          "headline": "The Trial of Christine Keeler review – a furiously fast, fun ride",
          "bodyText": "‘I had no idea what an extraordinary life I was leading,” says the voiceover as a young woman prepares to leave her flat in Notting Hill to go to an audition for a toothpaste ad. The year is 1962, the woman is Christine Keeler and she ain’t seen nothing yet. The Trial of Christine Keeler (BBC One) is the story of the Profumo affair told from a rare perspective: hers. The opening episode is a cracker and the rest – with so much ground still to cover, as by the end the seeds of the scandal have barely been scattered – promises to be likewise. It captures the tremendous sense of fun the 19-year-old model Keeler (Sophie Cookson) had, but it never turns her into a dolly bird or airhead, or paints the time and place as a hip and happening idyll. Racism, experienced directly by her black boyfriend Johnny (Nathan Stewart-Jarrett) who is habitually passed over for white applicants at job interviews, and indirectly by her as his companion in the street, is endemic. The capital is a bubble into which she has escaped from her deprived childhood and within which she thinks herself protected, despite its periodic punctures by her mother’s phone calls and constant requests for cash. The man who brings her into the bubble within the bubble, upper-class London, and introduces her to all the right people who are so very wrong for her, is society osteopath Stephen Ward (James Norton, perhaps too earthy a casting choice for the part, though his creepily patronising delivery of “little baby”, his nickname for Keeler, is worth the price of admission). He’s a man who knows people. And who likes to watch them, from a safe distance. He winds them up like clockwork toys, sets them off and waits for the collisions to entertain him. I would watch a drama from his perspective, too. Who doesn’t want to know what the voyeur thinks? Although I’m most interested of all in the psychology of a man who can live with the title “society osteopath” and make it work for him. We flash back at various points to Keeler’s first meeting with Profumo (customarily convincing stuff from Ben Miles, giving the secretary of state for war a steely charm that goes precisely so far and no further) and watch as she becomes increasingly tangled in a web whose reaches she can barely imagine. The question of whether history happens to her or she makes history lurks in the shadows of every scene. “Look what you made me do,” says her jealous ex-boyfriend, Lucky (Anthony Welsh), when he sees her in the street and, maddened by her continued existence without him, hits her. It is a sentiment, we understand, she has met before – from the men who groped her as they took her home as a teenager from babysitting their own children – and will again in the near future, as men with ever more to lose cast around for someone other than themselves to blame. By the end of the opening episode, Ward and his circle have come sufficiently to the attention of the secret services to make a crisis inevitable. In the closing scenes, Johnny – by now another maddened ex – shoots at Ward’s flat with Christine inside and the quality of attention on them all shifts. “I didn’t know it then,” comes the final voiceover. “But I still had a hell of a lot to learn.” If The Trial doesn’t quite reach the dizzying heights of last year’s A Very English Scandal, about the 70s equivalent of Keeler and its fallout, it remains a furiously fast, fun ride which doesn’t let the deeper, darker issues fall from its grasp. And it works, incidentally, as a great companion piece to the closing episode of The Crown’s second series, fleshing out the people with whom Matt Smith’s Prince Philip may or may not have partied the night (or many nights) away, watched by Ward. Like The Crown, it could also have a scroll atop every scene reading “O tempora! O mores!” In the decades since the Profumo affair we have moved from a time when a politician having sex with a woman tangentially associated with Russia caused the establishment to have a near nervous breakdown, to the leader of the free world snuggling up to Putin while soliciting favours from Ukraine with near impunity. To say nothing of our own government now being led by … well, insert your own term here. But I shall go out on a limb and say that “a man who evokes all of Supermac’s pragmatism, wit, unshakeable calm and firm grasp on how many children he had fathered” is probably not among them."

          "headline": "Felicity Cloake’s recipe for party blinis",
          "bodyText": "For me, blinis are the ultimate party food – though they’re standard breakfast fare in their native Russia, the very name conjures up visions of ice-cold martinis and slinky cocktail dresses (though, strictly speaking, these are actually oladushki). Whatever you’re planning to wear to eat them, however, know they are very much worth making yourself before you get changed – those ready-made rubber frisbees are no way to celebrate. Prep 20 min, plus cooling and proofing Cook 4 min a batch Makes About 35 150ml milk 70g buckwheat flour 70g strong white flour 1 tsp salt 2 tsp caraway seeds (optional) 2 eggs 4g dried yeast 100g soured cream 25g butter, for frying 1 Start making the batter Heat the milk in a small pan until it’s just below the boil. While it’s heating, in a large bowl whisk the two flours (buckwheat gives blinis their characteristic nutty flavour, while the white flour keeps them nice and light) with the salt and caraway seeds, if using. Separate the eggs, and put the yolks in a small bowl and the whites in a large one. 2 Leave the hot milk to cool As soon as the milk begins to bubble, turn off the heat and leave it to cool down to blood temperature. This scalding helps to denature the whey proteins in the milk, which will ultimately make your blini fluffier, but if the milk is still too hot when you add the yeast, it will die, and render your efforts pointless. 3 Add the yeast and egg yolks Stir the yeast into the warm milk, then whisk in the egg yolks and soured cream, mixing vigorously until they’re well combined. Pour the milk mixture into the flour bowl, stirring as you do so, until you have a fairly smooth paste. Be careful not to overwork it once it’s mixed, though, or your blinis will be tough. 4 Leave the batter to prove Cover the bowl with a clean tea towel and leave in a fairly warm, or at least not draughty, place for an hour or so, or until it looks spongy (it won’t rise dramatically, but the batter should have grown slightly in the bowl, and there ought to be a few bubbles visible on the top. 5 Add the egg whites and prove again Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gently fold them into the batter mixture using a large metal spoon or a rubber spatula, being mindful to keep as much air in the mix as possible. Once they’ve been well combined, cover the bowl again and leave for another two hours. 6 Cook the blinis Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once it’s hot, drop teaspoonfuls of batter in batches into the pan, and cook them until bubbles rise to the surface and golden brown underneath. Carefully flip over and cook for another minute or so, until golden brown on both sides. Repeat with the remaining batter. 7 Eat warm Blinis are best eaten warm from the pan, otherwise they can go rather stodgy, so either serve them in batches as you make them, or store them in a warm oven, wrapped in a tea towel to keep them soft, until you’ve used up all the batter. They can also be frozen once cooked: defrost and microwave briefly to reheat. 8 Serving suggestions The simplest way to serve blinis is topped with a dollop of soured cream and a few fish eggs or a curl of smoked fish or cooked meat, and perhaps a pinch of chopped chives or some freshly ground black pepper. Smoked mackerel, kipper or salmon paté, or chunks of pickled herring are even simpler options. 9 Vegetarian options Make a Finnish egg butter: boil two eggs for eight minutes, then peel and finely chop. Beat into 80g softened butter and season generously, then spread on blinis and top with capers or chopped cornichons. Or, for a more colourful choice, make a beetroot puree: whizz up four cooked beetroot with 100ml soured cream, add horseradish sauce or black pepper to taste, and finish with a little chopped dill."

          "headline": "Sportwatch: A-League top-of-table clash, W-League, Big Bash - as it happened",
          "bodyText": "That’s where we’ll leave Sportwatch on a night in which Sydney FC recorded a memorable and potentially decisive win in the A-League over their nearest and biggest rivals this season. Is that the premiership secured? A long way yet to run, and there’s the not insignificant matter of the Asian Champions League to distract the reigning champions over the months ahead. But when it mattered most - reduced to ten men inside half an hour - the competition’s form team showed themselves to be head and shoulders above their rivals. Former City man Luke Brattan pulled the strings for his new side, while Milos Ninkovic displayed another virtuoso cameo - winning a penalty, and attacking with twinkling toes, but also getting through a weight of work defensively. Former Victory striker Kosta Barbarouses haunting his erstwhile derby opponents with a goal late on to clinch it. Sydney FC nine points clear: who can run them down from here? Good wins for the Sydney FC women’s team and the Matildas-led Brisbane Roar in the W-League, while Adelaide remain winless. And that’s Sportwatch! Big Bash - End of Innings: Strikers 6/155 (20) They resort to seven different bowlers in the end, the Renegades, but you have to say, the Strikers have perhaps butchered that early platform, losing wickets steadily and failing to capitalise on Salt’s fifty. Rashid Khan cleared the rope twice late on in a 16-ball 25-run cameo, but this is definitely a getable score for the Renegades. Over to you, Aaron Finch. It’s an exuberant celebration from coach Steve Corica - has his side just secured the premiership?! It feels outrageous to even suggest such a thing, just 12 rounds into 29, but with City the nearest rivals, they’ve sent a huge message tonight, the Sky Blues. To do that with 10 men. Only Wellington Phoenix have prevented Sydney from eight-straight wins since that shock derby loss in round two. It’s a ninth consecutive home win for FC. Simply put - this team is head and shoulders above the rest. 90 + 3 min: City win themselves a corner, and the ‘keeper Glover ambles up to join the fray! Last roll of the dice for the visitors. He ends up with ball at feet in a wide position, and he tries to drop the shoulder on McGowan, but the experienced defender has none of it - and plays the ball off the ‘keeper to win the goalkick. Danger averted. And there’s the whistle! The pretenders have been vanquished - Sydney FC are the real deal, and they go nine points clear at the top of the A-League ladder! 90 + 1 min: Four minutes is the official added time, and Sydney run the first of those down as King wins a clever foul from former Sky Blue star Brillante. 89 min: A fine cameo from Luke Brattan in the Sydney midfield. For youngsters wanting to learn how to control the tempo of a game, get a copy of that tape. Calm on the ball, scanning for options, finding the right pass to release pressure, and turn defence into attack. He’s been excellent tonight the former City man. 87 min: Sydney FC contemplate a final change - it’s an A-League debut for Patrick Flottmann, replacing the sharp-shooter Adam Le Fondre. Defender for attacker, it’s officially shut-up-shop o’clock for the table-toppers. A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 2-1 Melbourne City (Barbarouses) 84 min: You wouldn’t say against the run of play, but they’ve conjured something from nothing, Sydney FC! Caceres plays a decent ball out to Barbarouses who turns his former Phoenix teammate Scott Galloway inside out, to stride inside and fire a low shot across Glover! It nestles bottom corner - a superb finish. And incredibly: the 10 men Sydney FC have come from behind to take the lead! 83 min: The home fans bay for blood as Griffiths catches Le Fondre. He’s already been booked the City skipper for the night, and it was on a break. There’s no card though, to the dismay of the faithful. 81 min: Luna goes in the book for a series of minor fouls, and City look to play their last card off the bench in the former of Lachlan Wales. Cabrera with a superb double effort - the first a stunning first-time volley, but it’s well blocked, and his follow-up effort rises just over the bar. It’s his last contribution, as Wales takes his spot. A-League - 77 min: Sydney FC make their second switch, as Ninkovic makes way for youngster Harry van der Saag. He receives a huge ovation from the home fans - it’s been another high-quality showing from the Serbian maestro in truth, whose earned penalty should have given Sydney the lead. Big Bash: Strikers 2/119 (15), Carey 36*, Wells 19* Down in Melbourne we are of course well into the Renegades v Strikers Big Bash clash. It’s a decent start from the Strikers with Philip Salt smashing an impressive 54 off just 26 runs. With wickets in hand this could be a decent total if they can explode over the final five overs - especially with the skipper Carey at the crease. Watch this space. 72 min: Cabrera does well to pinch it from King, but Maclaren can’t make the most of it centrally. Is he off tonight, the Socceroo? You hesitate to say so until the full 90 has gone, given his prodigious ability to make something from nothing. But in the battle of the sharp-shooters it’s definitely been Le Fondre who’s looked the more impressive tonight. 69 min: Sydney FC with a corner, but it’s a poor delivery from Caceres that enables the ‘keeper Glover to fire a fast release. He can’t quite find Maclaren though, and the move peters out. City go to the bench again, Noone jogs off for the promising Ramy Najjarine. Can he etch his name in lights? 65 min: Surprisingly, despite their ten men, Sydney FC are enjoying almost 50% possession. Mombaerts has perhaps told his side to be wary of the Sydney transition attack. They’re allowing the home side to dictate play a little though City, which with the man advantage they really shouldn’t be doing. 61 min: Le Fondre tries to skip round Delbridge after a clever ball from the youngster Joel King, but the big Australian defender shuts down the chance well. It’s nicely poised at this stage - City for their part starting to show a little bit more ambition, while Sydney look to hit in transition, as they have so brilliantly all season. 58 min: Cabrera picks out the new man Luna at the far post - he tries the spectacular overhead / horizontal minesweeper: but he can’t get it on target! What a goal that could have been - the two Uruguayans combine nicely. 55 min: A first change from Melbourne City as the goalscorer Metcalfe makes way for Adrian Luna. It’s a marginally more attacking change from Mombaerts - has he identified something in the Sydney FC midfield that the Uruguayan can exploit? 49 min: Now it’s City earning a corner, as Ninkovic is forced to do some defensive work. Sydney FC eventually clear their lines, but can’t spring the fast counter as Atkinson closes down Brattan. Noone fires in another dangerous effort from an acute angle. It’s another terrific run - he deserves a goal, but again, having done the hardest bit, the finish itself is underwhelming. Second half! 45 min: We’re back after the break. What words of wisdom have both coaches imparted? It’s the ten men of Sydney FC who dominate the opening moments of possession, and they earn a first corner of the half. I can also confirm a half-time change: Anthony Caceres comes on for Alexander Baumjohann. Presumably that’s a tactical switch, with the German not noted for his defensive workload. And for those of you who like those end of year awards malarkey, here’s a pretty good “alternative” awards selection from the Observer’s David Hills: Two Aussie treasures flying the flag, you’ll note: Bernard Tomic and Israel Folau pick up honorable mentions. Proud. So - your thoughts on that opening first 45? Plenty to digest and work through: fire us a tweet or email if you’d like to set a topic for discussion. Who’s looked the more likely? Who’s winning the little battles? And can Sydney FC finish over the top, with just 10 men? 45 + 4 min: It’s six minutes added on, given the lengthy head clash, VAR decisions and other miscellaneous delays. Maclaren seems caught in two minds when through on goal, while at the other end Kosta Barbarouses can’t quite find his partner-in-crime Le Fondre. It’s a pulsating first stanza: a red card, some niggle, two goals, a penalty missed. Are you not entertained? A-League - penalty saved! Sydney FC 1-1 Melbourne City 45 min: Blushes spared by Glover, given his role in the earlier Sydney FC goal, as Le Fondre looks to drive his penalty attempt hard and straight down the middle - but the former Tottenham junior just gets a leg to it and deflects clear! His teammates are delighted and rush to congratulate him. You have to say, I never thought Le Fondre would miss, the form that he’s in - but credit the ‘keeper. 44 min: It’s a mercurial run from the re-signed Serbian, Ninkovic - and he’s won Sydney FC a penalty! A slaloming run through the heart of the City defence, before he catches the leg of Delbridge. Could they go ahead, just before half-time?! 42 min: The loss of fullback Grant - remarkably his first red card in eleven seasons - has seen a tactical adjustment for the home side. The versatile Paulo Retre slots in at right back, and Luke Brattan drops to the solo anchor role, with Ninkovic and Baumjohhann coming a little more centrally. 38 min: And despite being reduced to 10 men, it’s the home crowd in fine voice after that Le Fondre goal. Plenty more to cheer, as Craig Noone bursts through with just Andrew Redmayne to beat - and he’s missed the target completely! It was a brilliant run, a give-and-go through the heart of the FC defence, including a nutmeg on Ryan McGowan, but City’s Englishman could only curl his effort harmlessly wide! What a massive let off. 33 min: Not only has that goal drawn Sydney FC level, but it’s also light a small fire in the dark beady eyes of Jamie Maclaren. The City striker in of course locked in his own personal battle with Sydney’s ALF for the golden boot race. He won’t have enjoyed seeing that one bobble the net. Maclaren: 10; Le Fondre: 12. A-League: Goal! Sydney FC 1-1 Melbourne City (Le Fondre) 28 min: Well, it’s all happening now! It’s the ten men in the Sky Blue (not City Blue TM) of Sydney who have a share of the lead. It’s a freekick and the ‘keeper Tom Glover doesn’t claim or clear cleanly - but it’s a terrific finish from the English sharp-shooter through a crowd of bodies. No danger of this one being a snore-fest. Game on! 24 min: Oh my, oh my. We could have some more VAR drama here. Rhyan Grant has gone in high on Nathaniel Atkinson - and despite an on-field yellow card being awarded, we go upstairs to deliberate if that’s a tackle worthy of a straight red card. And the machine men say: yes! It’s a red card for Rhyan Grant! It’s a calamitous few minutes for Sydney FC. A-League - Goal! Sydney FC 0-1 Melbourne City (Metcalfe) 21 min: It’s the short corner routine - and for seemingly the first time in the history of football - it’s delivered a goal! A fine ball in from Craig Noone and it’s the young midfielder from Newcastle who rises the highest. A terrific header, and it’s City who get the first break! 16 min: This is starting to bubble a little, as Rostyn Griffiths is penalised for a foul on Milos Ninkovic. He gets the ball, the City captain for the day, but he does appear to go over the top and catches the Sydney FC playmaker on the ankle. A slight delay before Griffiths is handed a yellow card. If that’s come from the VAR then we’ve got some bracket creep from the video officials - it’s either a yellow on the pitch, or by their own rules they’re not allowed to get involved. There’s the final whistle, and it is a much-needed, and you’d have to say, on weight of chances - a well-deserved - win for the home side. Just too much attacking talent, despite the heroics in goal from Coelho. Roar march up the ladder, while the Jets threaten to be cut adrift, alongside Adelaide and the Sam Kerr-less Perth. 11 min: An early sight at goal from Connor Metcalfe - and his curling effort is just deflected wide for a corner! A real scare just outside the Sydney FC penalty box as Craig Noone’s cutback broke kindly to the youngster and his first touch set himself up nicely, and his second was to thump it goalwards. Sydney defend back-to-back corners though, and eventually clear their lines. 8 min: A lively tempo to the start of this one - as you’d expect between the top two sides in the A-League. So much attacking talent in both squads, and with City playing a much more proactive style of football under Erick Mombaerts you just sense there could be some goals today. Plenty of tasty match ups across the pitch, as well. Luke Brattan in Sydney FC colours and Josh Brillante in City’s white? It’s still something the eyes need to adjust to. A-League: Kick off! 3 min: It’s an unfortunate beginning for two players as Rhyan Grant and Nathaniel Atkinson come together for a nasty clash of heads. Concern on both benches, but the players are up and on their feet - and the medical staff clear them for action. Let’s move to our feature match of the round from the A-League where it’s one v two - let’s get some team news for you ASAP. Sydney fC: Melbourne City: W-League - 77 min: A big cheer from the home fans as on comes the returning Elise Kellond-Knight, Matildas and Roar stalwart after several seasons away from Queensland. Pana Petratos also comes on for the Jets as both coaches look to effect a last tactical roll of the die. W-League - Goal! Brisbane 2-1 Newcastle (Palmer) 68 min: Well, there was a sense of it being just a matter of time for the Roar, and finally, they breach the brave defence of Coelho. It was driven goalwards by Raso, but saved - then rattled back off the crossbar from Yallop, to the squeals of home fans, before the Young Matilda Hollie Palmer was finally able to turn home! There’s the lead - and you can’t say it wasn’t coming. W-League - 65 min: And if you were in doubt about how this clash is unfolding, it’s Roar with 13 shots on target to Newcastle’s one. But what a one it was, given the scoreboard still reads 1-1. A nervy moment at the back for the Roar, that said, as Mackenzie Arnold miscontrols, and the ‘keeper almost invites trouble - very much against the run of play. And here’s the final day four report from the trans-Tasman Boxing Day Test. I for one would have loved to see a little more from the Black Caps. Fingers crossed for Sydney? W-League - 57 min: The Roar are starting to really besiege the Jets’ goal as the Matildas trio of Katrina Gorry, Yallop and Raso combine to threaten once again - but the final ball is missing on this occasion. There’s still plenty of experience in this Jets outfit, despite losing Emily van Egmond over the off-season, but they’ll need their older heads like Gema Simon and Jenna Kingsley to stand tall here, if they’re not to see one point evaporate into none. W-League - 50 min: We’re back underway in the second half of Brisbane v Newcastle where there’s considerable concern over the Jets’ goalkeeper Claire Coelho after a heavy collision with an on-rushing Tameka Yallop. It’s still 1-1, but it’s the home side making all the running since the break with Hayley Raso and Yallop both with opportunities. And if you’ve just joined us, the Boxing Day Test has just resolved - and alas it’s a pretty comprehensive loss for the visitors New Zealand. Jonathan Howcroft has the latest there: And the big news coming from the cricket today - veteran quick Peter Siddle has announced he’s hanging up his spurs. Competitive until the last - vale, you sweet workhorse. 221 international wickets is nothing to be sneezed at: And there’s the full-time whistle! Another “close but no cigar” mission for the Lady Reds. They rallied well late on, but a superb strike from Princess Ibini settled the nerves for home fans. Sydney FC bounce back from that heavy derby loss last weekend in the best possible way, while Adelaide slump to their sixth consecutive loss of the season. W-League: Brisbane Roar 1-1 Newcastle Jets - half-time And not quite in the shadow of half-time but there’s been a crucial equaliser up in Queensland as well, as Clare Polkinghorne has pinned back the Jets after Tara Andrews’ early goal. We head into the sheds all level therefore. W-League: Goal! Sydney FC 2-0 Adelaide United (Ibini) 90 + 1 min: Oh my. That’s some strike from Princess Ibini! Adelaide allowed the Matilda too much space outside the box and she let fly from long range. No chance for Sarah Willacy in the Reds goal - and their stout resistance has finally been put to bed. Evening all! I hope this finds you well, between the (presumed) decadence of Christmas and the (presumed) restraint of New Years resolutions. We’ve got two lots of live W-League that I want to get to straight away, where I can tell you we’ve just had a late goal. Let’s jump in. It’s a feast of football with a sprinkling of Big Bash cricket for pudding, this Sportwatch. In the W-League winless Adelaide chase their first points against Sydney FC, while Brisbane Roar host Newcastle knowing a win can see them apply pressure to Canberra after their heavy loss to the Wanderers. In the A-League it’s one v two: a mouthwatering match up of the competition’s top two marksman as Jamie Maclaren and Adam Le Fondre go toe-to-toe. And then it’s over to Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh to get the Renegades’ shock 0-3 season up and running as Adelaide Strikers come to town. Enjoy."

          "bodyText": "“Five or six years” is Michael O’Leary’s best guess on how long it will take for his current battalion of novice hurdlers and bumper horses to work their way through the National Hunt system, and he was insistent here on Saturday that even an afternoon such as this one will not change his mind. Delta Work charged hard and late to snatch the Savills Chase from Monalee in the final strides while Apple’s Jade returned to her brilliant best in the Frank Ward Memorial Hurdle, but the man whose Gigginstown Stud colours have landed dozens of the sport’s biggest prizes over the past 20 years is still determined to get out of the game. Indeed, O’Leary suspects he will not go racing once the last of his horses have headed into retirement. “If I didn’t have runners, I’d have no interest in coming here,” O’Leary said after Delta Work’s last-gasp success had prompted a second round of celebrations for his family party, including his four children. “I’d happily watch it on TV, jump racing is a wonderful spectacle and there’s wonderful people involved in it. But if you’re not involved, it can be a very boring day out. “I need action, I need caffeine and adrenaline and if you’re not involved with the horses I wouldn’t be that interested in travelling here. I have bumper horses now that will become maiden hurdlers and then novice chasers, so it’ll be four or five years before they can work their way through the system. But next year, I’ll have no bumper horses and not that many maiden hurdlers, so the numbers will work themselves out pretty quickly. “But the good thing is that [his trainers] Gordon [Elliott] and Henry [de Bromhead] have enough time now to replace our horses with other horses. It’s not a sudden decision and we’ll manage it over a period of time and hopefully with the minimum disruption.” Given the immense scale of his investment, the final five or six years of O’Leary’s ownership career should still mean him winning more Grade Ones than most owners could hope for in 500. While Apple’s Jade, who pummelled her rivals from the front on the way to the 11th Grade One of her career, is not a certain runner at Cheltenham in March, Delta Work is now a live contender to give Gigginstown a third win in the Gold Cup. Delta Work lost an unbeaten record over fences as a novice when he finished third in the RSA Chase back in March, after making a couple of mistakes that may have cost him more than his two-and-a-quarter length margin of defeat. His jumping was sketchy at Down Royal last month too, but he was a lot more fluent here and found an impressive turn of foot to close down Monalee just when it seemed that Rachael Blackmore’s frontrunning ride had secured her a third Grade One win in third days. Instead, it was Jack Kennedy who took the applause, from Elliott as well as a big holiday crowd. “Jack is riding out of his skin,” Elliott said. “He had a few hard injuries and it’s good to see him back riding like this. I knew there was a good bit of improvement in him. When he jumped the last and Jack pulled him out, he got over closer to the other horses [and] really put his head out. We thought he was a Gold Cup horse and obviously our bubble burst at Down Royal, but we’re not gone yet.” Delta Work was cut to a top price of 10-1 for the Gold Cup after the win, while last year’s Savills Chase winner, Kemboy, is unchanged at 6-1 after finishing fourth on his return to action after 241 days on the sidelines, within four lengths of the winner. Presenting Percy, who finished one place behind Kemboy, is now out to 14-1 for the Gold Cup having started favourite for the race last season. Richard Johnson reached 100 winners for the season with a treble at Newbury, the highlight of which was Thyme Hill’s hard-fought defeat of The Cashel Man in the Grade One Challow Hurdle. The winner is now top-priced at 7-1 for the Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham."

Never fear: there’s hardly any cooking involved in this banoffee trifle, and it’s all about the celebration – just stick a few sparklers in it and get back to the party. Have an easy, happy new year. Prep 20 min Cook 20 min Serves 12 For the toffee sauce 150ml double cream 40g unsalted butter 50g light muscovado sugar ¼ tsp fine sea salt For the brittle 230g caster sugar 20g unsalted butter 150g mixed nuts, roughly chopped For the trifle 600g extra-thick double cream 100ml Baileys 400g chocolate digestives, broken 5 large bananas, peeled and sliced 2 x 500g ready-made vanilla custard To finish 75g dark chocolate, grated Melt the cream, butter and sugar in a medium-sized saucepan, then leave it to bubble and turn a toffee sauce-like colour. Add the salt to taste, and set aside. Put four tablespoons of water into a saucepan and slowly add the caster sugar, stirring with a whisk or spatula, until combined. Cook over a medium heat until the sugar turns a deep amber colour. Remove the pan from the heat and quickly stir in the butter. Tip in the nuts and stir until they’re well-coated in the sugar. Carefully pour the sugary nuts on to a silicone mat or a tray lined with baking paper and leave to cool. Once cool, smash into shards. Mix the cream with three tablespoons of Baileys and set aside. Divide the broken biscuits over the bottom of a large dish. Drizzle more Baileys over the biscuits, top with the sliced banana, custard and Baileys-infused cream. Squiggle over some caramel sauce and finish with grated chocolate. Pop in the fridge until needed. When ready to serve, top with shards of brittle (and some sparklers)."

          "headline": "How Japan has fared in 30 years since the stock market bubble burst",
          "bodyText": "On 29 December 1989, Japan’s Nikkei stock market index hit a high of 38,916, a milestone that proved to be the last hurrah of the country’s asset-inflated bubble economy – a period of ostentatious consumption and overconfidence in the infallibility of Japan, Inc. What followed was a spectacular fall from the heights of the mid- to late 1980s. The stock market plummeted, losing more than $2tn (£1.5tn) in value by December 1990. In the years that followed, the Japanese surveyed an alien landscape of “restructuring” – code for cost-cutting – deflation and stagnation. When the bubble party ended, its hosts appeared to have no idea how to clean up the mess left by absurdly high share and property prices. Occasional outbreaks of nostalgia for the excesses of the boom years, when the ground beneath the imperial palace was said to be worth more than the entire state of California, have become a coping mechanism for a country now facing a new set of economic problems. “Japan’s 1980s bubble was the bursting start of a long adaption from a young, fast-growing economy to an ageing, slow-growth new normal,” says Martin Schulz, senior economist at the Fujitsu Research Institute. “It took until 2002 to bail out the banks from the real estate adjustment. It took another 10 years to put the necessary supply-side and social security reforms in place. The benign impact of the global financial crisis has shown that Japan’s economy has fully adjusted to its ‘new normal’ of slow but solid long-term growth.” Schulz adds that the economic policies of the current prime minister, Shinzo Abe, have done some good for a nation that remains a global powerhouse as the world’s third-largest economy. “Abenomics is working to get innovation going again and to improve future expectations. Japan is now much better integrated in Asia with its long-term growth prospects. Its service economy is flourishing again and embraces digitalisation, people find jobs well into retirement, and the young generation is optimistic. What’s missing are better work-life balances to enable families to have children again, and a more proactive stance to deal with the long-term debt overhang.” The end of the bubble era coincided with the enthronement of a new emperor. While Akihito sought to bring the imperial family closer to ordinary people, much of his three decades on the Chrysanthemum throne, which ended with his abdication this April, was marked by policy drift and a creeping fear that Japan’s post-bubble woes were merely the precursor to long-term decline. Enter Abe, hawkish on defence and conservative on social issues, but wedded to Keynesian notions of the state as a benign spending force for economic good. “Japan is back,” he declared when he became prime minister for the second time in late 2012. It wasn’t long before optimism over Abenomics, at home and abroad, began to chip away at the “lost decades” narrative that followed the bubble era. The first two of Abe’s “three arrows” – fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending, and loose monetary policy from the Bank of Japan, in the form of 0% interest rates and buying bonds off financial inistitutions in a process known as quantitative easing – had the desired effect. The Nikkei began to rise – though, at about 24,000 points, it is currently far from the levels of 30 years ago – and export-dependent manufacturers cheered a weaker yen. But after seven years of Abe, who recently became Japan’s longest-serving prime minister, a more mixed picture is emerging. There are more jobs than people to fill them and record numbers of tourists, mainly from other parts of Asia, are bringing a glimmer of hope to depopulated regions. But there have been policy failures that highlight the perils of vowing to nudge Japan out of its deflationary, low-growth orbit. Abe’s attempt to achieve 2% inflation came up short – the CPI rate is running at 0.5% – and questions persist over corporate governance in the wake of the allegations against the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn. Growth in the Japanese economy was 0.4% in the third quarter of this year. But there are fears that soft global demand and the US-China trade war will hit exports. There is concern, too, that a recent rise in the consumption (sales) tax, from 8% to 10%, to address Japan’s public debt burden – the highest in the industrial world and more than twice the size of its $5tn economy – will weaken private consumption. Abe’s first two arrows are still in flight, with the government announcing a record budget this month that its architect hopes will buy his economic project time and win him support after a series of damaging political scandals. It includes 13.2tn yen ($121bn) in public spending on disaster reconstruction, infrastructure and scientific research designed to shield the economy from a possible slowdown caused by a US-Japan trade war and a post-2020 Olympic hangover. But critics say the third and most critical part of his programme, structural reform, looks more like a badly thrown dart than an arrow, despite grim warnings about the failure to address the effects on long-term growth of a super-ageing, declining population. Abe has encouraged more women to enter the workforce and relaxed immigration laws to allow a modest number of blue-collar workers to fill gaps in pressurised sectors of the economy. But much needed reform of the labour market, corporate governance and healthcare have been slow to materialise. “Monetary easing and fiscal stimulus were supposed to make room for structural reform,” says Koichi Nakano, a politics professor at Sophia University in Tokyo. “But structural reform hasn’t happened. This means the Japanese economy continues to depend on government steroids. God knows what will happen after the Olympics. “Abe’s economic policy gave him enough political capital to push through much of his rightwing agenda – like the state secrets law and security legislation – but the government can’t continue to pump money into the economy, and the Bank of Japan can’t continue to subsidise Japan, Inc. It is telling that he never achieved his inflation target. The fundamental weaknesses of the Japanese economy have never been properly addressed.”"

          "bodyText": "When a politician can lambast your entire industry for its shockingly poor behaviour and earn applause rather than laughter, you’ve got a problem. But that was the situation National Australia Bank’s new chairman, Phil Chronican, found himself in at his company’s annual shareholder meeting on 18 December as the Australian banking industry’s year from hell tottered towards its end. “You are the unacceptable face of capitalism because you have failed to obey the law,” former Labor senator Chris Schacht told Chronican and the NAB board. “You are the face of unconscionable greed.” For the banking industry, it has been a bad end to a year that started with some promise. In February, the sector seized on the release of the final report of the banking royal commission as an opportunity to draw a line under years of scandals – including charging dead people fees, signing up vulnerable people to useless insurance and systematically undermining the retirement nest eggs of workers through high charges and poor investment returns. While commissioner Kenneth Hayne was damning of banking’s culture of greed, the report did not contain harsher measures some in the industry feared, and company share prices jumped in relief. But in the past few months plans by some in the industry for a quick return to business as usual, which included lobbying against responsible lending rules set down by the corporate regulator, have fallen to pieces. Westpac, which had been leading the push, looked to be gaining ground after a court victory in August against the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, over responsible lending standards. Asic has appealed against the ruling, and in late December signalled it would not be backing down on responsible lending standards by launching legal action against Volkswagen’s finance arm over almost 50,000 car loans it says weren’t properly assessed. But any hope the back to business project might succeed was smashed to smithereens in November when Austrac, the agency responsible for monitoring the flow of money through the economy, hit Westpac with a mammoth lawsuit alleging millions of breaches of anti-money laundering laws, including failing to detect or stop several thousand transactions consistent with child exploitation in the Philippines. Money for paedophiles. A new low for an industry already neck deep in muck. Unsurprisingly, Westpac’s chairman, Lindsay Maxsted, and chief executive Brian Hartzer handed in their resignations. In the week before Christmas, the corporate cop shovelled more of the smelly stuff into the faces of executives at NAB in a federal court lawsuit alleging it broke the law more than 10,000 times by charging customers fees for services they never received and failing to keep proper records of financial advice. NAB is also facing the prospect of action against it by Austrac, which in the past few years has emerged as the banking sector’s most feared regulator due to the seriousness of the laws it administers and the huge fines it can levy, which can climb well into the billions of dollars. All this was no doubt weighing on the minds of Chronican and NAB’s chief executive, Ross McEwan, during the recent AGM. Reflecting the turmoil in the sector this year, neither has been in the job for long. Chronican has been acting as CEO since February, when chairman Ken Henry and chief executive Andrew Thorburn resigned after being beaten up by Hayne in his report. McEwan became CEO just three weeks ago but his scant time in the top job wasn’t enough to save him from Schacht. It was a repeat performance for Schacht – six days earlier, he had delivered an even angrier speech to Westpac’s top brass at its annual meeting at the same venue, Sydney’s International Convention Centre. Schacht said he had been a NAB shareholder since 2003 and attended most of the bank’s AGMs since then. But he hadn’t detected an improvement in the bank’s management. “Every time there was a scandal, the same words that you said today and the same words of Mr McEwan – we’ll be better,” he said. “We will get on top of it. “But next year another bloody scandal turned up, something else went wrong. It has not changed, and that is the worrying thing about the bank.” Standards in banking were even lower than in politics, he said. “I gotta tell you, if I had done 1% of what this board had allowed to happen, I would have been thrown out of Parliament House, drowned in Lake Burley Griffin and everyone would have cheered.” Schacht is right that Australia’s banks are no strangers to scandal. It’s arguable a cowboy culture in the industry stretches as far back as the Victorian land boom of the 1880s and 1890s, when soaring property prices and easy credit provided by a string of fledgling banks and building societies helped create a speculative financial bubble – the pricking of which saw fortunes destroyed and corrupt premier James Munro bankrupted and beaten in the street. Westpac, then known as the Bank of New South Wales, did not escape unscathed – it lost out after lending money to some of the speculators. The big banks – ANZ, Commonwealth, NAB and Westpac – may be nicknamed the “four pillars” of the Australian economy, but they have also behaved in a less than solid fashion. Over the decades, they have more or less taken it in turns to be the bad bank. In 1992, Westpac, Australia’s oldest bank, turned in the country’s biggest corporate loss at the time, of $1.56bn, after writing off $2.6bn in disastrous loans on commercial property. The AGM went for two days and the managing director, Frank Conroy, resigned. NAB hit trouble in the “rogue trader” affair of the early 2000s in which four foreign exchange traders trousered hefty bonuses by hiding hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses. The scandal eventually cost the head of chief executive Frank Cicutto. Australia’s banks survived the global financial crisis in good financial shape, thanks in part to the Rudd government guaranteeing their debts, but nonetheless ANZ managed to get itself into trouble by backing stockbroker Opes Prime. Opes Prime collapsed in 2008 owing $1bn, including $650m to ANZ, after efforts by executives to cover up a $300m hole in its accounts failed. The affair was a wild ride involving fast cars, members of Melbourne’s underworld and colourful Sydney lawyer Chris Murphy, whose account was at the centre of the collapse. ANZ also loaned about $1bn to Indian business couple Pankaj and Radhika Oswal to build a fertiliser plant on the Burrup Peninsula. The loan went bad amid allegations of fraud and the bank had to pay the couple more than $200m to settle a highly embarrassing lawsuit. But more recently the banks have stopped taking it in turns to misbehave, with scandals coming so thick and fast it’s almost impossible to keep up. They have all been tarred by the financial planning debacle that was one of the main drivers behind the royal commission last year, although initially misconduct at CBA was most prominent. CBA also led the way at getting in trouble with Austrac, paying $700m in June last year to settle a case in which the regulator accused it of more than 53,000 breaches of the law. All big four banks tried to rig a key interest rate benchmark, the BBSW, to their benefit and against the interests of their customers – although Westpac copped the brunt of bad publicity because it made the quixotic decision to fight a lawsuit brought by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission rather than settle, as the others did. And there is more to come. Company accounts are normally pretty dry reading but buried deep in NAB’s annual report is a list of looming problems that provides a good summary of what’s ahead for the entire sector in the coming 12 months. Note 29, “contingent liabilities”, lays out the problems that NAB knows it has but on which it has so far been unable to put a price tag. These include a class action in the US over the BBSW, lawsuits in the UK over business loans its former subsidiary Clydesdale Bank wrote there and, of course, an Austrac investigation. In addition to Asic’s fee-for-no-service lawsuit it is sweating on the outcome of another industry-wide investigation by the corporate regulator into junk credit card insurance, an issue over which it faces another class action. It is also waiting on the outcome of Asic lawsuits over service fees wrongly charged by its superannuation trustee company, Nulis, and an introducer scheme that saw gym owners and hairdressers get kickbacks for bringing homeloan customers to the bank. On top of that, it is also being audited by the Taxation Office over its claims for deductions due to research and development spending. The other banks also face more pain at the hands of an Asic whose spine has been stiffened by the royal commission. Costs across the industry of compensating customers it has ripped off and fixing up long-neglected systems designed to make sure it doesn’t happen again are projected at $10bn. And they could well go higher. On Thursday, federal court judge Michael Wigney hit Westpac with a fine of $9.15m over the behaviour of just one financial adviser who earned fat commissions by tipping his clients into inappropriate superannuation and insurance products created by the bank. But those kinds of stings are dwarfed by a monster fine, likely to be in excess of a billion dollars, that Westpac is expected to pay to settle the Austrac case. The bank seems to have lost some of the anti-regulator attitude that saw it fight lawsuits tooth and nail and prompted Hartzer to complain at a meeting last year with the prudential regulator that it was “unfair” that all the banks had to do a comprehensive review of their cultural failings because “nothing has gone wrong to CBA’s scale”. Well, it has now."

          "headline": "I was abused as a child. Should I tell my mother?",
          "bodyText": "My childhood was lonely and frightening. A female friend lived with my father, mother, brother and I when we were children. She had an affair with my father and was a bully towards me and my brother when nobody else was around. The affair was not hidden from me and left me very stressed, and feeling guilty at five years old. Around this time she suffocated me with a pillow and later stuffed me in a pillowcase. She also tried to drown me in the bath. I can still remember pretending to be dead to stop the suffocation. For nearly two years I lived in fear and guilt. Later, the affair came out. Dad left and died soon after. My father was loving and caring but, sadly, not the best husband. He was a flawed man, but not a bad one. My mother is a good mum, but hard to talk to about the past. She’s never discussed her own past much, and I’ve learned more about it from other family members. I was later also sexually abused by a babysitter. This I don’t remember as much; I think my brain does not want me to know. I have blanks in my past that I just can’t remember, which is more frightening than a comfort. I told my brother, which was hard (we aren’t close) and he wants me to tell my mum. I’m in my 30s now, so how do I tell her I kept my abuse from her? Is it the right thing to do? I don’t want to take my abusers to court. I doubt I would get justice. The reason I asked my brother was that I wanted to know if anything had happened to him. The question plagued me for so long. He wasn’t abused, thank God. What do I do? I feel lost. Do I tell my mum what happened? It won’t change the abuse. You have been horribly abused by the woman who tried to kill you, and your babysitter. And despite all that has happened to you, here you are caring about your brother, worrying about how you kept the abuse from your mum. Nothing that happened was your fault. You were failed and harmed by all the adults around you. I’m so sorry. I wondered why you told and asked your brother now, and what else is happening in your life at the moment? Often survivors of emotional, physical and sexual abuse reach a safe place and can look back at what happened – maybe this resonates for you? Or maybe you are at the stage of life where you might be thinking of having children of your own? I talked to Joanne Stubley, a consultant psychiatrist and a specialist in trauma. She was impressed with your ability to recognise the failings in your parents and not just “see things in black and white, which is what often happens with trauma”. She said: “The big question is whether you should tell your mum or not: but that didn’t seem to be coming from you, but rather from your brother.” She felt that, before you do anything, you might want to work on “putting all of this together”. While you remember the assaults by the family friend clearly, Stubley thought you described the process of dissociation in relation to the babysitter very accurately when you explained that maybe your brain didn’t want you to remember. We both agreed that you need to put yourself at the centre of anything you do next. I can understand you wanting to talk to your mother, but I am not sure if she is the best person for you to speak to right now. Stubley wanted you to be very sure – or as sure as you can be – of what you do from now on, so you are not motivated by revenge or anger, or even wanting to save anyone else. This is important because you need to be careful not to repeat what happened to you before: people not noticing, not listening, not protecting you. If that were to happen again, then it may take you right back to what happened when you were a child. In terms of remembering the blanks, it’s imperative you do this in a place where you are psychologically “held” (safe), because remembering “requires you to feel the pain of what happened and grieve for what you lost”, says Stubley. If you are able to do some work to address the fallout it may help you feel that you have more choices about what kind of life you now want, and that you’re not stuck in this awful trauma.

          "bodyText": "After the disaster of the general election, Labour figures of a certain age started pointedly sharing on social media a video of a conference speech. It is of course Neil Kinnock, in 1985, attacking the “rigid dogma” leading to the “grotesque chaos” of Liverpool’s Labour council, then under the heavy influence of the Trotskyist Militant tendency. The implication didn’t even need to be stated: this is what needs to happen now. A centrist leader such as Kinnock is going to purge you Trots, tack back to the centre and then win an election … in 12 years. It’s history repeating itself, they say. An ineffectual pacifist who didn’t genuflect enough to patriotism – Michael Foot then, Jeremy Corbyn now – led the party to oblivion, and allowed in a horde of far-left “entryists”, who brought the party into disrepute. But who are the entryists today, and who should be purged? The first to name names is a Corbyn-sympathetic figure, Paul Mason, who has already argued that Corbyn staffers Andrew Murray and Seumas Milne are “Stalinists” who must be forced out. “Stalinists” is generally shorthand for ageing trade unionists unable to get with the times with the same ease as ex-Trotskyists such as Mason. But isn’t Momentum just like Militant, you may ask? The latter was a tightly organised Leninist party: a small sect based mainly in Merseyside that collectively joined Labour almost unnoticed in the early 60s; it took 20 years for it to control the party’s youth wing, take over several constituency Labour parties and elect three MPs. Following Kinnock’s mass expulsions, Militant had a major role in the campaign against the poll tax, but after its abolition disappeared back into the margins. It’s hard to imagine a more different beast to Momentum – a massive, unwieldy coalition. Its activists tend to be long-term party members – often, like its chair, Jon Lansman, with backgrounds in the post-1968 new left. The new left in Labour – which produced figures as disparate as Ken Livingstone and Margaret Hodge – were much more committed to anti-racist and feminist politics than Militant’s shop-floor Leninism, and saw no need for centralist structures. This meant they never broke the party rulebook in the same way. This can be seen now in the way that Momentum is a strange amalgam of a PR agency, a decentralised activist network and a media organisation, without a deep connection between each part. Momentum has faced its own entryism spats, but they are of a very different cast to those of the 1980s. It’s an open secret that the pro-People’s Vote wing of the Labour left is dominated by members or ex-members of Trotskyist groups such as Mason’s old outfit, Workers’ Power. Lansman at one point had to change Momentum’s entire membership structure to prevent these groups from leading the organisation. But in this case “the Trots” are actually allies of Labour’s centre, and are deeply associated with its questionable second referendum policy. In fact, it makes more sense to compare Corbyn to Kinnock rather than to Foot. Both took over after the dominant wing of Labour had lost a second consecutive general election – 1979 then 1983, 2010 then 2015. Both were subject to horrendous press hate campaigns. Both led – more enthusiastically in Kinnock’s case – campaigns against Labour local authorities, for illegal spending to build council houses in Liverpool, and for planning to sell off council houses in a property boondoggle in Haringey. Both of them aimed to adapt to “new times”, acknowledging, respectively, that in the 1980s Thatcherism had dismantled the old Labour class coalition, making the young, working population likely to vote Tory; and that the 2008-09 financial crisis had made Blairism’s giddy bubble economics extremely implausible. Both conclusions were bitterly resisted by the old guard, but their attempts to seize the leadership – Tony Benn in 1988, Owen Smith in 2016 – were swatted away with ease, as they had no new ideas, and could easily be told “we know where that leads – defeat”, whether the “longest suicide note in history” or the “Ed Stone”. Most of all, it seems Kinnock and Corbyn share the fact that each losing two consecutive elections themselves didn’t lead to their total discrediting within the party. This has led to surprise outside Labour, but it’s logical – both Kinnock and Corbyn, though both avoiding any major rulebook changes (unlike, say, Blair) were overwhelmingly popular with most members, even after their defeats (though Corbyn never had it from the parliamentary party). As the positioning of MPs such as Keir Starmer and Clive Lewis has already made clear, most candidates in the upcoming leadership election will stand as post-Corbyn, not anti-Corbyn – just as all serious contenders after Kinnock were his conscious heirs. None of this means that some Tony Blair of the left is around the corner to lead Labour to glorious victory. Though Kinnock was radical compared with Blair or Gordon Brown, and faced the vitriolic wrath of Rupert Murdoch because of it, Corbyn’s politics, both imputed and real, were considered a genuine threat to the British state, and his successors will be under enormous pressure to buckle accordingly. Even though, by 1997, a general election victory seemed an open goal for Labour, just to make sure of it the new leader ingratiated himself with the media that had destroyed his predecessor. It is unlikely that any of the current leadership candidates will be able to be quite so ingratiating; but what could yet be the same is the crushing of lives and hopes that led to that 1997 Labour government, when it finally arrived, standing on a platform that continued most of the Conservatives’ policies. • Owen Hatherley is an author and the culture editor of Tribune"

          "bodyText": "In 2019, I spent a lot of time waiting for a buzzer, in vast, open spaces and sometimes next to carefully commissioned graffiti, where a bowl of curried cabbage or an egg sarnie plus a bottle of pop costs £12 – sorry, that’s a yoga fire vegan curry or an egg sando. The names are alluring, the prices hysterical: welcome to the world of the food hall. An industry bigwig recently told me that the demise of actual restaurants will not be down to Brexit, but to the Generation Z attitude that pledging loyalty to a particular place that serves a three-course, sit-down menu is a quaint, vintage notion. Newness is all. Creating fresh memories, and social media content, around eating is now crucial to our self-worth, apparently. “Why would you open a restaurant if you could open a bubble waffle stand that dished out amazing-looking cheap carbs at nine quid a throw? And when your clientele have all taken a photo of that, you can just start making something else.” “Because, because … people like proper chairs, cutlery, their regular dinner,” I spluttered, wriggling furiously in the grip of reason. “And they still want somewhere to go on dates or to take small kids?” “Grace,” she replied, “they are not dating in restaurants. And they are not having babies.” And with that I was silenced. Welcome to the era of the “incubation-focused mezzanine kitchen space”, enjoy the communal tables, bus your own food and then eat it sitting a metre away from the owner while he’s conducting HR appraisals. But if this is the final hurrah for traditional hospitality, then it’s going out on a terrific high. Over the past 12 months, I ate gnocchi at Bottega Caruso in Margate, a love-filled, family-run joint that made me giddy. A day trip to Folkestone was made wondrous by the 26-seat nirvana that is The Folkestone Wine Company, with its seafood, raspberry french toast and Appassimento Salento by the glass. I loved The Yan in Grasmere, where a trek through the mountains brings you to a delicious pit-stop that does Cumberland sausage sharing platters. In London, I spent numerous Sundays with the long-suffering Charles slurping belt noodles and nibbling wood ear fungus at Xi’an Biang Biang in Spitalfields. I still rate Wagamama, Itsu, Leon and Busaba highly. Don’t ask me to feign shock about the end of Jamie’s Italian, Prezzo or Levi Roots’ Caribbean Smokehouse. Britain in 2019 has some great casual dining: Nando’s is still a crowdpleaser, and the food at Brewdog is surprisingly good. Casual dining crunch be damned: the Big Mamma group, which has dazzled London with Gloria and Circolo Popolare, proved that an 11 quid margarita pizza and a silly cocktail served with panache in a meticulously styled palace of bric-a-brac will draw queues down the street nightly. That said, if casual isn’t your thing, 2019 also brought a plethora of places in which to burn money: Lucky Cat by Gordon Ramsay, The Betterment by Jason Atherton and Siren by Nathan Outlaw are all living proof that investors know there are still big bucks to be made at lunchtime. At Peter Sanchez-Iglesias’s Decimo, the small version of the tortilla with caviar costs £45, and at Arros QD, Quique Dacosta’s lobster paella is £85 for two. I filed 52 columns this year, and ate out at least 150 times; the ticker-tape parade of restaurant receipts that I loosely term an office tells a story of how easy it is in Great Britain to spend £225 on dinner for two and still walk away with a virtually empty belly. Oh, your ears will be full to the brim of each dish’s description and of tales of the chef’s commitment to banning clingfilm or importing veg – and did you know he is currently making his own plates out of reclaimed tampon inner tubes? Or that this is a woman-only kitchen crew, and the pastry chef made the croquembouche while literally pumping her own breasts? This was a year when it was vital that the cognoscenti thought very deeply about our dinners. And I do – but sometimes I just can’t be bothered, which is why my favourite meal of 2019 was at Darby’s, a Robin Gill restaurant tucked behind the brand new US embassy in Vauxhall. They’re fancy and Irish; they do Guinness, chablis, oysters, lobster brioche rolls and seriously buttery mash. They serve brown butter waffles with smoked salmon and cultured cream, and truffled baron bigod cheese with fig and walnut sourdough. I certainly didn’t have any big, deep thoughts about anything when I waddled out of Darby’s. Pass the Gaviscon, here’s to 2020."

          "bodyText": "I once had a friend – and I use the past tense conspicuously – who, when I suggested a walk and a pub Sunday roast, told me she didn’t like Sunday roasts. Did not like Sunday roasts. I don’t know the specific medical terminology for this pathology, but I hope she is getting the help she needs. I imagine so, because the waiting list must be very short. I’m never happier than when diving into a moat of gravy. If it were possible, I would shrink myself and jump merrily into the middle of a giant, squishy yorkshire pudding, like a kid on a bouncy castle. Originally the roast was an after-church meal (hence the Sunday). I think often about how frustrating it is that they are limited to just one day of the week, and where this ranks on the world scale of injustice (high). Brits are such big fans of the roast that, in one survey about what we are most proud of, it came in at No 16. Yorkshire puds alone came it at No 9. To put this into context, that’s ahead of Stonehenge, the Royal family, and Shakespeare. As a vegetarian, I am sometimes accused of not taking full advantage of all the roast has to offer, whether that’s beef, lamb, pork, chicken, turkey or other meats. But this ignores the fact that the increasing quality of available nut roasts and butternut squash wellingtons tempts even carnivores. It is not uncommon for me to find, these days, that the veggie roasts have run out. (I am sure you can imagine my reaction.) There are also cook books and columns full of home options: Nigella’s roast stuffed pumpkin; or our own Nigel Slater’s parsnip loaf. Of course, as with the best meals, the joy of a Sunday roast isn’t merely about what is on one’s plate. It is the act of gathering, and the company one shares. Whether it is a friend hosting and pulling a disparate collection of chairs together to accommodate pals around a too-small table, or meeting up one-on-one with an old mate one hasn’t seen for ages, tucking into potatoes and life events. For me, the best roasts are enjoyed after an appetite has been built up on a muddy stroll. The afternoon is spent reading at home, top trouser button undone. Utterly sated. Or perhaps not quite sated, given how handy the surplus can be to fold into bubble and squeak, or sandwiches. Truly, the gift that keeps on giving. And a deserving matter of national pride."

          "bodyText": "GlaxoSmithKline is ramping up its use of artificial intelligence and recruiting 80 AI specialists by the end of 2020 as it turns to cutting-edge computing to develop medicines of the future. However, the UK’s largest drugmaker by revenue is struggling to hire enough AI researchers and engineers from areas such as Silicon Valley and is looking to former employees in academia, the US Navy and the music industry to fill positions in the new team. They will be spread across London, Heidelberg, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Boston. The AI unit will be headquartered in San Francisco, with one GSK executive admitting competition for AI professionals is fierce. “In AI, we are scouring the planet for the best people. These folks are very rare to find. Competition is high and there aren’t a large number of them,” said Tony Wood, GSK’s senior vice-president of medicinal science and technology. Among those to be hired will be researchers qualified at PhD or master’s level who will be working on AI drug development projects in London under a new fellows programme. AI will be used to help find treatments for conditions such as cancer and autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. AI refers to the use of trained algorithms to carry out tasks, which computers have learned to do through repetitive processes rather than instruction from humans. In recent years, the increasing use of AI in the pharmaceutical industry has begun to transform the way in which scientists develop new drugs. Drug development traditionally takes years, but AI can speed the process up and increase the success rate of new medicines from 10% currently. GSK believes choosing targets – proteins or other molecules – based on genetic evidence means they are twice as likely to succeed. This has led the company to invest heavily in human genome research, which involves analysing the workings and interactions of genes, and cell and gene therapy, which aims to fix genetic defects and re-engineer patients’ cells to fight disease. Wood said: “Functional genomics looks at hundreds of millions of data points from genetic databases, which was until recently out of reach of data science.” But the data can now be analysed thanks to increased computer power and the use of deep learning, a type of machine learning in AI that enables better analysis through integration of different types of data, such as cell imaging and genomic data. The main base of GSK’s AI team will be next to a new laboratory focused on functional genomics in San Francisco that the drugmaker is building in partnership with the University of California. The AI drive is part of a shake-up of GSK initiated by the chief executive, Emma Walmsley, who took over from Sir Andrew Witty nearly three years ago. GSK developed one of the first gene therapies, Strimvelis, for a rare immune deficiency known as “bubble baby” syndrome. GSK has since sold Strimvelis as part of its rare disease portfolio and is focusing on cancer treatments, with 16 in development. The most advanced is NY-ESO-1, a T-cell therapy, for solid tumours. Larger clinical trials will start in 2020 at a hospital near London for patients with synovial sarcoma, a rare type of cancer that affects soft tissues. Other studies are evaluating its use in lung and other cancers. In T-cell therapy, white blood cells called T-cells are taken from a patient. They are reprogrammed so they attach on to cancer cells and attack them when they are reinjected into the patient. So far, two cell therapies have been approved for blood-borne cancers worldwide – Kymriah for leukaemia by Switzerland’s Novartis, and Yescarta for lymphoma by Gilead of the US – but there are none for common solid tumours."

          "headline": "Motsi Mabuse: ‘People didn't expect black people in ballgowns’",
          "bodyText": "Motsi Mabuse is remembering the rough dance halls of apartheid-era South Africa and the shocking sights she would see as she took her first tentative steps across their floors. “When we had competitions,” she says, “we didn’t have security and people would be drunk and starting fights. We were just kids and we’d watch people with knives running through while we were in the middle of a routine. Compared to that, Strictly isn’t so difficult.” Mabuse, the newest judge on Strictly Come Dancing, first fell for the glitterball world at the age of nine after watching couples waltz, swing and cha-cha-cha while on holiday in Durban. “What I love about my parents is that they didn’t say: ‘Oh, you can’t do that.’ They found a way. But we had a lot of backlash, being the only black kids. People would laugh at us and call us names. We were bullied, but we just kept on coming back – and then we beat them.” It is a memory that suggests Mabuse was destined to find her way to Strictly: even before the BBC’s sequinned spectacular started owning Saturday night, she was living its spirit – if not going beyond it, breaking through the barriers of apartheid, one dance at a time. “People didn’t expect black people to be in ballgowns,” she adds. “We were living in segregation – we had to get separate buses to school. The doors were never open. We had to fight our way in.” All of which gave her the thick skin you need in order to survive in the cut-throat world of competitive dance. There is certainly no shortage of big personalities on the Strictly judging panel: it’s tough to make your mark when you are up against Craig Revel Horwood’s panto villainy, Bruno Tonioli’s ants-in-his-pants camp and Shirley Ballas’s technical fastidiousness. But 38-year-old Mabuse has swiftly become known for her emotional outpourings – weeping after the Paralympian Will Bayley’s routine and barely disguising her annoyance when fellow South African professional Johannes Radebe and actor Catherine Tyldesley were voted out. And then there is her penchant for a glamorous ballgown and her sleekly coiffed hair. Yet, when we meet in a London hotel, Mabuse is wearing a red quilted jacket and eating a full English breakfast. Minus her glittery nails, she gestures instead with forkfuls of bacon and sausage. “This is really me,” she says. “That’s a different person on screen.” Mabuse is no newcomer to judging, having been on the panel of Let’s Dance, Germany’s version of Strictly, for the past 11 years. Her sister, Oti, is one of the pros on Strictly, and the pair joked that Motsi should replace Darcey Bussell when she stepped down last year. And then, just weeks later, Motsi got the call. “I couldn’t believe it,” she laughs. Strictly regularly tops 10 million viewers, so the pressure is on for Mabuse, especially as she admits she doesn’t speak English that well after living in Germany for 20 years. “The tabloids are intense,” she says. “People said I would be too biased towards my sister. But I live in my own bubble.” She has received messages accusing her of being too flamboyant and, when she was first hired, the former Dancing on Ice judge Louie Spence called her a “nobody”, accusing the BBC of “box-ticking” for diversity. There has also been speculation about rifts between the Mabuse sisters, with papers claiming they “never” see each other despite being on the same show. Motsi maintains they are still on good terms: “Oti has been so supportive. After the first show we were both in tears, so proud of each other.” Similar suggestions have been raised about her relationship with Ballas. “Shirley and I have respect for where we come from – a dance world which is very male-dominated. We’re tough girls.” She may know the drill when it comes to judging, but she finds the British “far more fast-paced. Working here has taught me the meaning of professionalism.” What about her relationship with the other judges? “Everyone is very nice, but we’re all artists, so we give each other space.” They only really see each other for rehearsals and recording the show. In 2000, Mabuse moved to Germany to dance competitively. She went on to marry her Ukrainian dance partner, Evgenij Voznyuk, and they now live near Hamburg with their 15-month-old daughter. Initially, she didn’t encounter any issues there, but she now feels the country is far more divided. “I don’t get that involved in politics because I’m in my dance bubble,” she says, but she does feel that diversity is treated as a “fad” in Germany. “In Britain, it feels part of your history. In Germany, it feels as if it’s just fashionable for now. In three years, who knows what the country will look like? I just want my daughter to grow up in a society where she feels accepted being South African, German and Ukrainian.” Mabuse was 18 when she left for Germany. Oti, who was eight at the time, followed her to Hamburg 10 years later, for dance training. “It was great when she came to me,” says Mabuse, “as I finally had my family closer. In a way, it is easier to be the younger sibling, as the older one has to pave the way.” Breakfast half-finished, Mabuse is warming up, transforming into the high-energy persona we’re used to seeing on TV. “I’m actually very emotional,” she says, “but I always had to be strong because of my childhood and the competitiveness of the dance world. I learned that by being emotional on screen, people can relate. You end up helping them express themselves. That was something my husband showed me. He said: ‘You don’t have to be strong all the time.’ So now I’m just me.” Mabuse has been commuting from Germany to London for Strictly each week. “It’s been difficult for me leaving my daughter,” she says. “I didn’t know how I was going to deal with being without her, but I’ve got my mother and my husband’s family looking after her as a team now – that’s just the reality of being a working woman.” To an outsider, the world of ballroom can seem intensely pressurised, if not brutal, despite all the smiles, spangles and fake tan. Mabuse feels it is harder now than ever. “We used to travel to dance throughout Europe and spend weeks at a time with each other, so you would make lots of friends. Today, though, the dance world is at war. It’s all egos, money-making and politics.” Mabuse says rival competitions and schools make it harder for younger dancers to make a living, forcing them to specialise early on and thereby limiting their options. “I was lucky because I went straight from dancing into TV, but it’s much harder for the younger generation. In Germany, they don’t really have recognition for artists – it’s all still business, law and economics that people study.” Mabuse believes Strictly can give dancers a second wind. “When I started dancing, it was clear that when you retired, probably in your early 30s, you could only go on to teach. Every dancer suffers some kind of depression because they’re starting from scratch. Now, Strictly has given us another way out.” Her role as a woman of colour on the show has also been inspirational to many. “I get messages from young girls asking for advice,” she says, “and even from celebrities of colour here who I’ve never met, just thanking me for raising visibility.” The show can transform the lives of the celebrities, too, she says, particularly when it comes to same-sex dancing. Strictly aired its first such performance last month when Radebe and Graziano di Prima, two male pros, did spins and lifts, beaming at each other throughout. The segment drew almost 200 complaints from viewers. What these people were doing watching the campest show on TV, we’ll never know. “It’s a big deal over nothing,” says Mabuse, who is keen for this breakthrough to filter into the show’s competition side. “It’s time. There’s no stopping same-sex dancing couples. I don’t understand how people being happy can affect others so much – just let them be. Can we get rid of all these labels? It’s just people having relationships. I prefer to eat English breakfast today and muesli tomorrow – but it’s still breakfast. We’re humans. That’s my take on it.” A car arrives to take Mabuse away. “When this show started,” she says, with a final flourish of her fork, “people thought it was a joke, that no one would be interested in celebrities dancing. But now look. Half of the country is watching me!”"

          "bodyText": "Shoppers are forecast to spend more than £1bn online on Christmas Day after retailers lowered prices on Christmas Eve and the last-minute dash to the high street failed to materialise. The number of people visiting high streets, shopping centres and retail parks was down nearly 8% by midday on 24 December compared with last year, according to the customer data firm Springboard. “I am quite surprised by the extent of the drop,” said Diane Wehrle, the organisation’s insights director. She said a combination of factors was likely to be at play including low consumer confidence, the switch to online shopping and a reaction against buying unneeded items. The arrival in the UK of Black Friday, which usually falls in late November, has also changed shopping patterns, persuading bargain hunters to bag their presents early. “Black Friday being so much stronger has taken quite a lot of steam out of the market,” Wehrle said. “There has been a real change at Christmas.” Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis, Currys PC World and Boots kicked off their sales online on 24 December, as they have done for several years. An expected 7.3 million people were expected to shop online on Christmas Eve spending £734m compared with £850m in stores, according to Vouchercodes and the Centre for Retail Research. Discounts this year will be greater than recent years after low footfall in the final shopping days before Christmas and evidence that the difficult trading on the high street is spreading to online retailers. In the past, the last few days, or even weeks, before Christmas were dedicated to shopping on the high street, as home deliveries from online retailers could not be guaranteed to arrive in time for 25 December. However, shops now face competition from online players right up to the last minute, as companies including Argos and Amazon accept same-day delivery orders on Christmas Eve. Subscribers to Amazon’s Prime Now service, for example, can order up until 21.15 on Christmas Eve for same-day deliveries before midnight. Amid heavy competition, John Lewis said sales for the week to 21 December were down 5.1% on the same week last year, even after it extended its deadline for click-and-collect orders up until Christmas Eve. It blamed the poor figures on sales being pulled forward into the Black Friday discount period in late November. Fashion and beauty sales were down by just over 5% but homewares and technology performed even worse – down 8.9%. Boots is offering half-price discounts on selected No7 cosmetics and Oral B toothbrushes as well as some Christmas gift collections such as Champneys bubble bath. M&amp;S has 35% off a cashmere wrap as part of a list of knitwear price cuts of up to 40% off. It also offered 20% off champagne and half price on beauty gifts and some children’s wear, including a unicorn T-shirt on Christmas Eve. John Lewis was offering 50% off womenswear on Christmas Eve, while Hobbs and Whistles upped their price cuts to 70%, from 50% at the weekend. Late last week, Topshop and Miss Selfridge increased their discounts to up to 60%, from 40% and 50% respectively earlier in the week, while Jigsaw, Peacocks and House of Fraser increased their price cuts to 50%, matching Debenhams and Oasis. The online fashion retailer Boohoo was offering 80% off."

          "bodyText": "If you’re anything like me, what shared emotional life you might still have is mostly achieved by mainlining shows on a streaming service with your loved one perched on the sofa nearby. When I say loved one, I mean co-watcher. I’m not knocking Netflix or HBO or, now, BritBox, or the rest. I depend on them. These shows – you know the ones I mean – dramatise the bits of our relationships we’re too exhausted to undergo the drama of ourselves. At their best, they even hand us a predigested, precritiqued dose of the vexed and vexing world we’re in, allowing us both an engagement with it and an escape from it. Among friends, discussing these shows is reliable social glue, a fix of the cultural commonality we used to enjoy when everyone tuned into the same programme on the same channel at the same time. A time when what we had to feel guilty about was less a sense of, say, oppressive complicity and powerlessness, and more to do with our pleasures. So thank God for the streaming services, for bringing the pleasure principle back to culture. We can all agree we’re in a golden age of storytelling – topical, daring, boundary-pushing, conversation-changing. And yet despite, or precisely because of, their brilliance, humanity and depth … they’re kind of The Matrix, right? We kind of know they’re the endpoint of hyper-sophisticated, late-capitalist entertainment production, and they’ve got us totally in their grip. We kind of know they make us into soma-addled, Huxley-ish figures, engulfed in the sheer pleasure of binge-watching while the world burns. Also, and here I speak as a film-maker, bingeing while you could be catching a film instead. Pleasure – plaisir – is what the French literary theorist Roland Barthes called one kind of effect culture has on us: the effect of “readerly” as opposed to “writerly” texts. Readerly culture, the “audience-friendly” kind, is pleasurable precisely because it confirms our sense of ourselves, our ego, our position in the group. It gives you a nice juicy hit of belonging. You get to enjoy working over your identity and some of its contradictions. Readerly texts are basically homogenising. They’re the bubble. The writerly text does the opposite: it explodes your easy relatability. Instead of plaisir, it offers jouissance – the part of enjoyment that’s closer to pain. The excessive, destabilising bit of the pleasure principle that’s channelling the death drive. Instead of knowing yourself better, you come out unknowing yourself. Maybe barely recognising yourself at all. It will probably hurt. I’m going to say Netflix is basically plaisir and cinema is jouissance. Girls is plaisir; The Souvenir, jouissance. Or, Babylon Berlin, plaisir; The White Ribbon, jouissance. House of Cards, plaisir; Il Divo, jouissance. Atlanta: starts out plaisir but gets pretty jouissancy. The new Twin Peaks: so jouissancy it was just an overwhelming plaisir. As you can see, the TV/film distinction isn’t cut and dried – and clearly there are plenty of movies that just want to be plaisir, which is great, except when they’re bad at it. I’m not naming names. The point is, jouissance will do something to you in a way plaisir doesn’t. It’ll discomfit, even if that discomfiture is being given a beauty so naked that you suddenly can’t pretend you don’t have a soul. As a general indicator, jouissance is more likely to lead to you and your partner sleeping in separate rooms. It’s a pain. And so is schlepping your physical body out to the movie-house, especially to watch something that’ll make you hurt. Cinema, in its ideal sense, means both “the moving pictures” and the place where you go to worship them in their full, ego-obliterating splendour. But now with streaming services piping them straight to your cosy sofa for a fraction of the cost, and with wine you can actually afford, that trip starts to resemble a pilgrimage. Who can blame you if you’d rather domesticate the challenging art-film experience? Jouissance hurts enough even on a cosy sofa, and we already live in painful times. So who needs more, right? Well, Martin Scorsese, for one – a film-maker whose appeal emerges from an extraordinary blend of plaisir and jouissance both. Perhaps that’s why, for all his years, Marty embodies this most contemporary of conundrums. There he is, helplessly wired into the Netflix dollar yet somehow, like the protagonist of Tarkovsky’s Nostalghia, still struggling to keep alive the delicate candle flame that flickeringly illuminates those emptying cathedrals where some sort of mystery seems, if no longer possible for us, then possible, perhaps, for some as-yet-unimagined future iteration of the human. Don’t get me wrong. Hung on the cliff edge of these ever darkening times, I’ll take all the plaisir I can get. I’m every bit the addict, jacked into the mainline of all-subsuming capital – yet no less consumed by a “nostalghia” for what I can’t but feel is disappearing. Which, I guess, is what makes me want to try to keep that vanishing sense of another possible self, another world, aflame. I don’t know if, in the future, “cinema” is where we’ll still be able to find it. But it’s becoming increasingly hard to imagine we’ll recover all of it online. • Josh Appignanesi is a film-maker"

          "bodyText": "In my family, the turkey curry is as much a part of Christmas as the big roast itself – creamy pies and overstuffed sandwiches are all very well, but after the joyous orgy of bread sauce and roast potatoes on the 25th, our palates cry out for something a little more lively. You could go for Nigella Lawson’s bang bang turkey, or novelist Kamila Shamsie’s delicious-sounding biryani; Naomi Duguid’s zingy, Thai/Lao-style turkey salad or the jambalayas, Mexican moles and other festive favourites suggested by Twitter correspondents, but, for us, leftover turkey calls for curry of the vaguely Indian variety. I say vaguely, because, just as roast turkey isn’t a big deal in India, having leftovers of this kind to use up isn’t the norm, either; as chef Maunika Gowardhan tells me, when she was growing up, “homes didn’t always have ovens in India, so roasting meat wasn’t a common practice … if tikkas were made, they’d be reheated and served with chutney and roti”. One of my Twitter field reporters, Piya Sengupta, agrees: “Where I am from, this would be rare. Meat preparations are generally in a sauce to begin with. Leftovers might involve changing the gravy a bit, but you seldom have relatively plain cooked meat to cover with sauce to reuse.” In short, this will always be a very British kind of Indian-ish curry: a true fusion of culinary, if not festive traditions. It should be fairly quick and easy to make, too, and not require much in the way of fresh ingredients, fridge space being at a premium at this time of year. Using up other likely leftovers will score extra bonus points. So what’s the best way to make it? The fruity one Many helpful souls online point me in the direction of the English colonial curry (hey, don’t shoot the messenger) in Delia Smith’s Christmas Collection, which is very similar to that in Helen Lawson’s version in her 1970 book, How to Make Good Curries, as favoured by Sue Vickers-Thompson, who also got in touch on Twitter. Both are fairly simple affairs, as befits a time when Indian ingredients were harder to come by in this country; Smith’s uses just turmeric, ginger and Madras curry powder in the way of spices, with a base of onion and celery fried in turkey fat, and a creamy sauce made from flour-thickened stock flavoured with grated creamed coconut and mango chutney. Most retro of all, as far as my guests are concerned, is the fruit content – as well as chutney, the sauce boasts apple and sultanas, the last of which, in conjunction with curry powder, instantly transports us back a couple of culinary decades. Not in a bad way, you understand; this is pure nostalgic pleasure, but we agree we’d like something a little bit zingier to shake our palates out of their festive comfort blankets. The almond one The second recipe comes from another national treasure – the turkey korma in Mary Berry’s [rival] Christmas Collection deploys a few more spices (cumin, coriander, garam masala and cardamom, as well as fresh ginger), and features a sauce thickened with coconut cream and ground almonds, rather than flour, but also, intriguingly, contains green grapes. Again, it’s a crowdpleaser, yet not quite enough to rouse our tastebuds from their seasonal carb and cream coma. “Like a nice warm bath,” one tester says. Everyone (apart from the dog) likes warm baths, but personally I prefer them hot. The coconutty one One Tweeter, Richard Doxon, tells me that he made an “amazing” Anjum Anand turkey curry in 2010, but, tragically, the relevant copy of Sainsbury’s magazine disappeared into the recycling bin along with the recipe. Thanks to the magic of social media, however, he has now been reunited with it – and I get to try it for the first time. Anand prefaces this “flavourful but not spicy” curry by noting that roughly a fifth of Kerala’s population celebrates Christmas, though she admits turkey doesn’t tend to feature on the menu there. It is indeed flavourful, featuring a masala made from fennel seeds, peppercorns, cinnamon, cardamom and cloves, as well as mustard seeds, curry leaves, garlic, fresh ginger, turmeric and coriander, all in a coconut milk and tomato gravy, so it seems a shame to dilute these wonderfully aromatic ingredients with a pint of coconut milk at the end. Because the meat is necessarily just heated through, rather than cooked in the gravy as usual, this kind of curry does need a bit of extra help, whether by reducing the sauce or by adding extra seasoning or stock; a few chillies, as Anand suggests in her introduction, wouldn’t be unwelcome, either, though, of course, this depends on who you’re serving it to. The yoghurt one Olivia Potts is a woman after my own heart, introducing her turkey curry recipe in the Spectator with the observation that, on 27 December, “the last thing you really want is the same meal you’ve been eating for the past two days, looking a little tired and fridge-worn, all the best bits gone”. But, she says, “forget insipid, tepid, old-fashioned turkey curries: this one is packed full of aromatics and spice; it’s creamy and punchy and golden [with] … enough spinach to make you feel a little more human after your 25th Quality Street of the festive season.” There’s garam masala and cardamom and fresh ginger, yes, but the blessed warmth of Kashmiri chilli powder, too, plus turkey stock, yoghurt and a great handful of leaves. This one proves very popular with testers: it’s thicker than some of the others, and richer, with a kick of heat and a touch of sweetness from a spoonful of honey – plus some bonus green stuff to balance out the past four days of reckless self-indulgence. The stir-fry The other standout winner of our taste test comes from my colleague Meera Sodha, who describes her turkey curry with shredded brussels sprouts, caramelised onions and ginger as “more interesting than your traditional bubble and squeak … warming, spicy, healthy and tasty”. Leaving aside the vexed question of whether food has to be interesting to be enjoyable, she’s right: the cinnamon, cloves, ginger and nutmeg taste pleasingly festive and work brilliantly with the sweetness of the slow-cooked onions. It’s a wake-up for the tastebuds all right, but more like a stir-fry than the others: as one tester says: “Maybe this is me being a bit basic, but it would be nice to have some gravy.” Roast turkey breast can tend towards the dry, however skilfully it’s been prepared, so unless you’re lucky enough to have just dark meat left, a generous sauce is a good thing here. The tomatoey one It strikes me, looking at the five curries lined up on the table, that what’s lacking is a tomato-based number of the kind we generally favour at home, albeit with the help of a jar of curry paste rather than Raymond Blanc (and before you carp, he’s been in the UK far longer than I’ve been alive, so if Mary Berry is allowed to make turkey curries, so is he). Blanc’s recipe starts with onion and garlic softened in large amounts of butter (so far, so French, I admit), but is then livened up with ginger, red chilli and more of the spices used by Anand and Sodha, as well as coriander and cumin. Most importantly, however, his tomato gravy is slow simmered before the meat is added, which means that it has an intense flavour all of its own; enough, along with Sodha’s version, to convince us that tomato should play a large part in this particular recipe – if you’ve done Christmas right, you should have already eaten enough beige sauce to last a lifetime, or perhaps just the next 11 months of it. The conclusion Though culinary traditions are among the most sacred and subjective of all festive matters, if you don’t have a favourite recipe for turkey curry, then this one, richly tomatoey and aromatic, yet creamy enough to have wide appeal, may well be the thing to give your leftovers a new lease of life. The sweet spices used by so many of the recipes above feel apt for the time of year, while the mild chilli heat can be adjusted to taste, depending on your audience. You can even make the base up to the end of the third step in the method several days in advance, then add the turkey, vegetables and dairy when reheating. Not only does this use up roast meat, but any sprouts or other greens you may have hanging around, as well as that half-jug of cream that’s been making eyes at you from the fridge for days. In fact, in the spirit of goodwill to all men, you could even add grapes from the cheeseboard. Just make sure you blame Mary Berry, not me. Perfect turkey curry Prep 15 min Cook 55 min Serves 4-6 50g butter 2 tsp cumin seeds 1 cinnamon stick 2 onions, finely chopped 6 garlic cloves, peeled 40g ginger, peeled 1-2 tsp mild/Kashmiri chilli powder, to taste ½ tsp ground turmeric 800g tinned chopped tomatoes 2 tbsp tomato puree 1 tsp sugar or honey Salt, to taste 1 tsp garam masala 3 tbsp double cream or whole-milk yoghurt About 500g roast turkey meat, roughly chopped or torn 10 brussels sprouts, shredded Over a medium heat, melt the butter in a wide frying pan for which you have a lid, then add a teaspoon of the cumin seeds and the cinnamon stick, and cook for a minute, until aromatic. Add the onions, turn down the heat and cook, stirring occasionally to make sure they don’t catch and burn, until soft, golden and beginning to caramelise. Meanwhile, pound the remaining cumin seeds to a powder, then set aside. Pound the garlic and ginger to a rough paste and stir these into the pan once the onions are ready. Cook for a couple of minutes, then add the ground cumin, chilli powder and turmeric. Fry, stirring, for another two minutes, then pour in the chopped tomatoes and tomato puree. Scrape any solids off the base of the pan, stir in the sugar and a good pinch of salt, bring to a simmer, then turn down the heat slightly and leave to bubble gently for about 20 minutes, until thickened. Stir in the garam masala and cream, then add the turkey, cover the pan and leave to cook for about 10 minutes, until it has heated through. Stir in the shredded sprouts, put the lid back on the pan and cook for about three minutes, until wilted. Taste for seasoning, then serve. • Curry or pie, salad or sandwich: what’s your favourite recipe for Christmas leftovers, turkey or otherwise? And do you find yourself tending more towards nostalgic flavours such as old-fashioned “curry powder” at Christmas, however maverick you might pride yourself on being for the rest of the year?"

Come Boxing Day, sales slow, but these diminutive greens have more to them than just being part of the festive roast, and stay affordable and plentiful long into spring. Cooked properly, sprouts can be the hero dish of the Christmas table, and beyond. Fry leftover ones with lardons of tempeh or bacon, then cover with cheese and bake. Even overcooked sprouts can be transformed into a delicious brunch, mashed with potatoes to make colcannon or bubble and squeak. To reduce waste when preparing your sprouts, leave the stem attached, unless it’s on the turn, because its removal will cause perfectly edible leaves to drop off. To cook them, drop the sprouts into plenty of ferociously boiling water just minutes before you want to eat. That way, they’ll still be vibrantly green when they hit the table – and ready for reinventing into leftover recipes throughout the week. And if you have a glut of uncooked sprouts, they’re delicious raw, too, in a slaw or the like. Brussels sprout super-slaw This is a go-to Boxing Day recipe round my house. Raw sprouts are super-delicious in a slaw, and look colourful when mixed with satsumas and dried fruits. Use up other raw vegetables, too, and any nuts and dried fruit leftover from the holidays, to give the dish a wonderful texture. Serves 2 100g brussels sprouts, finely shredded 2 sticks celery, finely sliced ¼ red onion, finely diced 2 satsumas, peeled and pulled into segments 3 sprigs mixed soft herbs, such as oregano, mint and parsley, picked, stalks reserved 25g walnuts 15g crushed hemp seeds or other seeds 15g dried fruit, chopped Extra-virgin olive oil and a squeeze of cider vinegar, to dress Put the shredded sprouts in a large bowl, then add the celery, onion and the satsuma segments. Finely chop the herb stalks and roughly chop the leaves, and add to the mix. Add the walnuts, crushed hemp seeds (or other seeds) and dried fruit, season and finish with a drizzle each of extra-virgin olive oil and cider vinegar. Toss to combine, and serve."

          "bodyText": "We are going to leave the live blog there for the night. If you need updates on the fire situations: • The CFS site is for South Australia • The VicEmergency site is for Victoria • The RFS site is for New South Wales There are two fires at watch and act level in New South Wales: the Gosper Mountains fire and the Grose Valley fire. Authorities are keeping an eye on ember activity in Athelstone in South Australia from the Cudlee Creek fire. Although conditions have been less severe today, it is expected the fires will continue without significant rainfall. We will have updates in the morning, and in the meantime, please stay safe. My colleague Helen Davidson wrote this just two days ago about the effort to save Balmoral. It’s so utterly devastating that almost all of the town is gone now. AAP has some more horrific detail on the extent of the devastation in Balmoral. The town has around 150 houses and a population of 400. There is “not much left” but we don’t know exactly how many homes were destroyed yet. AAP: Matthew Deeth, who’s the mayor of the neighbouring Wollondilly Shire Council, says everyone knows everyone in the small village. “They were all banding together until they got hit yesterday and they were just decimated,” Deeth said on Sunday. “Most people were pulled out of their houses and if there was nobody defending houses they kind of just all lit up.” Residents in the nearby town of Bargo, north-east of Balmoral, were counting themselves lucky on Sunday. One house in Bargo’s Ashby Close was lost to the Green Wattle Creek blaze, with fire damaging a number of other properties in the street. Joe Cefai, 50, said the blaze just missed his home. Cefai, who evacuated with his two young children and a neighbour, lost a number of buildings next to his house. “It could have been far worse,” he said on Sunday. “I could have easily kissed my home goodbye. To return to see how close it did get, words can’t explain.” A total fire ban has been declared for tomorrow in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. An update on the situation in Victoria from AAP: Bushfires in Victoria’s East Gippsland have been downgraded as firefighters get a leg up on blazes thanks to milder weather conditions. A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale- Barmouth Spur is still not under control. “Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,” the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2,711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing and a milder 22C in Melbourne after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since 21 November but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. ABC is reporting SA premier Steven Marshall has said 72 homes have been destroyed in the Cudlee Creek fire. It is up from 15 yesterday. A total of 404 outbuildings and 227 vehicles were also destroyed in the fire. Here’s a bit more on what the Australian defence force has been doing to help out the firefighting effort in the past day. An aerial tanker has been provided to the NSW RFS from the RAAF base in Richmond. The HMAS Albatross has helped with water refuelling and retardant loading for the Currowan fires from the naval air station in Nowra. The army is also supplying personnel to prepare meals three times a day for 250 firefighters in the northern rivers region from November until mid-January. It is also assisting with transport and logistics for the RFS in Glen Innes, Kempsey, Casino, Wollondilly and in the Hawkesbury. Helicopters and accomodation are also being supplied You can read more about what defence is doing to help out here. I am going to leave you in the very, very capable hands of my colleague Josh Taylor for the rest of the afternoon. Conditions continue to be a lot better than yesterday, but that just means firefighters are having to try and use what time they have to get ahead of what is coming after that. Please pay attention to the alerts and make sure your plan is ready. Thank you for following along with me today – and as always, take care of you and those around you. Journalist Royce Kurmelovs has another update from the South Australian fires: James Tilbrook coughs from the smoke inhalation as he picks through the wreckage of his Adelaide Hills vineyard. “It’s not good,” James says of both the cough and the scene. The boutique Tilbrook Estate winery and vineyard is run by James and his wife Annabelle, who fled their property on Friday morning as the Cudlee Creek fires started to burn out of control. Coming back, James says he is shell-shocked. “We’ve lost everything,” he says. “Our house is on a separate property. My wife, son and our dog left at 10.30 for Mt Barker. At about 11am I had to choose between staying to defend the vineyard, or going to defend our home. I had to make that choice. The result is our house – our home – is still standing, but the vineyard’s gone. We’ve lost our livelihood.” “Once our house was safe, I went to help a friend with his home. I figured the vineyard was toast, there was nothing I could do there, so I might as well go help friends.” As the fire swept through, James says “cooked” the decades-old vine plantings and melted the winery on the property. A neighbouring cherry orchard was also destroyed in the blaze. “We were only a small producer, we make 1000 cases a year but all our stock was in the winery,” James said. “All the barrels of our last vintage. All our wine in tanks. All the wine in the tank is still there, but it’s probably cooked too. “I got a photo of some bottles that were sitting on top of a filing cabinet and the bottles have melted or collapsed. Someone said to me that the melting point of glass is 1400 to 1600 degrees. It would have been fucking hot in there. Excuse my language.” James says the biggest problem going forward is going to be income. The couple planted their first vines on the property in 1999 and it will take years for them to recover or regrow. In the meantime, they have a multi-million dollar mortgage to pay. “Someone told me there’s a chance the vines may recover and come back,” James says. “I’m usually a positive person, but I just don’t know. I don’t believe it.” Some friends have already set up a fundraiser for the family.

A watch and act warning remains active on Sunday for Tambo Crossing, Wattle Circle and Stirling, while the bushfire at Marthavale – Barmouth Spur is still not under control. “Emergency Services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay,” the VicEmergency website states. Fire crews have managed to get a handle on two blazes with warnings lowered to advice across Goroke, Lawloit, Little Desert, Peronne, Burnbank, Evansford and surrounding towns. One of the fires, the Lexton-Ben Major bushfire in the vicinity of Mt Lonarch, has been contained after burning through 2711 hectares, and an advice warning in place. It comes as the temperature took a dip on Sunday with about 24C forecast in Tambo Crossing, and a milder 22C in Melbourne, after a top of 44C in the Victorian capital. The bushfires have been burning since November 21 but flared up on Saturday after a cool change came through and brought dry lightning strikes. A relief centre has been set up at the Omeo memorial hall, 60 kilometres north, for people affected while generators have been set-up to restore power and services. Hundreds of firefighters on the ground and in the air have been working across the state to contain the fires, which are concentrated in steep and largely inaccessible terrain. People are advised to monitor the VicEmergency website. Anthony Albanese’s office has just released the transcript to the press conference, which includes this line at the end: In terms of this crisis, I have tried to visit the Rural Fire Service headquarters … Minister Littleproud, can I say this, has been exemplary at providing information and briefings to the opposition, but I have made a request now for days to visit the rural fire service. And that request has not been met up to this point. That would be the headquarters Scott Morrison held his “I have returned” press conference from this morning. From my time covering state politics in Queensland, those decisions are usually up to the state government. You can hear the terror and the frustration in this video. These fires – they are different. It’s not just authorities saying it. It’s those on the ground, the “quiet Australians” who have lived through previous seasons, but not like this. Which is why politicians saying they’ve seen smoke haze in Sydney before, or that we’ve always had fires, or quoting Dorothea Mackellar is not good enough, on any measure. NSW police say a man is missing in Lithgow, following a fire. From AAP: NSW police say a man is missing from the rural village of Bell after a huge bushfire tore through the Lithgow area, destroying dozens of buildings. The man in his 60 or 70s lives on a remote property in Bell and the area was engulfed in fire on Saturday, NSW police chief inspector Chris Sammut said on Sunday. Another elderly man who had been missing from neighbouring Dargan has been located “safe and sound”, the Rural Fire Service tweeted on Sunday morning. He was found at an evacuation centre in Lithgow which was threatened by the huge Gospers Mountain megafire over the weekend. Sammut said the man who was still unaccounted for lived on one of the remotest properties in Bell. “He may have self-evacuated or went to stay with friends and we want the public to let us know any information they have to assist us locate this missing person,” he said. Sammut confirmed up to five properties were burned in Lithgow on Saturday while about 30 buildings were lost in Clarence and Dargan. Those numbers include sheds and other structures. About 350 residential homes in Lithgow remained without power on Sunday afternoon. For those who missed the prime minister’s press conference, here is the beginning, including where he apologises for causing anxiety: But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they’re going through this terrible time. And I say to those Australians who I caused upset to, and I apologise for that. It is important I think when you [are] confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. Bits and pieces are slowly coming out of Balmoral. Anthony Albanese says he won’t be leaving Australia this summer, and thanked David Littleproud for being “exemplary” in providing the opposition with briefings. In the briefing that the opposition’s had this morning, there are cooler conditions expected as we’re experiencing today, over the next few days, but north-western Australia is a real issue. And of course, when you have heat, that’s where the heat begins. And it’s there now and is expected to come across the country to the east coast to the more heavily populated areas over the next week. Around north Queensland, around Townsville, Mount Isa and in that area, is also being looked at very carefully at the moment. And people should bear in mind the warnings that are there if they are thinking of going on driving holidays, for example, down the south coast, they need to listen to the expert advice which is there and not take any risks. The first priority is keeping people safe. And I thank minister Littleproud for the ongoing briefings that he’s provided, and the personal discussions I’ve had with him as well. Back to Scott Morrison’s decision to leave Australia, Anthony Albanese says: I wouldn’t have made the decision that he made to go – that is a matter for him and his family circumstances and it is difficult – I haven’t sought during this week to, to pass judgment on that, it’s a matter for his judgment. He chose to leave. He chose also to do it in a way that I think created a major issue of secrecy. This government has a real problem with being accountable with any scrutiny whatsoever, and the circumstances whereby Michael McCormack wouldn’t say whether he was acting prime minister or not, whereby people didn’t know when Scott Morrison was coming back – and even after he said he was coming back, he didn’t come back and wouldn’t tell the media or public when he would be returning. I just think this government has a problem with scrutiny and openness and it’s on display all the time, over so many issues. I’ve raised this for a considerable period of time – it is part of Mr Morrison’s character that when asked a question, that’s just a straight question, he dismisses it, or he prevaricates, he speaks about the bubble, or he says it’s just gossip and he won’t provide answers to simple question whether it’s in parliament or from the media. And I say to the media that they need to hold him to account, and we’ll do our job of holding him to account in the parliament, with a whole range of issues in which he just won’t provide a straight answer. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison’s assertion his government won’t be changing its emissions reduction policy: Well, I just find it staggering that in the current circumstances, whereby he’s sent Angus Taylor, a discredited minister, who has been misleading parliament since his first speech, to represent our nation at Madrid to try and undermine international action on climate change, including arguing for accountancy tricks rather than lower emissions. Australians do want action on climate change. The deputy prime minister yesterday said new measures were needed and a new response – and today, going from the acting prime minister to the real prime minister, we have a dismissal of the need for any action on climate change. The government needs to listen to the International Energy Agency head, who has said it is time for Australia to get our act together. And quite clearly, when it comes to climate change, the prime minister’s attitude is there’s nothing to see here. It’s business as usual. Well if he thinks there is nothing to see her, it’s because he can’t see through the smoke that’s coming from those bushfires. Anthony Albanese on Scott Morrison’s return from Hawaii. (Earlier in the week, Albanese said he would not be criticising the PM for taking leave.) Now I note that today, Scott Morrison has returned from his holiday in Hawaii. It’s a good thing that he is back. But we saw today no change in strategy with regard to the bushfires, a Coag meeting to be held next March. I wrote to the prime minister in November, asking him to convene Coag in November, prior to the emergency levels of the current crisis. And that was dismissed. We see no change to climate change policy. And we’ve seen no commitment to provide compensation to our volunteer firefighters who are giving up working and the wages that comes with that in order to help their communities, but they’ve still got to pay the rent, they’re still going to pay their mortgages, they’re still going to buy food for their families, and they are really struggling, they’re fatigued. And there’s a need for the government to look at making sure that they’re properly compensated. So they don’t have to choose between whether they continue to help out, or whether they have money to put food on the table for their families. Australian Associated Press has an update on the South Australian situation: Smoke from the Adelaide Hills bushfire had dropped the city’s air quality rating to poor. The Environment Protection Authority says air quality readings are improving but parts of the hills and metropolitan area remain affected by bushfire smoke. The situation on Sunday was further exacerbated by an early morning temperature inversion layer which kept smoke low to the ground. The EPA said anyone with health issues or concerns should stay inside with windows and doors closed. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze, with the Country Fire Service reporting some renewed fire activity within the 127km perimeter. The fire has burnt through more than 25,000 hectares and destroyed at least 15 homes. Before it was sparked on Friday, the Bureau of Meteorology also reported that smoke from the NSW bushfires had made its way to Adelaide. Anthony Albanese has just held his press conference in Rozelle. Unfortunately it hasn’t been broadcast as yet, and I am in Canberra, so I will bring that to you as soon as I can. We are still waiting on Anthony Albanese’s press conference. It should be soon. The smoke has officially made its way north. Which brings Scott Morrison back in to the frame: I think all Australians, I think, are very proud – I know the commissioner is very proud and the premier is very proud of the services that the lead. But all Australians are extremely proud of what is being done here, and in so many places around the country. ... All Australians are proud and have a great, great reason to be proud. This is this is Australia at its best, Australia at its best, and we thank them for it. The commissioner finishes with how proud he is of the fire services: We’ve seen only tragically this week, the risk is real. And the consequences can be fatal. And and as a result of the events only this week, there are there are families, there are loved ones, there are wives and there are children and there are mates, who will never be the same again because of the horrendous that unfolded this week. I could not be any more proud, not just of the extraordinary volunteers that that I have the privilege of being the commissioner for, but the entire coordinated fire response over here in NSW, partnering with the commonwealth, ... It’s a massive, huge logistical operation maintaining and sustaining more than 2,000 people per shift, day and night – the people behind the scenes of people on the front line, I could not be any more proud of the extraordinary efforts and commitment and dedication that we see following rolling out day in day out, and we know that they’re going to be doing it as long as their community and the people of NSW are going to be threatened and, and all we pray for is rain. And unfortunately, we need a lot of rain to start getting some reprieve. Shane Fitzsimmons on Balmoral: Unfortunately I don’t have the specific numbers – there are teams in the field today. But as the premier indicated the team inside there say that it was devastating, and I think I coined the phrase “there’s not a lot left or there’s not much left”, and that’s just really confronting to contemplate and, and whether it’s Balmoral or Buxton ... we are talking dozens of properties, dozens of buildings. As a matter of fact, right across all the far grounds of the last 24 hours, we could be talking about another hundred buildings that being added to the state tally so far this season. That doesn’t mean there’s 100 homes and we need to make sure we differentiate between buildings, property and homes. The detailed analysis going on in the field now will seek to differentiate between what is a home, what is a house, what is a shed, and you know, and that takes some time, we need to access these areas. But the toll is significant. ... There’s a long way to go before we really have an understanding of the magnitude and scale of the the loss and damage here as a result of these fires. Commissioner Fitzsimmons on what is coming up: We’ve got to keep in mind that we’re not expecting any rainfall to make any meaningful difference to these fires until January /February. That’s still a way to go. We’re still talking four to six weeks at best before we start to see a meaningful reprieve in the weather, based on the forecast are available. And then, as the prime minister indicated, we will want to do some very critical post-incident reviews, post-season reviews, gather the information gathered the support from firefighters and communities right across NSW. That will take some time. And the last thing we want is ad hocery or, or unnecessary reactiveness so close to the end of this season, and particularly when other states and territories are still going to have challenges heading well and truly into March. So they will need to be a very concerted effort to consolidate the learnings to ensure that we’re hearing far and wide and formulate that into lessons and proposals in due course but it is certainly something [we] will be very much focused on. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons on that same issue: Fatigue management, and the drain, the relentless nature of this season is certainly taking a toll and so to is a geographic spread of the activity – you might recall for several months between July and and into September, most of the effort was really concentrated in north-east NSW, we’ve now got fires spreading from north-east NSW and Queensland border down to the south coast of NSW. Those logistical challenges, those transport and, and accommodation challenges spreading and moving people right across such a broad geographic area all add to the challenges of fatigue and crew rotation. Underpinning all of this is a combination of members that are in a very strong position, a very ready position to sustain ongoing efforts and support for three days, five days at a time, coming back for rest and doing another three to five days coming back from a rest. Not everybody can do that. There are also teams that need to maintain a local presence and our local level of fire covering case we get new fires. And then on days like yesterday, where we saw such a broad area affected by catastrophic forecast and unfolding in the day, devastating fires, we saw a whole, a whole bunch of people in the order of 1,000 people stand up and make themselves available to bolster that effort. We’ve got another 30 people that the prime minister met this morning in at the state headquarters that have just arrived from Canada and the United States. We’ve got commitments to see beyond that, from our interstate colleagues, and our overseas colleagues to help us with the fatigue management and the crew rotations and where appropriate, the bolstering of numbers on those difficult days. It is a tough challenge. It is a difficult challenge, and something that we work very closely on, and we will continue to work very closely on as we see through the balance of this season. Scott Morrison on the fatigue volunteers are facing: It’s obviously one of the many significant issues that the commissioner manages with this incredible volunteer fighting force that is out there. But I gotta tell you, one of the things that commissioner told me this morning just, again, just impressed me so much is when a call went out yesterday for extra hands. An extra thousand firefighters showed up in response to that call. A thousand. That is just incredible. People know what’s at stake and they’re all making their contribution. Scott Morrison on the scheduled March Coag: Well, the immediate needs as I said this morning, simply require the requests to come forward as they do through the regular meetings that are held of the fire chiefs and commissioners. The ministers responsible ... they only met a few weeks ago. And what we need to do in March is to ensure that we deal with the recommendations that come out from many of the lessons that have come through these fires not just here in NSW, but in other states and territories as well that have been affected. And we look forward to receiving those proposals then, right now they are fighting fires, and we don’t want them sitting around writing submissions. We want them [to] obviously be focused on the operational tasks they have in front of them. Coag has been very busy over the back end of this year, particularly dealing with a lot of the environmental issues that we’ve been working on and waste management which I thank the premier for her support on and will be considering those proposals. A lot of the ministers have been meeting through their various councils in recent weeks and months. And that means there will be a really good body of work that comes forward to character in March which will be in NSW and it’ll be in Rooty Hill. And I’m looking forward to bring out their their wonderful new facility out there in Rooty Hill. From Australian Associated Press: More than 3,000 properties in the Adelaide Hills remain without power as a result of the devastating bushfire that swept through the region and continues to burn. SA Power Networks says crews are working in a number of areas to restore electricity supply. But it says the timeframe to have all power restored is unclear, and in some cases it could take several days depending on access and the extent of the damage. The company said it had already identified a number of spots where trees had fallen on powerlines. “Anyone in fire-damaged areas is urged to keep clear of power poles and wires as there may still be some that haven’t been inspected,” it said. Among those without electricity are properties in Woodside, Lenswood, Mt Torrens, Charleston and Lobethal. The Adelaide Hills fire has so far burnt out more than 25,000 hectares inside a 127km perimeter. A watch and act warning remains in place for the blaze which has destroyed at least 15 homes. RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons says fire authorities don’t expect any real relief in terms of conditions until well into January. Gladys Berejiklian: Question: There’s been concern in Balmoral specifically about when people will be able to get back in and see whether or not their home is still standing? Berejiklian: Look, it’s devastating not knowing whether your property is standing or not. Unfortunately, we have received bad news. There isn’t much left [in Balmoral]. I might ask the commissioner to add to my comments. I understand expert teams are going in on the ground in a lot of those communities today, to make full assessments and to let people know when it is safe to go back. Even if people have lost their properties, they still want to go back to see what’s left and if there is anything they can salvage. We know that’s part of the recovery. We want people to have access to their land, to their property, as soon as they can, but it has to be safe. Scott Morrison: As the premier has just said, the category C assistance is being extended to the Wollondilly shire. That, as the premier said, includes payments for small producers and businesses of up to $15,000 and includes things like mental health support and small grants to communities in both shires to help them rebuild particularly with community resilience programs and things of that nature coming out of that fund. That support is going to over – around 40 local government areas around NSW at the moment. It’s the same sort of support that’s been provided in many other parts, say, of Queensland where they have had the fires as well in recent times. These programs are designed to help people with their immediate needs. The premier and I have agreed also this morning that those $1,000 disaster assistance recovery payments that are paid to – for each individual and the $400 that are paid for each and – each child, in a family, that will be extended to the shire as well. It is already in place for Wollondilly. Those arrangements will be put in place today. These things are done as a partnership. This is the best coordinated, the best resourced, the biggest-hearted response that I think we’ve seen once again here from our response to these terrible disasters. It is something, I think, Australians – as I said earlier today – can be be enormously proud of, seeing their country at their best. That is what we have to keep focused on – allowing Australians to continue to be at their best, supporting them as they get tired and ensure that we can continue to roll out what has been an extraordinary performance from all of those who have been involved. Scott Morrison is called to the front – he starts with a repeated call for “kindness”: It is great to be here with you of course, your colleagues, and Angus Taylor, the local member, and Commissioner Fitzsimmons. Thank you, again, for the tremendous job you’re doing with all of your team – all around New South Wales. As the premier said, it is humbling as you come and speak to families and individuals, you speak to volunteers, and you see the best of Australia on every single occasion. That’s what we’re seeing here again today. Friendships, neighbours looking after each other, simple kindnesses that are being extended. I met one wonderful, wonderful lady today from Malta. She was there with another lady, a single lady, who was finding it tough. She was looking after her. She was making sure that she gets back to her property today. She’s holding her hand. That’s what she’s doing. And this is the – these are the – this is the grace, this is the kindness, that events like this need and that’s what’s being displayed here on the ground. That will continue. Not just through the ordinary everyday things that are done by members of the community off their own bat, but also by the many volunteers. We rightfully praise those in the RFS, but equally today we met with members of St John’s Ambulance, the State Emergency Service – those who are looking after the care and welfare of animals, and others – there are so many people who stick up their hands in these times. We thank them very, very much for everything they are doing. Berejiklian finishes with this: The devastation is shocking. I have also been just literally bowled by the way the community’s come together, the resilience and people’s generosity. People with not much are giving away everything they have to support others. And it’s times like these when you really appreciate what New South Wales and what Australia’s about. Gladys Berejiklian: So, as you know, we announced joint funding and now that joint funding is in excess of $63m across the state and extends to a dozen councils. These two are now part of that. ... I also want to stress – I have mentioned this to the mayor who is here today – that $63m is on top of the $25m the New South Wales government’s already set aside to get rid of hazardous materials and just to start the clean up. For some families, some families will be given notification they can go back to their properties, perhaps today, tomorrow. Other families have to wait. We want to make sure – no matter what people’s circumstances – just the hope of being able to move forward is so important. If we pick up the tab – sometimes it costs thousands of dollars – to get the hazardous materials off the property, whether you are insured or not insured, the state government is picking up that cost to get on with rebuilding as soon as you’re physically and emotionally ready to start the rebuilding process. As I’ve said, we’re not just here today and tomorrow but we will be with you for the weeks and months and for some communities years. Gladys Berejiklian is addressing the media – she is formally announcing the additional areas who can now access the disaster relief funding. Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian have arrived at one of the Green Wattle creek fire evacuation centres – the Picton Bowling Club. About a dozen people had stayed there last night. If you haven’t seen it, Lenore Taylor has written on what she took out of Scott Morrison’s press conference. A taste: This isn’t about an adjustment to your language, it requires an adjustment to your policy, it requires a credible policy, the kind of policy we know could benefit us economically, that business is begging you to enact so that they can invest. And we know that would mean we could fight for effective international action rather than continue to act as a hindrance. We know we can’t solve the heating that is exacerbating this crisis on our own, so please don’t insult our intelligence again with that “1.3% of global emissions” argument like you did at the start of this fire season. Given the consequences we are suffering, we should be doing everything we can, and we know that we are not. You’ve just kept pretending. You’ll find the whole thing here: Two more areas have been given access to disaster recovery funding. From the release: The commonwealth and NSW governments are providing another $3.5m to extend the community recovery assistance program under the Disaster Recovery Funding Arrangements (DRFA) to the Wingecarribee and Wollondilly LGAs. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said this additional funding brings the total federal-state recovery fund to more than $63m. “Having witnessed first-hand the devastation these bushfires have inflicted on locals and their communities it is vital the government act right away to provide assistance as quickly as possible,” Berejiklian said. “We have already made available support for people who are suffering personal hardship; help for people whose homes have been damaged; funding for firefighting operations and to restore damaged essential public assets; and financial support for small businesses, primary producers and non-profit organisations. “Importantly, we are also supporting these communities to become more resilient to disasters by extending the NSW Bushfires Economic Recovery and Community Resilience Grants Program.” Victoria Mackinlay has published this photo of dead ladybugs washing up on Bondi beach, surrounded by ash The ACCC has responded to the National Electricity Market price report – and it is not as rosy as Angus Taylor made out. From the ACCC public media release: The average annual bill for households in the National Electricity Market fell in 2018–19 compared with the previous year, by $65 or 4%, the latest ACCC electricity markets report has found. But while average household bills fell to $1509 in 2018–19, households were still paying about 20% ($254) more than in 2007–08, and the average price for a unit of electricity drawn from the grid was about 45% higher in real terms. “There is still work to be done to make electricity more affordable for households,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said. “We continue to seek action on our previous recommendations, which we believe will help drive bills down.” Further action on environmental scheme costs needed Environmental costs have been the biggest driving factor behind the increase in average household bills over the longer term, due to federal and state government policies aimed at encouraging greater uptake of renewable generation, promoting energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions. Customers with solar panels made up about 16% of all residential customers in the National Electricity Market (NEM) in 2018-19, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2007-08. Many of these policies, such as premium Feed-in Tariff (FiT) rebates, result in additional costs for retailers that ultimately flow through to customers’ electricity bills, unless funded through other means. The costs of such schemes accounted for $103 or 41% of the long-term increase in household bills between 2007–08 and 2018–19. ...For example, the average household pays about $550 a year (or 9.4 cents per kWh) more than a household with solar panels, a situation the ACCC believes raises significant questions about fairness. “The cost of installing solar panels has reduced significantly in recent years, so environmental schemes like the premium FiT rebates are no longer needed to make solar an attractive option for those households that can afford it,” Sims said. “Indeed, all customers who can, should consider how much they could save by installing solar panels. “We are primarily concerned about the additional costs such schemes have imposed on households that cannot access or afford to install solar panels,” Sims said. “Funding environmental schemes through government budgets rather than through increased electricity charges should also be considered as a more equitable option.” A very welcome piece of good news from the NSW RFS – a missing man has been found, safe. Scott Morrison is still making his way to an evacuation centre in Picton Royce Kurmelovs has provided an update on the South Australian fires for us: Adelaide has woken up to the smell of smoke as a haze lingers over the city from fires burning in the Adelaide Hills and on Kangaroo Island in the south, but the South Australian CFS says it is hopeful they will have a handle on the situation in the coming days. While the CFS is not confident enough to issue a statement on containment, cool conditions overnight have allowed fire crews to get on the front foot, with back-burning operations currently being performed in an effort to contain the Cudlee Creek fires in the northwest. So far the blaze in that area has consumed over 25,000 hectares, destroyed homes and properties, injured lifestock and native wildlife. Two people have been confirmed dead within South Australia during the bushfires, and 26 CFS volunteers injured battling the blaze. Road blocks remain in effect areas as fire crews are working to manage hotspots along the perimeter and are wary of flare ups in the coming week. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast temperatures in the 30’s in South Australia, with the mercury to climb as the days wind out. Elsewhere, the “complex” series of fires on Kangaroo Island has been downgraded and is being treated as two separate fire fronts with 50 firefighters currently on the scene. A spokesperson for the CFS said mop-up operations are expected to continue. “We’ll have fire crews on the firegrounds for quite some time. Even if we do get it contained, there’ll be fire crews out there checking the ground doing mop up for a few days yet.” I’ve just been alerted to Scott Morrison addressing the US and Canadian fire fighters at the Sydney RFS headquarters, which was shown on Sunrise (which is why I missed it the first time). He cracked a joke about Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Let’s hope he is talking about Trudeau’s love of a selfie, given the circumstances.: We value the same things, we share the same values, that we will be will all be doing, over this period time – I will be making sure to pass on my personal thanks to prime minister Trudeau and president Trump later today. I’ll get a pic and send it to them – I know Justin like his pictures. (There is laughter.) I’m not teasing him, I promise. We’ve often done that together, when we’ve been together. The Grose Valley fire has been raised to “emergency”. The smoke haze has hit Brisbane. As of 10:30am AEDT, here’s what we know the fire situation is across Australia at the moment. In New South Wales there are five fires at watch and act level: Gospers Mountain fire, Green Wattle Creek, Grose Valley, Kerry Ridge, and Upper Turon Rd, Palmers Oaky. In Victoria there are three fires at watch and act level: Tambo Crossing and Wattle Creek, Ensay and Reedy Flat and Brookville. In South Australia there are still two fires burning at Duncan and Menzies on Kangaroo Island, and a watch and act in place for a fire in Cudlee Creek. The weather conditions are a bit milder than yesterday, and there’s no emergency warnings currently in place, but we will update if that changes over the course of the day. Just before Scott Morrison’s press conference, RFS commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons* gave an update on the NSW fires: We have still got an enormous amount of fire burning in the landscape. Conditions are particularly dry and fire behaviour continues to be very challenging for firefighters and those areas affected by fire. A big focus this week, a significant focus this week, and starting today is the implications now for the entire Blue Mountains community along the Great Western Highway. We effectively got fire now stretching from the Darling Causeway, Lithgow area, in the western areas of the or the upper Blue Mountains, and only four, 4, 5km north of the Great Western Highway spreading all the way down to Currajong Heights, that’s due north Winmalee, Springwood, which is not far the Penrith escarpment and region. We have seen widespread damage and destruction being reported across a number of those fire grounds and we have got impact assessment teams already deployed into the field this morning trying to gain access to those impacted fire grounds to do assessments and undertake surveys in order to identify the extent of damage and the extent of destruction. As we indicated last night, the reports are still indicating that we are expecting another heavy toll, unfortunately, with estimates that property loss could be in the dozens of – of buildings including homes, outbuildings, sheds and businesses. That damage and destruction effectively ranges from places like Lithgow, Clarence, Dargan, Bilpin, all along the Bells Line of Road, we got places down around Balmoral and out towards Buxton and Bargo down on the Green Wattle Creek fire. We have also got down the Currowan fire south, up in the north-west corner of that, the communities of Neriga. There’s a very wide area of impact overnight and those assessments will be undertaken. *apologies for the typo in the original post Anthony Albanese will be up at 1pm. I imagine he wants Scott Morrison’s press conference to sit and marinate for a while, before he adds his two cents, given you know, the prime minister wants us all to be kinder to each other, and leave any division to the side - unless of course, you need to make your own political point. For example: Scott Morrison at the beginning of the press conference: It is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. Scott Morrison half way through the press conference: I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tons less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place if we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don’t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. This ‘debate’ if you can call it that, given Chris Smith seems to have decided his job, now that he is returning to Sydney radio 2GB is just to yell over anyone who has a different view, or you know, the facts, sums up most of the country right now: Angus Taylor has also decided right now is the perfect time to put out a release on electricity prices coming down: Residential electricity bills are coming down according to the latest Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) Inquiry into the National Electricity Market report. The November 2019 report found: a reduction in the average residential electricity retail price across the National Electricity Market (NEM) from FY2017-18 to 2018-19 of approximately 3 per cent, average annual residential electricity bills across the NEM have decreased by $65, or approximately 4 per cent, the most recent annual reduction in household bills of $65 is part of a longer-term trend that has seen bills fall by $209 in real terms since 2013-14, and average household bills across the NEM are at their lowest since 2013-14. (Which we knew they would, because a butt load of renewables have come onto the grid, which was anticipated for quite some time) So to quickly recap that press conference: Scott Morrison defended leaving the country to take a holiday (which he said he planned six weeks ago), having “made a promise to my kids” but said in hindsight, he would have made a different decision. (Morrison was due to return to work, as scheduled, tomorrow, December 23, according to what his office told the New Daily’s Samantha Maiden last week). I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it, but as prime minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. He has “learnt lessons” including about how his office dealt with the media: I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. After pointing back to the one comment he made in February linking climate change to worsening disasters “among other factors” for the majority of this (early) bushfire season, Morrison made an explicit point of joining the dots There is no argument, in my view, or the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world – but I’m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. But there will be NO change to Australia’s emissions reduction policy under his government. People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Morrison also believes the time to talk about his holiday is in the past, and the time to talk about climate change is not now. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. ... Australians know we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let’s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of protecting people’s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. On whether he believes he has shown leadership, Scott Morrison says: This has been going on for a long time, since September, and on each occasion I have been here, whether it is in Taree or out at Wilberforce a couple of weeks ago. Not on all occasions have I gone and been there with a travelling media team. I have been there on occasions just in a low-key way, talking to those in incident control rooms, and it would seem that whether it is myself or others there will always be criticism made but what I have confidence in and have always had confidence in is in the fair mindedness of the Australian people. As I said for I take responsibility for my own decisions and I take responsibility for those I made in relation to my family and, more broadly, in terms of my leadership responsibility for the nation and that is why I am here. On Labor’s proposal for tax breaks for volunteer firefighters who are unable to work while they deal with the bushfire emergency: Q: Labor wants compensation for volunteer firefighters. Is that something you are considering? Scott Morrison: I don’t know what the specific proposal being proposed … I will take that where it is. But these are things that the government has been considering, in the first instance these are matters for state governments. The RFS and the fire services around Australia are run by state governments so it is not for the commonwealth to step in and make decisions. But these are things that I think can be contemplated. But I very much want to do that in consultation with state and territory governments. As I said to the commissioner today, whatever they need, whatever they think they need to bolster support, sustain the operations that they are running, they simply need to ask. And they will get that support. I think there are immediate issues that need to be addressed there with the rural firefighters, particularly as they get into areas of terrible fatigue now. ... They have been fighting fires for a while now and they are still going. Thankfully, as I was briefed this morning, those parts of the state are more under today than they were when I was there not that long ago. But these are the many issues that I think we need to understand. Let’s not forget, there are 210,000 rural firefighters around the country, and there are thousands of surf-lifesavers who will be patrolling our beaches, those who are volunteering on meals on wheels and carers and others. Australia is a magnificent country because it does have that volunteer spirit. And Australia relies on them and they should be celebrated and we do so. And where there are ways that we can further support that volunteer effort, we are very open to considering this. Let me say one thing, all our firefighters are professionals. They are all professional at what they do. They are well-trained and they are very good at what they do. One of the things we focused on this morning was ensuring how we can better supplement the clearing work and the other things that need to be done in those areas that have been ravaged by fires and ensure that we can get even more prompt defence support into those arrangements. There has been defence liaisons in these … there has been in Queensland other places, and I am sure we can get some … at local level as well through the state government. The defence forces being deployed in those, defence force members who are firefighters, are out there fighting fires, just like any other employee would be. They are not in their platoons, they are in their brigades. Scott Morrison on why the government is not considering changing its climate change policy: The Kyoto targets set by the previous Labor government, when we came to government, there was the projection that we would miss those by some 700 million tonnes. Now we’re going to beat them … And I would hope that not only will we meet, and I’m sure we will, our Paris commitments, that we will beat them as well. And there is a long time between now and 2030 and we will continue to refine our policies because we’re about taking action. But what we will not do is act in a knee-jerk or crisis or panicked mode. A panic approach and response to anything does not help. It puts people at risk. Not just their livelihood but if you walk out there into the control room you will not see people panicking, you will see people be very professional, very focused on the job they have, talking to each other in a very professional way and getting the job done. Government is the same thing. Whether it is taking action on climate change or ensuring that, as the midyear economic statement shows, that the government is on track to achieve a surplus or the further job creation that is all over the last week. Over 100,000 jobs created since last election. You get these results by being calm and by being stable. And having clear goals and having the policies in place to achieve them. Whether that is on taking action on climate change or job creation or ensuring that we get the welfare system targeted to support those who need it most or dealing with the environmental challenges of waste management and plastics and any of these issues, mental health issues, the government is addressing them. On all these issues the government has clear plans and a clear approach to deal with them and is doing it in a very patient and in a very applied and professional way. We get back to climate policy – there will be NO change. Q: The government has been criticised for using carryover credits. Going forward after these fires, how can your government provide a more genuine commitment to making Australia a responsible global actor when it comes to reducing carbon emissions? Scott Morrison: People can expect my government to do what it promised to do, what it took to the last election. I know there are some who tried to make political points and score points over these issues in the midst of these disasters and that is disappointing. I will do what I said I would do because that is how I am with the Australian people. I said we will meet our 26% emission reduction target. Emissions under this government are on average 50 million tonnes less than they were under the previous government. Emissions have fallen over the last two years. Emissions are lower than at any time they were under the previous government. We have had record investment in renewables in Australia and now, thankfully, as a result of policies the government has put in place we are also getting electricity prices down, some $65 a year. And on top of that we are doing it without embracing the reckless job destroying and economy crunching targets that others are seeking to force upon us. I don’t think that is a balanced approach. We will take a responsible approach to taking action on climate change. We are taking action and we will continue to take action. We are part of a global action on the commitments we have made, we are meeting. We are meeting and we are beating. So I do not accept the suggestion that Australia is not carrying its weight. We are carrying our weight. We are meeting and beating our target and there are very few countries who can say that. Q: You said you have learned some lessons from this past week. What are they? Morrison: I think I have already outlined that in my earlier remarks. Question: You were critical of the Victorian police commissioner when she went to dinner during the Black Saturday bushfires. Scott Morrison: I have already made a number of comments today, as you know, where I think I have held myself to that same standard. Equally I would note that I am not the operational leader of an emergency service or police force. I am the prime minister. And as prime minister I was kept regularly and sought to be kept regularly updated on the events. The acting prime minister was in full control of what was it occurring ably supported by Minister Littleproud. The premier was leading, obviously the governments of the operational response here in New South Wales, and I have been in contact with the premier [regularly] on these arrangements …were in place to ensure that I could continue to do and fulfil my responsibilities, but I understand and the reason I have returned is out of a deep respect and sympathy for those Australians who were tragically killed a few nights ago. That demanded my attendance here, I believe, out of simply respect and sympathy for them and what they were going through and that is why I have been pleased to return. That is a decision that Jenny [and I made] and we told the kids about it and Australians are fair-minded. They know at the end of a difficult year people go on leave and they know that when a dad makes a promise to the kids they like to keep it. And events late last week are not where they were today so I think it would be unfair to say the events in very recent days were the same as a week or so ago. Nevertheless, I understand the anxiety and my people have been upset at this and that is why I am pleased to be back. This is not exactly a glowing defence of the deputy prime minister. Q: Why were questions referred to your office; why couldn’t McCormack simply say he was acting? Morrison: These are not the matters I am focused on now, I will leave those matters for others. Australians are worried about the fires and the support necessary to support those out there today. I understand there is media interest in the engagement of briefings between my office and the gallery and those sorts of things, I get that. There have been lessons learned this week and they will be imported and included next time. Question: But you knew about these catastrophic fire conditions. Are you sorry to the residents? Morrison: I already said that. I already said it. Q: Do you believe that the release of the information about this was handled poorly and the public needed to know? Morrison: The deputy minister was the acting prime minister and each time I have taken private family leave as prime minister I followed exactly the same process. There was no change. On my earlier leaves no statement was issued. I took private family leave and no objections were raised by the press on those occasions but it is something we will rectify. (No one knew he was leaving the country). Question: Where have you been and why the secrecy? Scott Morrison: I was in Hawaii, a trip with my family, a trip planned seven weeks ago and when I take family leave, it is a private family time. And then the prime minister asks us to all be kind to each other: Let me finish by saying this, and I apologise for the lengthy nature of my remarks this morning, it is time to be kind to each other. This is not a time for division, it is not a time for argument, it is not a time for partisanship, not a time for point scoring. It is a time to support people who have an important job to do, to give them the space and time, to give them the support they need. If people have something they want to contribute, that is fantastic and I want to thank all those who turned up to fire stations and made donations and you may want to think of dropping off some toys for the children of the firefighters who may not have had time to go out and buy some this Christmas because they have been too busy. These are things that people can do constructively. Australians, we need to rally together. The time for argument is not now. It is not to say there is no time to talk about climate change, of course there is and we are talking about it. But let’s do it in a way that does not distract from the very immediate need of detecting people’s lives, protecting their property, honouring those who are out there doing everything they can. And so I simply ask people, particularly this Christmas time, to reflect on that, to come together to support each other and to focus on the things we need to do now and on the other side of these fires, Australia will prevail. We always will. Australia is the most amazing country on earth. How do I know that? Because I see what is happening out there right now on those fire front and in the communities that have suffered terrible loss. That is why Australia is the best country in the world and that is the country I am proud to lead. know we all support in the cause which we all rally now and focus on supporting efforts of Australians. Scott Morrison says he believes Australians are “fair minded” and will understand why he took his holiday. Two other points. I have returned from leave and I know that has caused some great anxiety in Australia and Jenny and I acknowledge that. If we had your time over again and the benefit of hindsight we would have made different decisions. I am sure Australians are fair-minded and understand that when you make a promise to your children you try and keep it that as Prime Minister you have other responsibilities and I accept that and I accept the criticism and that is why Jenny and I agreed it was important that I returned, particularly after the tragedies we saw late this week. I get it that people would have been upset to know that I was holidaying with my family while their families were under great stress. They know that I will not stand there and hold a hose. I am not a trained firefighter nor am I an expert like those in the next room doing an amazing job. But I am comforted by the fact that Australians would like me to be here simply so I can be here alongside them as they go through this terrible time. And so to those Australians who had [cause for upset] and I apologise for that. I think it is important when you confronted with these things you front up and are honest with people and that is what I am seeking to do now. The time for that discussion is over. We need to focus on what is going out there today. And then we move on to power prices: We must take action on climate change and we are taking action on climate change. At the last election I said we would, I said we would meet and beat our Kyoto targets, I said we would meet our Paris commitments at a canter and we will. We welcome the record investment in renewable energy technologies and at the same time we welcome the fact we pursue our climate policies while getting electricity prices down as the ACCC noted today with a $65 reduction as a direct result of the policies in place to get power bills under control in this country. And we will do it without destroying the economy or jobs. We will do it with sensible target to get the balance right. That is what I promised Australians when we went to the last election and that is what I am committed to doing. We are not going to beat our Paris target “in a canter”. Emissions are still rising in Australia and have every year since 2014, when the carbon charge was scrapped by the Coalition. Scott Morrison on the climate change link debate: I appreciate that when things get as anxious as they have become, then people will think, you know, what’s been prepared? Is anything happens? Or have they thought of this? I understand that those anxieties are positively meant and are natural. But I want to reassure you that this- our officials, our commissioners, our firefighters, both those professionals who are paid and those who are unpaid, they are doing this year-round to prepare for events just like this. And that is why this response is something where we’re seeing the best of Australia, not the contrary. Flowing on from that public anxiety, there is also been other issues that have been raised, not just about the response and the resources which I think I have addressed, but also around issues of climate policy. It is also been the case - our Government has always and I have always acknowledged the connection between these weather events and these broader fire events and the impacts globally of climate change. It’s one of many factors as I have said. The drought conditions have certainly been a big contributor in terms of the dryness of the fuel load. There are also many other issues as you would be well aware and they’ll all come under scrutiny as we prepare for what needs to happen next time - issues of management in national parks of fuel loads, issues of back-burning and managing native vegetation and building codes and all of these sorts of things, ensuring our communications programs are important. I mean, there are some fires that have been started by just carelessness. Others sadly have been the result of direct arson. Many have been created by dry lightning strikes. And understanding all of that it will be important as we move through to the next phase. There is no argument, in my view on the view of the government, and any government in the country, about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world but I’m sure people would equally acknowledge the direct connection to any single fire event is not a credible suggestion to make that link. He moves on to the anxiety he says he sees the community dealing with: In talking to the Commissioner, I want to acknowledge what he has acknowledged - and that is as we face these fires at the moment, I want to assure Australians of this because I know people are anxious and I know people in some places are rightly fearful of what is literally at their door, and the haze and the smoke and all of these things heighten that anxiety as you think about your kids and your family and your can see the red tinge at night if you’re close enough, but our fire services in Australia are the best in the world. The response to these disasters, these fires, is the best in the world. This is a time when Australia should be very, very proud that we have the best-resourced, most-coordinated, best-equipped fire services of any nation on earth to deal with this. And that’s because as a country, we’re used to dealing with fires - admittedly and very rightly this season is much more lengthened and started a lot earlier and there isn’t the respite rains that we can expect any time soon and that is making this season harder than we have seen in a long time. But it is also true that after every fire, we sit down, we learn the lessons and we make sure we’re better prepared next time and that’s what’s happened on this occasion. The coordination is seamless between not only the states and the Commonwealth, but between the states and overseas jurisdictions as well. Our defence forces are deploying wherever they’re called upon and particularly now as you look at the burnt-out vast territories across particularly here in New South Wales, but in other states as well, there is wreckage to clear, there are trees to remove, there is access that needs to be provided to people’s properties and businesses and homes, and that’s the work that our defence forces can, are and will continue to play and they have been doing it since September - airlifting, ensuring they’re providing night flights for recognisance, and providing that heavy support that is backing in and complementing the amazing work of our firefighters. There’s some 70,000 firefighters here in New South Wales alone. That’s bigger than the entire of our defence forces and reserves. So we’re talking about an enormous force that has drawn together here in New South Wales and that’s about a third of the national force. So they will continue to get everything that they need and I have run through some matters this morning with the Commissioner and I have been speaking to the Premier as well - there will be a COAG meeting in March and at that meeting, as always, I have already put on the agenda the response capabilities for future disasters and lessons, of course, will be learned by these responses but I do know the response you’re seeing right now is informed by how this work has gone on each and everyday since the last fire. I mean, emergency management Australia which is the Commonwealth agency responsible for our engagement, both in drawing in the ADF and the other systems of support, including the important income support, later today I’ll be announcing with the Premier further disaster assistance payments into new areas of affected areas as three payments have been rolling out. Scott Morrison moves into addressing the issues which have exploded since he left on his holiday: There are over 100 fires active in New South Wales today and many of those are quite serious, but I do remind people that there are also severe fires in South Australia and in Victoria. I spoke to the South Australian Premier last night when I arrived back in Australia to get an update and there’s been loss of life there and there are fears for others. We have heard further news this morning of people missing, an individual missing out in Lithgow where the fires also have raged overnight. No-one wants to be out there fighting these fires, no-one wants these fires to be happening at this time. But when those fires do occur, as they have for a very long time in this country, then those who have - there’s over 200,000 of them in Australia - who have signed up and put their hand up to be there to defend their communities, then they go out and they do this work and they do it on behalf of all of us and they’re getting tired and they’re getting fatigued because this has been going for a very long time and this is one of the key issues I have been in discussion with the Commissioner about thismorning and also with the Premier and I know that Minister Littleproud, who joins me here and I thank him for that, David, and the work you have been doing, and the Deputy Prime Minister during my absence, we will continue to look at all of these issues as we go forward. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service and all the fire services across Australia will continue to get everything they need from the Commonwealth. As you know, the operational response to these disasters is delivered and is run at a state level, but with great Commonwealth support. Scott Morrison continues: A few months ago I was up in Canungra when the first of these dreadful fires started to appear. ...When we got out to Wilberforce just a few weeks ago up in Queensland and here we are again today following the terrible tragedy that occurred earlier this week. Andrew O’Dwyer and Geoffrey Keaton. Their families, Lisa and their little daughter Charlotte, 19 months. Jessica and their 19-month-old son, Harvey. When our volunteers go out there, they do it for so many reasons, but I can’t help but thinking that one of the most important things that inspires them is their love of family - family is community and they’re out there defending their community on that fateful night. And Jenny and I my heart broke when he heard of their terrible loss and their great sacrifice and I just want to extend to them our great sympathies, our love and support. They’re getting tremendous support from their Rural Fire Service family out there at Horsley Park and from the broader families of the firefighting communities around the country. What we, the rest of us, can offer them is our honour, our acknowledgment, and our respect for what they have done for all of us. Scott Morrison: ...Men and women who are out there today here in New South Wales who were out there yesterday, the thousands of men and women around Australia, not just here in New South Wales, up in Queensland, down in South Australia where it’s also been a difficult week, down in Victoria, all those that have come from other states - Tassie, the west, the ACT, up in the Territory. I want to thank those who have come from overseas - the Americans, the Canadians, our Kiwi cousins, those who have come to support us in this hour of need. I particularly want to thank Commissioner Fitzsimmons and the amazing team he leads here in New South Wales and for the opportunity to be briefed this morning. I want to commend the Premier, who I have been speaking to over the course of the last week, and for the tremendous job she’s been doing with her team here in New South Wales to respond to this disaster, this threat, that is ongoing and has been going for many, many months now. The prime minster is now addressing the media. If you can, you should watch this with the sound on. The firefighters all remain so calm, despite what they are facing. The “got this” at the end just sums up everything about how our volunteers are handling this. The prime minister will head to Picton after the Sydney RFS briefing, to meet with evacuees. Here is what the government has spent: Australia’s aerial firefighting force has been given an $11m funding injection from the Morrison government amid growing concern about the resourcing of firefighters combating the bushfire crisis. On Thursday the federal government announced it would nearly double the commonwealth’s annual contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre, which coordinated the 140 aircraft used to battle fires across Australia. “In response to the request from our national fire chiefs we’re backing our firefighters and our water-bombing fleet with an extra $11m boost,” the prime minister, Scott Morrison said in a statement. “That’s on top of the $15m we already deliver each year for aerial firefighting to tackle what has already been a devastating fire season.” There is a lot of commentary over how prepared Australia was for this bushfire season. The fire authorities said they did all the preparations they could - including hazard reduction burns, but the group of former fire chiefs who came to prominence at the beginning of this season (which started early) said they wanted to talk about how to prepare for this new normal. Paul Karp has found Labor’s bushfire policy from the election, given this debate. The bushfire season in Australia is lengthening and already overlapping with the northern hemisphere, increasing the risk that we won’t be able to access the aircraft we need at times of peril. At the same time, the Federal Government’s contribution to the National Aerial Firefighting Centre has plummeted from 50 per cent of funding to just 23 per cent, reducing our overall firefighting capability. The Bureau of Meteorology has identified this summer as Australia’s hottest on record, which included devastating bushfires in Victoria and Tasmania. Now is the time to invest in giving our firefighters the resources they need to keep us all safe. Labor’s national firefighting package will deliver: $80 million to establish the National Aerial Bushfire Fighting Fleet of aircraft It will include retro-fitted Black Hawk helicopters as they are phased out from active use by the Australian Army and Erickson S-64 Air-crane helicopters (or ‘Elvis’ as they are commonly known) which has a 2,650 gallon tank capable of snorkelling or scooping fresh or salt water. It’s expected that the national fleet will include a standing capability of up to six Large or Very Large Air Tankers, and up to 12 heavy rotary wing helicopters. Australia’s first ‘smokejumper’ units Smokejumpers are firefighters trained to be rapidly deployed by helicopters at remote fires during the short window during which those fires can be contained. Smokejumpers usually rappel from helicopters and use chain-saws, hoes and other dry firefighting tools to establish a containment perimeter around the fire. They then patrol the perimeter to ensure the fire does not jump containment lines while working with water-bombing aircraft to ensure the contained fire is fully extinguished. $21 million for the National Aerial Firefighting Centre (NAFC) A Shorten Labor Government will stop the Federal Government’s reduction in funding for our firefighting capabilities by returning to a 50-50 funding split between the states and territories and the Commonwealth. Scott Morrison’s return to Australia last night has brought him back on deck a day before he was scheduled back to work - the PMO told reporters, including Samantha Maiden, that Morrison would be back to work on Monday, late last week At least one person died in the Adelaide Hills fire which blazed last night, with another reported missing. More than 50 people have been injured - including 23 firefighters and two police officers. At least 15 homes have been destroyed, with about 30 other structures having also been consumed by the fire. But with residents only returning to take stock of the damage today, the number of structures destroyed is expected to rise. The government has announced the disaster recovery payment has been extended to South Australia. Claims will be open from Monday 23 December 2019. For more information or to make a claim visit www.humanservices.gov.au/disaster or call 180 22 66. Scott Morrison has not yet addressed the media - but here is what he had to say to the RFS at Sydney headquarters. Mike Bowers was at the Green Wattle Creek fire last night. Here is some of what he saw Good morning. It is another day of watch and wait as fire fighters across the east coast and south Australia keep a very, very close eye on what Emergency-level fires have swept across parts of New South Wales and South Australia, and the death toll and number of injured firefighters has risen, as the country’s severe heatwave and bushfire crisis continued on Saturday. Two people were confirmed dead in South Australia, and homes were destroyed and communities evacuated in what authorities described as “an awful day” in which fires raged across three states, even creating their own thunderstorms in some parts of NSW. At Lithgow, about two hours’ drive west of Sydney, residents were forced to flee as fires threatened the community of more than 10,000 people and destroyed several homes on the outskirts of the town. At 7pm, a person was reported unaccounted for in the Dargen area, near Lithgow, the ABC reported. Four firefighters in NSW were treated for heat exhaustion on Saturday, the ambulance service said, while another firefighter was reportedly injured after being struck by a truck in Richmond. Scott Morrison has returned to Australia - he flew in late last night. He is starting the day with a briefing with the New South Wales rural fire service headquarters in Sydney. AAP have the morning update: An elderly man whose home was consumed by flames remains missing and dozens of properties have been damaged or destroyed by bushfires which raged during heatwave NSW conditions on Saturday. Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons described the day as “awful” for firefighters, with up to 20 homes lost to the immense Gospers Mountain fire northwest of Sydney alone. At least two more properties were razed near Batemans Bay on the south coast, and others at Balmoral southwest of Sydney. Southerly winds moving upstate on Saturday evening fanned flames in new directions and caused erratic fire behaviour, before creating cooler conditions for the 3000 firefighting and emergency personnel in the field. A fire-generated thunderstorm also formed over fires in the Shoalhaven. With forecasts predicting close to a week of advantageous conditions across NSW, Mr Fitzsimmons said his crews would ‘make hay’. Tougher conditions would likely return later in the week or next weekend. Two total fire bans will nevertheless be in place on Sunday in the Northern Slopes and North Western regions, under “very high” fire danger. “Our big focus is on trying to consolidate and establish containment lines across as many fire grounds as we can. We have significant fire spread south of the Bells Line of Road and through the valley system such as the Grose Valley in the Blue Mountains,” Mr Fitzsimmons told reporters. “So we will be looking at what are the options, what are the fall-back lines and at what point do we start implementing very significant strategies to secure protection for an impending threat to the Blue Mountains, particularly the communities along the Great Western Highway.”"

          "headline": "Young Labour members point to shift away from Corbynism",
          "bodyText": "As Labour heads into another leadership contest, it will be the votes of the party’s 550,000 members that will matter most in the end. They will have the final say after a 12-week contest that will start next month. Since 2015, the membership has been strongly supportive of Jeremy Corbyn, and he won thumping majorities in 2015 and 2016 thanks largely to them. But after the recent catastrophic election defeat, Labour’s fourth in a row, are some losing patience? Do they want more Corbynism, or is the brand now tainted by failure? Shannon Jezzard, a 24-year-old Labour councillor in Harlow, Essex, is a member of the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement Momentum. She voted for Corbyn in the past two leadership elections. “I really liked his consistent voting record – opposing cuts and austerity – and felt like he was always on the right side of history, especially when it came to the Iraq war,” she says. Jezzard would like to see more Corbynism in the form of Rebecca Long Bailey, a long-term ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, as the next leader. “I think she’s a great candidate –she has good politics, but without the baggage of longer-standing MPs, and is genuinely likeable. I think it’d be good to get out of the London bubble and see someone lead the party from up north.” Backing Long Bailey for leader over Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry or Lisa Nandy might seem the obvious choice for Labour members who have previously supported Corbyn. The shadow business secretary has strong links with the union movement, whose endorsement will also be important in the forthcoming contest. However, other young members disagree. Jonny Lawrence, 25, a PhD student, backed Corbyn in the last two leadership contests but encountered hostility towards him in the general election campaign. “I canvassed loads for Anneliese Dodds in Oxford East and the main issue coming up on the doorstep for us was Corbyn as a leader. It was difficult – I lost faith in him myself, to be honest,” he says. Lawrence is now leaning towards Nandy, a candidate who has forged an identity and a message entirely separate from Corbyn and his allies. “I do think she was right on Brexit and how we need to go about rebuilding the party,” he says. “Our focus needs to be, as she has said, on restoring faith in the towns across the UK that Labour can provide a better future for. “In reality, the manifesto’s flagship policies were out of touch and were much more appealing to me and my demographic than the demographic we needed to win.” Alice Gent, 21, says she “strongly aligns to the left of [Labour] and its values”. But she too found Corbyn’s unpopularity with voters to be a strong factor in the election and is not in favour of a “continuity Corbyn” leadership. “Long Bailey as leader and Angela Rayner as deputy would just be a bit of a slap in the face for Labour voters who turned away due to Corbyn. Long-Bailey would just be repeating the mistakes of our biggest defeat since 1935,” she says. Gent spent the campaign knocking on doors in London. “Every door I knocked on Corbyn was the issue, and he must have seen how unpopular he was in polling so I don’t understand the decision not to let someone else lead. I do feel it was arrogant.” She too backs Nandy, the MP for Wigan. “I think we’ve had too many north London Liberal elite-esque leaders and [Nandy] would be a welcome change from this”. Since the beginning of the election campaign, Labour membership has risen by more than 50,000. Georgina Holden, 22, is one of those who has joined up. She left the party in mid-2019 before rejoining shortly after the exit poll was published on election night because she wanted a say over who should take Labour forward. “I wanted to make sure that I get a say in who leads the party out of the abyss. I knew that the membership would most likely vote for the Corbyn continuity candidate, and I wanted to stop that from happening,” she says. “I’m not going to vote for a candidate seen as Corbyn 2.0. The media gives Labour leaders a hard enough time as it is, and we need to combat that. To elect a continuity candidate would be to tell the electorate we’ve learned nothing.” Despite this, Holden liked the policies. It was the messenger not the message that was the problem. “[Labour] needs someone who can bring these leftwing policies forward but who appears sensible,” she said. Phe Hayhurst, a 19-year-old student from Reading, has been a Labour member since 2015. She voted for Corbyn in both leadership elections. But now she’s backing Keir Starmer because, she says, he is “best placed to bring the party back together” and is “not too closely aligned with any faction of the party, and comes across well in public and in the House of Commons”. Francine Mead, a 22-year old working in public affairs, has also been a Labour member since 2015 and previously backed Yvette Cooper (in 2015) and then Jeremy Corbyn (in 2016). For her Starmer also looks the best on offer. “There is no point in a main political party existing under first-past-the-post if it cannot win elections. I’ve wanted Starmer to stand as leader for quite some time now.” “He hasn’t pandered to factions, he doesn’t let himself be defined by individuals – he just does his job with passion and respect.” Since the summer of 2015, a majority of Labour members have been solidly in favour of project Corbyn. Now it seems some believe it is time for change, and that the worst reaction to the election result would be just more of the same."

          "headline": "Donald Trump impeached by House of Representatives in historic vote",
          "bodyText": "Just shy of the third anniversary of his presidency, Donald Trump was impeached in a mostly party-line vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening. Trump became the third president to be impeached. After a full day of debate, the House voted 230-197 to approve a first article of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power, with one “present” vote. A second article, charging Trump with obstruction of Congress, was approved 229-198. Trump now faces a trial in the Senate, where he is expected to be acquitted. Proceedings in the Republican-controlled body are likely to begin next month, but the exact timing remains unclear as Democrats and Republicans negotiate over the terms of the trial. As Wednesday’s vote unfolded, Trump spoke at a campaign rally in Battle Creek, Michigan. “It doesn’t really feel like we’re being impeached,” he said, to cheers. “This lawless partisan impeachment is a political suicide march for the Democrat party.” But Trump’s fierce efforts to seal himself in a bubble of adulation, and his insistence that Republicans pretend away the existence of facts threatening to pierce that bubble, could not divert the historic reality coalescing on Capitol Hill. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, described the proceedings as a “sad day” for the country. “The president’s reckless activities necessitated us having to introduce articles of impeachment,” she said at a press conference following the vote. ‘A republic under threat’ Pelosi had opened the debate on the articles of impeachment just after midday, calling Trump “an ongoing threat to our national security and the integrity of our elections”. Wearing a large pin of the ceremonial mace of the chamber as she rose to speak on the House floor, Pelosi warned that “our founders’ vision of a republic is under threat by actions from the White House”. “It is tragic that the president’s reckless actions make impeachment necessary,” she said. “He gave us no choice.” The speech was met with sustained applause from her caucus. Democrats accuse Trump of pursuing a scheme to cheat in the 2020 election by pressuring Ukraine to manufacture bad news about the former vice-president Joe Biden, one of Trump’s main Democrat rivals, and then blocking congressional oversight. Republican Doug Collins of Georgia, the ranking member on the judiciary committee, said that impeachment had always been an “inevitability” under the Democrats and denied that Trump had committed a crime.In a marathon and at times painfully repetitive partisan volley, members exchanged one- and two-minute blocks of speaking time over about eight hours of debate. Republicans accused Democrats of having a vendetta against Trump and running what they said was a corrupt process, while Democrats taunted Republicans for not even attempting to defend Trump on the merits. “They cannot articulate a real defense of the president’s actions,” said Jerry Nadler, the judiciary committee chair. Trump joined Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998 as the only US presidents to be impeached. Richard Nixon resigned in 1974 before he could be impeached. A two-thirds majority vote in the Republican-controlled Senate would be required to convict and remove Trump from office. With no Republican senators currently voicing support for impeachment, Trump appeared safe to survive. “They’re gonna do the right thing,” Trump said onstage in Michigan. Expected to start in early January, the exact timing of the Senate trial remains unclear as Democrats and Republicans continue to negotiate over the proceedings. Pelosi on Wednesday night declined to commit to a timeline on when the House would send over the articles of impeachment to the Senate – a prerequisite for the trial – or when Democrats would appoint members to present the case against Trump. “We cannot name managers until we see what the process is on the Senate side,” she said. “So far we haven’t seen anything that looks fair to us.” Democrats have questioned the position of the Republican leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell, who said on Tuesday he was “not impartial about this at all”. A Republican party united Zero Republican representatives voted in favor of either article of impeachment, fueling the party’s charges that the proceedings were driven by partisanship. Democrats replied that Republicans were hostage to Trump and unable to deliver a sound judgment in the matter. Two Democrats, including one whose staff said he would soon be switching parties to the Republican side, broke with their party to oppose both articles of impeachment. A third Democrat, Jared Golden of Maine, split his vote. A fourth Democrat, the presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard, voted “present”. The House’s sole independent, former Republican Justin Amash, voted for impeachment. Trump was handed the vote tally onstage during his rally. “We didn’t lose one Republican vote and three Democrats voted for us,” he said to applause. “The Republican party has never been so affronted, but they’ve never been so united as they are right now.” Early in the day, the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, presented a resolution seeking to condemn Adam Schiff, the chair of the intelligence committee, and Nadler for what McCarthy said were abuses of power and violations of procedure. The resolution was tabled without a vote. Schiff, whose committee performed the bulk of the investigative work in the impeachment inquiry, took to the floor just before 4pm to detail the case against Trump. “The president of the United States was willing to sacrifice our national security by withholding support for a critical strategic partner at war in order to improve his re-election prospects,” Schiff said. “But for the courage of someone willing to blow the whistle, he would have gotten away with it. “Instead, he got caught. He tried to cheat and he got caught.” Trump’s event Wednesday night was billed as a Merry Christmas rally in Battle Creek, Michigan, a shrinking food manufacturing center in a county that swung from supporting Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Trump in 2016. • This article was amended on 20 December 2019. A Nancy Pelosi reference to “our founder’s vision” was changed to “our founders’ vision”."

          "bodyText": "The resurgence of rail First the Scandinavians gave us hygge, then they gave us flygskam (flight shame), which has nothing to do with candles and everything to do with guilt about the environmental cost of flying. If the noughties were all about a giddy sense of the world opening up thanks to the rise of low-cost flights and online booking tools, the subsequent decade has started to feel like payback time, as we begin to reckon with the cost of our globetrotting ways. A 2019 YouGov report showed levels of concern about the environment at a record high. As the climate change crisis becomes more acute and the cost of overtourism bleakly apparent from Venice to Machu Picchu, there’s a growing sense that we need to rethink not just where we travel but how we travel, too. Tour operators that offer rail-based holidays are reporting record enquiries. Ffestiniog Travel, which specialises in tailormade and escorted rail tours, has seen a 30% increase in bookings since 2017. And after years of declining sales, the Interrail pass – that rite of passage for generations of young travellers – has started to see a turnaround, with sales of 300,000 in 2018, almost three times the figure for 2005. After years of cuts to European sleeper services, there are signs that the tide may be beginning to turn here, too. Next month, a new Nightjet service will launch between Vienna and Brussels, while Swiss Federal Railways is also looking into reintroducing its Wagon-Lits overnight services after they were cancelled in 2009. Sleeper trains from Amsterdam to other European capitals could also be in the offing. Could this be the start of a new golden era of rail travel? It’s too soon to say, but there are signs that our love affair with low-cost flying is cooling. And when you smugly book a rail trip and feel a sudden urge to tell your friends, remember the Swedes have a word for that too – tagskryt (train bragging). Peer-to-peer travel It’s estimated that, on any given night, 2 million people are staying in an Airbnb rental. But 10 years ago Airbnb was just another San Francisco start-up looking for investors. The three founders had come up with the idea to make some extra cash by renting out an airbed on their living room floor. The idea quickly inflated to become a global travel empire that today has more than 7 million listings in 191 countries. The company’s slogan, “Belong Anywhere”, tapped into a desire for a more authentic and intimate experience than traditional hotels could offer. You could hang out with your host, get insider tips on bars and restaurants, and shop at the neighbourhood deli like a local. In 2016, Airbnb further capitalised on this wish to go beyond the tourist traps by launching its own range of “Experiences” with local guides, offering everything from bar crawls in Barcelona to pasta-making lessons with Italian grandmas. The success of Airbnb has inspired dozens of imitators, with peer-to-peer equivalents for every travel need, whether it be camping (campspace.com), yacht sharing (borrowaboat.com) or currency exchange (weswap.com). Inevitably, with such rapid growth came some snags: stories of dodgy hosts, dodgy guests, inferior accommodation, last-minute cancellations and fake reviews. There has also been growing unease about the impact Airbnb has had on rents in cities such as Barcelona, with landlords able to make more money from short-term guests than long-term rentals. But despite critics’ complaints that Airbnb is changing the nature of the very neighbourhoods it aims to celebrate, there are no signs that the bubble is about to burst. The company, now valued at more than $35bn, recently acquired a hotel booking system and app and a luxury holiday rental company, and has announced that it’s about to start selling adventure holidays, too. It’s a long way from a blow-up mattress. #Hashtag holidays One of the most popular “experiences” Airbnb sells is the “Instagram photo walk”, where a local influencer or photographer will snap tourists in front of various landmarks and offer tips on how to capture the perfect social media shots. That such tours exist is testament to the power of the photo-sharing platform, which launched in 2010, ushering in a decade of bad selfies and Insta-sunsets. In a recent WeSwap survey of 2,000 18-34-year-olds, 37% of respondents said their choice of holiday destination was influenced by social media, and 31% said that posting holiday snaps online was just as important as the holiday itself. While it’s true that a picture can be worth a thousand words, it can also inspire tens of thousands of Instagrammers to try to capture the exact same image. Tales abound of bloggers queuing along the narrow cobbled streets of Santorini to replicate an iconic shot of Oia’s blue-domed church, and brawling at Rome’s Trevi fountain as tourists jostle for the perfect selfie. As well as influencing our choice of destination, the rise of image-sharing platforms has started to have an impact on the way those destinations look. Hotel designers are now briefed to include Insta-friendly features, whether it be an eye-catching mural or a hot tub with a view. Cavo Tagoo, a luxury boutique hotel on Mykonos, Greece, is an example of what happens when that’s done well. Its infinity pool with colour-changing lights, aquarium bar, minimalist white decor and sunset views is irresistibly photogenic and has helped it to become the most followed hotel on Instagram this year. Camping to glamping According to Google Trends, the word glamping first appeared as a search term in 2007, but the trend for posh camping really took off in the past decade. By 2016 it had earned an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. The first glampsites comprised a smattering of tipis or yurts in a field – essentially, camping holidays for people who didn’t want to put up their own tents – but intensifying competition has upped the ante. In recent years anything from retired ambulances to old shipping containers have been pressed into service, and the quest for novelty reached new heights, literally, in 2017, when glamping specialist Canopy and Stars suspended a cabin from a cargo crane above Bristol harbour. The company, which launched in 2010 and now offers 700 places to stay, says it has seen a 30% increase in bookings for next year, with treehouses the most popular option. The trend is showing no signs of slowing down, as more of us look to switch off from digital devices and reconnect to nature, if only for a weekend. Research carried out by Pinterest on the most popular search terms this year showed that one of the biggest leaps was for “bushcraft camping”, which jumped by more than 1000% year on year. The wellness revolution Earlier this year, the legendary Ibiza party hotel Pikes – whose swimming pool was the backdrop for Wham’s Club Tropicana video back in 1983 – announced that it would be running its first spring fitness retreat, the three-night Rockovery, in May. It was a seminal moment – proof that “wellness” had indeed become the new rock’n’roll. The island’s decision to reinvent itself as a holistic holiday destination was a shrewd one. Wellness tourism is big business, and growing faster than any other sector of the travel industry. Once the preserve of dedicated health resorts and retreats, it has gone mainstream, from fitness bootcamps in the Algarve to mindful skiing in the Alps. Perhaps one of the biggest shifts has been “wellness” moving out of the hotel basement and into the great outdoors. Where once a spa break meant shuffling in white towelling slippers between hot tub, sauna and massage table, now it’s all about reconnecting with nature and enjoying mindful exercise. Forest bathing, stargazing and wood-fired hot tubs are replacing gyms and infinity pools as selling points. The Finn Lough resort near Enniskillen in County Fermanagh is a good example of the new breed of low-key holistic retreats: here guests follow a trail through the grounds, stopping off at a lakeside hot tub, an aromatherapy sauna or a woodland shower. The desire to escape our sedentary, switched-on lives is also driving the growth of fitness and wellbeing festivals, such as the Big Retreat in Pembrokeshire, which, as well as yoga, Pilates and circuit training, offers cookery classes, tai chi and wild swimming. With Google Trends reporting that searches for “wellness retreats” have increased by 182%, this isn’t a fad that’s going away any time soon. Experiential holidays Experiences are the new luxury. Rather than splashing their cash on designer goods, people with disposable income are choosing to spend it on “transformational experiences”. Whether it’s learning to cook with immigrants from Asia, Europe and South America in their New York City homes or joining a reforestation programme in the Amazon, travellers are looking for more meaningful interactions with locals and for immersive experiences that go beyond ticking off the usual sightseeing spots. Tour operators are catching on to the trend. Scott Dunn recently launched its own “experiential” portfolio, offering a range of personalised activities, from perfume-making workshops in Paris to taiko drumming lessons in Tokyo. Hoteliers are also starting to respond to these consumer shifts. It’s no longer enough to offer a comfortable bed, a decent breakfast and an eye-catching design; the new breed of “lifestyle” hotels are courting their guests with the promise of immersion into a neighbourhood, a chance to mingle with locals and a menu of enriching activities. The Whitworth Locke, which opened last year in a former cotton mill near Manchester’s Canal Street, is a perfect example of this new hybrid of accommodation and culture hub. Before guests have even picked up their room key, they’re plunged into a world of exciting possibilities. Free yoga class? Painting workshop? Browsing the homewares and houseplants for sale in the lobby? Dining on Mexican street food in the pop-up restaurant? With a new emphasis on informality and authenticity, it appears that traditional tourism providers, be they hotel chains or tour operators, are finally starting to learn from the successes of their peer-to-peer rivals and, in doing so, creating a new template for tourism. If they’re going to survive the next decade, it’s a lesson they’ll need to score full marks in. Looking for a holiday with a difference? Browse Guardian Holidays to see a range of fantastic trips"

          "bodyText": "Can I tell you what drove me nuts about preschool? The tyre swing was flabby. Our teacher would wash our peaches with dish soap. The toilets were so low to the ground that when I peed, my knees touched the floor. The guinea pig’s hair was coarse as if caked with dried gel. And sometimes, this music lady would come and squat behind the bookshelves, waiting to make her entrance. Our teacher would say: “Guess who’s here?” I was four, but I was not blind. She emerged, we clapped, blew on these little recorders. But here’s the highlight. The pocket lady. We met her in the playground every Friday. The skin on her chest was wrinkled like soft crepe. Her hat blocked out the sun. She wore a long chequered skirt, gridded with pockets, maroon and orange and midnight blue, with a red frill along the bottom. Each pocket contained a small toy or treat. We each got to pick one. I lingered in the back of the crowd, trying to spot which pocket had a bulge that would promise a ball of bubble gum. Sometimes she would rest, sitting on the lip of the slide, sand pooling in the folds of her skirt. Only then would her pockets crease slightly open so you could peek inside. But then she’d stand, spin in a circle, and hard as I tried, I’d lose track of the squares again. Do you want to know the first thing I got? A plastic spider ring, skinny and useless, no substance, no plump thorax even. I watched kids carry off toy soldiers, packets of snow-pea seeds, gold chocolate coins. As I’ve grown older, I’ve been dealt some terrible hands, have reached in to be met with something that bit me or disappointed me greatly. Sometimes I’ve wondered how many times I will dunk my hand in and come out with the same thing. Sometimes the pocket is empty. At my lowest moments, I worry all pockets have been sewn shut. Then I remember these are the pockets of infinite possibility. I imagine pulling out a crayon, for the children’s books I will write. Ginger root, to brew when a sick loved one needs healing. A match, for those who feel numb and in need of warming. It doesn’t matter if you’re dealt a bad hand because each Friday you will find the pocket lady standing in the sand. Life’s skirt is long. We can always reach in again. • Know My Name by Chanel Miller is published by Viking (£16.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Free UK p&amp;p over £15"

          "bodyText": "Falling levels of trust in our public institutions have become the backing track for the demise of the progressive political project and the rise of populist strongmen who promise to take back control. Government becomes a problem to be solved, a “bubble”, a “swamp” of compromised technocrats and bean-counters operating against the interests of hard-working common folk, the “quiet Australians” whose will for a simple life is constantly being frustrated. One of the drivers of this collapse has been the impact of technological change on our body politic, the anger-driven echo chambers of social media, the fake news and disinformation, the increasingly sophisticated targeting designed to reinforce what we already think. Numerous benchmark surveys, including Essential’s own, document this decline, which tracks closely the destruction in traditional media models at the expense of these platforms. But as two reports released in the past week show, when it comes to thinking through the impacts of technology on the future, government leadership is more important than ever. The first, the government’s response to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s digital platforms review, is to the point. On one level the report, initiated as part of the deal to water down the media ownership laws that saw the Nine takeover of Fairfax, is an attempt by media giants to restore the natural order. But somewhere along the way the ACCC inquiry became more than that. Someone inside the agency seriously put their minds around the existential challenges of Facebook and Google, setting out a detailed framework that would have ended the conceit the social networks did not carry responsibility as publishers. While limited in scope to exploring the market dominance of the platforms as opposed to the broader social consequences of technological change, the inquiry positioned Australia as a world leader in grappling with the market power of big tech. The government’s response this week may fall short of realising the ACCC’s ambition of enforceable standards, opting instead for the sort of voluntary codes that any industry lobbyist yearns, but the intent from the prime minister in launching the report is clear: “The rules that exist in the real world need to exist in the digital world.” You can quibble with the ambition, and we have, but when a conservative government invests behind the ACCC to build its capacity to monitor the market operations of the platforms and get to the bottom of their algorithmic marketing model, something interesting is going on. The second report is, if anything, even more ambitious in its vision of governments’ need to lead us through profound technological change. The Human Rights Commission discussion paper into AI technology calls for the establishment of rules around the way automated decisions and data-matching develop in Australia. The report calls for all AI to be subject to scrutiny around its design and impact on users before it is unleashed on to the public, ensuring it complies with existing laws covering both direct and indirect discrimination. Commissioner Ed Santow argues that human accountability cannot be automated and that facial recognition technology in particular needs to be tested and thought through before it is unleashed on the Australian public. And that this should be the role of a new government body, the AI Safety Commissioner. In doing so, Santow is challenging some basic tenets of the information economy: that it’s OK to disrupt, move fast and break things; that the benefits of tech advancement outweigh its cost; and that the role of government is to adapt to change rather than step up and shape it. Research that Essential has conducted around this report shows Australians are looking for government leadership on the issue, with the majority of the public concerned about the automating of decisions. Santow argues that placing guardrails around how Australia develops AI will ultimately serve the national interest – not just protecting citizens but also developing a uniquely Australian AI that is “fair by design” and can become a compelling global export. But to get to that point, government needs to lead: not just being more assertive in taking on the recommendations of its expert bodies, but in the way it too uses its citizens’ information. In an era of declining trust in government, it is hardly surprising that the My Health Record program has stalled, with millions of Australians not prepared to share their medical records, especially under a model where entrepreneurs would have been encouraged to access this data to “innovate”. More profoundly, the failure of robodebt has reinforced every latent instinct that government is not to be trusted with sensitive information. That the first big government data-matching project was used to chase poor people deemed to have been overpaid says it all. Imagine the difference in trust dividend if the first application had been to find people who had not claimed benefits they were entitled to and send them a cheque to make good; or to chase down unpaid super; or ensure workers were being paid the right amount of money. The challenges of rapid technological change provide an opportunity for government to win back public trust, by setting rules that ensure technology serves the public interest and by being a best-practice custodian of our personal information. As a social democrat that’s what I want my government to be doing, regardless of its partisan colours. The alternative is a libertarian free-for-all that will only ensure the disruption, division, distraction and displacement of the times accelerates unabated. • Peter Lewis is executive director of Essential Media and the director of the Centre for Responsible Technology, a new initiative of the Australia Institute."

          "bodyText": "I’ve always been attracted to extraordinary women… the opinionated, intelligent, articulate and exasperating. Magenta was all of those things and more. Born Kim Taylor, she grew up in the home counties, her childhood bedroom wall adorned with all the rosettes she had won showjumping with her pony. Kim the English rose then reinvented herself as Magenta Devine, the Hollywood gossip queen, over six foot tall in her heels, with a shock of magenta hair, the ever-present dark glasses and those enormous red lips. Timeless. Sadly, our love affair was doomed from the start. As has been said before, there were three of us in this relationship; except there wasn’t a tangible third person, this was much more complicated. Because Magenta’s other love was heroin, and it was to be a very long affair. It kept her in a warm bubble – safe from the world, protecting her from harsh reality – which is where she wanted to stay. No matter how much I loved her and she professed to love me, heroin always came first, and ultimately, after a relationship lasting seven years, I found that impossible to live with. But in the beginning, before I understood, we started living together in her Maida Vale mews house. The previous tenant, Sid Vicious, had painted all the walls black. To complement this, Magenta had installed wall-to-wall deep-pile black carpet, a large sound system and a giant pink desk where she conducted the business of her larger-than-life days as a rock PR. There she would elegantly perch, a St Moritz cigarette in one hand, phone in the other, her seductive voice working its magic. She was so good. You believed in her: she had such taste, such style and an instinctive knowledge for what was real. You trusted her truth and I watched her list of clients grow, as others recognised what made her so special. One of her earliest clients was a young American called Prince, whom she was squiring around London. She took me to the gay nightclub Heaven to see a Liverpool band that were just breaking, called Frankie Goes to Hollywood. The mews house became a revolving door for the latest, most talented and most interesting faces of rock’n’roll. And she was at the epicentre. She was also my lover and my muse. We spent for ever discussing the new group I was creating, Sigue Sigue Sputnik. I would seek out her opinion and her blessing for every idea I had, every move I made. She was unquestionably the seventh member of Sputnik. Her true destiny, however, was to be on television. She was born to play the role of presenter. After all the straight guys, Magenta burst on to the screen like nothing seen before, a black-bobbed Audrey Hepburn lookalike telling you what was cool and where to find it. She was just so natural, so great at presenting the world. After the era-defining programme Network 7, she presented, among other things, the unique travel show Rough Guide for BBC Two, which made her a cult figure. I’ve bumped into so many people over the past years who raved about how much they loved her, how much she influenced them. She was a style icon. Like all creatives, I don’t think she ever really comprehended the impact she made. She became a UN goodwill ambassador in 1998 and every so often I’d hear that instantly recognisable voice on the radio, or catch a glimpse of her on TV shows. But being Magenta Devine in such a public arena took its toll. It meant she had to keep that face on more or less permanently, to try and control her demons or to keep them locked away. It seems those demons were stronger than she was and that ultimately, tragically, they won. Magenta was utterly unique. I know why she became such a star. I never stopped loving her. I still cannot believe she has gone, but she’ll be on screen somewhere, dazzling the afterlife with her beauty, wit and charm. How on earth could she not be?"

          "bodyText": "Top story: Labour leadership race narrows Good morning, Graham Russell here with how things look on Tuesday morning. As new MPs prepare to be sworn in today in the Commons, Labour is starting to get its house in order after its disastrous election result, with Rebecca Long-Bailey firming as the candidate most likely to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. The Salford MP is good friends with fellow contender Angela Rayner, who now appears to have curtailed her leadership ambitions and is instead aiming for the deputy leader spot. Long-Bailey, the shadow business secretary, is expected to win the backing of the party’s largest donor, Unite, and key Corbyn allies – though it is not a done deal yet. The leadership contest is expected to formally begin on 7 January and it is a field of six at present – here are all the contenders. The leadership transition may yet be a painful one; Corbyn is likely to face an angry parliamentary party meeting tonight, with some incensed he still has not apologised for his election failure or contacted the 60 ousted MPs directly. Speaking of transitions, a freshly emboldened Boris Johnson has moved to nail down the Brexit timetable, seeking to set down in law a transition end date of 31 December 2020. A Downing Street source said: “Our manifesto made clear that we will not extend the implementation period and the new withdrawal agreement bill will legally prohibit government agreeing to any extension.” The new parliament is likely to get its first Brexit vote on Friday. Johnson’s cabinet retains many familiar figures after his pre-reshuffle shuffle, and notably one who had already stood down as an MP. Former culture secretary Nicky Morgan had already handed in her pass and bid goodbye to her staff and driver before being reappointed to her post, and simultaneously given a peerage. It’s going to be a busy few days, so here’s a brief guide to what will happen over the rest of the week. * * * ‘Something must be wrong’ – A criminal justice system that is so under-resourced it is “close to breaking point” has led to a steep decline in rape convictions in England and Wales, a damning report has found. Nearly half of CPS lawyers say their caseload is “unmanageable”, its specialist sexual crime units are overstretched, and procedural matters such as examination of phones are taking up to 11 months to complete. The report by the CPS Inspectorate said: “The number of rape allegations lost in the investigative process is damning.” * * * Boeing woes – Boeing has halted production of its 737 Max jets, the first time it has paused manufacturing of its 737 models in 20 years. More than 700 Max jets remain grounded worldwide, with the aviation regulator saying the plane would not return to service this year following two crashes in which 346 died. Boeing as yet has no timeframe for restarting production. The uncertainty could hit the US economy, and markets further afield, hard. Boeing is the country’s largest manufacturing exporter. * * * Ongoing emergency – Years after the Grenfell Tower fire disaster, the London Fire Brigade remains one of the worst in the country, with incident commanders and drivers going without any training for years. Resourcing is not the problem, nor are its response times, the latest audit has found. Instead it is failing to learn from its mistakes and has a “worrying” culture that discourages incident commanders from using their discretion when fighting fires. The findings were “very concerning”, said a spokesperson for the London mayor, Sadiq Khan. Other poorly performing services were Gloucestershire, Northumberland and West Sussex. The best included West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, Lancashire and Staffordshire. * * * A good turn – Ellie Goulding has come to the aid of a driver whose car was being pushed sideways down the A40 by an apparently unaware lorry driver. The singer told her 14.4 million Instagram followers: “On a side note, I can’t believe the first instinct of the other drivers who got out was to instantly start filming on their phones and shout abuse at the poor shocked driver …” * * * Feast for the ayes – It is 30 years old, once contained a “mixed selection of biscuits”, and now holds the hopes of progressive MPs across New Zealand. The cherished “biscuit tin of democracy” contains the bingo counters that decide by chance which members’ bills get to be debated in parliament. The lucky dip – highlighted by a recent QI tweet – has led to debates on marriage equality and assisted dying. * * * Today in Focus podcast: The ups and downs of Jamie Oliver Fifteen Cornwall, one of Jamie Oliver’s last UK restaurants, shut last week with 100 job losses. Anna Berrill and Sarah Butler look at what went wrong for the celebrity chef. Also: Annie Kelly on a landmark legal case in the US against the world’s largest tech companies. Lunchtime read: Life after homelessness Life was tough on the streets for Susan Sutton. After her marriage ended, she spent a year sleeping rough among drug addicts, alcoholics and sex workers. When she couldn’t sleep on trains, she would wander the streets or see out the night in the 24-hour cafes. It was in one all-night venue – a Wimpy in Leicester Square to be exact – that her life turned around. Sport Changes to the structure of the Champions Cup are being considered with some stakeholders keen to reduce the competition to 18 teams. Manchester City will not stand in Mikel Arteta’s way if, as expected, he becomes the Arsenal manager this week and they would leave the door open for a return to the Etihad Stadium. Ben Stokes described himself as the “boy in the bubble” as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year thanked his teammates and the sport of cricket for helping him through his trial for affray and into a summer of sporting glory. Wilfried Zaha slammed an angled strike into the roof of the net to equalise Neal Maupay’s goal and earn Crystal Palace a 1-1 draw at home to Brighton in the Premier League. The seeds have been falling fast at this year’s PDC world darts championship, but Gary Anderson comfortably avoided an early exit with a 3-0 victory over Brendan Dolan. The former Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone has said he believes the theft of £50m worth of jewellery from his daughter’s property was an “inside job”. And the occasionally dramatic if sprawling medical tribunal of the former British Cycling and Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman, which was due to be done and dusted last March, may not finish now until October 2020 after being adjourned yet again. Business The post-election bounce continued for the stock market on Monday with a 165-point rise in the FTSE100 which added £50bn to the value of Britain’s leading companies. But the possibility of a hard Brexit deadline dented the optimism after the close so it is set to drop 26 points or 0.35% at the opening today. The pound also suffered from that Brexit report and is at $1.33 and €1.193. The papers More Brexit news on the front pages of the Telegraph: “Johnson to enshrine 2020 Brexit in law”, the FT: “Johnson vow on Brexit transition raises fears of cliff-edge next year”, the Times: “Johnson takes tough new line on Brexit trade talks” and the Express: “Boris to defy EU over Brexit deadline”. The Guardian focuses on the race to become Labour leader, with a story that Angela Rayner has cleared the way for her friend Rebecca Long-Bailey to run: “Long-Bailey gets clear run as candidate of Labour left”. The i has a story about Sadiq Khan weighing in on why Labour lost the election: “The wrath of Khan”. The Mail has: “Welby: Don’t expect royals to be saints” in an apparent defence of Prince Andrew by the archbishop. The Mirror reports that a private plane used by celebrities and royals came “10ft from drone disaster” and the Sun has a story about a builder who won a £105m lotto and is doing work for free over Christmas: “Santa chores”.

          "bodyText": "Ben Stokes described himself as the “boy in the bubble” as the BBC Sports Personality of the Year thanked his teammates and the sport of cricket for helping him through his trial for affray and into a summer of sporting glory. English cricket achieved standout success at Sunday night’s ceremony in Aberdeen, taking the team of the year as well as Stokes’s individual award, and winning the moment of the year for the winning run-out against New Zealand in the World Cup final. The challenge now is to capitalise on it. “That moment at Lords when we won the World Cup was a childhood dream,” Stokes said. “Talking about the years before that you look at it and sport has an amazing way of picking you back up. You’ve got so many people around you who are able to help you – family, teammates, everybody involved in cricket is a part of that. “When you’re out there as a batsman, I just try to envisage myself as a boy in a bubble. Anything outside of that, I’ll try not to let it in. I just look at what I’ve got to do with the bat in hand.” Stokes was dropped by England in 2017 after being involved in a brawl outside a Bristol nightclub that led him to stand trial on charges of affray. He was recalled for the 2018 winter tour of New Zealand and was found not guilty at Bristol crown court the following summer. “When you’re not in [the team] that gets taken away from you,” Stokes said. “If [your teammates] are taking time out of their days to keep in contact and see how you are, that’s when you really know you’re part of something quite special. That wasn’t just for the first days and weeks that was completely until I got back in the team. Even though I wasn’t there I was made to feel like I was.” For Eoin Morgan there was no surprise Stokes won the award after his performance not only in the World Cup but during the unforgettable third Ashes Test at Headingley. The collective awards, however, were a pleasant surprise for the one-day captain. “There was probably an expectation between us [of Ben] winning the big award,” Morgan said. “But to scoop the other two on top of it in what was a big year for sport … It’s fantastic to see that cricket is at the forefront of everybody’s mind. It was incredible to be part of, we travelled up and down the country witnessing it first hand, just the incredible caring nature and the feelgood factor around the sport. For me that means a huge amount.” Asked how cricket can build on this success, Morgan said: “I think you try to take advantage of the platform that the success has brought. Using the opportunities to grow the game and get it to the most important people, which is young kids up and down the country. We want to be in schools getting a bat and ball in their hand and I think The Hundred couldn’t come at a better time.”"

          "bodyText": "A circular building topped with a union jack dome rises from the trees on the Swanscombe peninsula in Kent. With its flag tightly wrapped around a glass bubble, it looks like a little Brexit capsule, safely sealed off from the free movement and free markets of the outside world. This is the proposed entrance pavilion to the London Resort, a £3.5bn theme park planned for the Thames estuary. This walled kingdom of themed “lands” would rise from the muddy marshes by 2024, just as Boris Johnson nears the end of this term as PM. The first images of this planned dreamland were unveiled a few days before the election and the project now seems like a fitting metaphor for the result. Why elect a government that would address social welfare, tackle rising homelessness and fix the NHS, when you can build a parallel fantasy world instead? Working in partnership with Paramount Pictures, BBC and ITV, on behalf of a Kuwaiti developer, the team have concocted a perfect vision of little Britain that will bring a tear to even the most steely of Corbynite eyes. After being drawn into the great union jack glass tent, visitors will be funnelled into High Street, a place “full of shops and restaurants” – like actual British high streets used to be. Maybe there’ll be an empty library and an interactive food bank experience, too. From High Street, punters can progress to The Studio, described as a “gritty, modern-day warehouse district”, similar in fact to the cluster of industrial sheds that are already on the site. To the north lies The Woods, “an enchanted realm” with a whiff of Thomas Heatherwick, where elfin creatures roam the forest and garden bridges miraculously sprout from rivers. Next is The Kingdom, promising a full-on feudal experience. It will be the best of British, where the landed gentry lord it over the peasants from heavily fortified castles, recalling the good old days before we joined the EU, and to which we’re returning having taken back control. Images show a magnificent Arthurian pile, topped with crenelated towers and flanked by fire-breathing dragons. A rickety wooden rollercoaster swirls around in contorted loops, while a medieval trebuchet-shaped ride swings ominously to and fro in the background. The menu of enchanted escapism goes on. Next comes the The Isles, a place of “giant creatures, mythical beasts and adventures at the crossroads of imagination and reality”, as well as The Jungle, where ancient ruins of a long-lost civilisation (the welfare state?) will be visible through the tree canopy. Marvel at overgrown relics and “strange mystical artefacts” (is that social housing?) transported to the present by inquisitive explorers. The final land, Starport, will catapult visitors into a thrilling future, with high-octane rides, alien encounters and sci-fi stardust. The developers say it will launch people into adventures that are out of this world, “leaving them mesmerised at things that should be impossible but are not”. Sounds painfully familiar. First mooted in 2012 and subject to endless delays, the London Resort now looks to be back on track. Having dropped out in in 2017, Paramount is back, and the project is now headed by PY Gerbeau, the theme park whizz credited with turning around the fortunes of both EuroDisney and the Millennium Dome. The park’s long-awaited arrival now seems a welcome prospect. By 2024, it might be the escape from reality that we will all desperately crave."

          "headline": "Rachel Roddy’s recipe for focaccia sausage rolls",
          "bodyText": "Eating hot, salty things while drinking cold bubbles is something I enjoy. It is at this time of year, though, when I start expecting it as often as possible. After all, who knows when Christmas will take a dark turn? Last Sunday afternoon, for example, as the light was snatched away and the house shrank, and I needed to make this recipe again and take pictures, we went from a claustrophobic family slump to a small party of three in the space of an hour. The Chinese tradition maintains that for food to be perfect, all of the senses must be stimulated. Now, while I am cautious about using the word perfect, today’s recipe with bubbles is proof of this theory, with all five senses at work in the best possible way: the smell and sizzle sound coming from the oven (not to mention the pop of the cork and fizz in the glass); the sight of the golden carapace with sausagemeat inside; touch as you grab a roll with your fingers and burn your tongue; and the taste of oil-slicked focaccia and sausage and sage stuffing. Sausage rolls, but not as I knew them, until now. These are rolls of the bun variety, made from an olive oil-rich focaccia dough wrapped around a sausage, onion and sage filling. They are not intended as a rival to the classic, puff pastry sausage roll, but an ally. The dough recipe is my standard focaccia dough, and the nearest I come to making bread. The beauty of this recipe, taught to me by the Italian cook and teacher Carla Tomasi, is in the kneading, or rather the pulling and folding. You do this on an oiled surface with oiled hands, lifting the sides of the dough up and over as if you were gathering a drawstring purse. There are two Roman words I like a lot. The first is sfizio, which literally translates as “whim”, or meaning something you don’t really need. But it has come to mean a delicious thing, usually fried in oil, that you absolutely must eat. The second is sgargarozzare, which my wine-selling friend Antonio defines as: “To consume or throw back with joy, and with no intention of stopping.” These words feel entirely appropriate here, for stand-up dinners of hot cheese straws and anchovy puffs, lumps of cheese and fat-studded slices of salami, battered and fried things, your largest bowl filled with crisps and, of course, sausage rolls. Plus, lots of bubbles all consumed on a whim, and with no intention of stopping. Sausage rolls Prep 30 min Rest 1 hr 45 min Cook 30 min Makes 12-14 200g ‘00’ all-purpose flour 200g strong bread flour 8g dried yeast or 20g fresh 10g salt Olive oil 250g sausage meat 1 large red onion, peeled and thinly sliced 1 handful sage leaves Black pepper White wine or marsala In a bowl, mix the flours, yeast, salt, two tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil and 300ml tepid water into a soft, slightly sticky and shaggy ball of dough. Cover and leave to rest in a warm spot for 15 minutes. Turn the dough on to an oiled worktop, then lift and fold the sides of the dough up and over (the oiled surface helps this), before returning to a clean, oiled bowl. Cover and leave in a warm, draught-free place for an hour and a half. By the end of resting, the dough should be triple the size. While the dough is resting, make the filling. Fry the onion in a little olive oil with the sausage meat, squeezed from the casing and crumbled into the pan, some ripped sage leaves and lots of black pepper. Add a little white wine or marsala and leave to bubble for 10 minutes, until the sausage is cooked and the wine has evaporated. Working with oily hands, pull off walnut-sized lumps of dough, flatten slightly and put a teaspoon of filling in the middle, then wrap the dough around it, sealing carefully. Put the rolls on an oven tray lined with baking paper, then brush with more oil. Bake at 190C (170C fan)/gas 5 for 15 minutes, or until puffed up, firm and golden."

          "bodyText": "In recent weeks, former medic Adam Kay has topped both hardback and paperback charts, having followed his memoir of life as a junior doctor, This Is Going to Hurt, with a seasonal offering, Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas, in which he revisits the trials of working in a hospital during the festive period (delivering a baby as Johnny Mathis played, drunk drivers and a boy who’d shoved a bit of his mum’s novelty flashing earring up his nose). Kay, who has adapted his work into a stage show in such demand that he’s still adding dates to this year’s tour, is also busy turning it into an eight-part series for BBC Two. Only a few slots down the paperback listings comes The Secret Barrister, an insider’s look at the failings of the criminal justice system, which started life as an award-winning blog, became a chart-topping book and has now spawned a sequel, Fake Law: The Truth About Justice in an Age of Lies, which will appear in the spring. In terms of how we relate to the experts in our lives, how we understand their relationships to the institutions in which they work, and the glimpses we get of what they think of us, the increasing body of “professional confessionals” is significant. Often, the picture is not only alarming, but unflattering. In Twas the Nightshift Before Christmas, for example, alongside the revelation that the ear, nose and throat department is known by other specialisms as “early nights and tennis”“ and dermatology as dermaholiday, Kay takes aim at the “middle-class pastime of Christmas Eve granny-dumping – bringing one’s elderly or infirm relatives into hospital with some vague, fabricated medical complaint, so the dumpers can dedicate the next few days to solid partying, unfettered by caring for their parents”. The dominant mode, though, is that of the whistleblower exposing underfunding, overwork, bureaucracy, organisational chaos and the myriad ways in which a field’s core values – making people well, protecting them from injustice – are undermined by exigent reality. And the current of anger that runs beneath many books in this emergent genre makes comrades of its readers: not so much a railing against experts as the experts telling us that they’re being prevented from doing the jobs for which they trained so hard. Joanna Cannon’s Breaking and Mending exemplifies this kind of writing. Cannon didn’t go into medicine until she was in her 30s, having left school with one O-level; the professor who admitted her to medical school admitted that she was his annual wild card. After specialising in psychiatry, she eventually left the profession and wrote two best selling novels, The Trouble with Goats and Sheep and Three Things About Elsie. Breaking and Mending is part account of the patients and processes that marked her medical career and part meditation on the emotional demands that life as a doctor makes. “All the way through medical school,” she writes, “the one thing that keeps you going, despite the exams and the travelling, the lack of money and the complete absence of free time, is the idea of what kind of doctor you are going to be. You don’t fantasise about prizes and awards and accolades, you imagine the small and the ordinary instead. Having time for your patients, being able to explain a treatment to someone in a way they can understand, helping someone’s journey to be a little more bearable. It’s only when you arrive on the wards, when you are spat out into an NHS that bends and breaks under the strain of the endless demands placed upon it, it’s only then that you realise you will never be able to be the doctor you want to become. The system simply won’t allow it.” The medi-memoir is a broad genre, in which varying degrees of personal material are present: other additions include How to Treat People by Molly Case and The Language of Kindness by Christie Watson, both nurses; All That Remains: A Life in Death by Sue Black, a forensic anthropologist; Nathan Filer’s This Book Will Change Your Mind About Mental Health; David Nott’s War Doctor; and palliative care specialist Kathryn Mannix’s With the End in Mind. It is as though people who buy non-fiction feel not merely a duty but a necessity to inform themselves. And where might we need informing more than in the murky area of the law, especially since we’re called on to interpret the intricacies of constitutional and parliamentary law almost every day? Like the Secret Footballer before him, the Secret Barrister casts light on a world that we perceive as sloshing with money and – thanks to TV representations from Rumpole to Silks – a fair amount of glamour. It is certainly not like that in real life, and the SB thinks we should know that; that we must regard the law as “a shared asset”, before which we all stand equally. Sadly, s/he thinks, “There is, in criminal justice possibly more than any other sphere of public life, a devastating lack of public education, exacerbated by inaccurate, ill-informed media reports and political pronouncements that betray an ignorance of the legal system that stretches to the very top of government.”It’s a view backed up, in a broader context, by a former justice of the supreme court, Jonathan Sumption, whose book Trials of the State: Law and the Decline of Politics demonstrates an interest in the moral implications of the intersection between the judiciary and democratic accountability that has made him a regular feature on current affairs programmes. A theme emerges in the popularity of these books: although the age of deference may have drawn to a close – as much from within ranks as without – readers are still gripped by the idea of what goes on in the elite professions. They are necessarily written by those who have had access to higher education; there is a degree of privilege and a lack of class and racial diversity to these books. They are marketed to a relatively literate audience, without the mass-market paraphernalia that is applied to, for example, the memoirs of former Para, Marine and Special Boat Serviceman Ant Middleton, whose autobiography First Man In: Leading from the Front was propelled to the top of the charts partly because of his role as instructor on the Channel 4 series SAS: Who Dares Wins; his new book, Fear Bubble, has sold more than 50,000 copies. But perhaps the sleeper hit of this Christmas will be a different kind of inside story altogether. With his book How to Be a Footballer already a success, Peter Crouch has gone big with a sequel I, Robot (for the uninitiated, a reference to his on-pitch celebration), which promises to lift the lid on what it takes to make it big in the beautiful game. Given his comic touch, blowing the whistle on Crouch’s sporting career might simply have ushered in his second act. And perhaps that’s the lesson of all these books – now that the age of the job-for-life has passed, it always pays to have something else up your sleeve."

An unrelentingly bleak vision of motherhood, played out by an utterly consumed Natalia Osipova and the shape-shifting Jonathan Goddard, much credit must go to designer Yann Seabra, David Plater’s lighting and musicians Frank Moon and Dave Price, responsible for creating the nightmarish world of the show. LW Read the full review. 9 Rosie Kay: Fantasia Dancing. To music. For fun. It’s not very “contemporary dance”, is it? Perhaps choreographer Rosie Kay is pulling our leg? Not at all: it turns out that she is simply going for broke. Three Amazonian dancers, costumed like kids playing dress-up, gleefully – and skilfully – romp through fistfuls of music from Vivaldi to Vaughan Williams, mimicking styles from moonlit romantic ballet to melodramatic Martha Graham. Cartoonish, yes, but it’s not parody – it’s pleasure. SR Read the full review. 8 Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater: Lazarus Sixty years strong, the New York company proved it can keep a vital connection to its roots while forging into new territory. Alongside the evergreen Revelations (which despite its status as the most-seen contemporary dance of all time, still manages to contain its own small revelations each time), Rennie Harris’s Lazarus paid tribute to the company’s founder and his childhood in the American south, while mining fresh phrases from Harris’s own hip-hop vernacular. LW Read the full review. 7 Matthew Bourne’s Romeo &amp; Juliet A huge burst of youthful energy (courtesy of young cast and collaborators) was key to the success of Bourne’s Shakespeare shake-up, finding the star cross’d lovers trapped in a draconian institution and raging against the authority that suppresses their runaway feelings. A great portrait of the all-consuming delusion of young love (complete with epic snogs), with tons of clever ideas, a dynamic cast and a renewed vigour injected into Bourne’s choreography. LW Read the full review. 6 Merce Cunningham: Night of 100 Solos Marking the centenary of Merce Cunningham’s birth, a one-off intercontinental event with performances in Los Angeles, New York and London saw 25 dancers perform extracts from the choreographer’s back catalogue, interwoven into a new work. Some were already Cunningham experts, others (such as luminous ballet dancers Francesca Hayward and Joseph Sissens) were verdant newbies, and it was fascinating to see Cunningham’s taxing choreography as a living thing for each dancer to face on their own terms. LW Read the full review. 5 Northern Ballet: Victoria An epistolary ballet? Sounds highly unlikely – even more so when told through flashbacks, split viewpoints and doubled characters. Yet aided by a score that narrates its story in sound, a versatile set and subtle performances, Cathy Marston’s singular, sweeping take on Queen Victoria – seen through the eyes of her youngest daughter, Beatrice, as she reads the diaries of her grieving mother – never lets go of the plot, the characters or their social world. It’s quite an achievement. SR Read the full review. 4 San Francisco Ballet The company brought an impressive 10 UK premieres to their London season, including the fresh, feelgood buzz of Justin Peck’s Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming and a stripped-back Edith Wharton drama in Cathy Marston’s Snowblind. But among the short works was the serious substance of Alexei Ratmansky’s Shostakovich Trilogy, reflecting on classical ballet technique and the choreographer’s own Soviet heritage to the thrillingly mercurial compositions of his countryman Shostakovich. The dancers were brilliant, too. LW Read the full review. 3 Royal Ballet: Romeo and Juliet For a dancer to take a role they have performed many, many times and make it seem as if they are experiencing those emotions for the first time is the holy grail of the story ballet. Lauren Cuthbertson’s Juliet fell in love in front of our eyes and you could see her surprise at her own feelings as Matthew Ball’s Romeo leaned in for a kiss or raised her aloft. It was a deliciously romantic performance of Kenneth MacMillan’s exemplary ballet. LW Read the full review. 2 Pam Tanowitz: Four Quartets A longtime figure in New York’s underground dance scene, choreographer Pam Tanowitz utterly wowed us with her international debut, danced to TS Eliot’s Four Quartets, read in full by actor Kathleen Chalfant. In a work of multilayered fascination, words, steps, music (by Kaija Saariaho) and sets (paintings by Brice Marden) all shifted in and out of focus, and Tanowitz’s choices showed thoughtful craftsmanship, beautiful handling of texture and a great clarity of mind. LW Read the full review 1 Oona Doherty: Hard to be Soft – A Belfast Prayer There’s a brilliant voiceover in Hard to Be Soft, in which a young woman describes herself and her friends in Oona Doherty’s home town of Belfast: “This little bubble that has tragedy in the walls.” Their defiance has a physical manifestation, she says, the importance of putting on a good face. “If you’re in a shit-hole but you look fucking amazing there’s something really empowering about that … They’re superstars in this granite-like stagnancy … just for putting on their armour and getting on with the day.” In Hard to be Soft, Doherty elevates the defiance, pride and resilience of the tough, sometimes maligned working-class men and women around her, while scratching at the vulnerability underneath. All the while, choral voices rise in charged crescendo, underlining the beauty and horror that religion has bestowed on this city and these lives. She is only at the outset of her career but Doherty’s shows at this year’s Edinburgh international festival and Dance Umbrella made her look like the most exciting young voice in contemporary dance. The chameleonic choreographer herself transformed into callow yet cocksure young men, sour-faced and swaggering, putting up a brittle shell against the world. Purely as a piece of physical metamorphosis it was masterful, but Doherty’s work is so much more than that. LW Read the full review."

          "bodyText": "Downing Street is threatening the future of the BBC by insisting it is seriously considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee, while boycotting Radio 4’s Today programme over the broadcaster’s supposed anti-Tory bias. No 10 pulled ministers from Saturday’s edition of the Today programme and sources said it intended to “withdraw engagement” from the show in future. The row is seen as an ominous sign of Boris Johnson’s willingness to bypass independent scrutiny and follows criticism of the BBC’s election coverage from both left and right. No 10 pointed to Andrew Neil’s on-air monologue in which he lambasted Johnson for his refusal to be interviewed, and the BBC’s “extensive coverage” of a four-year-old boy with suspected pneumonia forced to sleep on a hospital floor – as supposed evidence of anti-Tory, pro-remain bias at the corporation. Meanwhile, Labour backers have raised concerns about the BBC’s coverage, from the editing out of laughter aimed at Johnson in a news bulletin to leading reporters uncritically repeating Conservative sources, and the prime minister escaping scrutiny after dodging the one-on-one interview with Neil. The BBC has firmly rejected such criticism. In an email on Friday, the director general, Tony Hall, wrote: “In a frenetic campaign where we’ve produced hundreds of hours of output, of course we’ve made the odd mistake and we’ve held up our hands to them. Editors are making tough calls every minute of the day. But I don’t accept the view of those critics who jump on a handful of examples to suggest we’re somehow biased one way or the other.” During the election campaign, Johnson threatened to take the BBC’s licence fee away as he called into question its status as a publicly funded broadcaster. The prime minister suggested the licence fee, which is guaranteed to continue until at least 2027, was a general tax that could no longer be justified when other media organisations had found other ways of funding themselves. Any changes to the BBC’s funding model would require parliament to pass fresh legislation. Abolition would be hard, but a bigger risk for the BBC is the negotiations with the government over the cost of the licence fee between 2022 and 2027. Even more worrying for the public broadcaster are comments by chief secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak, confirming plans to look at the decriminalisation of failing to pay the TV licence, which could be set out in the next Queen’s speech and would undermine the BBC’s funding model. Sunak told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “That is something the prime minister has said we will look at, and has instructed people to look at that. I think it’s fair to say people find the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee to be something that has provoked questions in the past.” A No 10 source confirmed that the licence fee was “in the firing line”, following reports in the Mail on Sunday that its future settlement was under discussion. A BBC spokesperson said decriminalisation would lead to £200m less to spend on programmes. “The government has already commissioned a QC to take an in-depth look at this matter and he found that ‘the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained’ and that it is fair and value for money to licence fee payers,” they said. “Decriminalisation could also mean we have at least £200m less to spend on programmes and services our audiences love.” Johnson’s senior adviser Dominic Cummings is known to be a strong critic of the BBC, its funding model and its output. He is particularly dismissive of the Today programme, which he argues operates in a metropolitan bubble out of touch with the rest of the country. Downing Street has also attacked Channel 4’s election coverage after it replaced Johnson with an ice sculpture when he refused to take part in a leaders’ debate on the climate crisis. During the election the Tories confirmed that the party would review Channel 4’s public service broadcasting obligations if Johnson was returned to Downing Street. Under the proposal it will “look at whether its remit should be better focused so it is serving the public in the best way possible”. However, there will be voices within the Tory party who are uneasy about an all-out war with the media, particularly the BBC – both because it remains one of the most trusted institutions in the country and because of its daily influence on the news agenda."

          "headline": "Twenty tech trends for 2020",
          "bodyText": "1. Tesla’s cybertruck will not ship This is an easy prediction to make, because even Tesla isn’t claiming that its eye-catching angular steel beast will be available for sale in 2020. The company’s own pitch is that production won’t even begin until 2021, with owners receiving their first shipments in 2022. But the gap is relevant to Tesla’s future: where the company was once genuinely ahead of the curve, in making beautiful electric cars that people wanted to buy, it has increasingly relied on beating its competitors to announcements, rather than actually shipping. The list of Elon Musk’s as-yet-unfulfilled promises grows every year – but the electric fleets of BMW, Ford, General Motors and others grow faster. 2. Google’s Duplex won’t come to Europe One of the most impressive, and futuristic, products to have come from Google in recent years, Duplex is an AI assistant that can make calls to local businesses on your behalf to do things like book appointments and find out opening times. The tool was criticised when the company first revealed it, for being so good that its use could plausibly be described as “deceptive”: the AI assistant even injects “um” and “er” into speech to sound more human. That, combined with the difficulties of gaining consent for receiving an automated cold call, means that GDPR might well keep the technology from European shores for years to come. 3. Advertising will come to smart speakers Amazon and Google comfortably dominate the smart speaker landscape, but neither has yet answered an important question: what’s the advantage of getting all these devices in homes? Aggressive price cuts mean that neither is making a substantial amount of income from sales, and the absence of paid services means that they aren’t taking a glorious 30% cut of revenue either. Amazon has long experimented with using Alexa as a retail channel, but the only way to really make millions is by delivering sweet, sweet advertising to the ears of your customers. Expect the dial to be turned up. 4. 5G will be meaningful For Brits, 5G is technically here already, with multiple networks offering the ultrafast mobile standard in denser urban areas. But there are few devices that support the new standard yet – and fewer still that are acceptable to the gadget-obsessed early adopters who would otherwise be first on board, since the flagship devices from manufacturers such as Samsung, Google and Apple continue to be 4G only. That will change in 2020, when you can expect hardware like the Pixel 5, iPhone 12 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S11 to support the faster connections. 5. Your homescreen will still look the same It’s been years since any consumer app broke through into the mainstream – with an honourable exception for TikTok among the under-25s – and that trend shows no real sign of curving upwards in 2020. Between the dominance of default apps from Apple and Google, and the ability of the major platforms to acquire, clone or kill upstart competitors, it’s a hard time to be a consumer software company. Harder still to become one of the 28 who get a coveted spot on a typical user’s homescreen, rather than being buried in a folder. 6. Facebook will kill Portal It was always hubristic for Facebook to release an Echo competitor. The company had no real expertise in building hardware, nor an obvious strategy for getting its products to market: it may own the world’s most valuable advertising real estate, but it’s not a store. Then Cambridge Analytica broke, and Portal went from a bold idea to a bad one. Who would want to put an always-on microphone connected directly to Menlo Park in their homes? The answer, it seems, is “not many people”, because Portal sales have reportedly been minuscule. A second iteration was squeezed out earlier this year; don’t expect a third. 7. VR will have a second mini-boom – thanks to one game Virtual reality has been the “next big thing” for five years, and has been a big thing for precisely none of those. But just when it was on its way out, there’s the potential for one last flurry of attention, thanks to the work of PC gaming company Valve. The company announced a new edition of its beloved Half-Life series, the first since 2007, would be exclusive to its VR headset. There have been few titles that can encourage non-believers to spend the thousands required to get high-quality VR at home, but Half-Life: Alyx is one. Whether it sparks a lasting resurgence, or just a final flash in the pan, remains to be seen. 8. Amazon’s Alexa expansion will slip Alexa has been coming to new products at an impressive clip. Amazon has incorporated its voice assistant into almost every gadget it makes, and a good few it doesn’t. But, even though voice assistants remain popular among their devotees, privacy concerns are only growing among the cohort of refuseniks who want nothing to do with always-on microphones. If Ford, for instance, starts losing out on sales because of an overly ambitious plan to put Alexa in everything, you can be certain they’ll reassess that integration rapidly. 9. We won’t hear about Apple’s smart glass or car The two worst-kept secrets in technology are Apple’s biggest experimental projects: a pair of augmented-reality glasses and a self-driving car, both being developed in Cupertino. The glasses have a path to release, and references to them in the code for Apple products have started showing up in beta tests and other leaks. The car, for now, has no existence outside of a few offices in Sunnyvale and some suspicious hires from companies like Tesla. But, at the earliest, the glasses won’t hit shelves until 2021, and Apple is always wary about pre-announcing things. 10. The console wars will restart with a vengeance Video gaming has been quiet for the past few years. With Xbox Ones and PlayStation 4s in houses across the nation, Microsoft and Sony turned their attention to intra-generational upgrades and cheaper models designed to be a second console. Nintendo took a different path, releasing the Switch and upending what a home console could be. And Fortnite rendered the whole thing moot anyway, as the most popular game in the world worked on every console, PCs, and even mobile phones. But 2020 will see the launch of a new Xbox, a new Playstation, a new Halo and a new Last of Us – and the return to playgrounds nationwide of tiresome debates about which is better. 11. Google could gain from article 13 While the European Union was hammering out the details of 2019’s copyright directive, Google began one of its largest lobbying efforts to date. The company was incensed by two proposals – articles 13 and 15 of the draft bill – which it dubbed the “upload filter” and the “link tax”. Passage of the directive, it implied, could result in the end of YouTube in Europe for good. It mobilised thousands of YouTubers in opposition, and sparked group hysteria among tween fandoms on Instagram and elsewhere. While individual nations ratify the legislation, expect more protest and legal challenges, but ultimately Google may gain from article 13: after all, they are well placed to build and license the content filters required to police copyrighted material. 12. AI will be mobilised in cyberwar Simon Shooter, a partner at law firm Bird &amp; Bird, predicts that 2020 will see “the escalation of the cyberwar, with AI in use on both sides of the divide”. Hackers have long been experimenting with automatic tools for breaking into and exploiting corporate and government networks, but the need to stay undetectable has limited the use of AI in practice. As the cyber cold war heats up, however, that could change. 13. Cool China The rise of TikTok may have concerned the adults in the room, who see the company’s role in exporting Beijing’s censorship and slow adoption of child protection standards as reasons for caution. But among the younger generation, it could have the opposite effect, cementing a perception of China as the home of cool products and services. Who would win if that happened? “The success of TikTok will not have gone unnoticed by Tencent, which owns WeChat,” says Tamara Littleton, CEO at social media agency the Social Element. “It has struggled to gain traction in other countries… but I predict they will make a play for the UK and US audience with a slightly tailored version.” 14. Apple will experience worker activism The only people with the power to change how Silicon Valley works are inside Silicon Valley. Employee activism burst through in a big way in 2018, with Google workers walking out over sexual harassment and plans to open up a censored search engine in China, Microsoft workers campaigning against working with the US Department of Defense and Amazon workers joining in protests against working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Apple, the largest of them all, has so far kept its staff from expressing public dissent. Whether that’s through the carrot or the stick is unknown – but with the company coming under increasing pressure for its craven stance towards both Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, it surely cannot last. 15. Digital wellbeing on the statute books Both Apple and Google launched their screen time controls in 2018, and upgraded them this year. Ross Sleight, chief strategy officer at tech accelerator Somo, thinks this trend will continue – and will start to impact on regulation. “Many people are now very aware of their addictive habits and are trying to disengage,” he says. “A shared responsibility for wellbeing falls on to each one of us: the companies designing applications and user interfaces that play on our psychology, but also on policy makers.” How that would look in practice is likely to be the result of years of legal wrangling – but watch the proposals bubble up over the next year. 16. Google v Nike for wearable tech’s second place When it bought Fitbit towards the end of 2019, Google signalled a renewed desire to succeed in wearable technology, a space where it has previously struggled. The company’s Android Wear operating system bombed against competition from the Apple Watch, and its decision not to engage in hardware directly looks short-sighted in a sector where elegant pairing of software and design is table stakes. But, says Jim Prior, global CEO of brand consultancy Superunion, challengers may come from leftfield: “The bulk of these gadgets and garments lack an emotional narrative to differentiate themselves, connect with consumers and drive purchase. In comparison, sportswear brands are highly engineered and technical but have mastered this – in particular Nike, which has woven a strong narrative around the brand driven by its creative vision.” 17. The loot box bans spread Loot boxes, treasure crates, card packs – whatever they’re called, the practice of offering randomised rewards for real money has gained an increasingly bad reputation. Stories of children spending hundreds of pounds of their parents money – and adults spending thousands of pounds of their own – back up the perception of the offerings as closer to unregulated gambling than a fun aspect of video games in the 21st century. Self-regulation might be on the cards if the industry showed the slightest interest in doing it, but the billions it rakes in from the practice (Fifa loot boxes resulted in more than half of EA’s 2017 revenue from game add-ons) makes a voluntary change unlikely. 18. The continued death of new media In the past decade, hundreds of small sites were launched with venture capital cash, riding a wave of social media distribution and programmatic adverts to a peak of bubbly excess, before it burst in 2016 and they dropped like flies. In the US, consolidation has seen some outlets close, others merge, and still more lay off hundreds of employees in total, and the trend shows no sign of abating. The biggest scalps have already been claimed, but 2020 could be a time when smaller sites start to lose out, like the hyper-partisan news outlets that so shaped the 2017 election, or the few remaining independent blogs that have eked out a living on reader support and savings. 19. The next iPhone will have four rear cameras The smartphone industry seems to be following the trend set by Gillette and one-upping itself on an annual basis. Other phones already have four cameras, so why not Apple? The company would have a good reason for adding another lens: while the iPhone 11 Pro is perhaps the best smartphone camera on the market, it falls far short in one specific area, with just a 2x optical zoom at the highest level. So a bigger zoom lens would be well received by any users who like shooting big things far away or small things nearby. 20. Britain continues not to regulate tech The online harms white paper, revealed in a blaze of publicity in the summer of 2019, has gone nowhere. The prime minister who commissioned it is out, as is the culture secretary who launched it. Whoever sits at the head of cabinet in 2020 is unlikely to want to progress this odd legislation, assembled as it is from a mishmash of Telegraph-pleasing statements about harmful but not illegal speech. And they’re unlikely to have the parliamentary time to do so even if they did want to. So instead, everyone will continue to talk about how much we need to update our laws, while doing nothing of the sort."

          "bodyText": "So, I’d like to talk about Christmas gift guides, but first I’d like to talk about the Peloton advert, which was so bad it cost the company $1.5bn. Merry Christmas, Peloton! I must confess, until this advert came crashing through the internet, I’d never actually heard of Peloton, which is probably due to my intolerance of exercise – a lifelong affliction. (As Will Ferrell says of sex addiction in Blades Of Glory, it’s a real condition, with doctors and medicine and everything.) Now, I have, and I’m pretty clear on what it is – a jazzy exercise bike – so in terms of raising awareness with me, the advert is flawless. In other matters, possibly less so. In the ad, a very slim woman is given a Peloton for Christmas by a man who may be her husband, but seems more likely to be her jailer. For reasons no one can explain without references to Black Mirror, the woman then films herself for a year using her jazzy exercise bike. The next Christmas, she proudly shows the presumably extremely long cycling film to her jailer, in which she tearfully thanks him for changing her life. “A gift like no other,” Peloton tweeted, and indeed it is – the perfect gift for the brainwashed woman you keep in your basement. People have criticised the ad for being sexist and yes, obviously it is. But I would urge these newly outraged people to look at gift suggestions – or “gift guides” to use the common parlance – in general, because they are always reliably, hilariously, appallingly sexist. Now, I say “always”, but of course I mean “always, with the strong exceptions of the Guardian and Observer gift guides, which are paragons of equality, as you’d expect from these fine papers”. (Phew, job safe for another year.) But in the vast main, gift guides – in newspapers or magazines, in shops, in adverts – attempt to appeal to the entire human population, and that means relying on gender stereotypes. One of my first jobs was to compile a Christmas gift guide for a magazine and, looking back, I see that in my “gifts for her” section I included – and I swear I’m not making this up – a pink sequined beret and some bubble bath. The “gifts for him” section is absolutely perfect, should the him in your life be Ron Burgundy. A washbag made from reassuringly manly dark leather? A personalised shaving kit? Both will look marvellous among his many leather-bound books, in his apartment that smells of rich mahogany. Truly, gender is enough of a prison without chucking in a leather washbag to exacerbate the pain. When you try to please everyone you end up pleasing no one. Do all women want a pink sequined beret? Do any? Because, if the current debates about gender identity have taught us anything, it’s surely that we are all wonderful unique unicorns who deserve more than offerings in pink or blue, literal or metaphorical. Gift guides need to get more specific and reflect real people. And, no, suggestions of “what to get for your hipster boyfriend” (a £500 coffee grinder) or “your luxury-loving girlfriend” (Chanel bubble bath) do not count (actual examples from an actual magazine). I’m talking about people you actually know. So, putting into practice my career-spanning experience of gift guides, and my lifelong experience of knowing people, here is the ultimate list of what to get people for Christmas. (You’re welcome!) • The person in your office who talks way too loudly on the phone: a bag of caramels. They’re tasty and will stop him talking for at least a few minutes. • The person in your yoga class whom you hated for ages because she was so much better at yoga, until she talked to you one day after class and it turned out was really nice, and now every time you go to yoga you’re reminded of what a judgmental cow you are: a fancy yoga mat with a lotus flower painted on it. Then never go to yoga again. (Merry Christmas to you.) • Your friend’s girlfriend, who has become an Instagram influencer: a full-size mirror. So good for extra narcissism, I mean selfies. • The local dry cleaner who once saw you using the other local dry cleaner, prompting you to make up some lie about how you were picking up your neighbour’s dry cleaning, even though he knew you were lying and you’ve now basically stopped dry cleaning your clothes in embarrassment: an absurdly nice cashmere scarf. (You really need to start cleaning your clothes again. Kill this problem with cashmere.) • Your passive-aggressive friend from school who always starts her Facebook messages to you, “Hello, stranger!”: a scented candle. (Nothing – literally nothing – is more passive aggressive than a scented candle.) • The woman in the park whose name you don’t know, and she doesn’t know yours, but you know everything about one another’s dogs: a card addressed “To my fellow dog lover!” and signed “The mad dog lady in the park!” • The brainwashed woman you keep in your basement: a Peloton."

          "headline": "'Things can’t get worse’: Wrexham turns Tory amid Welsh Labour losses",
          "bodyText": "There was jubilation among Conservatives in Wales as the party achieved its best results since the heyday of Margaret Thatcher, even winning in once rock-solid Labour seats such as Wrexham, which has never before returned a Tory MP. Labour remained the biggest party in Wales with 22 of the 40 seats, down six on 2017, while the Tories were up six on 14. Plaid Cymru held on to its four seats. Among the winners for the Tories was the former Welsh secretary Alun Cairns, who quit the cabinet at the start of the campaign after a row about what he had known about a former aide’s involvement in the collapse of a rape trial. Despite the scandal, he held on to his seat in the Vale of Glamorgan in south Wales. One of the most spectacular Tory victories was Wrexham in north Wales, which had been held by Labour since 1935 but where Sarah Atherton, a former soldier, nurse and owner of a microbrewery, took the seat with a majority of more than 2,000. Atherton and two others became the first female Tories to be elected as MPs in Wales. People who had backed Labour all their life deserted the party. At one of the covered markets in the town centre, Mike Evans, a butcher, said he had voted Tory but sighed when asked if he liked Boris Johnson. “I think he’s the best of a bad bunch,” he said. Evans’ family has run a butcher’s business since 1911 – even longer than Labour has held Wrexham. He has voted Labour in the past but said: “I didn’t believe in Jeremy Corbyn’s policies – his changes to public services went too far. We’d have gone backwards. Wrexham has been Labour for too long. We need a change. Things can’t get worse.” Boris Johnson’s Brexit message resonated among Welsh Labour leave voters. Steven Vale, the owner of Caroline’s Viennese Patisserie in Central Arcade, used to vote Labour but has no time for Corbyn and voted Tory this time. He said: “It’s about time people realised there’s more to politics than Labour. Especially when we’ve lost all the industry, the coalmines, the steelworks. We’ve had a Labour Welsh government for 20 years. Have they tried to improve the hospitals? All they do is blame the government in Westminster for not giving them enough money.” Yvette Moss, a local government worker, said she had stuck with Labour. “This place was decimated by Maggie Thatcher. I’ve seen how austerity has affected local government and people at the lower end.” The soul-searching was beginning for Labour activists. Mary Wimbury, the defeated Labour candidate in Wrexham, said Corbyn had to go. “He was by far the biggest issue on the doorstep,” she said. Adrienne Jeorrett, a hard-working Labour councillor in Wrexham, said she was shocked at the size of the Tory win there. “I don’t understand how people are not seeing what I’m seeing – the homelessness, the food banks, the holiday hunger, the period poverty, the increase in children being taken into care,” she said. “How are people not understanding that’s because we’ve got a Tory government. Am I wrong? Am I in a bubble? Why aren’t people drawing the dots? I find it very distressing. I just don’t understand. It’s very painful.” Jeorrett added: “We do have to look at the leadership. They really, really need to listen to Labour party members and what our experience has been. They have got to listen to those conversations we have with people.” The Labour leader in Wales, Mark Drakeford, a Corbyn ally, sent his congratulations to Johnson, with the reminder that he only had a majority in England. Delwyn Derrick, a Plaid Cymru supporter, said he was angry that so much attention was being paid to Johnson’s “amazing majority”. “It’s only a majority in England, not in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland,” he said. Derrick said a Tory MP was bad news for Wrexham. “This is a working-class town. My grandfather would be turning in his grave. But the area voted for leave and that’s made a lot of people lean towards Boris Johnson and the Tories. Brexit has polarised people.”"

          "headline": "A-Z of election night jargon",
          "bodyText": "A Agents: Everyone standing for election has an agent who manages their spending, form-filling and communications with election authorities, and is usually the person scowling as the result is read out if they haven’t won. Angry voters: Politicians are unlikely to encounter them on election night, but you might get a bit of heckling as the results are read out, especially high-profile, unpopular government ministers. Angst: The feeling you’ve had in your stomach all day about how crucial this election result is going to be. B Bar charts: Notorious for appearing on leaflets to give a misleading impression of how close one party is to catching another. Always read the small print. The only bar charts that ultimately count are the results on the night. Boat: Do you remember when the BBC spent £30,000 hiring a boat in 2010 to have an election night party with random celebrities, who got increasingly drunk and made less sense as the night wore on? So do they, and that’s why they won’t be doing it again. C Change UK/the Independent Group/the Independent Group for Change: They’ve changed their name as many times as their number of candidates, but Anna Soubry, Chris Leslie and Mike Gapes are still standing under the banner of the new centrist party that so spectacularly failed to get off the ground earlier this year. “Chaos with Ed Miliband”: A 2015 tweet from David Cameron promised: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” Four years later, we’ve had two general elections, one EU referendum, and three different prime ministers. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Constituency: The country is divided into 650 constituencies, and each is represented by an MP. Count: After the polls close, the ballot boxes from each polling station are transferred to one central location for each constituency and counted – often overnight. By law you have to start counting within four hours of polls closing, otherwise you have to send in a report explaining why. Some of the more remote voting locations in the UK are permanently on the naughty step. D Deposit: To stand as an MP, you have to pay £500. You get it back if you secure more than 5% of the vote. If you don’t, bizarrely it goes to the Queen, via the Treasury. There are some candidates, like the anti-abortion campaigners who have been targeting Stella Creasy in Walthamstow, where people will cheer when they lose their deposit. Dimbleby: No Dimbleby this election. Huw Edwards steps into the shoes of the man who presented every general election for the BBC since 1979. You can always follow @DIMBLEBOT though if you miss him. Dogs: Expect to see a lot of pictures of dogs at polling stations in the dead hours while the polls are open. There’s really not much else to report on polling day. Bonus points if you spot a horse. You can lead it to a polling station, but you can’t make it vote etc etc. Doorstep: Politicians will frequently reference the “doorstep” when being asked: “Doesn’t the result in Flydale North show that your leader/policy/attitude is unpopular with voters?” In reply, they will confidently assert: “That’s not what I was hearing on the doorstep, Kay.” E Elites: If you are an Eton-educated son of nobility, then the “elites” are the media and the civil service and remainer business leaders conspiring against the people. If you a horny-handed daughter of the soil, then it is the latte-sipping metropolitans you have in your sights. Basically, the other side. Exit poll: At 10pm on polling day an exit poll announces the expected result. It is usually pretty accurate – hence the gasps when it emerged that in 2017’s snap election Theresa May had lost her majority. F False statements: It is a criminal offence to make a false statement about a candidate during the election campaign – not that anybody seems to take any notice. First past the post: Unlike other voting systems, in the UK it is simply the candidate with the most votes in each constituency who gets to be its MP. No second choices. No transferable vote. No proportional representation. Just winner-takes-all. G Graphics: The bigger and more ludicrous the better, the BBC seems to think. Poor Jeremy Vine will be hopping around in front of virtual No 10s, virtual Houses of Parliament, and who knows what else. Hopefully, the cowboy accent won’t return. H Hot mic moment: When a politician says something, thinking that the mics have been switched off, but which gets picked up by the media. Came of age in the election sense when Gordon Brown used the phrase “bigoted woman”. Hung parliament: When no party has won enough seats to control over half of parliament, it is described as a “hung parliament”, because it is hanging in the balance. I If: “If these exit poll numbers are correct, and I’m not saying they are Huw” will be the start of virtually every sentence between 10pm and 11:15pm until one of Sunderland or Newcastle is the first constituency to declare. Independent: There might be a couple of independent candidates returned to parliament this year. Principled anti-Brexit ex-Tory rebels David Gauke and Dominic Grieve will be hoping voters will prioritise personal loyalty to their MP over party loyalty. J Joke candidates: There is long and proud tradition of joke candidates standing against major figures. Who can forget Lord Buckethead and Elmo opposing Theresa May in 2017? Insert your own punchline about which party leader you also think is a joke this time around. L Landslide: That is what the Tories are hoping for with this election – a majority in parliament of around 100+ MPs, which would allow a government to push through its programme without having to worry about rebels on their own side forcing compromise. Lifts: Party activists will be haring round in cars trying to ferry old, vulnerable and less mobile voters to the polls to cast their votes. You’ll enjoy several people reheating on social media the old anecdote that their dad always used to get the Tories to give him a lift down to the polling station, and then voted Labour every time. M Manifesto: Long list of promises just waiting to be broken or contradicted. Maps: There will be a lot of talk about the changes to the electoral map. Someone will almost certainly produce a viral tweet that compares the voting pattern in 2019 to something or other in 1919 such as coal mines or provision of public libraries. Thinking they’ve made a great point about social history, they are basically revealing that people in Britain have mostly lived in the same major urban areas for a couple of centuries. Look out for the giant election map outside the BBC’s Broadcasting House in London. It’s December, why wouldn’t you build it indoors? Marginal seats: Parliamentary constituencies that have a history of changing hands between parties, or in which the incumbent MP has a very small majority. They are the battlegrounds on which elections can be won or lost. Eleven seats were won by fewer than 100 votes in 2017. N Non-voters: There are usually enough of them across the country that they could have completely overturned the result if they had showed up at the polling station. O “OK boomer”: Joyfully dismissive retort from millennials to the people who enjoyed free education, free healthcare, affordable housing and chunky state pensions, when they start complaining that young people these days spend too much money on avocados and that the country can’t afford any of the things Labour is promising any more. Opinion poll: An attempt to predict the outcome of the election. It usually involves asking about 1,000 people around the country how they voted last time and how they intend to vote this time, and extrapolating a result from that. Our poll tracker shows what people have been saying – that the Tories go into the election as favourites, but that a hung parliament is still a possibility. P Postal vote: If you’ve already posted your vote, it might have already been opened and verified. This sometimes gives political parties a clue as to how they are performing. Don’t mention them to Laura Kuenssberg though. Psephology: A busy night ahead expected for the Is Sir John Curtice On TV? Twitter account. Expect a lot of sightings of the legendary professor giving his view on the numbers as they come in. Psephology is the study of election results and polling numbers, and you’ll be able to follow our own Dan Sabbagh’s view on what it all means on our live blog during the night. Purdah: A much misunderstood term. Once an election is called, civil servants and local government officials aren’t allowed to announce anything that might influence the election. There’s a 41-page guide from the Cabinet Office about what they can and can’t do. It doesn’t prevent media outlets or your Insta stories from getting political. Q Queen’s speech: No, not the one at Christmas that Jeremy Corbyn couldn’t remember if he watched or not, the one in parliament. And yes, we did just have one in October. But we’ll get another one before Christmas, outlining the future plans of whoever has ended up with the keys to 10 Downing Street. Queues: “I’ve never seen queues like it at the polling station.” A regular stream of social media posts at every election since social media began. R Recount: If a vote is close, candidates can ask for a recount. All the ballot papers are checked and counted again until the election officials are satisfied with the result. Returning officer: The returning officer in each area is the person charged with running the election. They are the one who gets to read out the results on national TV. It’s a bit like when they go to the jury from Syldavia in the Eurovision song contest and someone has their 15 seconds of fame. S Safe seat: A seat where the MP has such a large majority that it is almost impossible for them to lose. Speaker: Traditionally, none of the major parties oppose the Commons Speaker in their constituency, so the new Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, can expect to be comfortably re-elected. He is, though, facing a challenge from an independent who has officially changed his name to Mark Brexit-Smith. Swing: In a two-party system, the “swing” is a measure of how much support has shifted from one party to another. If party A were 4% behind party B, they’d need a swing of a fraction over 2% to catch up ie one party loses 2% support, the other party gains 2% support, and that cancels out a 4% lead. The national level of swing has become a less useful figure now that the SNP is dominating elections in Scotland and the Liberal Democrats have established their south-west strongholds. T Tactical voting: Casting a vote for a party you don’t particularly support, because they are more likely to win in your area against a party you definitely don’t support. Tellers: Party activists hanging around outside polling stations asking you for your polling number, so they can cross you off their lists. In tight contests, parties may go round “knocking up” on the doors of people they think might vote for them, to try to propel them down to the polls. Terrible night: Have a shot every time someone says: “These numbers show it has been a terrible night for [INSERT NAME OF THE OTHER PARTY]” and you’ll be drunk and asleep by quarter-past-midnight. Turnout: The turnout figure, usually expressed as a percentage, indicates how many people out of those registered to vote did so. In the 2010s the highest was 2017, with 68.7%, the lowest was 2010, with 65.1%. It is yet to be seen how having the country’s first December election since 1923 will affect the number. U Undecided voters : A problem for opinion pollsters, who often exclude them from their headline figures, and the very people parties have been wooing in their campaigns. In a tight election, it is their last-minute decisions that will shape the next parliament. #UsePens: There’s a persistent social media conspiracy theory that if you use the pencils “they” provide, “their” secret agents come along later, rub out your vote, and replace it with the vote that “they” want. If you are voting today, use pens. V Voter registration: There was a huge push to get voters registered and 2.8m applications were filed after the pre-Christmas election was called. If you haven’t registered to vote it is too late now. But who knows, if the result is indecisive, we might yet end up with another one in April. Sign up to vote in that one here. W Westminster bubble: You’ll have heard the phrase: “Politicians needed to get out of the Westminster bubble and speak to real people.” Today is the day that the “real people” get to speak. Brush up on what that is like with our Anywhere But Westminster video series. X X: The cross you put on your ballot paper to indicate who you want to vote for. Actually a tick, or the word “Yes” or a smiley face would probably count as well. Ballot papers will generally be accepted if there has been a clear intention to vote for one candidate. In the European parliamentary elections, a vote for the Green party was counted after the voter wrote a swear word next to all of the other candidates. Do our quiz to see how much you know about being in charge of an election, which tests you on which ballot papers you would accept. Y Youth vote: Every election there is a huge campaign to get young people and potential first-time voters registered and voting. In 2017, around 57% of those aged 18-19 voted, while 84% of over-70s voted. If younger people vote in large numbers today, they could significantly swing the election. Z Zzzzz: You struggling to stay awake in the early hours of Friday 13 December, waiting for the exit poll to turn into real results. At least you’ll have Andrew Sparrow on our politics live blog for company."

          "headline": "Can DuckDuckGo replace Google search while offering better privacy?",
          "bodyText": "So is DuckDuckGo no good? Surprised you did not mention it. Murray Following last week’s article about privacy and surveillance capitalism, several readers wrote in about the absence of DuckDuckGo, and it was mentioned a dozen times in the comments. I have suggested this privacy-oriented search engine a few times since 2012, and I think it’s worth a go. However, I’m answering Murray’s earlier query along the same lines because I can use his email verbatim rather than cobbling together a joint question from multiple sources. I will admit that Google is generally the best search engine. I was an early adopter and often recommended it. Google was also attractive because its home page wasn’t stuffed with advertising, and because of the company’s old motto: “Don’t be evil”. This was a bit of a jab at competitors, who were said to be “kind of exploiting the users to some extent”. How times change. Google’s prowess at search and its success at selling advertising created a virtuous circle. More users and more money led to bigger indexes of web pages, more servers and faster responses, along with better algorithms created by growing numbers of super-smart computer scientists. Adding Gmail, Maps and the Chrome browser reinforced its power. Nobody else could keep up. Google Search soon became one of the web’s category-defining behemoths along with, for example, Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Gmail, Instagram, YouTube and Wikipedia. Dominant web properties can decline dramatically – it happened to AOL and Yahoo, as Data Is Beautiful’s animated video shows – but most survive for a long time. Theoretically, upstarts can displace incumbents by using new technologies to offer an (initially) inferior but cheaper product to a larger market, as described in Clayton Christensen’s book, The Innovator’s Dilemma. This appears to be impossible with Google Search, because its price is zero and its reach is almost unlimited. (Baidu dominates in China and Yandex is popular in Russia.) Google therefore looks impregnable, unless it loses its grip on the advertising market – no money, no search – or the US government intervenes. Pitching privacy But Google has a weakness, privacy, which DuckDuckGo attacks. Indeed, it describes itself as “the internet privacy company” where Google is obviously “the internet advertising company”. It follows through with a Firefox extension, DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials, its Privacy Weekly newsletter, a blog at spreadprivacy.com, and annual donations to privacy causes. The blog offers practical advice, which includes suggesting alternatives to other Google products. Google Search is free at the point of use, but the company makes more than $100bn (£76bn) a year from advertising based on tracking and targeting users. DuckDuckGo is therefore undercutting Google “on price” by not collecting any information, not storing your searches, and not tracking you across the web. This means it can’t sell personalised advertising, and it can’t deliver personalised search results. Also, governments can’t get your data, because there isn’t any. None the less, DuckDuckGo does have ways to make money, and it is profitable. Mainly, it uses the old idea of selling ads against search queries. If you search for cars, you are likely to see car ads. This is probably how most search engines make most of their money. In a blog post, DuckDuckGo argues that Google’s and Facebook’s business models “don’t need to be this invasive. It is a choice to squeeze every last ounce of profit at the expense of privacy, democracy and society. A choice they don’t have to make. Without all this tracking, I’m confident they would still be among the most profitable companies in the world, and we’d all be better off.” Google search quality Google should deliver the best search results because it has the biggest, freshest index of websites and the smartest search algorithms. However, this does not guarantee the best results. DuckDuckGo can compete because, sometimes, less is more. Personalised search is great in theory but can be flawed in reality. For example, if people are wrong about, say, vaccinations or climate change, personalised search could end up reinforcing their misconceptions instead of correcting them. This is known as the “filter bubble” problem. Also, ultimately, it is more profitable for Google’s algorithms to keep users clicking, even if they end up in a swamp of conspiracy theories on crackpot websites. Of which there are many. Further, even the biggest, freshest web index may have drawbacks. Google’s results can be swamped by blogspam – quick knockoffs of news stories that contain no original thought, and no original reporting. Good quality articles can get buried where hardly anybody will find them. Google tries to deliver the results most people want, which works because most people are terrible at searching. Even half-baked questions can get impressive results. But if you’re an expert searcher, like me, Google’s algorithms can seem to ignore what you’ve typed in. In these circumstances, using the “verbatim” command forces Google to pay attention to the words in my query. It can make an astonishing difference to the results, but why should I have to do that? Google’s search results have also been “gamed” for commercial or political reasons, or just for fun. This year, the “bad writers” of Game of Thrones Season 8 were “Google bombed”. How far can you trust search results when members of a Reddit forum can manipulate them? Life after Google A good guide to DuckDuckGo has been written by its founder, Gabriel Weinberg, on Quora. I’m assuming you will read this, so I don’t have to devote 1,000 words to describing it. Suffice it to say that DuckDuckGo works exactly how you would expect a search engine to work. Of course, you’ll only find out how well DuckDuckGo works for you by trying it. I’ll be amazed if it doesn’t answer more than half your search queries, but if you want a second opinion, you can always send your current search to Google just by putting !g in front of it. No retyping required. The stumbling blocks for me are: (1) DuckDuckGo’s lack of custom date ranges, which both Google and Bing offer; and (2) it doesn’t do reverse image searches, which I use for double-checking pictures posted on Facebook and Twitter. DuckDuckGo is a little less convenient than Google in that, as far as I can tell, you can’t see the options for things like image search, maps, news and shopping without first doing a text search. However, you can send queries to other search engines from DuckDuckGo by using bang (!) commands, as mentioned above. For example, starting a search query with !a will search Amazon, !m will search Google Maps, !r will search Reddit and !w will search Wikipedia. If DuckDuckGo’s ancillary searches don’t work well enough for your purposes, don’t go straight back to Google. Here, Bing Maps and OpenStreetMap are good alternatives to Google Maps. Yandex’s Image Search and reverse image searches are better than Google’s. Bing News is competitive for news. Wolfram Alpha is a great “computation engine” that can do many things better than Google, as well as many things Google cannot do. Finally, if you really don’t like DuckDuckGo’s main search results, there are lots of alternatives. StartPage, Swisscows, Qwant and Yippy are all privacy oriented. Switzerland’s Swisscows can draw “semantic maps” based on filtering results by their contexts (eg Windows OS updates vs windows and doors). France’s Qwant uses the ampersand for the equivalent of bang commands (for example, &amp;a searches Amazon and &amp;w searches Wikipedia). MetaGer and SearX.me are both privacy-respecting metasearch engines, which means they base their results on other search engines. SearX.me is particularly impressive in the options it offers after you have run a search. You will miss a few things if you stop using Google. You will miss far more if you never use anything else.

          "headline": "Is the Conservatives’ plan based on backing Fleetwood Town? It seems niche",
          "bodyText": "Thank God for the sports section. You’ve read the politics. You’ve found out again how depressing the world is and now you get the escapism. Unless you’ve come straight to the sport. Get the fun out of the way and hopefully you’ll have to get back to work before you’re forced to read the serious news. There is no link at all between sport and politics. Both exist in entirely separate vacuums. And that is how it should remain. As a sports broadcaster who has ventured a few – hopefully informed but probably biased – political opinions on social media, it has got to the point where muting the phrase “stick to football” would certainly clear up my notifications. As Jonathan Liew explained this week, steering clear of politics is the safest way for sports people to have an easier life. Whichever side you support, there’ll be a backlash. Yet that hasn’t stopped Andy Pilley, the chairman of Fleetwood Town. In an exhaustive two-tweet video thread on Tuesday evening, Pilley (6,800 followers) explained why it was entirely appropriate for him to use the club’s social media account (83,000 followers) to share his support for the Conservatives. “It’s my role to do what is in the best in interests of Fleetwood Town. I’m the business owner and I care deeply for the town of Fleetwood and for the club.” All seems fair so far and Pilley has been instrumental in taking the club from the ninth tier of English football in the early 2000s into a side punching well above their weight in League One. He has invested millions of pounds and transformed the stadium. He is Fleetwood’s Jack Walker, their Sheikh Mansour. A local hero. “Now what would happen to the football club is it will virtually, definitely lose its league status if the Labour Party was to be elected because the football club would lose its funding …” You what now? Fall out of the league? Lose its funding? Overnight? How does that work? Are Labour pulling funding from lower-league football? How did we not know about this? Fleetwood are on the verge of the play-offs. Does Joey Barton know? That will be quite a blow. I should probably let Pilley finish the sentence. “… the football club would lose its funding from BES which is my core business. So it’s very much in best the interests of Fleetwood Town that the Labour Party are not elected and the Conservatives are elected and they continue to back business and ultimately Fleetwood Town.” Hold on a second. This is the grown-up version of “it’s my ball and I’m taking it home with me”. Is the Conservatives’ entire plan based on ultimately backing Fleetwood Town? It seems pretty niche. Clearly Pilley is a successful businessman and he can choose to do what he likes with his money and his company that operates out of Highbury Stadium. He knows more about business, the north-west and Fleetwood Town than a Guardian journalist who – in an almost cringeworthy cliche – is writing this while drinking a £2.50 Americano at a hipster cafe in the Islington South constituency. What connects us as football fans though, regardless of background or geography or whatever, is an unconditional love of our club. He must love Fleetwood Town. He has done so much for it, so surely he would cope with the inevitable financial crisis he implies would happen. Or at least wait and see if it did happen. Locally, his intervention may well be unsuccessful, given the number of rival supporters who live in the constituency of Fleetwood and Lancaster, where the sitting Labour MP won by more than 6,500 votes in 2017. And it seems harsh on Fleetwood fans, who have less than 24 hours to get out to those marginals across the country. Quick, book an away coach to Esher and Walton to make sure Dominic Raab sees off the Lib Dems. Otherwise, it’s back to the North West Counties League for us. It would certainly be a strange story on Friday morning if Fleetwood suddenly dropped out of the league because Jeremy Corbyn was the prime minister. The club should at least announce it as early as possible, so Gillingham fans can make alternative plans on Saturday. Yet Pilley’s intervention doesn’t appear to be sport’s most curious of this final week of campaigning. Test Match Special’s Dan Norcross spotted a name among those on Twitter pretending to be friends with a nurse at Leeds General Infirmary. “Very interesting. A good friend of mine is a senior nursing sister at Leeds hospital – the boy shown on the floor by the media was in fact put there by his mother who then took photos on her mobile phone and uploaded it to media outlets before he climbed back on his trolley” – a widely circulated message exposed as completely fake. What began from an unknowing middle-aged lady’s Facebook account ended up being tweeted by lots of “people”, including the now defunct account @joetulip. There was a footballer with the name Joe Tulip, best known for his time at Queen of the South. He was one of the first Englishmen to play in the Scottish League. Apparently he was spotted by a Dumfries policeman who was on holiday south of the border and made his debut in November 1933 against Rangers. Despite his death in 1979, he was evidently contacted by his hospital friend and felt the need to tweet from beyond the grave. If the polls are to believed, it seems the late interventions of a League One club chairman and a dead footballer will get the Conservatives over the line and then we can move on to the much more important inevitable voting scandal that will affect all our lives for decades – Sports Personality of the Year. If it goes to another rower or a cyclist the BBC will virtually, definitely, lose its funding. Unless it doesn’t. Until Sunday then."

          "bodyText": "Over the last few days, this year’s Art Basel Miami has been making headlines for a banana. The artwork, worth $120,000 and consisting of one taped to a wall, became an irresistible viral hit, even more so when it was eaten. But beyond the silliness, sustainability was a dominating theme this year at the 17th edition of the week-long art event, which always draws art lovers to over 300 exhibitions, a dozen art fairs and hundreds of VIP parties. Which is ironic, considering Miami art week is probably the most excessive contemporary art event in America; champagne bottles are strewn across South Beach with locals picking up the litter after partygoers, celebrities and art aficionados are long gone. The climate emergency is making a statement at the art fair circuit, pointing fingers at yachts, the luxury lifestyle, automobile pollution and water bottles. But is it sellable? One curator says that protest art isn’t commercial but artists have invested their time regardless. As the Norwegian artist Thale Fastvold recently said: “Science has a communication problem that art can solve.” Here are some artworks doing that precisely. The Zero-Waste Party Potentially the first ever zero-waste art party in Miami featured locally sourced food, biodegradable plastic forks and wooden plates. The table flowers were donated to the local botanical garden, with the leftover food donated to local missions. Set inside the Miami Beach Botanical Garden, it was hosted by Brooklyn artist Shinique Smith, who creates sculptures from secondhand clothing. The aim was to celebrate the United Nations’ sustainability goals; responsible consumption and production, and was co-presented by UBS and the #TogetherBand campaign, which helps the world move towards sustainability goals. Traffic Jam The art world can be an insular place so there’s something to be said for art that goes beyond the white cube which makes this public art installation by the Argentinian artist Leandro Erlich even more of an eye-grabber. Set on South Beach at Lincoln Road, 66 life-sized cars made of sand were created to form a traffic jam. The artwork, entitled Order of Importance, is a project centered around the climate emergency. According to the artist, the climate crisis requires immediate action, and Erlich wanted to raise awareness of our responsibility to protect the planet. A commission of the city of Miami Beach, and curated by Ximena Caminos and Brandi Reddick, the sand cars will stand until they deteriorate, though the exhibition closes on 15 December. The Museum of Plastic This pop-up exhibit, set inside of a conference room of a five-star hotel, is hosted by the ocean conservancy not-for-profit, Lonely Whale. With LED screens, pedestals and sculptures, it aims to highlight the effects of plastic pollution. One of the artworks is a gigantic receipt detailing how the $200bn that makes up the water bottle industry could better be spent, be it helping kids graduate from high school or stopping deforestation. The main critique here is on water bottles. “We use 500 billion single-use plastic bottles every year, it’s an insane number,” said Dune Ives, executive director of Lonely Whale. “We know the plastic packaging market is continuing to grow over next 15 years and will come from oil and gas extraction. For us, this exhibition is an important way to bring together the climate emergency, ocean health and plastic conversation in a tangible way. It’s where people can make a decision and have a direct impact.” Coral Reef by Everglades Art Lab Another project that taps into ocean pollution is Coral Projects: Everglades Art Lab, an eco-art project spearheaded by the Brooklyn artist Vanessa Albury. Along with a group of artists, she used her booth at the UNTITLED Miami Beach art fair to promote an upcoming underwater project, where they’re making a coral reef out of ceramic, glass and reusable aluminum, which will launch at the Oracabessa Bay Fish Sanctuary in Jamaica next year. “What I have learned is that we all want the planet to be OK, and we all want to be part of a positive impact,” said Albury. “The idea is that art can help, brings relief.” Presented by Benrubi Gallery, it features artworks by Albury, Rachel Frank, Thale Fastvold and Tanja Thorjussen with the Reverend Houston Cypress of Love the Everglade. The group are inspired by the ocean advocate and marine biologist Sylvia Earle. “The planet is resilient, so is nature and those who have witnessed the worst still have hope,” adds Albury. James Clar Art fair booths either go one of two ways: they’re typically painted all white or are loud bursts of color. The New York artist James Clar decided to go halfway. His new series of climate-centered work at the Jane Lombard Gallery booth at the UNTITLED Miami Beach art fair is set in a booth painted with the bottom half blue, citing rising sea levels, with the top half white. The artworks in Dynamic Entities range from LED lights cast in resin to videos of tropical storms and burning flames. One of the minimalist, abstract sculptures is named after the Kardashev scale, a 1964 model created by the Russian astrophysicist Nikola Kardashev, which was created to measure a society’s technological advancement in relation to their energy consumption. One artwork is a screen cast in resin, depicting a water bubble floating to the surface, while another is titled 100% Humidity. Paper Pulp Furniture At the Design Miami art fair, the Berlin-based Functional Art Gallery shook things up. Typically, galleries at any art fair are either design (furniture or lighting) or art (paintings and sculptures). Rarely do they ever cover both. The (Functional) Art of This Century blurs the line, with a series of chairs that point to reusable materials as the future of art and design-making. As the gallery’s founder Benoît Wolfrom explains: “The art world is asking, ‘How do we reduce our carbon footprint?’ But the younger generation are using what they have access to, and is asking themselves, ‘How do we move on as a civilization?’” All of the works here are made by recycled materials. Among them, a sturdy chair made of cardboard pulp is created by OrtaMiklos, while Donna Huano and Theophile Blandet made a plastic chair from parts an industrial factory. Artist Leo Orta created a lion dog chair from 1990s landline phones and foam. “Young artists and designers don’t even think about making environmental art, they’re already there,” said Wolfrom. Climate Meltdown One of the most compelling artworks during Miami artwork is at a hotel, oddly enough. The Brazilian artist Rubem Robierb has created a melting ice sculpture inspired by the climate emergency speech Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist, recently gave at the United Nations. The words “How Dare You,” carved out of two tons of ice, and stretching 36ft, floated across the pool at the Shore Club South Beach, before melting. The goal, says the artist, is to confront the old systems of living, which are being met with frustration by a younger generation. This artwork only lasted eight hours, though. The point? “I was impressed by Greta Thunberg’s powerful and courageous speech at the UN – when I saw it, I knew I had to do something about our planet, said Robierb. “My mission as an artist is to open difficult conversations. Climate change is the biggest issue of all time because it affects every living being on our planet.”"

          "bodyText": "A gust of cinnamon from a pine-wreathed glühwein stand while the carousel plays Frosty the Snowman, and neon snowflakes decorate the neoclassical columns. A Pavlovian sense of festivity fights with my inner Scrooge. On the journey, there were still smudges of autumnal ochre on the wooded hills outside the train window. But Oxford, an hour’s ride from London’s Marylebone station, is in Christmas mode. I’m planning festive cultural tourism in my old home city, including visits to places in Philip Pullman’s books; His Dark Materials is currently enlivening Sunday nights as a BBC One drama. First stop is the Ashmolean Museum, 10 minutes’ walk from Oxford station. The world’s first museum has had a £61m revamp in the last decade and ancient treasures are newly revealed. The Last Supper in Pompeii exhibition (adult £12.25, 12-17s £6, until 12 January 2020) recreates Roman feasts from mosaics, rusty pruning hooks and carbonised pomegranates. Next up is a display of maps in the Bodleian’s new Weston Library (free, until 8 March 2020). There’s CS Lewis’s sketch map of Narnia and a Victorian “drink map” of Oxford showing all the pubs, such as the centuries-old White Horse next door, visited by crime writer Colin Dexter’s Inspector Morse character and Pullman’ Lyra Belacqua. Over the road, I climb into the Sheldonian Theatre’s cupola (£3.80) for an all-round view of the city’s towers and bridges. The university’s 39 self-governing colleges each have stuff to explore, from the marble statue of drowned Shelley in University College to Christopher Wren’s sundial outside All Souls. I’m visiting just one: Exeter, Pullman’s alma mater and the model for his fictional Jordan College. It is open to visit, free, most afternoons. I wander into the jewel-like chapel with its stained glass and William Morris tapestry, before heading out to the garden bench (where Lyra sits) overlooking Radcliffe Square. Seeing the cobbles from this odd angle, framed by an exotic strawberry tree on the high garden wall, feels like wandering into a parallel universe. There’s a similar strangeness stepping out of the wintry Botanic Garden (adult £5.45, under 16s free) into the steamy hothouses, full of pitcher plants and water lilies. Two minutes away, Keepers Kitchen and Bar opened earlier this year in the Mercure Eastgate hotel, where I’m staying (and where JRR Tolkien dined). The bee-themed restaurant likes to flavour dishes with Cotswold honey, including the keepers pizza with roast veg and rocket (£11.95) and a honey bubble cocktail, featuring vodka, raspberries and prosecco (£8.50). Next day is cold and grey. Perfect for a culture crawl, my excuse to visit log-fire-warmed pubs while wandering three miles up the Thames to Wolvercote. I’m too early for the Eagle and Child, meeting place of the Inklings (a literary group that included CS Lewis and Tolkien), but there’s great coffee and brownies at Common Ground, which popped up round the corner on Little Clarendon Street last year. On through the Jericho neighbourhood and into the sandalwood-scented, byzantine interior of St Barnabas church, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary with music and festivals. The church features in Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure and was commissioned by Thomas Combe, an early patron of the pre-Raphaelites. Hardy worked for the architect here in the 1860s. More recently, the writer Heathcote Williams lived nearby. His polemic Boris Johnson: The Beast of Brexit (2016) was posthumously reissued this summer and his equally prescient Autogeddon (1991) inveighed against the lethal tyranny of cars. Strolling up the canal and over Port Meadow, I reach riverside Binsey with its thatched pub, The Perch (another Morse and Inklings favourite), where Lewis Carroll first gave readings of Alice in Wonderland. Gerard Manley Hopkins’ 1879 poem, Binsey Poplars, lamented the felling of local trees and the human tendency to “hack and rack the growing green”. The Thames Path is still just passable heading north but there is currently floodwater on both sides. Swans, gulls, geese and cormorants crowd onto grassy islands and the line of spires and domes fades into misty distance. Another mile along the river, I pass ruined Godstow Priory and the Trout Inn, with its peacock-haunted garden, and follow the road into Wolvercote village for tea at beamed Jacob’s Inn. The Oxford Bus Company’s (one of the UK’s greenest) No 6 runs from nearby Home Close every 15 minutes back into Oxford (£2.30). Later, I catch the No 3 eastwards to meet friends at the Magdalen Arms, a gastropub that offers a early evening menu with a glass of house wine for £12 (Mon-Fri 5.30pm-6.30pm). We try some delicious things à la carte, the most memorable being a melting pear and almond tart (£6.60). Lots of Oxford’s best restaurants are in the east, such as bakery-cafe Silvie or the Sri Lankan Coconut Tree. I take the Stagecoach S3 bus to Woodstock on my last day, for a walk round the Blenheim estate, one of Capability Brown’s largest landscape designs. The palace has newly transformed itself into an enjoyably OTT Alice-in-Wonderland fantasia (until 5 Jan): every corridor is a wintry extravaganza and a clockwork Queen of Hearts rotates beside the state-room tapestries. Jaunty ragtime music serenades a Mad Hatter’s tea party in the Long Library, where projected playing cards swirl across portraits of Queen Anne and the 1st Duke of Marlborough. Blenheim (palace, park and gardens £27, 5-16s £16, family 2+2 £67.50) offers 30% off regular entry to people who get here by public transport and, working with Good Journey, attracted more than 20,000 extra car-free visitors in 2019. There are buses back to Oxford until late. The No 7 stops at Oxford Parkway, an out-of-town station that opened in 2015 with regular trains to London, so I can stay and see the spectacular mile-long trail of Christmas lights that winds through Blenheim’s gardens (£20, no bus discount, until 1 Jan). There are lasers, pulsing vines, tunnels of pea lights, a rose garden full of flaming torches, and the spot-lit bust of Winston Churchill, who was born here. For me, the most beautiful moments are when the lights enhance the existing landscape: the floodlit intricacies of a craggy oak or stately cedar, the rainbow incandescence of a winter-fierce waterfall, crossed by a twinkling bridge. Even my inner Scrooge is enchanted. • Train travel provided by Chiltern Railways (advance single tickets from London to Oxford from £5.40).

          "bodyText": "As we draw the line under 2019, fires burn out of control along the east coast of Australia fuelling an end-of-days haze that our leaders choose to shrug off. The smoke that obliterates the harbour city’s beauty and stings the back of our throats is an obvious metaphor for the year. The question is: what is its meaning? Maybe it’s as literal as the harbinger of climate inaction, a final warning that if politicians choose to ignore science then science will inevitably prevail; that if the leaders of fire services entreaties’ to prepare for the worst fall on deaf ears it will be no surprise when things get out of hand. As the blood moon glows maybe our God-fearing leader will consult the prophecy from the Book of Joel that “the sun will turn into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes” and conclude this is not the work of the woke but those who are asleep at the wheel. Maybe it’s a caution to both this leader – who proudly fondles coal and boasts of meeting unmet targets in a canter, who leads a Coalition that has wilfully destroyed a climate consensus and reaped its political dividend – and to his vanquished opponents grappling with whether to stay on the right side of history or have a bet each way. Or maybe the metaphor is more prosaic, that the haze is a tribute to the PM’s mastery at obscuring reality and harnessing disengagement in the pursuit and ultimate attainment of power. We would start with the way he confected a budget surplus before it had been achieved, conjured a $387bn tax hike out of thin air, and turned a disunited rabble into the safe alternative to death taxes and a war on the weekend and the Bill we couldn’t afford. We would stretch the analogy to describe the way he has invited the public to think of themselves as noble and quiet Australians who are happy to stand back as unions and charities and environmentalists and even lawyers have their rights to promote their public discourse whittled away. And the haze would obscure the fact that what is happening here is happening around the globe, as privately owned social platforms usurp the traditional safeguards of democracy, spreading lies and anger that create the climate for authoritarian populists. But looking at the final Essential Report of the year, I think the metaphor speaks to something even more profound. When it comes to our personal life, things have muddled along, OK or average for most Australians – the family, work, even finance – the majority are not complaining too much. This accords with my caution in the final week before the election when, despite all polls (mine included) predicting a narrow Labor win, there was a general mood of happiness across an electorate living in one of the most affluent nations in the wealthiest moment in human history. Of course there is nothing wrong with personal happiness – indeed it is something we should all aspire to – but what strikes me with this table is a growing disconnect between our personal world and the one that sustains it. You can see it in the ways the satisfaction with the year dips when we start talking about institutions, such as unions, the government and more abstract concepts like politics and the economy. While we are doing all right, we don’t extend that optimism to the things that bind us as a society. And as we zoom out the picture gets even more bleak. The planet is in strife and we know it. Except we are still doing OK so there’s no need to do anything now. My “smoke as 2019” metaphor then? The most striking thing about the weeks of fire has been the way we Sydneysiders have come to ignore it and carry on regardless, inhabitants of a wealthy international city, kidding ourselves we are immune to broader debates, that the things that go on in Canberra are, as Scott Morrison would have us accept, just part of some bubble of make believe. But when it’s unsafe for kids to play outside, or old folk to shop, or planes to take off, then it all becomes real. The smoke that makes it impossible to see across our harbour reminds us there are consequences to the decisions we make at elections and the decisions our elected representative subsequently make on our behalf. When unions are weakened, wages flatline and the economy stalls; when refugees are denied medical support, people die and we lose our moral compass; when coal burns, climates change, the Earth becomes more fragile, homes burn down and people die. 2019 was such a challenging year for progressives because we failed, and now we must deal with the consequences of those failures. When – if – the smoke finally clears it’s on us to regroup and meet our obligations to do better in 2020 as citizens and forebears of generations to come. • Peter Lewis is an executive director of Essential"

          "bodyText": "Here’s a quick afternoon summary of today’s events. Jeremy Corbyn declined to disclose the source of documents used as evidence that the NHS would be “on the table” in a post-Brexit UK/US trade deal, after Reddit warned of a link to a Russian interference campaign. The forum issued a statement on Friday night saying that the documents had been posted on their site in late October. “We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia,” it said. The Labour leader today declined to respond to a question of where Labour obtained the documents from: We obtained those documents. We believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else. The father of a man killed in the London Bridge attack has accused Boris Johnson of lying and making “political capital” from his son’s death during the BBC leaders’ debate. David Merritt – whose son Jack was stabbed to death by convicted terrorist Usman Khan – called the prime minister a fraud following his appearance on Friday night’s TV debate, six days before polling day. “Johnson lied and used our son’s death to make political capital,” Merritt said in a thread posted on Twitter on Saturday. The Conservatives are investigating three parliamentary candidates over antisemitism and are facing calls to suspend them before the election. – Sally-Ann Hart, standing in the Tory marginal seat of Hastings, shared a video with an image implying that the billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, controls the EU, and she also liked a Nazi slogan on Facebook. – Lee Anderson, standing for the Conservatives in Labour-held Ashfield, is an active member of Ashfield Backs Boris, a Facebook group where Soros conspiracy theories have been promoted and which includes supporters of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson. – Richard Short, the candidate for St Helens South and Whiston, is being investigated for asking whether a Jewish journalist was more loyal to Israel than to Britain. The Labour party has pledged to electrify England’s entire bus fleet by 2030, promising to bring services “into the future”. Jeremy Corbyn said “the Westminster bubble” didn’t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people “isolated and stuck at home”. His party plans to electrify all of England’s 35,000 buses by 2030, reducing their emissions by 72%, and fund a reverse in the cuts to services as well as creating new ones. Boris Johnson was asked about the case of serial rapist Joseph McCann, after the probation service apologised for “failings” that enabled him to carry out a series of attacks on women and children. Asked whether anyone in government should take responsibility, he said: I think it’s an absolutely appalling case and shows that there is something very wrong and what we’re going to do is, what I’ve said for a long, long time, is that we want to review the way sentencing takes place and the way sentences are served. And at the moment, the automatic early release at the halfway point for serious sexual and violent offenders is totally wrong, and I said that back in August, and we’re going to stop that. We have a bill ready to go, in parliament, if we can get a working majority on Thursday, we will not only get Brexit done, we will get other things done, including that. (Here is some useful analysis by the Guardian’s home affairs correspondent Jamie Grierson, arguing that the key issue in the McCann case is not actually his initial sentence but its management.) Johnson repeated that he thought terrorists should have to serve their full sentences, following from the London Bridge attack last Friday. I also think that, as I’ve said, the terrorists will serve their full sentence but when it comes to this individual case we have to look at exactly what happened and we have to make sure we do not have a continual habit of early release for really serious sexual and violent offenders. That doesn’t mean you can’t have rehabilitation, it doesn’t mean you can’t do things to ensure you keep people out of prison. You can do all sorts of things to work with young people to get their lives back on track, but when someone commits a serious sexual or violent offence they should not be released early. Such comments today provoked more furious criticism from David Merritt – whose son Jack was killed in the attack – who used a thread on Twitter to say the prime minister “used our son’s death to make political capital”. You can read the full story here: While we’re on the topic – Johnson has been asked again about the parliamentary committee report on potential Russian interference in the EU referendum and the 2017 general election, which he has refused to publish. Well I can repeat what I’ve already said about this, many times, which is that, I know of no evidence of any successful interference by Russia in any democratic event in this country and on the report, we (are) obviously just complying with the normal timetable for releasing such things and I saw no reason to release it earlier just because there was an election going on. Corbyn is speaking about the leaked document on US trade talks, which he says shows the US would demand access to the health market in Britain and access to our public services. He says that the Conservatives are now saying those documents aren’t real. (The Conservative line is actually that the documents don’t show what Labour says they do, not that they are not real.) Corbyn says: A week later they claim that somebody else wrote these documents. Well, it seems a very strange turn of events that, first of all, you get a refusal to publish the documents – so you get the redacted version, which did confirm that all the meetings had taken place. Then you get the American version, which shows they did take place. Then you get the version which was given to me, which I produced for the public interest, which suddenly, this morning, is apparently an invention by somebody else. I tell you what it’s in their imagination. They are up to their dirty tricks with our NHS, our services, our lives and our market in the future. No Labour government will ever sell our National Health Service. It is simply not for sale. Just to be clear, the suggestion is that the documents were first posted on Reddit by an account which was part of a campaign directed by Moscow. Here’s Reddit’s statement from last night: “We were recently made aware of a post on Reddit that included leaked documents from the UK. We investigated this account and the accounts connected to it and today we believe this was part of a campaign that has been reported as originating from Russia.” Jeremy Corbyn says he was proud to go to Iain Duncan Smith’s constituency of Chingford and Woodford Green and say that a Labour government would scrap universal credit. He says we need “a real living wage” for all workers, including young workers. On the NHS, Corbyn says that Johnson seemed annoyed yesterday when he mentioned that the Conservatives voted against its creation 41 times. “The Welsh Labor government has been grotesquely underfunded by the Westminster government,” says Corbyn. It would be so much better with a Labour government in Westminster working with a Labour government in Wales, he says. On the issue of compensating the Waspi women, he says the media often ask him how he can afford the policy. “Well I’m sorry, it’s a moral responsibility,” says Corbyn. He says Michael Gove doesn’t like him very much. There are boos from the crowd. “It’s ok, it’s ok. They don’t call me marmite for nothing,” says Corbyn. He talks about Labour’s plans for a “green revolution”. “You cannot go on watching species being extinct and forests burned in Latin America and West Africa,” he says. He says he wants a Labour government to host COP26 and “to go further and faster then Paris envisaged”. “At the current rate we won’t reach emissions targets until 2099,” he says. Jeremy Corbyn is talking at an event in Swansea. He’s talking about the linking of music and art with socialist ideas to “create the kind of society we want to create”. He pays tribute to his favourite poet, Dylan Thomas, from Swansea. You can watch it live here. Boris Johnson has abandoned a walkabout in Westhoughton, Lancashire, after about 100 protesters took to the town’s high street along with a large screen with a photo of the prime minister with Donald Trump. “Have they just done the UK’s biggest drug deal?” it asked. The PM had planned to meet voters in the marginal Bolton West constituency, taken by the Tories’ Chris Green in 2015 after holding off Labour’s Julie Hilling by just 936 votes in 2017. But after the Tory battle bus arrived in town it was decided that the visit should be abandoned, amid the presence of protesters. The demonstrators, some of whom were from the Socialist Worker newspaper and holding banners saying: “No to Racism, No to Boris Johnson”, had lined the high street where the walkabout was expected to take place. Instead, Johnson travelled back to London by car after his trip to the north-west on Saturday and his battle bus also headed south. Jo Swinson has insisted she would not quit as leader of the Liberal Democrats leader if the party fails to make significant gains in the general election. Asked if she would stand down in such circumstances, Swinson said: No, because I have just been elected as leader of the Liberal Democrats four months ago with an overwhelming majority. We have got more members than we have ever had before and we are running a strong campaign. So, people have got confidence in my leadership and I’m excited to be doing the job. Boris Johnson has been asked about the issue of a potential Russian link to the NHS documents while on a campaign event in Cheshire. Well I do think we need to get to the bottom of that. As far as I am aware we haven’t yet established the truth about that, but what I certainly think is that document, whatever it was intended to prove, did not prove what Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party hoped it would prove. And I’m afraid it was just another distraction. Jeremy Corbyn has been asked about Reddit’s announcement that documents used by Labour as evidence that the NHS would be on the table in a post-Brexit US trade deal were posted by an account linked to a disinformation campaign directed by Moscow. (See our story here.) He was asked to respond to the suggestion that Labour had either directly or indirectly benefited from a Russian trolling operation. This is such nonsense. This is such an advanced state of rather belated conspiracy theories by the prime minister. When we released the documents, at no stage did the prime minister or anybody deny that those documents were real, deny the arguments that we put forward. And if there has been no discussion with the US about access to our health markets, if all of that is wrong, how come after a week they still haven’t said that? The issues are that those documents show exactly what the British government is doing in discussions with Donald Trump’s administration in the USA and also why the prime minister has refused to release the report on Russian interference in British politics, which he’s been sitting on for a very long time. He refused to say from where the Labour party had obtained the documents. We obtained those documents. We believed those documents to be correct and nobody until yesterday denied the correctness of those documents. The issue is there should be no interference in British politics by anybody else. The prime minister has answers to give, which he refuses to do, about Russian donations to the Tory party or the report that he is sitting on about Russian interference in British politics. Of course there should be no interference in our British political system by Donald Trump or the Russians. More photo ops on the campaign trail. You can watch a live stream of Jeremy Corbyn making a latte on a visit to a cafe in Swansea here: Boris Johnson has been visiting Cheadle, near Stockport, where he attended a junior girls’ soccer match between Hazel Grove United U10s and Poynton Juniors u10s. The PA news agency has been following Nigel Farage on his visit to Sedgefield in County Durham. The Brexit party leader donned a hard hat and protective glasses as he visited the factory of Tolley Fabrications, a company specialising in aluminium, stainless steel and super-duplex fabrications. He was asked by a worker who he trusted most out of Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn . “Do you know something, that’s the most difficult question I’ve been asked,” he responded. “I’ve known Boris on and off for 25 years, and he is a likeable, entertaining personality. Would you absolutely trust him? No.” When asked whether the prime minister could be trusted to deliver Brexit, Farage said: ‘Get Brexit done’ is an attractive line to a country where a lot of people are utterly cheesed off that this has been going on for three-and-a-half years. The idea that somebody’s going to wave a magic wand is very appealing, and if it was true I would support him 100%. But it’s not. If he passes the withdrawal agreement unamended, we go into three more years of agony. It will be Brexit in name only, but we’ll still be stuck with all the European rules and regulations, with no say whatsoever and with a huge bill. Here is the latest piece of polling analysis by Dan Sabbagh, defence and security editor and our resident polling expert for the election. A week to go before the election and the Conservative vote appears to have peaked. The party’s share hit 42% about a fortnight ago and has not advanced since – a level that is intriguingly similar to the 42.34% result achieved by Theresa May in the last general election. The party now dominates the leave vote – with a 69% share, according to ICM’s analysis published this week – following the effective surrender of Nigel Farage in the early part of the campaign. Essentially, the Conservatives’ five-point improvement during the campaign has been almost entirely at the Brexit party’s expense. Friends of the Earth has judged that Labour has the most impressive environmental policies of any of the main UK-wide political parties. The organisation examined the manifestos of the Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrats and Green parties and scored each against their election asks, which covered 10 areas, including climate targets, energy, transport, food and nature. The manifestos were marked out of 45. They said: The final assessment saw Labour, Lib Dems and Greens all marked highly, but with the Labour party given a slightly higher score overall. The Conservative party scored poorly: its manifesto was judged to be missing significant commitments in numerous areas, inadequate policies in others, and actively damaging policies in transport. Here were the final scores: Labour: 33 Green: 31 Liberal Democrat: 30 Conservatives: 5.5 Dave Timms, Friends of the Earth’s head of political affairs, said: Environmental issues have been given greater priority in this election than ever before – and with the world in the midst of an ecological and climate crisis this must be the next government’s top priority. Many of the policies that Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Green party have put forward are commensurate with, or striving to meet, the challenges we face. It is disappointing we have not yet seen the same urgency, ambition or consistency from the Conservative party. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, has also been on both the Today programme and Sky News. He’s been setting out Labour’s plans to electrify England’s entire bus fleet. You can read the story here: In the light of claims that UK government documents leaked online – and used by Labour to hammer home their argument about NHS vulnerability in post-Brexit US/UK trade talks – could have been subject to Russian interference, McDonald said it would be perfectly legitimate to hold an inquiry. I think that’s perfectly legitimate. I think what interests me particularly is the content of the documents. He called on the government to publish the report by parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC) into possible Russian interference in the UK democratic process. If we want to get to the bottom of the extent to which the Russian state interferes in elections, can we please publish the Intelligence and Security Committee report? Let’s get that out there. That should have been published ages ago. Here’s a roundup of what is happening on the campaign trail today. Today is “small business Saturday”, so expect the party leaders to be setting out their offerings to small business owners. Boris Johnson is visiting north-west England, although his exact plans have not yet been disclosed. Jeremy Corbyn takes the Labour campaign to Wales, touring the country and appearing at a rally. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson will visit Hertfordshire to discuss her policies with small businesses to try to convince them to back her party. The Brexit party leader, Nigel Farage, travels to Sedgefield in County Durham, where he will also meet business representatives. The outgoing culture secretary, Nicky Morgan, has been speaking to broadcasters this morning about the Conservative party’s pledge to invest £550m in grassroots football. (You can read the BBC story here.) She told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that it was “extremely serious” that leaked documents – used by Labour to claim that the US wanted NHS to be included in future trade deals – could be linked to a Russian disinformation campaign. You can read the background here: I understand from what was being put on that website, those who seem to know about these things say that it seems to have all the hallmarks of some form of interference. And if that is the case, that obviously is extremely serious. And actually as culture secretary, obviously one of the things that we are looking for and monitoring is any interference in our elections. She was later asked by Sky News why, if they were so concerned about Russian interference, had No 10 blocked the publication of a report examining the country’s infiltration of British politics. She said it had been a matter of timing and the speed with which parliament had been dissolved. “There hasn’t been a parliament to publish that report to,” she said. All I can say is the government, obviously, is taking steps. We are very aware of the potential for overseas interference and watching very carefully through lots of different channels as to what potentially might be going on. Here’s a video of the highlights from last night’s debate – Good morning and welcome to the politics live blog on the morning after Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson went head-to-head in a BBC debate. The party leaders clashed over Islamophobia and antisemitism in their parties, with both accusing the other of “a failure of leadership”. Johnson said: “I think that Mr Corbyn’s handling of this particular issue, his unwillingness to take a stand and stand up for Jewish people in the Labour party and put an arm round them is a failure of leadership.” Corbyn hit back: “A failure of leadership is when you use racist remarks to describe people from different countries or in our society. I will never do that … I hope that the prime minister understands the hurt that people feel when they hear remarks and articles he has written.” You can read the full write-up from the Guardian’s deputy political editor, Rowena Mason, and political correspondent Kate Proctor here. And political correspondent Peter Walker has an assessment of who won the debate here. A snap poll from YouGov found 52% of Britons asked after watching the debate believed Johnson won and 48% Corbyn. The pollster said it fell within the margin of error and so could be considered another draw. Those surveyed said Corbyn was more trustworthy than Johnson by 48% to 38% but Johnson was considered more prime ministerial by 54% to 30%. We have fact-checked claims made by the two party leaders. I’ll be here to guide you through the day’s political developments. You can tweet at me on @fperraudin and comment below."

          "bodyText": "The fun of planning, cooking and eating delicious food comes into its element at Christmas. I love thinking about what we might eat at every stage – with allowances for long, brisk walks peppered between feasting. If I can make anything in advance, I will: a smoky chilli raisin relish for ham; a delicious compote for breakfasts; some spiced nuts for drinks; every breakfast, lunch and dinner is an opportunity to eat something special. Although we often have beef, this year we are having a turkey, in homage to Mexico. If you are many, a standard size will do well, but otherwise you could opt for an extra-small bird (KellyBronze do an approximate 2kg one, and Copas a 4kg one), meaning less cooking and a lot less leftovers. Happy Christmas. Baby roast turkey with fino sherry, apricot and thyme stuffing rotolo I love cooking the stuffing separately from the bird: it makes the cooking quicker, and the rolled stuffing looks spectacular on the table. If you have a larger bird, consider cutting away the legs and freezing them to cook another day: I love to slow-roast them at 170C (150C fan)/gas 3 and serve with a richly spiced tomato sauce. You could also confit them. You will need a 30cm x 40cm sheet each of greaseproof paper and tin foil, and two baking trays. Prep 15 min Cook 2hr 15 min Serves 8 1 extra-small bronze turkey (ours was 2kg) 2 carrots, peeled and chopped 2 onions, peeled and chopped 2 sticks celery, diced 1 glass white wine For the rotolo 3 tbsp olive oil 200g pork mince Salt and pepper 2 medium onions, peeled and finely chopped (about 200g) 6 fat garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 small bunch thyme, leaves stripped from half 10 sage leaves ½ nutmeg, grated 75g butter, softened 150g turkey and chicken livers 3-4 tbsp fino sherry 100g dried apricots, chopped 50g breadcrumbs 120g smoked streaky bacon First, make the stuffing roll (you can do this a day or two ahead). Heat a heavy-based saucepan on a high heat, then add a tablespoon of oil, followed by the mince. Season generously and brown the mince, breaking it up into small pieces with a spoon – about three to four minutes – then tip into a bowl. Add the rest of the oil to the pan and sweat the onions on a medium-high heat for seven to eight minutes, until translucent. Turn the heat down a little, add half the garlic and thyme, and all the sage, then season again generously with salt, pepper and the nutmeg. Cook for five minutes more, then add to the pork. Turn the heat right up and, once the pan is smoking hot, add a quarter of the butter. Season the livers generously, add to the pan and quickly brown on all sides – about a minute (they will cook through in the oven). Add to the pork, then deglaze the pan with the sherry, letting it bubble for about 30 seconds, before pouring the reduction into the mixing bowl. Cut up the livers with a pair of scissors, and stir in the apricots and breadcrumbs. Season to taste, remembering that you will be wrapping the stuffing in salty bacon. Lay a 30cm x 40cm sheet of foil on a board with a sheet of greaseproof paper the same size on top. Butter the middle of the paper with another quarter of the butter, then lay out the bacon, slightly overlapping, along the length of the paper. Spoon the stuffing along the length of the bacon, shaping it into a fat sausage. With the help of the paper, gently roll up the stuffing, using extra bacon to patch up any holes, so the sausage is entirely enveloped. Chill for up to two days, and take it out half an hour before you want to cook it. Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)/gas 4. Season the turkey inside and out with salt, pepper and the rest of the butter. Put the vegetables in a roasting tray with the rest of the thyme and garlic, season generously and put the turkey on top. Pour in half the wine and roast for an hour. After half an hour, put in the stuffing. When the meat hits 55C, remove and rest, covered, somewhere warm for half an hour. Turn up the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6, unwrap the stuffing and roast for a final 15 minutes. Make a gravy using the vegetables and juices in the turkey pan and the remaining wine, and serve with the bird and the stuffing. Fiona Beckett’s drink match Any favourite red you’d normally drink with the turkey would work here, and for that I generally look to the Rhône. Aldi has a 2018 Vinsobres (14.5%) that, at £7.99, is hard to beat for value, or try the smart-looking Les Cardinaux 2017 (13.5%), from Famille Perrin, which is currently £10 at the Co-op and Tesco, but will be on promotion at the former for a bargainous £7 from next Wednesday.

          "bodyText": "The Labour party has pledged to electrify England’s entire bus fleet by 2030, promising to bring services “into the future”. Jeremy Corbyn said “the Westminster bubble” didn’t care about buses, despite the fact that so many people rely on them. He said the Conservatives had overseen the cancellation or reduction of 3,000 routes across the country leaving people “isolated and stuck at home”. His party plans to electrify all of England’s 35,000 buses by 2030, reducing their emissions by 72%, and fund a reverse in the cuts to services as well as creating new ones. Labour has pledged to give local authorities the power to regulate bus services and create council-owned bus companies, allowing them to bring down the cost of tickets. In areas where bus services are brought into public control, bus travel would be free to under-25s. “The Westminster bubble doesn’t care about buses but cuts to bus routes leave so many people isolated, stuck at home and unable to make vital trips out,” said Corbyn. “Away from London, many people have approached me in this election to talk about their local bus route closing down. “This policy will bring our bus services into the future and help to revitalise our high streets and rebuild local communities. We want people to be proud of their local bus service.” Approximately 700 of the 35,000 buses in England are currently electric, most of which are in London. Labour calculates that the cost of electrifying the rest of the fleet over a 10-year period would be under £4bn, and would be funded through their £250bn Green Transformation Fund. The party said its costing was based on analysis of the price difference between electric and conventional buses, and included estimates for reimbursing owners of conventional buses for retiring the vehicles early. Based on the 2018 average electricity grid mix, electric buses create 72% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel buses. The shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, accused the Conservative party of not caring about “buses nor the people and communities who rely on them”. “The Tories’ manifesto didn’t pledge a penny to reverse a decade of cuts to local bus services,” he said. “Buses are by far the most used and most important form of public transport but huge budget cuts have caused bus use to plummet to an all time low.” The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, hit back, saying: “Labour’s war on the motorist continues apace.” “Labour won’t be able to deliver a modern bus network because they would raid the roads’ budget and scrap vital new roads and upgrades to fund their fantasy giveaways,” he said. “Corbyn’s Labour would bring gridlock to our roads and gridlock to parliament with their plans for another two chaotic referendums next year.”"

          "headline": "Every time Morrison invokes the 'Canberra bubble', he undermines parliament itself",
          "bodyText": "As the parliamentary year limps to a close, there’s a gear shift in Australian politics that we really shouldn’t miss. Scott Morrison is posing a mind-focusing question, one I haven’t seen a prime minister pose before, and the question is this: does parliament matter? Do the institutions and conventions of politics matter? Our story needs to start with the bubble. Morrison’s deliberate devaluing of his own ecosystem, the vocation of politics, began with creating a crime scene, then distancing himself from it. Donald Trump had the swamp. Morrison invoked the bubble. Canberra was the bubble. The bubble works, conceptually, as a brand, because a lot of voters believe it exists. Because voters feel alienated by politics, and perceive a lot of what goes on in parliament as either derangement or rank self-indulgence, Morrison can invoke the bad place, plausibly, and style himself as the person to set it right. Bad business, that bubble. Just as well I showed up. Morrison’s bubble is multipurpose: both sword, shield, and safety deposit box. The bubble is invoked to malign conduct from opponents he finds inconvenient, and to deflect questions he doesn’t want to answer. Anything not to the prime minister’s liking can also be confined to the bubble. That’s a bubble preoccupation. A bubble question. Don’t waste my valuable time. Don’t expect an answer. You’d laugh at the audacity of all this, it would be a hoot, this jape, except it’s not funny. The bubble language is not invoked constructively, to try and drag a rancid, rotting institution into self-correction and catharsis. It is invoked predominantly to mark people as occupants of various tribes – the pantomime people and the practical people – and pit them against one another. Apart from divide and conquer, the oldest trope in politics, there’s another dimension to Morrison’s rolling parable of the bubble-dwellers versus everyone else, and it became profoundly obvious during the final two rancorous parliamentary sitting weeks of 2019. Think about it. If Canberra is a bubble comprised of washed up high school debaters and circus performers, if you can make that reality stick, then none of what happens in that arena matters. Foundational conventions of politics and the parliament get presented as sideshows or cheap power plays, rather than important accountability mechanisms to protect Australian citizens from abuses of power. In the universe where anything is possible and nothing matters, it doesn’t matter if the prime minister misleads the parliament (which he did on several occasions in this past fortnight). Why worry about nitpickers? Just write a letter to the Speaker cleaning it up, or don’t even bother. It doesn’t matter if the prime minister phones the New South Wales police commissioner in the middle of an investigation into one of his ministers. (Boutique issue, only troubling the goat’s cheese circle). It doesn’t matter if Naomi Wolf says categorically she was not at Oxford in 1991 and Angus Taylor tells parliament he absolutely met her and “she began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago”. (Close enough, right? Why sweat the small stuff?) If no one is required to be precise, or accurate, then it doesn’t matter if Taylor keeps tripping over himself, again and again, making mistakes ministers should not make, and suffers no apparently penalty, because this is a bubble issue. A kabuki play. Sound and fury signifying nothing. If it’s all nonsense, then it doesn’t matter if you treat question time as a joke, requiring backbenchers to stand up like a procession of ventriloquist dummies with scripts prefaced with “how great is our strong and stable government, prime minister”, or “how fabulous and confident is Australia with you, sir, oh great one, at the helm” – because that feeds the appearance of pantomime, artifice and spectacle, which reinforces the voter alienation, which creates more opportunity for Morrison to validate that frustration, and style himself as the antidote. The bottom line is this: if you can sit at the pinnacle of your institution, if you can orchestrate this sideshow, while telling onlookers your institution is busted, worthless, and meaningless, you create opportunity and space to write your own rules. There are no guard rails. You can defy gravity. People who line up to ask questions, be they journalists or other political actors, are just irritants to be batted away rather than ramparts in a democratic system. There are two problems with this. The first is just obvious: why should voters trust a prime minister to write their own rules? I wouldn’t trust any prime minister to do that, whether I respected them or whether I didn’t. Conventions – like the requirement not to mislead the parliament, to answer questions, to insist on ministerial accountability, or to steer clear of police looking at conduct in your government – exist for a reason. They exist to allow power in a democracy to be both exercised and appropriately checked. Post global financial crisis politics has taught me that democratic institutions are more fragile than they look. It is vitally important that we stand up for our institutions and conventions through this period of realignment in global politics. These things stand between us and chaos. That’s not a hyperventilation on my part, that’s just the reality. Any passing glance at the great democracies of the world will tell you that. Quite apart from the fundamental belief I have that democracy, and its trappings, is the only thing better than the alternative, there is another danger associated with prime ministers making their own reality, and requiring whole systems to bend to it. Long term, it’s not in their interests. That way lies hubris. That way lies overreach. That way lies justifying unjustifiable things. That way lies misjudgments. That way lies the thin edge of the wedge. While it’s obvious this behaviour isn’t desirable, unfortunately it is rational. At one level, the times do suit Morrison’s disdain-the-citadel approach, which is presumably why the prime minister has adopted it. I said a moment ago Morrison is pitching into a crisis of trust in institutions, and I think it was Churchill who said never waste a good crisis. Politicians can both suffer and profit in this environment, depending on their level of dexterity. It’s also entirely possible that Morrison has chosen to present Canberra as a circus act and a distraction because he can afford to do that. Political parties don’t win elections now because of the pitches that are made at the dispatch box in Canberra, because of impressions that are forged in the parliament – which was how things played out in the television age. In the digital age, elections are won by developing ever more sophisticated ground games and by direct messaging. What Morrison’s MPs are doing and saying on the ground – combined with this curated derring-do prime ministerial character called Scott that the Liberal party projects through social media like a hologram – is probably more important to the Coalition’s long-term electoral prospects than what is or isn’t happening in Canberra during sitting weeks. I say probably, because while Morrison and the team around him act like people who think accountability is a speed bump on the superhighway to the dear leader’s permanent prime ministership, I’m not entirely convinced that we’ve entered a consequence-free world. Perhaps this is the journalist in me, hoping against hope we haven’t entered a consequence-free world, because the consequence-free world means there is no point to my public service. In a consequence-free world, all I’m doing is stoking the cacophony. But, as they say in the classics, only time will tell."

          "bodyText": "Finally, the UK’s FTSE 100 has rompped higher by the close of trading. The blue-chip index has closed 101 points higher tonight at 7,239, a gain of almost 1.5%. The stronger-than-expected US jobs report has calmed nerves after a volatile week. It has also been cheered in the White House: Although the big picture is that America has been creating jobs at a steady rate for almost a decade now: On that note....have a lovely weekend, and we’ll be back on Monday. GW Today’s strong US jobs report bodes well for growth, and stock prices, in 2020. So argues Hugh Grieves, Fund Manager at Premier Miton Investors: “Headline payrolls blew away expectations, rising by 266,000 and far exceeding the 180,000 increase expected. Even when adjusting for the positive impact of the end of the General Motors strike, this is a very strong figure indicating that the US job market, and wider economy, is in good health. The unemployment rate fell 3.5%, the lowest level since December 1969. The healthy labour market validates Chairman’s Powell’s view (shared by us) that the US economy is in decent shape and that interest rates can stay on hold for now, following the three “insurance cuts” earlier in the year. For President Trump, the strength of the US economy removes pressure on him to cut a quick trade deal with China so we may see more aggressive tweets from him in the near future. All in all, although one positive data point is not a trend, this is a very good number and supportive of a positive view of US equities out into 2020.” In other news... China isn’t the only country facing higher pork prices because of its swine fever crisis. Over in Germany, there’s a ‘schnitzel alert’ as the cost of sausages and bacon across Europe rockets. Here’s our US business editor Dominic Rushe on today’s jobs report: The US added 266,000 new jobs in November boosted by the return to work of striking auto workers. Economists had expected job growth to 187,000 in November, up from 128,000 in October and boosted by the return to work of 48,000 GM workers following a 40-day strike. Manufacturing employment rose by 54,000 in November, following a decline of 43,000 in the prior month. Healthcare added 45,000 jobs. The impressive headline growth rate was compounded by upward revisions for earlier months. The labor department revised October’s jobs growth to 156,000, up from 128,000 originally and September’s was revised up to 193,000 from 180,000. Wall Street has opened higher, as traders hail today’s strong jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average is up 232 points, or 0.8%, at27,910. Neil Wilson of Markets.com says: Forget Star Wars, this year’s Christmas blockbuster is today’s nonfarm payrolls report. A blowout jobs number sent equities higher along with the US dollar and Treasury yields as it shows the US economy is doing better than many corners of the market feared. But does that mean America’s central bank might raise interest rates, reversing its three cuts since the summer? Wilson thinks not.... Should we worry about the Fed pivoting again? I don’t think so and the market clearly thinks the same. The Fed can stand this sort of hot reading for a while yet – jobs growth is averaging only 180k this year vs 223k last year. Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, says today’s non-farm payroll suggests that America’s jobs market is robust. It is shrugging off the trade war, a slowing global economy and a worldwide cooling in factory growth, he says: “When corporate profits come under pressure, as they have this year, companies often respond by cutting jobs. So the critical question for investors in recent months has been whether the labour market would hold up. “Today’s very strong job gains, even when adjusted for the return of striking GM workers, are a sign that the labour market remains remarkably robust despite the headwinds from the ongoing manufacturing slowdown and trade related uncertainty. “Healthy employment growth has been the key pillar supporting equity markets even as the economy has slowed and today’s numbers show that pillar shows no signs of crumbling under the weight of political and profit pressures.” Ben Casselman of the New York Times has posted a very decent thread of charts, which explain today’s US jobs report: It’s a tale of two jobs reports! Canada’s economy has suffered a drop in employment last month, with its non-farm payroll dropping by 71,000. November’s strong jobs report suggests that America’s economy is taking the trade war with Chine in its stride. Of course, you could speculate as to whether job creation and wage growth would be even stronger without the burden of tariffs on Chinese goods.... ....and it’s likely that businesses would benefit from a ceasefire. Richard Flynn, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab, says: “Today’s numbers have surpassed expectations, showing the highest reading since August, as seasonal hiring picked up and 45,000 GM workers returned to work, following the longest auto industry strike in 50 years. The upbeat data reinforces the strength of both the labour market and consumer confidence, despite slowing global growth and continued trade uncertainty. “However, without a comprehensive trade deal with China that covers the major structural issues surrounding intellectual property, theft, technology transfers and supply chains, it is difficult to envisage a long-term resurgence in consumer and business confidence. While U.S. stocks have surged in hopes of a near-term ‘phase one’ trade deal by year end, major issues remain unresolved, and there is concern that investor sentiment is getting frothy.” Almost every sector of the US economy has created jobs in the last year - as you’d hope. The only real laggard? Retail, where the rise in e-commerce has forced shops on main street and at malls to close. As suspected, the end of the General Motors strike did boost job creation last month: But the average number of jobs created over the last quarter is the best since January -- a sign that the labor market is strengthening. Here’s more snap reaction: Bloomberg’s Matthew Boesler has spotted that wage growth for some US workers has hit the highest level since the financial crisis. Stocks are rallying on the back of this strong US jobs report. In London the FTSE 100 is up 78 points, or 1.1%, to 7215. All the European markets are higher too. Wall Street is set to open higher too, as worries about a US slowdown are eased. November’s non-farm payroll is the strongest for 10 months. Good news for US workers, and particularly good news for Donald Trump. Expect a tweet from @realdonaldtrump soon..... In another boost, October’s non-farm payroll has been revised higher (as predicted). It shows that 156,000 new jobs were created, up from 128,000 originally. September’s NFP has also been revised up, to 193,000 from 180,000. Average hourly earnings across the US economy rose by 3.1% annually in November, today’s report shows. During the month, wages rose by 0.2%. Newsflash: America’s economy created a LOT more jobs than expected in November. The non-farm payroll expanded by 266,000 last month, smashing forecasts of 186,000 new jobs -- and defying the doomsters who thought it might be weak. This has pulled the jobless rate down to 3.5%, from 3.6% last month. More to follow! Economists will also be looking for some earnings growth in today’s Non-Farm Payroll. Last month’s report showed 3.0% wage growth, with the jobless rate sticking at just 3.6%. The US president has just tweeted.....about the stock market rally of 2019. It’s nearly time for the final big economic news of the week, the US non-farm payroll for November. Economists had predicted that it would show around 186,000 new jobs were created in America last month. That would be an improvement on October’s 128,000 (which will probably be revised today. But there’s chatter that the NFP could miss expectations, after the ADP survey of private sector job creation hit its second-lowest level on Wednesday (at just 67,000). The picture is complicated by the strike at General Motors, which ended last month. https://twitter.com/MWellerFX/status/1202663686449577986 If you’re just tuning in, here’s Associated Press’s take on this morning’s weak German factory data: October factory production dropped in Germany over the previous month in another sign the economy, Europe’s largest, is struggling. The Federal Statistical Office reported Friday that industrial production fell 1.7% in October over September when adjusted for price, seasonal and calendar factors. It was down 5.3% over October 2018. The agency reported Thursday that industrial orders in October were down 0.4%, suggesting an upturn in production is not likely in the immediate future. Germany just narrowly avoided entering a recession in the third quarter and ING economist Carsten Brzeski says the data indicate the German economy is continuing to flirt with stagnation and contraction in the final quarter. “Trade conflicts, global uncertainty, and disruption in the automotive industry have put the entire German industry in a headlock, from which it is hard to escape. Sébastien Desreumaux, CEO of Eddie Stobart, says the firm can now crack on with shifting goods around the UK in the big Christmas rush: “The Proposed Transaction provides Eddie Stobart with the opportunity to move forward and look to deliver sustainable growth and profitability from a stable footing. Our main priority and focus is now continuing to deliver the high levels of services expected by our customers as we move into the busy Christmas period.” Breaking: Transport firm Eddie Stobart is being rescued from the brink of collapse. Shareholders have just voted to approve a bailout from a private equity firm, which should prevent the firm - whose lorries are a popular sight on the UK roads - falling into administration. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: Douglas Bay Capital (DBay), backed by the famous trucker’s son William Stobart, will take control of Eddie Stobart’s assets in a £75m bailout that should prevent the company going bankrupt before Christmas. The deal represents a victory for William Stobart over his former brother-in-law, Andrew Tinkler, who had mounted a rival £80m bid to take over the firm with the backing of unnamed investors. The childhood friends have previously taken turns to run the company at various points in its recent history. Tinkler was present at a short shareholder meeting on Friday morning in London. He spoke briefly against the DBay bid, although sources in the public company’s meeting – from which journalists were barred – said his tone was calm. The vote offers a short-term reprieve for Eddie Stobart’s 6,500 workers, who had faced the prospect of the company falling into administration shortly before Christmas, and only months shy of the company’s 50th anniversary. Sporting debuts are tricky things, but Amazon appears to have scored with its move into football. The company is reporting a surge in sign-ups for Prime this week, from fans keen to watch streamed Premier League games (including a pulsating Merseyside derby and a rather entertaining clash between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur). But is this good news for fans? They already have to pay for Sky or BT Sport to get live Premiership action. More fragmentation means more subscriptions. Here’s our news story on the Halifax house price index: European stock markets are rallying thanks to China’s decision to waive some tariffs on US farm goods. The main indices are all higher, lifting the EU-wide Stoxx 600 index by 0.4% back towards the four-year highs seen in late November. After a turbulent week, there are signs that relations between the US and China are improving. Overnight, China has decided to waive the tariffs on some imports of soybeans and pork from America. Beijing’s finance minister said the waiver would be applied to applications from individual companies. It will allow them to avoid China’s 30% tariff on US soybeans and pork, imposed in retaliation to US tariffs. One source told Reuters that the move shows that China is committed to reaching a trade deal with the US. They said: “The goal (of this move) is to expand purchases and reassure the United States..... “It should be interpreted as a positive signal. Despite the many political difficulties the two sides face, economic and trade cooperation and moves to stop the escalation of the trade war are in the interest of both parties.” China has offered similar waivers in the past, though it’s not been clear how many were granted or how long they lasted for. The pork waivers could be particularly popular, given the swine fever epidemic that has ravaged China’s agricultural industry, driving prices sharply higher. Here’s the latest house price data from Halifax, showing property prices rising at their fastest rate since the spring. Economist Rupert Seggins points out that Halifax’s data shows a higher rise in house prices than other indices. Housebuilder Berkeley Group has warned that political uncertainty is hurting the sector, after posting a sharp drop in profits. It told shareholders this morning: We remain alert to market risks with a General Election next week and the delay to the UK’s proposed exit from the European Union prolonging the uncertain operating environment of the last three years. This is damaging to our economy and London where fewer developers are prepared or able to accept the high operational risk of bringing forward new homes, with supply falling as a consequence. Berkeley reported a 31% drop in profits in the last six months, with revenues down 43%. Here’s some snap reaction to the surprise rise in UK house prices last month: Mark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients: ‘It might be a little surprising to see the biggest monthly rise in house prices since February but the end of year can see a spike in sales as people aim to be in their new home for Christmas. Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington Property Finders: With average wages rising at more than twice the rate of consumer inflation, homes are becoming steadily more affordable in many parts of the country. “Mortgages remain cheap and the relative lack of competition among buyers, even for good homes, is enticing more strategic buyers to pounce. “For now, the election has brought forward the traditional December slowdown, adding to the build-up of delayed demand. Lucy Pendleton of estate agents James Pendleton: “Contributing to the pick up in the annual pace of growth is the London market, which has started to bubble away again. “In the capital, a big jump in the number of sales going to best-and-final offers is going hand in hand with increasing footfall through front doors as buyers’ appetites return. Just in: UK house prices jumped 1% in November, the fastest monthly rise in seven months. That’s according to mortgage lender Halifax, and suggests that the clouds of political uncertainty may be lifting a little. On an annual basis, prices were 2.1% higher than a year ago, Halifax reports. Russell Galley, managing director at Halifax, explains that low interest rates - and a shortage of properties - are keeping prices up. “Average house prices rebounded somewhat in November, with annual growth of 2.1% being driven by the biggest monthly rise since February, following two months of modest falls. Prices are now up by £3,904 since the start of the year. While a degree of uncertainty remains evident, it’s also clear that buyers and sellers are responding to factors such as improved mortgage affordability and the limited supply of available properties. It is these issues which we believe will continue to underpin the resilience evident in the market for most of 2019. Over the medium term we expect the emerging trend of modest gains to continue into next year.” The slump in German factory output in October is so bad that it could drag the wider economy back towards recession. Oliver Rakau of Oxford Economics says the plunge in production is “disastrous”, and could mean that the economy shrinks in the final quarter of this year. Germany only just dodged a recession, with modest growth in Q3, but Q4 is not starting well. Earlier this week, factories reported a drop in orders, which could signal further weakness in the months ahead. Here’s Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at ING Germany, on the factory slump: Today’s data suggests that the German economy is continuing to flirt with stagnation and contraction in the final quarter of the year. Capacity utilisation has dropped to its lowest level since early 2013. At the same time, the well-known supply-side constraints have also started to ease but not with the same magnitude as capacity utilisation. The lack of skilled employees and too little equipment as limiting factors have dropped to their 2017-levels, suggesting that the current slump in manufacturing is still a combination of supply-side and demand-side factors. Looking ahead, both soft and hard indicators bode ill for industrial activity in the months ahead. Production expectations show very tentative signs of stabilisation at low levels but order books are still shrinking and inventories remain high. Trade conflicts, global uncertainty and disruption in the automotive industry have put the entire German industry in a headlock, from which it is hard to escape. On an annual basis, Germany just suffered its worst drop in factory output since the financial crisis! Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. 2019 is turning into a year to forget for Germany. Factory output has slumped again as problems at home and abroad batter Europe’s largest economy. Industrial output fell by 1.7% month-on-month in October, new figures show. That’s much worse than expected, showing that the recession across German factories hasn’t eased up. On an annual basis, output was 5.3% lower than in October 2018, as trade tensions and problems in Germany’s car industry have hurt activity. The decline was driven by a 4.4% month-on-month slide in production of capital goods -- the pricy heavy-duty machinery and equipment that has been the bedrock of Germany’s economy. Germany’s problems are part of a wider picture -- manufacturing data has been weak around the globe this year as the world economy has slowed. But it has certainly suffered more than most. Germany’s economy ministry fears that it could take several months for the situation to stabilise. It says: “The economic weakness in industry remains. However, the latest developments in new orders and business expectations indicate that a stabilising trend could emerge in the coming months.” Reaction to follow.... Also coming up today Investors will scrutinise the latest US jobs report for signs that America’s labour market is slowing. Over in Vienna, Opec are trying to hammer out a 500,000 barrels/day cut to oil production levels. There’s clearly a disagreement over how to implement the deal -- ministers talked late into the night, when they were due at a gala dinner to celebrate the success of the alliance #awkward . European stock markets are expected to open higher, shaking off the jitters that sparked a selloff earlier this week. Traders are still hoping for progress in the US-China trade talks, before the 15 December deadline when Washington could impose new tariffs. And the future of UK trucking business Eddie Stobart will be decided today, as shareholders vote on a rescue plan. My colleague Jasper Jolly explains: The vote will pit William Stobart, the third son of the company’s founder, against his childhood friend and former brother-in-law, Andrew Tinkler. If their competing bids fall through, the company could collapse under the weight of a huge debt pile months before its 50th birthday. The agenda 1.30pm GMT: US non-farm payroll for November. Expected to show 183,000 new jobs created, up from 128,000"

          "headline": "Has WhatsApp become a potential career assassin?",
          "bodyText": "We need to talk about WhatsApp. When the little green speech bubble first showed up in my life, I greeted it with awe and wonder. I even wrote a little love letter to its ability to connect with a virtual black sisterhood – the kind that rarely exists in our too-undiverse workplaces in real life – in my first book. It became the perfect platform to share experiences, frustrations, strategies and ideas. WhatsApp group communities proliferated on my phone – they were education, community and activism all in one place. It was great. Until it wasn’t. Groups grow too big, don’t they? Then personalities clashed, unleashed from the restraint of real life by the notorious rudeness of social media. Then a WhatsApp safe space was shattered, as one group member leaked confidential material shared by another, showing it to their boss to gain favour at work. The mutual trust and community that took years to build was poisoned in an instant, and so was someone’s career. These perils took on an entirely new dimension last week in the case of Robyn Williams, the police superintendent prosecuted for the crime of having received a WhatsApp message that contained indecent images of a child. Williams’ case is shocking because her sister sent her the clip not to gain any gratification from child abuse but to condemn it, and to call for the perpetrator to be caught and punished. The court accepted that neither had any sinister intent, and Williams never actually watched the video. Williams was a highly decorated officer who had been given an award by the Queen, had supported Grenfell Tower survivors, and was tipped to be a future Scotland Yard commissioner. Yet her reputation counted for nothing next to the offence of receiving an unopened WhatsApp message. Now she is a convicted sex offender and her career is in ruins. A petition supporting Williams has gathered thousands of signatures, and even a former director of public prosecutions has expressed disbelief that she was prosecuted in the first place for not keeping up with her WhatsApp thread. I don’t keep up with my WhatsApp threads. Perhaps that’s now a self-incriminating statement. But the thought that something for which I could be prosecuted is lurking in there, is perhaps the only thing more stressful than many unopened messages I have in the first place. How did the platform that seemed like a friend turn into a potential career assassin? The answer is less to do with WhatsApp and more to do with the failure of data regulation. In England, cases have already established that messages sent – we think privately – on WhatsApp can be subject to disclosure during legal proceedings. Even a group of highly skilled hackers were not able to prevent their WhatsApp chats being used as evidence when they broke a clause in their employment contract. In India, the government says it has the right to intercept WhatsApp, with a warning that social media can threaten “disruption” to democracy. Turkey says it is legal to read employee messages to see if competition law is being broken. An Israeli company, NSO, is being sued by WhatsApp, which claims its surveillance technology was used in a series of highly sophisticated cyber-attacks that violated American law in an “unmistakable pattern of abuse” – allegations the company denies and has vowed to fight vigorously in court. NSO technology is alleged to have targeted the phones of journalists, human rights campaigners and women’s rights activists in 20 countries. I consider myself all three: no wonder I’m nervous. All these jurisdictions fail to grasp that legislation has to keep up with our everyday use of data. How many of us know that things said on WhatsApp could be used as evidence in litigation? I will never know what’s in all my unread WhatsApp messages. But I do know that if the law is meant to provide us with certainty, and keep us safe, then something has gone badly wrong. • Afua Hirsch is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "Peter Hopwood spent 45 years working in the north Wales coalfield and now every time he walks through Wrexham town centre he stops for a moment at the sculpture of a miner on Lord Street. “I give him a tap and think about those years underground,” said Hopwood, a sprightly 87. “It was hard work but we had some good times too – until Maggie Thatcher came and wrecked it all.” Like most of his workmates, Hopwood always voted Labour but not this time. “In my my heart I’m Labour and I voted for remain in the referendum because I reckon working people in places like this get a better deal from Europe than they do from London,” he said. “This time it’s a toss-up between the Brexit party and the Tories. I never thought I’d say that. We’ve had so many governments over the last 300 years and nobody’s got it right. We’re still all arguing about how to run the country. We need to rip it all up and start again.” Hopwood is not your archetypal rebel. After his mining career ended, he worked as a carer and then devoted himself to looking after his wife, Theresa, until she died three years ago. Now he is searching for something different for his country, a fresh start, and his way of making a point seems to be to cast his vote for something that goes against what he has believed in all his life. When the coal mines thrived Wrexham was indubitably Labour. The party has held the seat since 1935 and in the mid-1970s had a majority of more than 16,000. In 2017 this fell to a little over 1,800 and the Tories strongly believe they can cause a huge shock next week by winning in Wrexham and other longtime Labour strongholds. Hopwood lives on the edge of the Caia Park estate, a key battleground in the campaign. One part of the estate is in the top 10 of the poorest in Wales and is the most educationally deprived spot in the country. Eirian Hughes, 50, was on her doorstep of her house in Caia Park smoking a cigarette before heading off for the 3pm-midnight shift cleaning at the Eagles Meadow shopping centre. She and her partner both work to enjoy the nights out and the holidays that two wages pay for. “We work hard for the life we want,” Hughes said. She doesn’t see herself as particularly rich or poor. “We’re somewhere in the middle.” In the past Hughes has voted for both Labour and Tory but plumped for Ukip in 2015 when Nigel Farage’s party came a solid third in Wrexham. “The Conservatives and Labour say they’ll fight for us but we’re nothing to them.” Hughes was among the 59% of the electorate in Wrexham who backed leave in the referendum. She insists she is not racist but rages against the town’s Polish and Portuguese residents, who she claims take jobs from local people. She also complains about the town’s hospital, Wrexham Maelor, and was horrified by the story of a 70-year-old man who died after waiting in an ambulance outside the hospital for eight hours. “Is that going to happen to me in the end?” asked Hughes. “You pay national insurance from the day you leave school. And it comes to that.” She doesn’t even think she’ll bother to vote this time. On the face of it, Wrexham should be a straight fight between Labour and Tory but it is complex. Though the parliamentary seat has been Labour for more than 80 years, Wrexham council is run by a Tory/independent coalition. One council officer, who asked not to be named, summed up the ruling group as an “austerity masochist Conservative coalition” – but added that there was no life in the Labour opposition. Another complicating factor is that policy areas like health and education are the responsibility of the Welsh Labour government. With many different parties to blame, it is no surprise allegiances have become so fluid. When the Guardian asked residents which issues were most important to them, Brexit was by no means at the top of everyone’s list. Respondents expressed concerns about the state of the hospital, the impact of austerity, homelessness, the struggles of AFC Wrexham (the third oldest professional football team in the world but currently floundering in the fifth tier of the English pyramid) and, perhaps most strikingly, the number of people for whom hunger is a pressing concern. “Six months ago I think it was all about Brexit,” said 30-year-old Bill Long, who was born and bred in Wrexham. “I think people are now realising, hang on, we’ve had three prime ministers under the Conservatives since Brexit and things are getting worse. People are very fed up, tired and scared.” As a teacher at St Christopher’s in Wrexham, the largest special school in Wales, Long sees the pressure on the most vulnerable. Some pupils come into school hungry and he says teachers dip into their own pockets to feed them. Long has sometimes brought in a toaster and bread to make sure there’s a snack on the go at break-times. Teachers and teaching assistants don’t like to talk about the hand-outs. “It’s an unspoken thing but it goes on,” said Long. “It’s not something that should happen.” At the Trussell Trust food bank on a Wrexham industrial estate, Sally Ellinson was supervising the preparation of emergency Christmas food boxes. Two years ago the agencies who refer people to the food bank asked for 200 boxes. Now the number is 500. “We’re not sure we can fulfil all those referrals but we’ll do our best,” she said. It is not that there are no jobs in Wrexham. Most people agree that if you want work, you will find it. But more than half the people who use the food bank have jobs. “People coming in are embarrassed and ashamed,” said Ellinson. “But most haven’t eaten for a couple of days and are hungry.” There are many good people trying to help. In the town centre, carer and Salvation Army volunteer Dawn was on her way to a shift at a food bank distribution centre. She stopped to buy the rough sleepers outside McDonald’s porridge and cheesy bacon flatbreads. Dawn said she was a long-term Labour voter but she too was going to vote for the Brexit party this time. “I want Brexit done. Let’s leave and then we can focus on other things – the disgrace that is universal credit, the humiliation people face when applying for PIP (personal independence payment), the problems in schools, the long waiting lists in hospitals.” A number of people who contacted the Guardian flagged up the decline of the town centre and the drug-takers on the streets. There are many empty shops in the town centre and drug users are a common sight but dig deeper and there are inspiring things happening too. The building that occupies numbers 9-11 on Regent Street used to be a JJB Sports but is now an art space called UnDegUn (eleven in Welsh). It hosts exhibitions, poetry readings, debates and the Wrexham bands Baby Brave and Neck Deep rehearse here. Dave Gray, 44, the founder of UnDegUn, is one of the few people the Guardian spoke to in Wrexham who was voting for the party he had always supported – Labour. “I feel I have to vote Labour. Its manifesto is optimistic, l like that, it’s brave. They seem to want to make a difference.” Across town in the politics department of the further and higher education college, Coleg Cambria, a teacher predicted most of the 18-year-olds voting for the first time would back Labour. It turned out not be so. Of five students interviewed only one was definitely voting for Jeremy Corbyn’s party. Two were opting for the Tories, one for the Welsh nationalists, Plaid Cymru. They were interested in the environment, university fees, the economy. Cait Williams said she was “completely conflicted”. “I don’t think the politicians in London get north Wales,” she said. “They’re in their Westminster bubble. I want to vote in a passionate way for someone I genuinely believe in. But I’m not sure who that is at the moment. I’ll have to do some more research.”"

          "bodyText": "Ask the average 2019 voter where the problems with political news lie, and you might hear a few familiar claims: fake news. Russian interference. The biased BBC. But take a look at their smartphones, and you might discover a different, more chaotic world – in which news is being shaped less by publishers or foreign agents but by social media algorithms and friendship groups. Now, in a first-of-its-kind election monitoring project conducted by the Guardian and research agency Revealing Reality, a group of voters have allowed their phone use to be recorded for three days – and the results from each individual’s phone show how the traditional media ecosystem is changing and disintegrating. Charlie in Sunderland consumed much of his election news through memes on lad humour Facebook pages, spending more time looking at posts of Boris Johnson using the word “boobies” than reading traditional news stories. Fiona in Bolton checked out claims about Jeremy Corbyn’s wealth by going to a website called Jihadi Watch before sharing the far-right material in a deliberate bid to anger her leftwing friends. And Shazi in Sheffield followed the BBC leaders’ interviews purely by watching videos of party supporters chanting the Labour leader’s name outside the venue. The six volunteers who took part in the project should be seen as a snapshot rather than a statistically representative sample of the population. But the behaviour chimes with previous research to illustrate a pattern of behaviour across the political spectrum – a result with huge implications for the role of responsible journalism and reliable sources. “News is becoming intermingled with entertainment,” said Damon De Ionno of agency Revealing Reality, who ran the project after pioneering the screen-recording approach to market research in the UK. “You’re no longer asking: what’s going on in the world today? It’s very different – you want to be entertained.” The analysts who studied the volunteers – recruited under pseudonyms to reflect a spread of demographics, politics, and geography – saw broad patterns in the way they used their phones. Some were expected, with people increasingly consuming news passively by scrolling through headlines rather than actively seeking out information; one woman in London read 29 headlines but clicked on just six and only read three articles to the end. Several participants were observed sharing articles on Facebook without clicking the links, and excitedly diving into comment sections for an argument before looking at the articles. Most showed a tendency to read news that confirmed their existing views. Some behaviours were more surprising, hinting we may be becoming a nation of trolls. One 22-year-old Conservative-voting woman was observed going out of her way to read reputable mainstream news sources so she had a balanced understanding of Labour policies. But she would then seek out provocative far-right blog posts to share on Facebook because their headlines would anger her leftwing friends and create online drama. In this snapshot of online voter behaviour, news is often consumed through user-generated memes, posts by celebrity influencers, and politicians’ own social media accounts. Despite the large focus on paid-for Facebook adverts during this election, such material appeared rarely in users’ newsfeeds during the time that data was being collected. And while mainstream websites such as the BBC, Sky News, MailOnline and the Guardian still play a key role in news consumption – collectively reaching tens of millions of readers every day and helping to set the tone of coverage – professional journalism outlets are only one small part of where the public are getting their online information about this election. “It’s total anarchy,” said De Ionno. “The idea of fake news and fake ads, with Russians manipulating people, is a really easy bogeyman. The reality is there’s many more shades of grey and it’s hard to unpick.” And it’s political parties who understand how to cut through this cacophony of information who stand a better chance of success of winning next week’s general election. At Revealing Reality’s headquarters in a converted ballroom in south London, a group of analysts working for De Ionno are attempting to piece together how Britons are consuming news in this general election campaign with the aid of a wall of photos of each volunteer in their home, pages of data, and transcripts of interviews. Although there were some changes in behaviour during the study – one person complained they had had to restrict their viewing of online porn while the study was taking place – the researchers believe most people largely forgot their phones were being recorded. Analysts then studied the recordings of each volunteer’s screen activity using an coding system adapted from software originally built for the study of animal behaviour, before comparing notes following a three-hour interview with each participant. “A lot of the content has been taken out of context,” says one analyst, looking at Charlie’s online reading habits. “They’re disengaging with mainstream sources,” says another. A third analyst said Shazi didn’t really understand that social media algorithms shaped what news she was seeing on Twitter: “She wasn’t aware that other people would be seeing different things.” The researchers came across very little completely false material. According to Ruby Wootton, one of the researchers on the project, rather than outright fake news there was instead a glut of heavily-slanted news with a kernel of fact. Instead she saw “a lot of content that is quite exaggerated or deliberately presented to influence you in a way that’s not connected to the full picture.” Regardless of their place on the political spectrum, the analysts found people are drifting into the same habits, sometimes knowingly embracing the “indulgence” of a reassuring social media bubble of news that reinforced their existing viewpoints in a troubled world. Participants also appeared to have little idea why they were seeing certain news stories, being guided by news aggregation services already built into their phones or the whims of social media algorithms serving up material from friends. They also often failed to distinguish between material posted by established news outlets and obscure Facebook groups. “If social media content is playing such a central role in shaping people’s views on the election what are the implications for high quality journalism, reputable sources and well constructed and evidenced articles?” asked Revealing Reality’s researchers. The individuals who took part in the study – all aged under 60 – very rarely watched television news, reflecting the shift away from the medium for that age group. But many were aware of claims of BBC bias during the election and had seen viral video clips of political interviews culled from mainstream programmes. Even though they were rarely watching it, some cared very deeply about what the BBC was broadcasting on the basis that it was influencing other voters, perhaps explaining why viral video clips of the BBC’s mistakes are sometimes reaching more viewers than the original television audiences. But the screen recording data suggests that the traditional media are now just a sliver of how the British public are learning about politics, with a growing role for political activists with large followings – with posts by the likes of comedian Jason Manford as likely to decide what people see online about the election as stories from traditional news outlets. While political journalism during this election has often focused on official online campaign material put out by political parties themselves – or the spectre of under-the-radar paid-for Facebook ad campaigns – the case studies suggest that real story of the 2019 online general election campaign could be in the general chaos of users’ smartphones and social media, where memes compete with rolling arguments in local Facebook groups and content from traditional outlets. This constant passive consumption of the news – as opposed to relying on a single news bulletin or reading a particular print newspaper once a day – meant bombshell articles fail to get heard over the general online cacophony. De Ionno said he had noticed people struggled to remember individual stories, adding: “News doesn’t stick as well. There’s a new drama every day and cliffhangers on a daily basis. A lot of the respondents didn’t have a good memory of what happened a week ago.” While previously the public’s news consumption was shaped by powerful gatekeepers such as newspaper editors or the bosses of heavily regulated broadcast news channels, on their phones it is shaped more by the hands-off approach of companies such as Facebook. The social network has decided against taking a patrician approach of pushing straightforward reporting into newsfeeds alongside user-generated memes asking Was Enoch Powell Right?, or hyperpartisan posts spreading distorted information about Jeremy Corbyn. With limited human involvement in choosing the news stories people are seeing, the researchers said the general public were being asked to take responsibility for their own news diet with the hope that they seek out accurate information without any intervention. Revealing Reality’s analysis of the volunteers’ election news consumption concluded: “If everything that people are seeing is via social media – who is accountable? There is very little human intelligence or decision-making behind it, no attempt to give a balanced view. That seems to leave all responsibility on the reader.” Read how each volunteer consumed their election news."

          "bodyText": "A cursory glance through the Tory manifesto would suggest a party bereft of ideas, with little meaningful or relevant to say about the challenges confronting a crisis-stricken society. “Get Brexit done” is their battle cry, so that we can finally talk about the issues that really matter – all the while gliding over the pesky minor detail that it is their leader who has played a pivotal role in making Brexit the issue sucking oxygen out of our political realm. The main parties’ manifestos, up against one another, is surely compelling evidence that – unlike in the 1980s – the left is bubbling with ideas and the Tories are in ideological retreat, sustained only by a wave of rightwing populism and the political polarisation delivered by the 2016 referendum. But it is the emptiness of the Tories’ flimsy document that should alarm us. It is a sign that the Tory right is in the ascendancy, and those deemed “moderate” (so even-handed and sensible that they will happily strip disabled people of their benefits) have been purged. The document gives them free rein to ride roughshod over Britain’s poorest people. Yet the Tories insist that this is all a conspiracy. We are invited to believe that, granted a parliamentary majority, rightwing politicians defined by their ideological fervour will skip a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to implement their lifelong, defining beliefs. This deceit is nothing new for British Conservatism. Let us recall the 1979 Tory manifesto: surely here was the founding ideological document of Thatcherism, setting out the party’s grand masterplan to refashion British society and overturn the postwar consensus established by the 1945 Labour government. It was no such thing. As one political academic puts it, Thatcher’s “government either cleverly concealed the true extent of its liberalising intentions or – more likely – only gained full confidence in the idea of unleashing ‘market forces’ once safely installed at No 10”. Another suggests its commitments were largely “compatible with other postwar Conservative manifestos”, and attempted to counter Labour’s attempts “to portray Mrs Thatcher as a dangerous extremist”. And what about now? Let us consider Dominic Raab, whose rightwing views frighten some of his own colleagues. Here is a man who co-authored a pamphlet arguing that the “current monolith” of the NHS should be “broken up”, while “new nonprofit and private operators should be allowed into the service, and, indeed should compete on price”. Translated into non-wonk speak, this is privatisation. The foreign secretary has also denounced British employment legislation as a “straitjacket” for the economy, favouring instead hire-and-fire rules. And again, another book he co-authored – Raab is nothing if not prolific – alongside fellow cabinet ministers Priti Patel and Liz Truss, denounced British workers as “the worst idlers in the world” and proposed scrapping workers’ rights. As Maya Angelou once said: “When people show you who they are, believe them.” Brexit, for them, is not principally about reconfiguring Britain’s relationship with the EU, but rather scrapping what they call red tape and we call workers’ rights and environmental protections. The same applies to Boris Johnson, who once lambasted the NHS as “top-down monopolistic healthcare” and advocated introducing charges for NHS services. We should heed the words of ex-Conservative prime minister John Major, who declared that “the NHS is about as safe” with Johnson and his colleagues as a “pet hamster would be with a hungry python”. Michael Gove, he suggested, desired to privatise the NHS: and indeed the cabinet minister is the co-author of a book that described the NHS as “no longer relevant in the 21st century”, instead arguing that Britain’s most important institution should be replaced by private healthcare companies. The Tory party should not be accused of a scarcity of ideas, but rather of being dishonest about its intentions. Johnson and his allies know their heartfelt beliefs are not popular with the general public; they are also aware that Labour’s domestic policies on public ownership and raising taxes for the rich enjoy widespread support. It is for this purpose that they deploy Brexit as a distraction and so run down the clock with stunts such as picking fights with Channel 4 News. They will do anything to deflect from Labour’s programme and the failure to state their own in detail. There are fundamental differences with 1980s Thatcherism, of course. Back then, the Tories intended to embed a new political consensus by granting a short-term boost to the living standards of a layer of the population, principally through right-to-buy and share ownership. But this was an unsustainable bubble; one that built a new social order that condemned the next generation to insecurity and stagnating living standards. It’s a phenomenon I encountered in Stoke-on-Trent at the weekend: a middle-aged woman confessed she had done rather well out of Thatcher, mainly because of right-to-buy. But she spoke of her son, unable to afford to buy his own home, instead paying through his nose to a private landlord; and of his girlfriend, who studied for a university degree and has the vast debt to show for it, and is now stuck in a low-paid, low-skilled job. It is the experience of her son’s generation that explains why Tory support has imploded among the young. This time around, there is nothing left to sell, no meaningful short-term bungs to offer. Instead, the Tories rely on an authoritarian rightwing populism to fill the vacuum. Their hope is that this will appeal to working-class voters in Stoke-on-Trent, Doncaster and Bolton whose economic views are rooted firmly on the left. They make sure to keep shtum about their true intentions, believing Brexit demagoguery is a means to deflect from policies that threaten the living standards and rights of leave-supporting voters in the small towns of the Midlands, the north and Wales. And so here is a warning. The Tory manifesto is a blank cheque, not an empty sheet. The Tory rightwingers are ravenous vultures circling over the remnants of Britain’s creaking public realm and hard-won social rights. Their ambitions are not lacking, merely disguised. And if they secure the majority they crave, soon there will be nothing worthwhile left of Britain for them to feast on. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"

And in 2019 I am resolutely, unfashionably, not politically homeless. Everyone is, these days. Can’t throw a brick without hitting someone saying: “Ugh, there’s no choice at all, it’s like picking between being two different ways of being murdered.” This election, depending on which paper you read, is either a desperate fight to save the Queen from being murdered by John McDonnell at 9am on 13 December, or a deeply dull and unpleasant affair which Your Humble Correspondent finds themselves unfortunately caught up in through no fault of their own, like someone sent out to cover an arts festival in Azerbaijan who ends up accidentally reporting on a scandal involving a dodgy sewage works. You would barely be able to tell, reading the output of the ‘politically homeless’, that the levels of actual, literal homelessness in this country are at truly catastrophic levels. Shelter says that 135,000 children will be homeless on Christmas Day, with current trends meaning that 4,000 children will become newly homeless between now and Christmas. The evidence of our own eyes tells us that real homelessness is a huge problem on our streets, but “hidden” homelessness – precarious accommodation, and people living in substandard, crowded houses rotting with mildew – is all too common. We are failing at being a society, the social fabric frays around us, yet a substantial chunk of the commentariat is somehow bored. It’s not that I’ve never felt rejected by the political process. I remember the 2010 election very well, facing the dismal offer of Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Nick Clegg. In the Red corner: the guy who’d been chancellor during the Blair years, overseeing a strategy of funding growth by overleveraging an asset bubble, and building detention camps while ramping up officially sanctioned Islamophobia. In the Blue corner: a shiny-faced Bullingdon Club nonentity offering to increase the beatings until morale improved. Times were so grim that Nick Clegg – Nick Clegg for God’s sake! – looked like a breath of fresh air. Nine years can give you a hell of a perspective though. Take me back in a time machine now, and I’d be hollering at everyone I could see: “Vote for Brown, the other two are much worse than you think!” I wouldn’t be happy about it – I have no real faith that the unadventurous economic programme he put on offer would have done much, except just be better than the alternative. But better is better. I’ve seen what the austerity regime that Cameron and Clegg unleashed on the country has done to my friends and neighbours. I’ve seen how the “hostile environment” has ripped families apart. I’ve seen the Department for Work and Pensions transformed so that it no longer even pretends to be a social security agency, fully embracing its role to punish the poor and disabled until they get work or die trying. I’ve seen the flattening of wages and the grinding drop in working standards which slowly turns this country into a meaner and grimmer place to live. To sit above it all in 2019 feels incomprehensible. Yes, Labour remains a deeply flawed vehicle for reform. Its manifesto offer, as radical as it is compared with the status quo, is in many ways still insufficient to fully reverse the long-term damage that has been inflicted on our society. But the big question – what kind of country do we want to be? – has two distinct and contrasting answers this election. Do we want to be a nation of underpaid, overworked, suspicious, angry people? Or do we want to try something else? Do we want to choose a society that invests in itself, which sees homelessness and poverty as a moral problem to be solved? Do we want to do something about the climate crisis, or hunker down and buy more barbed wire? To cling to the slim, tentative, ephemeral hope offered by Labour is an exercise in ongoing heartbreak and doubt. I know that even the best outcome is for years of struggle and constant setback. And yet the mere chance that there could be people in government who want to try to build a better society is enough. I would love to be capable of fashionable cynicism, I honestly would. It’s the hope that kills you, after all. This election is making me sleepless and sick with worry. I am tired, and it is cold, and I want to get on with Christmas. But the circumstances of our lives do not design themselves according to what we find convenient and unchallenging. I wonder how bad it has to get out there, how much more actual homelessness there has to be, before political homelessness starts to feel as detached and callous as it looks from the outside? • Phil McDuff writes on economics and social policy"

Thankfully, I’ve only been trapped on it for the past week. That’s been more than enough, let me assure you. Loyal readers, thank you so much for sticking with us throughout. Just want to pay tribute to the incredible Amy Remeikis, Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. Feeding this beast is an almighty effort. This week’s blog will have been a window into the steady disintegration of my mind. But it’s only been four days. Amy and co do it all year. Just to recap the day’s events. Angus Taylor decided to double down on his fight with *checks notes* Naomi Wolf, calling for her to apologise for inferring he was antisemitic after he inferred she was at war with Christmas during their Oxford years. Wolf also doubled down, saying Taylor had his facts wrong and was peddling divisive lies about her. The government rammed its union bashing bill through the lower house this morning, gagging debate, and causing outrage all round by not letting the opposition speak on the bill. Anthony Albanese likened it to totalitarianism. Scott Morrison said unions were full of thugs, so who cares. There was continuing fallout to the repeal of medevac. Human rights groups continued to criticise the decision and Labor and the Greens continued to demand an explanation of Jacqui Lambie’s deal with the government. New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern said her offer of resettlement was still on the table but said Australia had not approached her government for talks in recent days. Morrison announced a raft of machinery of government changes, reducing the number of departments from 18 to 14 and getting rid of five departmental secretaries. The overhaul was criticised for concentrating power and undermining the cabinet system. It also saw the promotion of Andrew Metcalfe, Morrison’s old immigration secretary. Thanks again. Merry Christmas from the blog. Stay safe. The UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, has released a statement expressing its disappointment at the repeal of the medevac legislation on Wednesday. It has also urged the government to accept the New Zealand offer to resettle refugees. “Since its commencement earlier this year, the medevac mechanism had proven to be a timely, effective and often life-saving safeguard,” the agency said in a statement. “After more than six years of uncertainty regarding solutions, UNHCR is extremely concerned that the health situation of asylum seekers and refugees will continue to deteriorate. “In the absence of the now repealed medevac mechanisms, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to continue utilising pre-existing legislative processes in a good faith effort to evacuate individuals in need of urgent medical treatment. “As Australia retains responsibility for people forcibly transferred under its offshore arrangements, UNHCR urges the government of Australia to find appropriate solutions including taking up the longstanding offer by New Zealand to resettle refugees and to prevent further harm.” In spillover Senate estimates, jobs department officials have revealed that businesses which take a jobseeker on in a PaTH internship do not need to host for the full four weeks to be paid $1,000 for the placement – only five days. The top five businesses providing PaTH internships are: Yacoub family trust, AHS hospitality, Coles, Woolworths and Hog’s Breath Café. Officials said the employment rate (that is, the proportion of interns who get proper employment at the end of the placement) for those five businesses is 53.8%, compared with 60.8% for all providers offering more than 10 internships. Anthony Albanese gives his version of the love-in speech. He signs it off with: As Naomi Wolf would say, have a lovely Christmas. Better things are happening in the Senate. Trust me. Scott Morrison is summing up the year in the lower house as we reach the end of the sitting year. He thanks the public for returning the Coalition to government and speaks of the great challenges Australians have faced in terms of natural disasters this year. This is the time when everyone pretends to be nice to everyone else. So that we all leave with warm fuzzy feelings in our hearts. Yay. Scott Morrison says to Anthony Albanese: It is also fitting of this time of the year to extend to the leader of the opposition and his family my very best wishes for Christmas and the holiday season. Whether he’ll be watching re-runs of old footy games or I’ll be, who knows. But I do hope he has a wonderful Christmas and New Year period with his family... and a bit of rest. Haha, yeah. Who knows? No one’s watching old footy re-runs. Don’t be ridiculous. Labor’s Mark Butler is pointing out the bizarre nature of Angus Taylor’s statement on Naomi Wolf in parliament today. He tells the ABC: I’m not sure who knows better than her where she was in 1991. Instead Angus Taylor doubled down, he not only said she was there in 1991. He told question time that she’d been there since the mid-1980s until a few years ago. The Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman and the Labor MP Anne Aly are on the ABC. They’re asked whether they think question time today was an edifying display. Spoiler alert: nah, it wasn’t. Zimmerman says it’s the name calling and the heat that people object to. I think question time generally is something most Australians struggle to come to terms with. Aly says it fails at its core objective of actually getting answers. I’m in that category of people who had never watched question time before I came to parliament. I went into my first question time with a pen and paper thinking we were actually going to get answers. Wolf says she had never heard of Taylor before three days ago. I’ve never met this man. I didn’t know who he was until three days ago when I was alerted to these lies about me. Particularly at the time of her book’s release: Respectfully to Mr Taylor, I wasn’t paying attention to him, whoever he is. She’s asked if there’s a stalemate. I didn’t pick this fight, [he] decided to say things about me that are simply and categorically not true. It’s up to him as an elected official to correct the record. Wolf: As a woman, I find it objectionable that I’m having to document my entire life.... he should apologise and more importantly, this is not about me, he should correct the record. She sticks to her guns on the charge of antisemitism. I do think that’s antisemitic. I stand by what I said. She says the comments were clearly religiously divisive and false. Wolf responds to Taylor’s statement that his grandmother is Jewish. I mean, respectfully, I’m glad he comes from such a diverse family. As I said earlier, I have no argument with his family. I do think it was inappropriate to say I was somewhere I wasn’t, doing something I wasn’t doing. She insists she was not in Oxford, despite Angus Taylor’s repeated claim that he remembers meeting her there. She holds up a list of the bookseller list for that year, and it shows her book at No 13. She also refers to a friend who can confirm she was not in Oxford that year. I shouldn’t have to identify where I was. He has said things that are completely, provably wrong. There are multiple eyewitnesses. Naomi Wolf has conducted an interview with the ABC. She said her phone call with Angus Taylor’s office was not “heated”, but was firm. I think that I was firmly requesting a correction because Angus Taylor has made statements about me in very public forums misstating that I was among graduate students at Oxford in 1991 who were campaigning against Christmas. She says a profile in the Australian Financial Review on Taylor, which repeated the claim, is currently being corrected by the newspaper. I wasn’t there in 1991, I was in New York, I had written what many people think is a very important feminist text. I was touring all over the world with it... and I’ve never campaigned against Christmas. She continues: I really object to my name and reputation being misused by an elected official to tell a false story. Wolf responds to Taylor’s attack in parliament today. Taylor asked her to apologise for calling him antisemitic. She says: I have to say I’m quite taken aback by what you’re telling me. I think it’s very inappropriate, and very wrong. The government’s plans to merge the family court have hit a bit of a snag. The proposal to merge the federal and federal circuit courts was condemned by the Law Council of Australia and other legal groups which warned earlier this week that it risked “victims of family violence falling through the cracks”. The Senate has set a reporting date on the legislation by November 2020. The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, says this has “effectively put a one-year hold” on the plan. Dreyfus: Mr Porter stunned many in the family court sector in May last year when he announced plans to destroy the family court on the basis of a six-week desktop review by a firm of consultants. Earlier this year, a comprehensive report by the Australian Law Reform Commission – which the government commissioned and is still to respond to – totally contradicted the attorney general by recommending the creation of an entirely new court system and greater specialisation in the family law system. The Morrison government has not responded to that ALRC report. Instead Mr Porter reached agreement with One Nation to hold yet another inquiry into the family law system. Albanese moves on to Angus Taylor. He wonders whether the Naomi Wolf scandal might “get up on TV tonight”. I think it might, I think it might. Because the extraordinary attack on Naomi Wolf, who was in New York, not a roomie, at college in the United Kingdom at the time. At that very year she had the number one bestselling book in the world! Like, this wasn’t someone obscure, and what did he do? He ripped into her. Nothing to see here. She should apologise. To him! to him! Like he’s the victim... and this prime minister keeps running a protection racket for this bloke. It is the witness protection program that this man has. Question time ends. Anthony Albanese leaps up to speak. He says Scott Morrison is acting as though he’s been on a “victory lap” since the election and had won 100% of the vote. We’re not a one-party state, he says. This is a democracy. This is the greatest jackboot administration that we have seen, and today in sacking five departmental heads, what they have also done is centralised power at the centre. Because when you have multiple cabinet ministers with a single department... all power gets centralised to prime minister and cabinet. The fact is that this government regards democracy as an inconvenience, one that can be dismissed at any time. Things are deteriorating here. Lots of anger, lots of bile. Lots of insults followed by withdrawals. Urgh. Pull the plug already. Mark Butler turns the attack to Angus Taylor. He asks a question that mentions allegations Taylor lied about going to Oxford with the US author Naomi Wolf, who Taylor spoke about in the context of students warring on Christmas and wanting to remove a Christmas tree from their common room. Taylor comes out swinging. He reckons he did see Wolf at Oxford, despite her saying she was on the other side of the world at the time. Of course I recall seeing and meeting Ms Wolf at New College in Oxford during my time there. She began her studies there in the mid-80s and she finished at Oxford only a couple of years ago. Now my speech to the parliament six years ago did not say she was involved in the war on Christmas. I want to say this, her accusation of antisemitism is wrong and deeply offensive to me and my family. Mr Speaker, my grandmother was Jewish and my belief in Judeo-Christian values is deeply held. I call for her to apologise for these unsubstantiated and outrageous accusations. The fact that the Labor party has attached itself to antisemitic accusations shows just how low they’re prepared to go. The last bit provokes uproar. Anthony Albanese wants him to withdraw the accusation that Labor is antisemitic, which didn’t really make any logical sense. Taylor withdraws. Morrison continues: I understand the leader of the opposition is very angry, Mr Speaker, and he’s angry because the government is standing up for those who don’t want to see thuggery and bullying in their workplace, particularly against women, Mr Speaker. He accuses Labor of attempting to attack his faith, which prompts uproar from Labor. Morrison: That’s what you did, that’s what you did. Tony Burke is furious and says that attack is “very personal” and should be withdrawn. Labor’s deputy leader, Richard Marles, asks Scott Morrison why he doesn’t believe in integrity and accountability, before rattling off a series of examples. The treatment of the union bill this morning, misleading parliament, his phone call over the NSW police investigation into Angus Taylor, why he was sacked as chief executive of Tourism Australia, and why he invited Brian Houston to the White House. The question prompts shouts of “smear”, “smear”, “no policy” and “muckraking” from the government benches. Morrison repeats a line from earlier this week. This is question time, it’s not smear time. Tanya Plibersek asks why Scott Morrison has lied about reducing funding for Tafe. He responds: As the member would know, funding for Tafe is provided by state and territory governments ... so the member can’t come and say things that are simply untrue. Scott Morrison is asked a question on what he is doing to increase the number of nurses in aged care facilities. I will take that matter up, and make sure I get an answer, Mr Speaker. He speaks about the aged care royal commission. It is very distressing what was reported in that report, and as that report reflected this deals with issues that have been endemic that have been in the aged care sector for a very long time and the government is seeking to address the issues in aged care, which are serious and substantial. Morrison says they are increasing the number of aged care places, and reducing the use of chemical restraints and the number of young people ending up in care. A couple of economic questions from Labor. The shadow treasurer, Jim Chalmers, asks why we have falling investment, a weakening economy, flat wages and rising unemployment, when the government promised to build a stronger economy. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg: The shadow treasurer referred to investment. I can confirm that under the Coalition that investment outside of the mining sector has increased 34% since we’ve come to office, or over 5% per year. Now under the Labor party, investment outside of the mining sector fell by 10% during their time in office. Heaps of gesticulating for the dixers. Andrew Laming giving it a red hot animated go with his “down, down, Labor debt down” line to Josh Frydenberg. Albanese asks again about the government’s rushing through of the union-busting bill this morning without debate. Why does this prime minister not respect the democratic process? Morrison says the bill was debated extensively last week. This issue, this matter of dealing with thuggish, militant unionism is something the Australian people wanted us to address. We stand up for what we believe in. This matter has been through this place before, it’s been up in the Senate before. It went through some 15 or 16 hours of debate in the other place, Mr Speaker. He continues: I will stand up against thugs, Mr Speaker. The Labor party stands up for thugs. Last day of school vibes going on here. Couple of Labor MPs have been booted, including Joel Fitzgibbon. Michael McCormack leaps up. He’s had a running war with Fitzgibbon all week. Well the average IQ of the chamber just went up, see you Joel, have a nice Christmas mate. Albanese asks the prime minister, Scott Morrison, why he has failed to bring on legislation following the banking royal commission but broke precedents to ram through the union-busting legislation this morning. Morrison said: I introduced the laws that ensured the banking executives who did the wrong thing should be punted forever. That’s what I did, Mr Speaker, and those opposite sought to frustrate it. He said “ugly militant unionism should have no place in this country”. Morrison gets a tough one from his backbenches. Australia is the best country in the world, as we all know, so tell us why you’re so great etc etc. Question time is upon us. Anthony Albanese says the government won’t support freedom of speech, won’t support freedom to protest and now won’t support debate in parliament. He refers to the union-busting legislation that was pushed through the lower house without debate. When the prime minister talks about quiet Australians, doesn’t he actually mean silent Australians? Morrison says: On the night of the election, I thanked all those Australians who go about their lives honestly decently with their aspirations. They’re the Australians our government spoke directly to, Mr Speaker. Morrison says Albanese has spent his political career focussed on the “bubble of this place” and the “tawdry drama of Canberra”. The mystery of the missing bills, by Mike Bowers. OK, I’m calling it. Speech of the week goes to Tim Watts. Hands down. Watts is the Labor MP who last week tweeted about Angus Taylor’s first speech and its references to Naomi Wolf and a plot to remove a Christmas tree from their Oxford common room. The US author has since slammed Taylor’s speech as wildly inaccurate and ethnically divisive. “The response was, well, unexpected,” he says. “It was a cautionary tale straight [from] Aesop’s Fables that summed up the minister’s career to date. You could call it: the boy who cried Wolf.” I’ll let Watts, who read from a mock book of fairy tales, do the rest. Here’s how it goes. Once there was a grasslands boy who wanted to be prime minister. One day for no comprehensible reason, the boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted ‘Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, Wolf, there’s a Wolf trying to steal Christmas’. But when people looked, there was no wolf. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again ‘a man from Yass, a man from Yass, a man from Yass asked me to protect my grasslands from meddling environmental regulation’. But when the people looked, there was no man from Yass. Later, the boy who wanted to be prime minister sang out again ‘a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor, a junketeering mayor spending millions of dollars on flights’. But when the people looked, there was no junketeering mayor. One day, the boy who wanted to be prime minister was lying in his grasslands when a taskforce Garrad came upon him. The boy who wanted to be prime minister shouted ‘a smear, a smear, a smear’. But when the people looked, there was no smear. One day, the boy who cried Wolf will tell the truth. But well, that bit hasn’t happened here yet. But if you believe in fairy tales, maybe one day it will. Labor is moving a motion saying the government’s attempts to push the union-busting bill through without debate was “anti-democratic”. Better still is this bit of the motion: This is a prime ministerial tantrum, with the prime minister of Australia behaving like a juvenile schoolyard bully just because he didn’t get his way last week. Yeah, dunno, but not sure the government will go for this one. We’re now moving through the votes for the government’s union-busting bill. The Community and Public Sector Union, the main union representing public servants, said the changes announced by the prime minister today will do nothing to enhance service delivery. The union says the major review of the public service, conducted by David Thodey, did not suggest creating new super departments, and instead suggested the opposite. The CPSU national secretary, Melissa Donnelly, said: It is clear that the prime minister is out of ideas. First he borrowed Services Australia from the NSW government, now super-departments. Moving buildings and merging departments does not fix the service crisis created by his own government. We know that since 2013 18,908 or 11.4% of public service jobs have been cut under successive Liberal governments, causing enormous damage to the capacity of the commonwealth to deliver policy and essential services that all Australians rely upon. This change will not do anything to address the 48 million unanswered calls to DHS in 2017/2018 or the further 5.3 million calls abandoned out of frustration. These are not the actions of a good government. This won’t change the delays in the family court, and it won’t change the challenges our CSIRO face. Rightio. Well, now the speaker has done a bit of digging. And it turns out there were in fact copies of the bills in the House, despite all of that. Speaker Tony Smith says: I’ve been able to ascertain some facts, I realise emotions are running high. I can report that notwithstanding the view ... that there were no bills present. That was not correct. I have checked. There were bills present. I’m not going to have an argument about this. Prior to the ringing of the bells there were 25 copies, Smith says. Another 40 copies were being brought in. More were being printed. Enough for everyone! Mike Bowers captured the government benches as they attempted to gag debate and pass union-busting legislation on the last sitting day of the year. He’s still in the chamber and tells me the clerks and attendants are running around, pointing at to a pile on the desk, and saying they were there all along. Anthony Albanese is responding to that mess in the House as we speak. This is a prime minister who doesn’t want scrutiny from the media, he doesn’t want scrutiny from the parliament either. And we’ve seen this today. Albanese likens the government’s actions to a “totalitarian state”. We have now had the parliament shut down because the government is incapable of running a basic democratic process. Here they run in, they gag debate, they refuse to allow anyone to speak, to push through legislation. To what end? So that they can make a point that even though they lost in the Senate last week, they won in the House today. Right, well, that was a bit of a circus. My head is still spinning. Just to recap: the government sought to move quickly on its union-busing legislation this morning, suspending usual business to get straight to it. then it tried to gag debate in a way Tony Burke described as “unprecedented”. then the vote was called. But the opposition said it had not seen a copy of the bill it was supposed to be voting on. The government said there were copies in the chamber, but Labor insisted it hasn’t seen them. it prompted uproar. Labor are and were outraged. All the while, MPs are unable to stand to speak during the division, so they’re sitting down with pieces of paper or books on their head as a signal they have the call. Speaker Tony Smith considers the issue momentarily. He decides that, yes, people probably should have access to copies of the legislation they are voting on. Fair, I would have thought. He suspends the vote for 15 minutes to get copies. Anthony Albanese has called a press conference. The vote is being called off momentarily so we can all cool our heads. We’ve suspended sitting for about 15 minutes to sort it all out. We’re now stuck in the lower house in a very bizarre situation. Labor are saying they do not have copies of the union-busting legislation they are voting on. The government says it brought 60 copies in yesterday. The speaker, Tony Smith, initially demands legislation be brought in. Then there’s confusion because he receives updated advice saying the copies of the legislation were previously in the chamber. Stay tuned. There’s an interesting development in the Senate. Labor has moved (with government support I gather) to establish a new select committee into foreign interference in democracy through social media. Chris and I (and other colleagues at Guardian Australia) have been very attentive to this fake news/misinformation phenomenon having looked deeply into the death tax campaign on Facebook during the May election. Here’s the meat of the motion that’s about to be moved by the Labor senator Jenny McAllister. (1) That a select committee, to be known as the Select Committee on Foreign Interference through Social Media, be established to inquire into and report on the risk posed to Australia’s democracy by foreign interference through social media, with particular reference to: (a) use of social media for purposes that undermine Australia’s democracy and values, including the spread of misinformation; (b) responses to mitigate the risk posed to Australia’s democracy and values, including by the Australian Government and social media platforms; (c) international policy responses to cyber-enabled foreign interference and misinformation; (d) the extent of compliance with Australian laws; and (e) any related matters. (2) That the committee present its final report on or before the second sitting day of May 2022. This inquiry will be one to watch in the new year. Incidentally, Labor has also asked the JSCEM (the joint parliamentary committee on electoral matters) to look at the role of misinformation on the platforms as part of the inquiry it does every election cycle into the conduct of the last federal election. Strange scenes in the lower house. Members are unable to stand to speak, so are signalling they want the call by placing a book or paper on their head. Drama down in the house. The government is returning its union-busting “ensuring integrity” bill, which was defeated on Friday after a shock last-minute switch by One Nation. The bill is currently before the lower house again. But the Coalition is trying to gag debate. It prompts uproar in the chamber. Labor leader Anthony Albanese says the government is attempting to use gag orders that were never intended to limit debate for partisan or party political reasons. It is my view that the government is using this provision to shut down democratic debate in this parliament and it is an abuse of our democratic processes. Tony Burke says the government’s actions are unprecedented. What is happening right now is a change in the role of this house... as to whether it is a parliamentary debating chamber or whether it is only here for the voice of the prime minister and his chosen ministers. Albanese says Labor is being asked to vote on legislation it hasn’t seen. We are being asked now to vote on legislation which I don’t have, there are no copies anywhere. how can we possibly do that. is it within standing orders for us to be voting on legislation, I don’t know what it is. It is appropriate for us to be voting on this without having copies of it? Reports in the Channel Nine newspapers this morning confirmed the government is pressing ahead with plans to privatise Australia’s visa processing services. The shadow assistant immigration minister, Andrew Giles, was out on the hustings this morning, saying the position leaves 2,000 workers going into Christmas in fear of losing their jobs. This is isn’t good enough we know that this is a terrible idea. We know this because everyone has been saying so. This is an absolutely friendless proposal. Former secretaries of the immigration department have referred to the risks to the integrity of our system, risks also to national security. The Community and Public Sector Union has warned that this could be the new robodebt implemented. And we know what will happen in Australia, because we’ve seen what has happened in the UK with their visa system that has been privatised. We’ve seen massive cuts to services and the creation of a two-tier system, where people who can afford to pay get a fast track system. In Australia we’re not hearing enough about why the government is doing this. The United Firefighters Union was at Parliament House this morning speaking out about the effects of climate change and the extending and intensifying the fire season. From their statement: The United Firefighters Union of Australia passed a unanimous resolution at its national council in Canberra demanding a national approach that would allow firefighting to operate seamlessly across borders, improving the compatibility and capacity of different state and territory services, and boosting the number of professional firefighters. The national council of the UFU passed the resolution calling for an “urgent phase-out of coal, oil, and gas” because they are “driving more dangerous and intense fires”. The UFU national president, Greg McConville, said: Now is absolutely the time to talk about climate change and the ever more intense fires being fought by our members. We are stretched to breaking point. The fire season is longer and more intense than ever. We need to begin work now to boost the nation’s firefighting capacity and make it truly interoperable. Interesting point on the machinery of government changes from Markus Mannheim. Stephen Jones, the shadow assistant treasurer, is on Sky News saying Morrison should accept the New Zealand deal to get children off Manus Island and Nauru. He rejects the government’s insistence that there are no more kids there. Jones urged Morrison to be “pragmatic” and take the NZ deal. The politics of it are toxic and the humanity of it gets left out when the politics gets injected into it. The PM announcing an overhaul of the public service, courtesy of Mike Bowers. The PM’s office has just released a more detailed list of those changes. They will take effect from February. Here’s the full list: The creation of the Department of Education, Skills and Employment, which will consolidate the current Department of Education; and the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, which will consolidate: the current Department of Agriculture; and environment functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy. The creation of the Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, which will consolidate: the current Department of Industry, Innovation and Science; energy functions from the current Department of the Environment and Energy; and small business functions from the current Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business. The creation of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications, which will consolidate: the current Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development; and the current Department of Communications and the Arts. The Department known as Services Australia (formerly known as the Department of Human Services) will be established as a new Executive Agency, within the Social Services Department. Just to recap on those machinery of government changes: the education and employment departments are being merged the agriculture department is combining with the environment department energy will be merged with the industry, innovation and science department The communications and arts portfolio is being merged with infrastructure and transport department A few interesting tidbits there. Energy is being decoupled from environment. But emissions reduction stays with energy. Just to reiterate, the PM is proposing no costs savings and no job losses, aside from the five departmental secretaries. Morrison is asked whether the government will consider New Zealand’s offer to take refugees from Manus and Nauru. We’ve always been very aware of the New Zealand government’s offer. The government will continue to implement its policies as we’ve set them out. Scott Morrison says he has full confidence in Angus Taylor. What Angus has done in the past six months to get the big stick legislation through, to ensure the dodgy late payment fees that are charged by energy companies, they’re all gone. The policy performance of Angus Taylor is not under question. Morrison says this is not a “savings measure”. So department secretaries and others will undertake the normal things that they do in managing their budgets. This isn’t about any cost saving measures. I expect frankly all departmental secretaries to be maximising efficiencies. Morrison says there will be no change to ministerial portfolios. I’m very pleased, very pleased, with the performance of all my ministers. Morrison announces we’re losing five departmental secretaries as part of the shake-up. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, is speaking to the media. He’s speaking about changes to the public service. The Australian reported this morning that he was “poised to put an axe through the public service today with plans to dramatically cut the number of government departments with another round of mandarins set for the chopping block”. Morrison announces he will reduce the number of government departments from 18 to 14. He says the APS will need to provide services more “efficiently and effectively”. This sounds very much like a standard machinery of government change. Departments being renamed and subsumed into others. You know, the type we do every few years for some reason. Every time this happens, I can only think of all the corporate merchandise that’s suddenly become redundant due to departmental name changes. I’m weird, I know. But what do they do with it all? So many spare pens. We could use them over here at the Guardian, just FYI, if departments are feeling charitable. So far he’s named changes to the education, agriculture, environment and industry portfolios. We’ll have a full list of changes shortly. Morrison says he wants a public service that “is very much focused on implementation”. They [public servants] should expect from us clear direction, and we should continue to expect from them being able to continue to discharge their duties in the incredibly professional way they do. Mick Keelty, the inspector general of the Murray-Darling basin water resources, spoke to ABC radio a little earlier about just what the government has asked him to do. Keelty was tasked with a review of water sharing arrangement amid damaging protests for the Nationals in Canberra this week. He’s asked precisely what he’s actually going to do: In plain speak, whilst there’s been a lot of attention focussed on the Murray-Darling basin plan, what the federal minister David Littleproud was able to broker this week, and to his great credit ... without jumping to a conclusion is what is happening now is the inquiry will actually properly define what the problem is. Is the problem the Murray-Darling basin plan and the operations of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, or is it something deeper than that? Were the plans [the water sharing agreements] developed at a period of time where the inflows, particularly from the northern basin, were actually happening? And of course for the past two years, they haven’t been happening there’s nothing in the northern basin coming through and feeding into the system. Keelty is asked how the protesters, previously furious at Littleproud and the Nationals, came away feeling comfortable with the result. He said the protesters were not promised any additional water as a result of the review. Nobody has promised more water. There is no more water to give under the current rules. That has been exhaustively examined by both the commonwealth and the individuals involved. But there is water around. The prime minister has just called a press conference for 10.30am. Stick with us. On the Murray Darling, Nationals MP Damian Drum is saying the water-sharing agreements between the states are outdated. He hopes the review by Mick Keelty, the Murray-Darling inspector general, will improve them. These agreements have been in place for over 100 years. But the water regime that now exists ... so much of the water used to be used next to the storage, now the users of the water are 400km away from the storage. Drum was out the front of parliament with Barnaby Joyce a little earlier this week, copping an earful from farmers. He says: The Nationals have got to lead the way because people expect us to fix it. they don’t expect the Liberals to fix it, they don’t expect Labor to fix it, and they know the Greens will only make it worse. Greens senator Nick McKim urges the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to pick up the phone and talk to Jacinda Ardern for the “sake of humanity”. In regard to prime minister Morrison, I think he needs to pick up the phone. Make the arrangement with New Zealand. There is no need for him to wait until the US arrangements have concluded. You can walk and chew gum at the same time. I’d urge him to do that for the sake of humanity. Ardern is asked whether New Zealand would consider preventing asylum seekers who go to NZ on resettlement would be prevented from later coming to Australia. She says: If that was a scenario to be created, it would be created by Australia and ultimately it would be in their own domestic policy ... It would be a matter for them. During the interview, Ardern mentions multiple times the deportation of New Zealand citizens from Australia, an issue that has caused much angst across the Tasman. Ardern is asked whether she would want something in return for accepting refugees. She says: That is not how we operate our relationship. New Zealand’s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has spoken to Sky News. She said NZ’s offer was still on the table. Yes, that has not changed, but as I say the ball is obviously in Australia’s court. She says Australia has not approached NZ about the deal recently. No discussions at that level and as I say ... as far as I’m concerned we are still in the same status quo. On to other things. Adam Bandt is planning to move to suspend standing orders in the lower house. He wants the house to note that the medevac repeal deal was done in secret. Naomi Wolf is really going after Angus Taylor on this one. I’ll let her tweets do the talking. My colleague Helen Davidson has just filed on further developments in the unlikely stoush between Angus Taylor and the US author Naomi Wolf: Naomi Wolf has reignited her stoush with Australia’s energy minister, Angus Taylor, publishing what she said was a transcript of a phone call with his office. On Thursday morning the US author said she had recorded a call to Taylor’s parliamentary office requesting a “formal correction” to the Hansard record of his maiden speech, asking that Taylor “tell Parliament please that I was not campaigning against Xmas in any way?” Taylor referred to Wolf in his maiden speech to parliament in 2013 while recounting an anecdote about “political correctness” and a dispute over a Christmas tree at Oxford University in 1991, when he was a Rhodes scholar. When Wolf was alerted to the speech on Monday she pointed out that she was not at Oxford in 1991 and accused the minister of “antisemitic dogwhistling”. On Thursday Wolf said Taylor’s staffer had told her that all media who had reported on the story had been given the advice that she was not campaigning against Christmas. “Can I have evidence?” Wolf said. The spokesman responded: “I’m sorry, obviously we can’t prove that has been provided.” The fallout is continuing from the Australian government’s repeal of medevac laws. Australia is now being urged to take New Zealand’s offer to accept 150 refugees from Manus and Nauru a year. We mentioned earlier that there is speculation that Jacqui Lambie was pursuing resettlement when she gave her vote to the government. David Manne, executive director of the Refugee &amp; Immigration Legal Centre, said there was no logic to the government’s refusal to accept the NZ offer. He described suggestions that it would create a “pull” factor for people wanting to come to Australia as “spurious”. “It doesn’t make any rational sense,” he told Sky News. Manne also dismisses the government’s figures showing that most of those who came to Australia through medevac are not in hospital. We’ve reported already that medevac is designed for assessment and healthcare, not just acute hospital care, so it’s not surprising. Manne makes a similar point: When someone is sick, sometimes they’re in hospital, sometimes they’re not. You don’t measure whether someone is in need of healthcare ... by whether they are in hospital. So what exactly are we expecting from today? Well, it’s another day of parliament, so of course we can expect another Angus Taylor controversy. And lo and behold, it’s not yet hit 8.30am, and there’s already something unfolding. Naomi Wolf, the well-known US author, is on the warpath against the minister over his misrepresentation of an alleged encounter they had at Oxford University in their student days. That encounter happened, in Taylor’s telling, at a time when Wolf was on the other side of the ocean. We’ll bring you a bit more about that in a moment. On another Taylor front, there were reports yesterday naming the staffer said to have obtained and distributed the document with dodgy figures about the City of Sydney council’s travel expenditure. Expect more of a pursuit on that from Labor. We’re also anticipating more fallout from the medevac repeal yesterday. The critical question remains: what did Jacqui Lambie secure from the government in exchange for her crucial vote? There’s been some suggestion that she’s won an agreement from the government to pursue the resettlement of refugees from Manus and Nauru. But she’s staying silent on the whole thing, and the government is insisting there is “no secret deal”. The Murray-Darling basin is continuing to cause headaches for the Nationals. The government has announced a review of water sharing in the Murray-Darling. The protesters have left Canberra with a sense of victory. But the question remains: what will the review actually achieve? How will it deliver more water for those without any? Have the Nationals actually resolved the issue? The poor school results out yesterday are still prompting reaction this morning. Tanya Plibersek has been out this morning saying the focus must be on teacher investment, through professional development and mentoring. The government says throwing more money at the problem is not working. There’s another report out this morning in the Sydney Morning Herald about Gladys Liu, reporting that she asked the Liberal party to give her back a donation of at least $100,000. The report claims Liu says the donation she gave was a loan. Happy last sitting day of the year! It’s a momentous occasion. Who knows what else parliament can achieve today? It’s already denied doctor-led medical care to those we’ve condemned to remote islands for daring to seek asylum. Hard to top, even for this bunch, you’d think. But I digress. Alongside the fallout from medevac, there’s plenty of issues on the boil. Angus Taylor. The Murray-Darling basin.The fallout from medevac. Chinese government influence. Stick with us and we’ll get through it all together."

          "bodyText": "The artist Rebecca Hendin has won the political cartoon of the year award for a work in the Guardian that depicted Boris Johnson sitting in a burning room while skipping a joint press conference with Luxembourg’s prime minister. Hendin’s artwork was published in September after the prime minister failed to appear with Xavier Bettel, amid boos from protesters. Johnson faced hostility as he left a working lunch with the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, before opting out of plans to speak alongside Bettel, after being targeted by a larger crowd. Hendin’s cartoon, riffing on a popular meme by KC Green, shows Johnson sitting in a chair, with fire all around him, and a speech bubble with the words: “This is fine.” He is watching Bettel on TV gesticulating at an empty podium as the press conference goes ahead without him. The runner-up award also went to a Guardian cartoon, one by Ben Jennings about knife crime depicting the grim reaper with young people in hoodies outside a closed community centre. It appeared after Britain’s most senior police officer contradicted Theresa May’s claim that police cuts were not to blame for a rise in violent crime. The Political Cartoon of the Year Awards were presented at a ceremony in Westminster by the former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke and Kate Hoey, the former Labour MP for Vauxhall – neither of whom is standing for re-election. Hendin tweeted a series of pictures celebrating her win: In another of Hendin’s recent cartoons for the Guardian, she depicted Johnson’s visit to flood-hit towns, where his head appears just above water. Next to him is written “Get Brexit done”. It came after Johnson was accused of doing nothing to help flood victims as he visited one of the worst-hit areas and told residents: “We’ve been on it round the clock.”"

          "headline": "'It's about solidarity': the artists who hijacked the Turner prize speak out",
          "bodyText": "The idea came to them in June. The Turner prize nominees had arrived in Margate to visit the Turner Contemporary. The four artists – Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Helen Cammock, Oscar Murillo, Tai Shani – had never met before and, as they talked in a white-walled meeting room facing the North Sea, they began to discuss proposing themselves to the judges as a collective. Their idea was, in other words, that there should be no single winner of this year’s Turner prize. It was a plan for a hijack – albeit, says Cammock, “a considered hijack”. “I don’t remember who said it out loud first,” says Shani, whose sensuous, voluptuous work for the prize’s exhibition combines performance, text and installation to imagine a post-patriarchal world. “We’d all thought about it. For me, it felt like being nominated was a huge recognition. I was really happy with that. When someone suggested it, we were very cohesive immediately.” Murillo – who is showing an unsettling installation of papier-mache figures staring out to sea, their view all but blocked by a dark curtain – says: “If any of us had individually won, I would have felt I was betraying my own work and ideas – if we are indeed really talking about solidarity.” Abu Hamdan quickly understood that although his fellow shortlisted artists use very different aesthetic tools from him, they have much in common – an interest in power and agency, exclusion and oppression. “If anyone gets what we do as individual artists, they will get why this decision had to be made,” he says. His films in the show arise from a project to collect aural memories from survivors of the infamous Saydnaya prison in Syria – memories that in practical terms helped researchers reconstruct the conditions of incarceration but also, in their distortions and metaphorical layerings, allowed the artist to mine a deeper, poetic understanding of these horrific experiences. “There was something about the way we work and why we work that resonated,” remembers Cammock, who is showing a film about women’s resistance and protest in Derry during the Troubles. “We started to talk about the toxic political environment and it felt like it was a moment we could start doing something about that, between us – however that worked or manifested.” As their eventual joint statement puts it, they believed that pitting themselves against each other “would undermine our individual artistic efforts to show a world entangled. The issues we each deal with are as inseparable as climate chaos is from capitalism.” Proposing themselves as a collective, as an act of resistance, would be a symbolic gesture. Symbolism is, of course, the great tool of the artist – and the Turner prize, for the British artist, is the most prominent platform from which to deploy it. This coup was, says Shani, “actually quite a bureaucratic process. We didn’t have very high hopes of it going through. This idea of Mutiny on the Bounty – that wasn’t quite how it panned out.” They made a proposal to Tate Britain, which runs the prize, in the summer and it wound its way up to the trustees before being offered to the jurors as an option. They weren’t at all sure it would be accepted. The jurors met as usual on Tuesday, the day of the announcement, and were free to ignore what the artists had suggested – though realistically, there wasn’t much moral wriggle-room. So they accepted and the artists will split the prize money equally, £10,000 each. At the prize ceremony, in Margate’s art deco Dreamland amusement park, Cammock read the full statement – the most political Turner prize speech in years, a sustained attack on the Conservatives’ politics of austerity and exclusion. To slam the point home, Shani was sporting an enormous pendant bearing the slogan: “TORIES OUT.” She talked of an increasingly narrow idea of “Britishness” offered by the right. As Abu Hamdan put it the morning after: “There’s a disconnect between being accepted as a British artist culturally – and being put on the highest platform of what it means to be a British artist – and the ‘hostile environment’.” This feels personal to all of them. Abu Hamdan has a British passport but lives in Beirut partly because of the difficulties of settling his Lebanese wife in Britain. Murillo, who was born in Colombia, once flushed his British passport down an aeroplane loo in a moment of rebellion against the privilege the document confers. Shani, who is Jewish, talks about how she feels “antisemitism has been manipulated by the right. There’s a feeling that you are being instrumentalised and that people are speaking on behalf of your identity in the name of protecting you.” Cammock feels that the current climate of division and racism is “a resurgence of something toxically dangerous, like a wave that keeps rising”. Should artists be getting into this kind of territory? Well, why not? All art is political. But the other point these artists press home is that they also live in the real world. Their work is not magically disconnected from their lives and opinions, and the society in which they live. “I’ve been vocal about my financial precarity,” says Shani, who has posted on social media about how she’s feared having to give up working as an artist because of the difficulty of making ends meet. “People ask me,” chips in Cammock, “about how the arts can become more inclusive spaces for people who don’t come from wealthy backgrounds. But art isn’t isolated from society. If people are excluded from other things, they will also be excluded from the arts.” Shani continues: “If people aren’t paid properly in the arts then people can’t be artists.” Cammock: “And if it’s being taken out of state education and becomes something for privileged private schools.” Shani: “Then there’s higher education, tuition fees. Everything is related. We are part of society.” You could reasonably ask: if the artists had been so eager to disrupt the rules of the Turner prize, why did they allow their nominations to go forward in the first place? They had the choice and many – mostly famously Sarah Lucas – have turned down the chance over the years. The artists all say they are honoured to have been shortlisted, and their decision was contingent on the synergies between them – another combination, in another year, and it wouldn’t have happened. But also, points out Cammock, this isn’t an isolated incident. Look at the history of sport. “There have been many moments when people have taken a stand – moments where people have seen the interconnectedness between things and have made a decision. They run across the line together. They do the black power salute.” Abu Hamdan pitches in: “And there’s Kaepernick” – referring to the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who took the knee during The Star-Spangled Banner as a protest against racism. “We are not in an isolated bubble,” says Cammock. “We are people too.” We are in a moment when the traditional cultural authority of the arts prize – with its single “genius” winner – is being challenged. More and more victors of prizes (Helen Marten, for example, who won the Turner in 2016) are choosing to share out the prize money with their fellow nominees. In the case of the Booker prize this year, it was the judges who refused to observe the rules, presenting Bernardine Evaristo and Margaret Atwood as joint winners in defiance of the organisers. Shani sees this as part of a wider shift – a mood of unpicking authority, of seeing through the accepted matrices of power and questioning them. It is possible that the world is moving beyond the monolithic, winner-takes-all prize – increasingly people are questioning the act that holds up one artist as the best. In the present case, it’s hard not to fall for the sincerity of these four artists who, without cynicism, have expressed their beliefs and hopes through the means at their disposal. “What did Audre Lorde say?” says Cammock, in reference to the American poet and activist. “‘Your silence will not protect you.’ This is a moment of saying no to silence.” • The Turner prize exhibition is at Turner Contemporary, Margate, until 12 January."

          "bodyText": "TV to the left of me, laptops to the right, there I was, stuck in the middle with Amazon Prime. Primed for prime on a Tuesday night – waiting like all other broadcasters who hadn’t been asked to take part to see if it fell apart. A centre-forward relies on the service from the wide men. Here Gabby Logan and friends depended on the service of your broadband. And I had no complaints. It ran smoothly and the football happened. Like it always does. The football, of course, wasn’t the important bit. What mattered was how well social media performed over the course of the evening. I’d already lined up a zinger of a tweet. “Very much hoping, as Chris Wood scores a last-minute winner, the Amazon Prime commentator says: ‘Add that to your basket and check out.’” One hundred retweets and 1,000 likes. It didn’t land like Andy Ruiz Jr on Anthony Joshua. But it wasn’t a bad start. It would get worse. Just the three retweets for “I’m afraid Sakhos are no longer in stock. #crybou #amazon” after he careered into Adam Smith. It would get worse. It turns out Amazon’s major selling point – that you can watch all the games – is the worst thing about it. You CAN watch all the games. You CAN watch Crystal Palace v Bournemouth. Any other year, we would have been blissfully unaware of such an offering. Two minutes at the end of Match of the Day when you’ve stopped concentrating. A three paragraph report in a paper to be skimmed over. But I watched every minute of that half. Or more accurately, every minute of that half was broadcast into my living room. As soon as my concentration lapses in any game – a break in play, or even just a throw-in – I turn to the second screen. Here was my tactical setup. Mamadou Sakho’s red card happens on Mrs Rushden’s laptop which is placed on my lap. She hadn’t used her free Amazon Prime trial. I have Twitter open on my laptop on the sofa to my left. In between my failed attempts to tweet amusing things about the football, I’m engaged in the first ever polite conversation about antisemitism with a man called Ben, who’s reacting to something I sent about tactical voting five hours earlier. At the same time, Jack has tweeted to point out the comedian and Guardian Football Weekly contributor Elis James is doing the voiceover for a BBC Four documentary about a farmyard. I turn the telly off mute and listen to his soothing voice. Elis informs me about roosters while the Aberystwyth brass band serenade a herd of cattle. I get my phone to WhatsApp Elis his narration back to him. And this is how I consume football. Four screens. Three conversations. Two with people I have never met, while a Welshman is telling me about bumble bees in the background as I’m telling that same Welshman he’s telling me about bumble bees. Perhaps if Palace v Bournemouth had been more interesting, I’d have confined myself to just one other screen. And perhaps I’m the only idiot incapable of concentrating on one thing at a time. But I doubt either is true. And this isn’t confined to the armchair. Every other fan in the ground is on their phone – either checking a refereeing decision or filming another free-kick from behind the goal. This could be the one that goes in and we can get a point-of-view shot of an iPhone being smashed on the floor. Ten minutes into the Burnley v Manchester City game and people are complaining about buffering. How can we possibly be expected to watch a game a minute after it is really happening? Are we not owed real-time footage from Turf Moor piped into our living rooms? If we are 60 seconds behind, what’s the point? We put a man on the moon FFS. I bet Neil Armstrong wasn’t on delay. Buffering gives me yet another opportunity to tweet. I make up that Manchester City have taken the lead in the 22nd minute. “City 1-0. Great finish from Sterling.” In come the replies. “You can’t report this quick when we’re streaming.” The more perceptive: “Are you lying?” Then in the 24th minute, before I’ve finished explaining I was kidding, Gabriel Jesus scores with a great finish. So instead of gently winding up a few people concerned by a small delay in the broadcast, now I look like a massive racist, as is pointed out to me by just a couple of people. I’m lucky it doesn’t blow up. Perhaps it’s fate’s way of telling me to just watch the game. And so Amazon’s problem isn’t Amazon’s problem at all. It’s our problem. During rare moments of reflection, I close my laptop and hurl it to the other end of the sofa – out of reach. Within seconds I sneak my phone out of my pocket. I forget who came up with the phrase – when you get bored of the big internet so you check the smaller internet to see what’s up. It’s almost as if the world will stop if we don’t comment on everything. After Unai Emery was sacked, I found myself arranging my condiments on the kitchen table, cutting a speech bubble out of the back of an envelope, finding some Sellotape and sticking it to the salad cream with the phrase “Arsenal talking to Allegri”, just so I could tweet: “This is what my sauces are saying about the next Arsenal boss.” The worst part of that is I was quite pleased with it. I am a 40-year-old man. I have interests. All that for 32 retweets. In the last decade I have sent more than 63,500 tweets. I could have written a book. I am taking steps. I leave my phone downstairs at night – but there are times when I just stare at it thinking of something to say. When I sat in the Junior U’s enclosure at Cambridge United in the 90s, the half-time entertainment was the Tannoy man giving us the latest scores from around the country. It was genuinely thrilling. When a game was on the TV, I watched it. I concentrated. I fell in love with that. I want to go back to that – but I’m not sure I can."

          "bodyText": "Here we go. A nip in the air, the Christmas lights are up, Black Friday deals are still hanging around, and it is time once again for another international climate conference. The COP, or conference of the parties to give it its full name (the “parties” being the signatories to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change) is the UN’s annual climate talks. This year it’s in Madrid, next year it’s Glasgow’s turn. They’ve been going since 1995 and although they are covered by journalists, they tend to run pretty inconspicuously. But this time it feels that things might be different. That this is a special COP. Why not, when we’ve had the climate strikes, parliament calling a climate emergency and the advocacy of the inspirational Greta Thunberg? The world might finally be watching. Except, we’ve been here before. Wind back a decade to visit the ghost of climate politics past, when COP15 was in Copenhagen. This was promised to be a COP with a difference, set to update the 1997 Kyoto protocol (not least because the US had pulled out of it) and build global climate action fit for the 21st century. Climate change was, not unlike today, high on the list of public concerns. Campaign rhetoric was heavy with phrases such as “the time is now” and graphics of ticking clocks. There were new protest movements cropping up, warm words from politicians, as well as hand wringing over the ethics of flying, celeb-fronted concerts to raise awareness and even an Attenborough special on the BBC. We called it climate chaos back then, rather than a crisis, and it seemed ever so slightly further off still, even if we knew it was already biting. We didn’t have the boost of the youth strikers. Plus, as it was the late noughties, people were still buoyed by the Obama campaign (one PR push was even called “Hopenhagen”). For some reason, lots of people painted themselves blue. But in many ways, it was achingly similar to the past year. And then it crashed and burned. Eight draft texts and days of talks between 115 world leaders ended with Barack Obama and the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, brokering a loose accord which recognised the scientific case for keeping temperature rises to no more than 2C – but, crucially, didn’t contain commitments to cutting the emissions needed to get there. The climate movement retreated to lick its wounds. Things weren’t helped by the economic crash, which temporarily sapped energy from the cause. Climate activism, like most ongoing protest movements, relies on a steady flow of new blood but much of this was absorbed fighting austerity. The UN managed to pull things back with the 2015 Paris talks, carefully rebuilding momentum in the preceding years with talk of the “unstoppable” rise of clean energy. These talks even got people talking about the possibility of keeping global heating to 1.5C – perhaps its most important legacy being the commissioning of the IPCC’s 1.5 degrees report. Climate activism had been on the ascendancy before this was published in October last year, but it offered a powerful catalyst, scaring many into taking notice. To look now to the ghost of climate politics future, next year’s Glasgow’s talks are scheduled to be a bumper event; as big as the Copenhagen, Paris or Kyoto talks. They will involve a global stocktake of countries’ emissions reductions targets, and discussions over what action will need to be taken to stay anywhere below 2C warming. Will the energy we’ve seen globally over the last year and a half maintain itself until then? Public concern over climate change seems to bubble up every five to 10 years or so, with increasing levels of intensity, and has done since the 1950s. It’s vital that we keep this bubble going not just all the way until the Glasgow talks, but afterwards too. Climate politics is characterised by short bursts of activism heading towards short-term and often slightly arbitrary deadlines. We’ve been told again and again that the time is now, or at least within a few years, or the planet gets it. It’s understandable in some ways. Global climate action has been dragging its heels for so many decades that climate activists are tired of waiting. And, frankly, we’re scared of the consequences of further inaction. Yet the nature of the climate fight is that it’s one that will be with us for the long term, and so our activism has to be too. This is partly because we’ve left it so long that we have to deal with the warming we’ve already cooked up for ourselves as well as radical action to avoid more, but it’s also partly the nature of the beast. As climate scientist Kate Marvel neatly puts it, climate change isn’t a cliff you fall off at some particular stop on a thermometer or date in the calendar, it’s more a slope you slide down. As yet another decade of inaction on the climate crisis comes to an end and we look fresh-faced and hopeful to the next, we need to be ready to look far ahead. The climate movement as a whole must build sustained, long-term relationships with the public rather than bubbles of activity, so that politicians can’t let it drop off their radar. We also need to build resilience, including care of one another, and have strategies for long-term sustained action. At the Paris talks, for example, some NGOs split teams between people who worked on the summit (who could then fall asleep in a heap at the close) and those ready to clean up after. This is the sort of approach that will keep us going. We don’t have time to wait for the phoenix of climate action to burn out and rise again – 2020 has to be the year we don’t just battle the climate crisis but ensure it’s a fight we stick with. • Alice Bell is co-director at climate change charity, Possible, and is writing a book on the history of the climate crisis."

          "bodyText": "That’s where we’ll leave the live blog for the day. Thanks for following along. It’s been another messy day. Many say the medevac repeal has made it one of parliament’s darkest. If it helps, I’ve been silently chanting ‘one more day, one more day, one more day’ for the past three hours. It’s no real comfort, to be honest. But it does busy the mind. Feel free to give it a go. Don’t blame me if you go insane. This is what we learned today: The government won Jacqui Lambie’s vote using unknown promises, thereby securing the passage of its medevac repeal bill. We suspect they promised to give new energy to their efforts to resettle the refugees on Nauru. But the repeal means the effective end of doctor-led decisions on healthcare transfers for asylum seekers and refugees. The decision has been condemned by GPs, refugee advocates, human rights groups, the opposition, the Greens and Centre Alliance. There is real anger that the vote took place without anyone truly knowing what the Lambie-Coalition deal actually entailed. On the Angus Taylor front, there was an unconfirmed report in the Australian naming one of Taylor’s staff, Josh Manuatu, as the person who obtained false travel figures about Clover Moore and sent them to the Daily Telegraph. The Guardian also reported that police have asked Clover Moore for a statement, and Taylor revealed in question time that he had set up a “point of contact” with New South Wales police. Also on Taylor, the US author Naomi Wolf has challenged Taylor to correct “disinformation” about her in his maiden speech to parliament. So that’s still bubbling along. Senator Cory Bernardi gave his valedictory speech, speaking of the difficulty of defecting from the Liberals. GDP figures were released late this morning, showing a 0.4% quarterly growth in the economy. It’s still well below the long-term growth average. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, said there were reasons to be positive. Others weren’t so rosy. Malarndirri McCarthy gave an emotional speech to the Senate about the vile death and rape threats she has endured in office. The threats were truly horrific and McCarthy’s speech gave a powerful insight of what it’s like for victims of such abuse. Early on in the day, Barnaby Joyce called for changes to allow more of the commonwealth’s environmental water holdings to meet critical human need. The Nationals have been placed in a tricky position by all of this. They are bearing the brunt of farmer anger over water arrangements, and risk losing their traditional constituents to minor parties or elsewhere. Another development on the Angus Taylor front. The City of Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, has been approached by police to provide a statement for their investigation into accusations Taylor relied on a falsified document to attack her travel-related emissions. The council said in a statement: “NSW police have asked the lord mayor for a statement. She will cooperate with the police request.” Naomi Wolf has called on Angus Taylor to correct the record after it emerged his first speech to parliament wrongly stated that she had attempted to have a Christmas tree removed from their student accommodation at Oxford University, which Taylor used as a gross example of “political correctness”. Bernardi becomes emotional when he talks about his family and wife, Sinéad. He concludes by saying he wanted to live life in politics “walking lightly through these corridors, wondering, ‘what if?’”. Looking back, I’d like to think I took Kipling’s words to heart in that here I met both triumph and disaster, and treated those two imposters just the same. That said it isn’t for me to pass judgment on my contribution over the years. However, I want to conclude on reflecting on the very nature of success. Each of us will have different measures of what it means to be a success. But when I think of the difficult life of modern politics, if you can get through it without harbouring malice or discontent you have achieved success. If you can end your time here with more firm friendships than when you began, that too is a good measure of success. If you can leave the Canberra bubble with your marriage stronger, a family you are truly proud of, and completely at peace with yourself, then that to me is the ultimate measure of success. Bernardi talks about the focus directed to him from the press. To the troops of the fourth estate – where do I start? I naively thought that knowing so many of you from my days as a publican might give me an easy ride. Fat lot of good that did me though. In fact, I think that you, knowing that I knew what you were really like, simply seemed to focus your aim at me. Conservative senator Cory Bernardi is giving his valedictory speech in the Senate. He praises the Liberal senators Nick Minchin and former Senate president Alan Ferguson for their guidance. He speaks of Jeannie Ferris, a senator who died of ovarian cancer in October 2005. Bernardi says a day after Ferris’s death, the Senate machinery kicked back into gear. That was my greatest and most important political lesson. That experience taught me that none of us here are indispensable. Bernardi speaks of defecting from the Liberal party. He says he lost many friends and colleagues. Suffice to say, I made choices that I thought were necessary and in the best interests of the country. Those choices were very difficult for me and my family. They were painful. He speaks of the “awesome foursome” who united in their opposition to the carbon pollution reduction scheme 10 years ago. That group included Mathias Cormann, Michaelia Cash, Bernardi and David Bushby. We had an enormous amount of fun and I think we really did change the course of political history. He jokes about his friendship with Labor senator Don Farrell, who lost his seat in 2013, but has since returned to parliament. He says he was the sole keeper of “the Farrell flame” in the Senate. As a cheer squad of one, I have to tell you even I was surprised when he got back. But it has been good to have you back Don, and I only wish some on your own side felt the same way I do. GPs have slammed the government’s repeal of medevac laws, saying it will increase the risk of further deaths and compromise patient care. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners refugee health network chair, Kate Walker, said the heads of 12 prominent medical colleges were united in their support for medevac for “good reason”. “Last week I expressed concern that the repeal of the legislation would compromise patient care and increase the risk of further deaths. I stand by that statement,” Walker said. She said 12 refugees and asylum seekers had died in offshore processing in the five years prior to medevac. None had died since. Without medevac, the government must take urgent action to ensure patient safety. They must be transparent in their processes and accept medical advice. Australia has a duty of care for those most vulnerable who remain offshore. Border protection is important but so is our duty of care to the health and safety of those in offshore detention. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, has welcomed news that Behrouz Boochani has applied for asylum in New Zealand. We’ve known for some time that this was likely. Di Natale tells the ABC: We wish him all the best, we hope that he’s able to put this trauma behind him. Most people don’t. On behalf of the many decent Australians, we are so sorry for what Behrouz has had to endure. Our political editor, Katharine Murphy, has written this report on the events of today. Murphy reports Jacqui Lambie wanted a re-energised pursuit of the New Zealand resettlement deal from the government in exchange for her support. She may have gotten a letter of assurance from the government to that end. The talk around parliament on Wednesday is Lambie emerged from the tortuous medevac tussle with a letter from Morrison indicating the government will pursue resettlement with New Zealand after the current deal with the United States is exhausted – but I haven’t seen the letter. I am entirely confident Lambie has been pursuing the New Zealand resettlement option in her protracted talks with the government about medevac repeal, but the rest is speculative, and the government claims no deals have been made. Still, there is an obvious way to square this “I’ve got a deal, sort of”/“no deal” circle. Despite appearing reluctant to pursue New Zealand’s kind offer to resettle the asylum seekers Australia sent to moulder in offshore detention, the home affairs minister hasn’t really ruled out doing that. The line has been that now is not the time. Assuming that New Zealand remains willing, perhaps a more convenient time to pursue resettlement will materialise soon. Perhaps the government signalled this to Lambie, or some other viable resettlement plan involving another country – a plan to slowly dismantle the life-force sapping apparatus of offshore detention. Not a deal so much, as a sharing of (as yet unannounced) government policy (if you will). The Australian has just named one of Angus Taylor’s staff, Josh Manuatu, as the person who obtained false travel figures about Clover Moore and sent them to the Daily Telegraph. I have no evidence that Manuatu was involved in this at all, but there has been talk around the government that he might have been the staffer who handled the material. But even if he did (and I said I don’t know if he did or not), the letter did go out under the signature of the minister. Old fashioned to reference the concept of ministerial responsibility I know. Taylor’s office has told my colleague Anne Davies when she made inquiries about this yesterday: “I reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the document in question.” The Labor MP Andrew Giles, like many of us, cannot understand how the deal between Jacqui Lambie and the Coalition came to be. On Sunday, Lambie said she had given the government a choice: I have given the government a choice, it can either pick A or B. Out of all due respect to the prime minister and Peter Dutton, and to make sure those talks continue over the week, I don’t want to be saying too much about this. Today it sounded simply like Lambie had accepted the government’s assurance that it would continue to implement its resettlement policies. Though that’s still not entirely clear. Giles: It doesn’t sound like any of the things Jacqui was talking about last week or even on Sunday. What an awful way to make law. What an awful way to make law. Where even cabinet ministers wander into the Senate without even knowing what they’re voting for. A new report shows inadequate Centrelink payments are driving people into poverty and heightening their risk of homelessness. The Homeward Bound report, authored by the lawyer Sophie Trevitt with the National Social Security Rights Network and Canberra Community Law, examined the experiences of 567 clients in Canberra. It found Centrelink recipients are struggling to meet their basic daily needs, including food and housing. It found women, single parents, Indigenous Australians and people with disabilities are suffering the most, and are most at risk of homelessness. The report called for an increase in Newstart, reforms to the social security system and additional social housing. “People on the Newstart allowance are struggling to live on less than $40 a day. They are entirely cut off from the private rental market; and with extremely long wait times for public housing, many were forced to sleep in their cars, in the living rooms of friends and families, in parks, caravans and refuges,” Trevitt said. Nick Martin, a GP and former senior medical officer on Nauru, has written on the repeal of the medevac laws for the Guardian. It’s pretty strong stuff. Today Australia became just a little crueller, just a little more sadistic. A bill that was working well was repealed because a self-professed Christian thought that his values aligned with denying care to the vulnerable. Absolutely nothing to do with border protection – boat turnbacks provide the assurance that boats will be stopped. I saw firsthand the damage to people kept in indefinite detention. It was why I spoke out in the first place. I am not a politician; I simply wanted correct and timely medical care to be given to those in need of it. To see the politicians engage in this carnival of cruelty, dressing up their arguments with consistently debunked statements on stopping drownings at sea has been demoralising. God only knows what the refugees stuck offshore must think. Australia has yet again signalled to the world that we are prepared to inflict suffering on those who flee terror and risk dangerous journeys to seek asylum. Question time, as seen through the eyes of Mike Bowers. Lovely shot from Mike Bowers of Timothy Weeks, a recently freed Taliban hostage, getting a standing ovation during question time this afternoon. Question time has ended with a sustained attack on Angus Taylor, yet again. This is what we learned: Angus Taylor has established a “point of contact” with NSW police over its investigation of his office’s reliance on a falsified document to attack Clover Moore. So we’re not yet at the stage of a police interview. But there is contact, of some description. Taylor continued to duck questions on why he hasn’t produced evidence to back up his claim that he downloaded the document with erroneous figures from the council’s own website. Mark Butler pointed out that the document had accurate figures at four points in March, April, June and October. That would make Taylor’s version unlikely, to say the least. The repeal of the medevac bill dominated many of the questions. Labor asked why the government was claiming it had not done a deal with Jacqui Lambie, when she intimated that they had. Scott Morrison said Lambie had simply supported government policy. He then attacked Labor for sending women and children to Manus Island, prompting an uproar in parliament. In the Senate, Richard Di Natale asked a more targeted question than Deal or No Deal – was there an exchange of letters with Jacqui Lambie? There was another angry exchange between Michael McCormack and Joel Fitzgibbon, who seem to be having quite a week. McCormack said Fitzgibbon was a disgrace and “wouldn’t know a farmer if he met one”. Take that. Timothy Weeks, a freed Taliban prisoner, was in the house and received a standing ovation from the chamber. Weeks had been a Taliban prisoner for three years since he was taken hostage in 2016. Labor led its attack on the poor school performance results released overnight, which show Australian school students are falling behind the rest of the world. Scott Morrison said “funding is at record levels”. Dan Tehan said funding wasn’t everything and Australia needed to find other ways to improve performance. Taylor again. Mark Butler points out that publicly available internet archives show the annual report on the council’s website contained accurate figures on four dates in March, April, June and October. How does that square with Taylor’s claim that his office downloaded a version of the report with inaccurate figures from the council’s website? Butler asks: Does the minister seriously expect Australians to believe the report with the correct figures was on the website on each of those dates, then inexplicably replaced with a report with incorrect figures, which only his office downloaded, then the report with the correct figures was put back up again, for only him to see? The question prompts some wry smiles from the Labor benches. It does all seem, er, rather improbable. There’s some scuttlebutt about whether the question would interfere with an active police investigation. Eventually, Taylor says: I made a statement on this which I have tabled in the house, while there are ongoing police inquiries as a result of those opposite, I have nothing more to add. Another question to Taylor. Mark Butler asks if he has provided metadata and download logs to police. Taylor reveals he has established a point of contact with NSW police. As I said, I will always cooperate with matters of this sort. My office has established an administrative point of contact with the NSW police, and I don’t propose to say anything more while police inquiries are continuing. Labor shifts to Angus Taylor. They ask why he hasn’t complied with a Senate order to produce evidence to back his claims that he downloaded a false document from the City of Sydney council’s website, which he then used to attack the lord mayor, Clover Moore. The Speaker, Tony Smith, makes his position on the matter fairly clear. Oy Senate, bugger off. I’m paraphrasing slightly, but you get the drift. Taylor gets up: I will always cooperate with matters of this sort. I tabled a statement in this House last week... as I have repeatedly told the House I reject absolutely the scurrilous accusations of those opposite. They are so transparent. They seek to distract from their own failings with smear. That’s fine and all, but he still hasn’t provided any evidence that he downloaded the dodgy document from the council’s website. Senator Cory Bernardi – who is due to give his valedictory speech this afternoon – got what is likely to be his final question in Senate question time. Bernardi asked the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, to explain the evils of socialism and why the government has not implemented such policies. It was all very Auspol101, and a bit of a nostalgia lap for the Australian Conservatives senator who started his career as a Liberal. Kim Carr interjected “they have” (implemented socialism) – asking “what’s the big stick all about”. Green Peter Whish-Wilson also got in on the action suggesting “the question should have been directed to Matt Canavan, the minister for nationalising coal-fired power stations”. Cormann then expounded on the different growth rates in East and West Germany – which Tim Ayres suggested hardly proved his point because West Germany was a social democracy. The first supplementary question was about Marxism, which Cormann described as “socialism on steroids”. In his final supplementary, Bernardi asked if Cormann was aware of a certain senator standing 6 foot 5 inches who had consistently railed against socialism (himself). Cormann responded: I once knew a guy who was in the Liberal party party room, sadly he left us. In more recent times I feel that senator has been coming back closer to the bosom of the Liberal party. Scott Morrison is asked how the government can claim it has done no deal with Jacqui Lambie, when she herself claimed such a deal was brokered. I’m not aware of what the member is referring to. I have before me Jacqui Lambie’s comments... and it makes no mention of it. Morrison says Lambie simply confirmed her support for government policies, including its policy on medevac. He then prompts an uproar when he accuses Labor of sending women and children to Manus, which he says was a new low. This mob on this side Mr Speaker, this Labor party were the party that sent children to Manus Island. So I will not take lectures from the Labor party that showed themselves to be the most outrageous treatment of women and children in sending them to Manus Island and then did nothing while we sought to stop the deaths at sea. On the topic of border protection, the Kaldor Centre for International Refugee Law at the University of New South Wales said the repeal of medevac and the Independent Health Advice Panel “in no way extinguishes Australia’s duty of care” to those held in offshore processing. It said medevac saved lives and de-politicised the health care of refugees and asylum seekers. Under both international and domestic law, Australia has a duty of care with respect to the health and well-being of people transferred offshore to Nauru and PNG. The medevac system assisted the Government meet this duty of care, by ensuring that there was a clear, transparent and effective process for people in need of transfer to be brought to the attention of the Minister, and for urgent medical decisions to be made by people with the requisite qualifications and expertise, within appropriate clinical timeframes. It minimised the risks of delay, uncertainty, and politicisation of medical decisions. It was a measure designed to save lives, and did so without compromising the ultimate power of the Minister to exclude any person who he or she deems to be a safety or security risk to the Australian public. The Kaldor Centre told a Senate inquiry in August that medevac was a “necessary, reasonable and appropriate” measure. Peter Dutton gets an energetic dixer from the backbencher Vince Connelly. Hands were flurrying. Dramatic pauses. Gesticulation, emphasis abound. The dixer is on border protection, which leads Dutton down a well-worn path. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, quotes Scott Morrison’s words back to him on the economy. At the end of the last quarter, Morrison said “you’d expect that things would improve in the next quarter”. Albanese says: Given economic growth has slowed in the September quarter ... how did the prime minister get it so wrong? Morrison responds: September quarter this year was higher than September quarter last year. Now I note that the leader of the opposition is not even economically literate, Mr Speaker ... Albanese protests on relevance. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, gets a dixer on the economy. He says despite the drought and other economic headwinds, the Australian economy has shown great “resilience” and continues to grow. In the first time in more than 40 years, we have seen a current account surplus... it’s a result in part of the free trade agreements that this side of the House have supported. In Senate question time, Richard Di Natale has asked a more targeted question than Deal or No Deal – was there an exchange of letters with Jacqui Lambie? The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, refused to rule it out: I won’t go into private conversations … What I can say is there has been no deal to change our stance on border protection or anything else. We provided briefings, we did not provide any undertakings to change policy ... We provided detailed information about what the policies of the government are. The supplementaries are all the same question – and now all the Greens are interjecting “any letters?” A nice moment in the House, for a change. Timothy Weeks, the Australian man who was held hostage by the Taliban for three years, is in the chamber. His presence is noted by the Speaker, Tony Smith, and the lower house rises united in standing applause. Weeks was freed after a prisoner swap deal earlier this year. Weeks was teaching English at a Kabul university when he and an American colleague were abducted at gunpoint in 2016. Fireworks again in the lower house between Michael McCormack and Joel Fitzgibbon. The pair have got some odd competition going on this week about who knows more about farmers. McCormack said: He wouldn’t know a farmer if he met one, quite frankly. Over in the Senate, it looks like Mathias Cormann is explaining his “no secret deal” comment by claiming nothing in government policy has changed as a result of its negotiations with Jacqui Lambie. Righto. We get a dixer to the PM on the economy. Then Labor asks the education minister, Dan Tehan, about the Pisa results. Tanya Plibersek asks when the government’s education reforms are going to start to work. Tehan says: We want to ensure that there are progressions in place so that we can map for every student across the nation the progressions they are making on literacy and numeracy. That is something that was never done on the other side. He then objects to criticism. You’re in the wrong business, mate. Rather than coming in here and lecturing us about this and that, why don’t you actually encourage the state and territory ministers to come to that meeting next week and be bold. Morrison continues: The outcomes of the Pisa 2018 results today are deeply concerning to the government, they are deeply concerning to the government. Labor kicks off question time with a question on the Pisa results, which show Australian school students are falling behind the rest of the world. Scott Morrison responds: Our education funding is at record levels, and the reason we can fund our schools at record levels, Mr Speaker, is because we know how to manage money. The shadow climate change minister, Mark Butler, has told Guardian Australia that the resources minister, Matt Canavan, “doesn’t even pretend to care about our international commitments” on climate change after the minister gave two interviews to the climate science denier Alan Jones on Monday. Jones asked the Queensland senator if he would be going to the UN climate talks that are under way in Madrid, but Canavan joked he had “got some better things to do” and that he had “not committed enough sins” to have been sent there. The Greens climate spokesman, Adam Bandt, accused Canavan of engaging in “smug mockery”. Canavan claimed terms like “climate emergency” were being forced upon members of the public, which he said was “Orwellian” and an attempt to shut down “alternative viewpoints”. When asked on radio by Jones why he was not in Spain, a laughing Canavan said: “I’m sure it’s lovely this time of year but I’ve got some better things to do. I haven’t committed enough sins in my life to be sent there yet, Alan.” Later on Sky, Jones again asked Canavan why he wasn’t in Madrid. “Ha!” said Canavan. “Well, Alan, it would not exactly be how I would like to spend my Christmas let’s just say that, but good luck to all those beautiful people who aggregate there. “Obviously we need to have international meetings to discuss these things, but then there are all these hangers on who seem to use this as a PR exercise to preen their moral vanity.” In each interview Jones, who has described human-caused climate change as a hoax, promoted a climate science denial group known as Clintel, before then introducing the minister. Clintel is promoting a declaration that “there is no climate emergency” and that “CO2 is plant food”. Canavan did not comment on the Clintel group, which has signed support from more than 100 Australians, including Hugh Morgan, a former president of the Business Council of Australia, and Ian Plimer, a director on Gina Rinehart’s Roy Hill Holdings iron ore project. The Queensland state MP Colin Boyce, of the LNP, is the only Australian elected official to have his name appear on the Clintel declaration. Later in the Sky interview, Canavan said: “What’s wrong with this agenda that’s being pushed by some people going to these conferences is that they want to regulate what we say and do.” He added there was an attempt to “shut down debate”. He said: “They are worried about alternative viewpoints. As you said in your intro we now have to call it a climate emergency. “It is not enough to call it climate change or global warming or greenhouse gases of the ozone layer – it’s now a climate emergency. This is true Orwellian stuff that we have to use these kinds of terms.” Canavan also used the interviews to heavily promote coal-fired power and coal generally, claiming coal generation was growing in other parts of Asia. “We are as a government backing coal-fired power,” he told Jones on 4BC, adding the government was “progressing an option” for a new coal-fired power station at Collinsville in north Queensland. Canavan said the renewable energy target had “destroyed our energy systems” and had been a “massive mistake”. Butler told Guardian Australia Canavan’s comments on the climate talks “tells us everything we need to know about the government’s attitude to action on climate change. “Matt Canavan doesn’t even pretend to care about our international commitments under the Paris agreement. The hard-right of the Coalition dictates Australia’s climate policy, as a result emissions are continuing to go up and our children will pay the price.” Bandt said anyone attending the Madrid talks should be applauded, adding: “This smug mockery from the minister for coal is part of a broader assault on climate action by a government in the pocket of the polluters.” The Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy has revealed she has suffered “threats of violence, graphic threats of being gang-raped and beaten, being killed for doing [her] job” which she described as “reprehensible”. These included “threats of executing me in the federal parliament” that were taken seriously by the Senate president, the speaker of the House, and the Australian federal police – which served a personal protection order against the person making the threats. She told the Senate: Today I share my experience of what threats of violence in the workplace can feel like and how it has been a long and often times paralysing shadow over all that I do … Next month it will be two years when the first abusive phone calls began … the tone of constituent calls took a turn for the worse, call after call, message after message on my answering machine both my Canberra and Darwin office became an obsessive focus for the caller so fixated on wanting to inflict pain until finally I said enough. In my nearly 15 years since becoming Labor member in NT and now federal parliament I have never had to be concerned daily for my personal safety until now. McCarthy said she suffered anxiety about safety when she attended public events and even attending rallies now requires AFP protection. She said the threats are “designed to maximise fear, render them incapable of doing their job” and to put the target in “a prison of impending danger”. McCarthy also revealed that Pat Dodson was “also now a focus for similar threats” and thanked police in the NT and the AFP for taking the threats seriously. Scott Morrison says he has “fulfilled a promise” to the Australian people by repealing medevac laws. We’ve always understood that that type of loophole doesn’t strengthen our borders, it only weakens them. A year ago, we were defeated in the parliaments but we stood firm. And we stood firm and went to an election and said, support the Coalition and we will repeal those laws and so today, we fulfilled that promise to the Australian people. Peter Dutton says the law was always about getting people here through a “back door”. He pays tribute to the “independent senators” – read Jacqui Lambie – and says medevac was “bad policy”. Morrison will not be drawn on what deal the Coalition struck with Lambie. He says the only condition he gave was to implement the government’s policies. One of those policies, he says, is to resettle those on Nauru. Asked whether that would include accepting the New Zealand deal, he responded: The government is always looking at ways to resettle those who are on Nauru. Morrison is choosing his words very carefully here. He is not saying anything about accepting the New Zealand refugee resettlement deal. We’ve just published this story on a whistleblower complaint concerning Peter Dutton and statements he made about the case of a convicted drug trafficker who was spared deportation. Andrew Wilkie says parliament has “sunk to a new low” with the repeal of medevac laws. He has just issued this statement: The people marooned on Manus Island and Nauru are Australia’s responsibility and it is a basic human right that every person has access to appropriate medical care. What have we come to as a nation when we are prepared to treat human beings so cruelly? Clearly medevac has not started the boats again and has not created a national security problem. The government is hiding behind the term “national security” because they know there is no legitimate reason to have repealed the legislation. They are simply intent on punishing innocent people in the name of ideology. Medevac has reduced the preventable suffering of ill asylum seekers and refugees and is supported by medical experts. There are many politicians who should be ashamed of their willingness to throw innocent people to the wolves. Labor is continuing its pursuit of Angus Taylor through all of this. Penny Wong spoke in the Senate a little earlier. Labor had ordered Taylor’s representatives to table documents explaining how he came to rely on a falsified document to attack Sydney lord mayor, Clover Moore. Wong says Labor was giving Taylor a chance to provide evidence to support his position that the falsified document came from the City of Sydney website. He failed. This motion was a test for the government and it has failed that test. It was a motion that required the government to table any evidence that it had to support Mr Taylor’s repeated claims he didn’t doctor a document to attack his political opponent. Because this is a scandal ... which started with a dodgy trick by a mediocre minister and it’s ended with the integrity of the entire government in tatters. Mr Taylor has labelled this fiasco a “grubby smear”. Well, if that were true he’d be able to prove it but he refuses to put forward any evidence to clear his name. And the only reason you would choose not to clear your name is because you can’t. GetUp and the Human Rights Law Centre are holding a press conference right now. GetUp’s human rights director Shen Narayanasamy said what is needed, more than anything, is a solution for the refugees still on Nauru and Manus. There is a reason that they are getting sick, and it is because we are holding them there, in conditions that we know are inhumane, that will cause them to be sick. She said she can only hope that the deal struck by Lambie does something for their lives. We saw today incredible scenes in our senate as senator Lambie got to her feet with tears in her eyes to say that she had done some sort of deal with the government. We can only hope what that may be. The prime minister Scott Morrison has called a press conference for 1pm. We’ll bring that to you as it happens. One question he may well be asked is: was there a secret deal with Jacqui Lambie? She seemed to think there was. It seemed pretty obvious to everyone watching that there was. Yet Mathias Cormann said categorically that there was not. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is speaking on the GDP figures out today. He’s got slides. The figures were softer than expected at 0.4% quarterly growth for the September quarter, which remains below the long-term average. “Australia is back in black and back on track,” Frydenberg says to kick things off. Frydenberg says the labour market remains strong, with annual jobs growth at 2%, more than double the OECD average. He said the overall growth was broad-based, contributed to by household consumption, net exports and public final demand. Household consumption has only increased by 0.1%, just so you know. He says household disposable income grew by 2.5%, the fastest quarterly rise in a decade, leading to an increase in household savings . But Frydenberg said the drought was having a significant impact on the Australian economy. Farm GDP are at record lows and rural exports are down. Mining investment is down 7.8% in the quarter. Total new business investment fell by 2%. In conclusion, Australia is not alone in facing significant domestic and global economic headwinds, but there are reasons to be positive about our economic future. Médecins Sans Frontières says the medevac repeal will endanger patients and is “unethical and harmful to vulnerable people and the entire medical profession”. “Asylum seekers and refugees who remain indefinitely contained on Nauru and PNG have been blocked again from accessing treatment for critical health conditions where adequate care is not available locally,” said Paul McPhun, executive director of Médecins Sans Frontières Australia. MSF noted there was still no access to proper psychiatric care on Nauru, a problem that has existed for almost a year. “During our time working with patients on Nauru, MSF psychiatrists and psychologists determined that the majority had their lives impaired by mental illness,” McPhun said. “To now deny medical professionals from taking decisions in patients’ best interests – and to effectively hand that power back to unqualified officials – entrenches dangerous precedents set in the last years and puts those most sick and vulnerable at risk. “Preventing access to medical care as a policy tool is unethical and harmful to vulnerable people and the entire medical profession.” We’ve got some vision now of Jacqui Lambie’s speech to the Senate. The Human Rights Law Centre has issued a statement on the repeal of medevac. It says the government stripped away “a humane, transparent and doctor-led process for the refugees in its care”. David Burke, the centre’s legal director, said it was a “shameful day” for the government and the senators who voted with them. “Fear and lies have dominated at the expense of men and women who need medical care,” Burke said. “Peter Dutton and the Morrison government have today played cruel, bloody-minded politics with peoples’ lives. The Morrison government has stripped away the basic shred of humanity that meant that when someone was sick they could get the care they needed.” The centre said since the laws came into effect in March 2019, about 200 people have been evacuated to get medical care. More than 500 people remained in PNG and Nauru, Burke said. “Now that the government has robbed these people of the medevac laws, it is more urgent than ever that they ensure every single person is resettled to safety. We will continue to challenge these cruel policies.” The near-universal reaction to those GDP figures? They’re softer than expected and of concern. Mike Bowers was in the chamber for that vote to repeal medevac, where Lambie used her critical vote to side with the government. Refugee advocates, Labor, the Greens, and human rights groups say it is a “dark day” for Australia. Here’s how it unfolded in the chamber: The Australian Bureau of Statistics have updated GDP figures for the September quarter. The Australian economy grew 0.4% in seasonally adjusted chain volume terms in the September quarter 2019 and 1.7% through the year. Growth of 0.4% this quarter is down from 0.6% in the June quarter. ABS chief economist, Bruce Hockman, said: The economy has continued to grow, however the rate of growth remains well below the long run average. The government had held out hope that the September quarter would produce a bounce on the back of tax cuts for middle income earners of up to $1,080. Household gross disposable income increased by 2.5% due to the tax cuts and lower mortgage repayments after three interest rate cuts this year. But the results show household expenditure increased by just 0.1%, with weakness in spending on discretionary goods and services. The household saving ratio rose to 4.8. Hockman said: The reduction to tax payable did not translate to a rise in discretionary spending, which led to a visible impact to household saving. While mining investment declined 7.8% this quarter and 11.2% through the year, the public sector was again the saviour: Government final consumption expenditure rose 0.9% in the quarter and remains strong through the year at 6.0%. The New Zealand government has refused to confirm whether they have recently been approached by the Australian government on the Manus deal, only reiterating that the offer remained live. “The offer to take 150 refugees is still on the table,” immigration minister Iain Lees-Galloway said in a statement to the Guardian. In November last year, the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, reiterated her government’s offer to take up to 150 refugees after a weeks-long standoff at Manus Island detention facility led to a desperate humanitarian situation for the remaining detainees. New Zealand has made the same offer to the Australian government since 2013, but it has been strongly and repeatedly refused. The Australian home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, described it as a “bad option” and suggested it may encourage people-smuggling boats to intensify their efforts to reach Australia. There is a precedent for New Zealand accepting refugees that Australia does not want. In 2001 Helen Clark’s Labour government offered asylum to 130 refugees who were rescued from the Tampa after it sunk off the Australian coast. Twenty of the 130 asylum seekers were young boys and adolescents, and became known as the “Tampa boys”. Abbas Nazari, 23, a Tampa refugee who resettled in New Zealand, recently won a Fullbright scholarship to study in the US. He says the country welcomed him with open arms. “I can’t recall any instances of racism and that’s the same experience for the vast majority of my family and community,” says Nazari. “We wove naturally into the fabric of New Zealand society. So when I hear stories of prejudice and racism, I know for sure that it exists but my experience in New Zealand has been amazingly warm and welcoming.” Reactions are flowing thick and fast after that vote. Shamindan, a refugee still in Papua New Guinea, said it was a “very dark day” that would allow politicians to deliberately deny medical care to those who need it. Anthony Albanese said “you can be strong on borders without being weak on humanity”. Richard Di Natale said it was clear someone had lied about the deal struck between Lambie and the Coalition. He just held a press conference: Someone’s lying here. Either senator Lambie is lying, or the government is lying. It’s very clear. According to senator Lambie there was a proposal put to the government that was negotiated in secret, yet the government denies it. It is cruel, it is heartless, it is absolutely an assault on the parliament. Amnesty International Australia has described it as a “shameful day” for Australia. Advisor Graham Thom said: It’s a shameful day when the Australian parliament turns its back on sick people in desperate need of medical attention. Let’s not forget that this offshore detention system is the one under which 12 innocent people have died. Although one Labor amendment was voted on (to continue the medevac process for those with existing applications), I’m advised the rest weren’t circulated in time so the gag motion effectively prevented them being voted on. Jacqui Lambie leaves the chamber alone. She walked past Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick, without making eye contact. The medevac repeal bill is passed 37 votes to 35. This is effectively the end of the medevac laws. As they vote, Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff has sent us this statement: A government that has no empathy for people in need of critical medical care is a government that doesn’t deserve to govern. This repeal is all about a government desperate for a win – any win – ahead of the summer break. Prior to medevac there were many deaths in detention. There have been none since medevac came into force. This repeal will damage lives. It is a heartless action that shows complete disdain for humanity. We’re now up to the final vote on this bill. This is it. We’re expecting the repeal bill to be passed. Division in progress. Lambie is voting against this amendment and it is defeated by one vote. That’s a pretty grim forecast for the rest of Labor’s proposed amendments. We’re currently voting on an amendment to allow people already in the medevac process to remain in the medevac process. Seems sane. Let’s see what our Senate thinks. Pauline Hanson is shepherding Jacqui Lambie through these divisions. At the moment, Lambie is penned between Hanson and the Liberal frontbencher Anne Ruston. It must be pretty intense, sitting between Hanson and Ruston right now. We’re now into a series of votes on the second reading of the medevac repeal bill. Labor is attempting now to move its amendments. The amendments are unlikely to be passed, but if they are, the bill will need to return to the lower house. Kristina Keneally is using the amendments to call for government backbenchers “with some semblance of a beating heart” for support. Labor has put in a whole bunch of amendments to the medevac bill. If Jacqui Lambie continues voting with the government they may not be successful, but they will trigger a series of votes after 11am that will delay its final passage. These amendments would: Require home affairs minister Peter Dutton to make a detailed report every time a refugee or asylum seeker is settled in a third country. Allow minors to continue to come to Australia for psychiatric and medical assessments. Continue the work of the Independent Health Advice Panel in making independent health assessments which then must be tabled in parliament Stipulate that where the minister fails to make a decision about a proposed transfer, the more generous medevac provisions will continue to apply. These would, in effect, soften the blow of repeal and try to set new rules to prevent the government refusing to deal with proposed medical transfers, as occurred before the medevac provisions were introduced. Lambie was obviously emotional during that speech. There is fury in the chamber. The Greens who sit close to Lambie, heckled her throughout. A Labor senator shouted “this is undemocratic” as Lambie apologised for not revealing the detail of her conversation with the government. As Lambie spoke, Penny Wong, Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher stood at the front of the chamber, in conclave, arms folded. Richard Di Natale is furious. Mathias Cormann has just insisted there was no “secret deal”. But Lambie has just confirmed, clearly, that there is a secret deal. Di Natale: Who on earth is misleading this parliament? Someone is misleading the Senate about one of the most important pieces of legislation that has been before this parliament. Lambie: I get that this vote will disappoint many, and I apologise for that. This is a matter of conscience. She says she cannot allow the border protection system to unravel again and have people drown. Lambie is breaking down in tears as she says she still cannot explain why she has given her vote to the government. She again cites national security for her lack of reasoning. I’m not being coy or silly when I say I genuinely can’t say what I proposed. I know that’s frustrating to people and I accept that. When I say I can’t discuss it for national security concerns, I am being 100% honest with you. Jacqui Lambie finally gets up to speak. She says the decision was not easy and apologises for taking so long. Medevac isn’t a national security threat, but there are real problems with the way it is operating. They cannot be amended away. The Labor party and the Greens might think it’s a-OK, but I’m not comfortable with it. She says the system is not as perfect as the activists would have you believe but not as bad as the “media loudmouths” would have you believe either. Kristina Keneally points out 62% of Australians support medevac. She’s referring to this Guardian Essential Poll. “Boy they don’t like hearing that, do they?” she says. Keneally continues: “What you’re voting on today will deny sick people treatment,” she says. “It will deny sick people the opportunity to see a doctor and get treatment.” A bit more activity at the back of the chamber. Penny Wong has just paid a visit to the Greens advisers. Pauline Hanson is also heckling Nick McKim. Jacqui Lambie is looking straight ahead. Nick McKim says it is a “dark day for the Senate”. But it’s darker still for those still on Manus and Nauru. It’s the darkest day for those people who remain on Manus and Nauru. That’s who this is the darkest day for. Pauline Hanson is repeating the fact (which we’re also seeing in a lot of newspapers) that people brought here under medevac aren’t in hospital. It’s worth noting (again) that the purpose of medevac is to bring people to Australia for medical care or assessment which is unavailable in PNG and Nauru. That does not necessarily equal hospitalisation. And a lack of hospitalisation does not equal a scammed medevac. Hanson then says a bunch of stuff that are not facts. Pauline Hanson is on her feet. She doesn’t seem perturbed about not knowing the nature of the deal between Lambie and the Coalition. Instead, she’s attacking Labor and claiming medevac repeal is wanted by most Australians. Katharine Murphy, who’s in the chamber, reports that a Labor interjector has given her a handy fact. “The majority of Australian support medevac, you silly woman.” The current debate is on Labor’s attempt to force the government to table all documents about its deal with Jacqui Lambie before the repeal bill is voted on. It’s expected to go for about half an hour. Labor will need an absolute majority, but if it wins, it would effectively mean the bill cannot pass until those documents are provided to the Senate. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is up on his feet. There is no secret deal. There is no secret deal. There is no secret. the Australian people know extremely well the work that we have done to strengthen our border protection arrangements. He continues: Obviously the Labor party doesn’t believe anybody can ever be persuaded by argument. While Penny Wong is in full flight, Mathias Cormann makes a brief check on Lambie, who has resumed her seat. Jacqui Lambie is now wandering, at large, at the back of the chamber. The government wins the vote and we’re now debating the bill. Labor is attempting to move amendments to force the government to disclose its deal with Jacqui Lambie. Penny Wong is attempting to suspend standing orders. She wants debate delayed until “all documents relating to negotiations between the government and Jacqui Lambie” are laid on the table. At the moment we have cabinet ministers coming in here like lemming, voting on a legislation based on a deal you haven’t seen. What sort of cabinet government is that? What sort of process of democracy is that? She continues: You should require of this government some disclosure. You should require of this government some disclosure. You should require something more than secret deals done in the shadows. We’re now voting to bring on consideration of the bill immediately. The government wins the vote to limit debate 38-36. Mike Bowers is in the chamber. The government wins the vote to suspend standing orders 38-37, with Lambie’s vote critical. It is now bringing on a vote to limit the debate. Lambie is voting with the government in this division. There is much bonohomie on that side of the chamber. Over the other side, the two Centre Alliance senators Stirling Griff and Rex Patrick are boxed in by Kristina Keneally and Katy Gallagher. Jacqui Lambie has just entered the chamber. She looks cheerful. Malcolm Roberts from One Nation meanwhile is engaged in conversation with the Greens senator Janet Rice. There is some speculation from senators that Scott Morrison has agreed with Lambie to pursue the New Zealand deal but only after the US deal has been fully executed. That’s what people think. The government’s deputy Senate leader Simon Birmingham has dismissed Labor’s position that medevac is needed to ensure sick people are brought to Australia, saying the government has had its own system where people are assessed and brought here if needed. Which is true – they do have such a policy. But it was been widely criticised as inadequate. Data reported earlier this year showed that some people on Manus Island had waited as long as five years for treatment to start after the government’s contracted doctors recommended it. We’re now voting on the suspension of standing orders. A division is required and the bells are ringing. If this passes, the government will be able to effectively guillotine debate and force a vote on the medevac repeal bill. Penny Wong is on her feet. It appears there’s been a deal done to repeal medevac. Well the Australian people wants to see the deal, this Senate wants to see the deal. Wong says it’s consistent with the government’s attitude to scrutiny and transparency. It’s not a government that likes scrutiny. It’s not a government that likes transparency. Jacqui Lambie is now in the chamber. Wong says to Lambie: Do not make them to require you to vote for legislation with the requirement of secrecy around it. It is not a reasonable proposition. Di Natale continues: If this government had a shred of integrity, it would allow this parliament to scrutinise the basis for the repeal of a law that protects what is a fundamental human right. In the chamber, while Richard Di Natale is speaking, Penny Wong is engaged in a conversation with Mathias Cormann across the table. Kristina Keneally is camped beside the advisers box. Jacqui Lambie is not in the chamber. Greens leader Richard Di Natale says the Senate is being asked to repeal laws that enshrine a “fundamental human right” on the basis of a secret deal. So what we’ve got is we’ve got a government working with senator Lambie to repeal laws that provide people access to healthcare, that’s all this does. Medevac says if you are sick, you have a right to see a doctor, and it is a doctor who has the right to decide what kind of healthcare you receive. That is a fundamental human right. That’s all the medevac laws do. Now we know that those laws that enshrine what we all understand to be a basic right afforded to every citizen, are going to be repealed but repealed on the basis of a secret deal. Labor senator Katy Gallagher is slamming the Lambie-Coalition deal, saying they were “obsessed with getting a win after a shocking week”. “Trying to get a win off the back of more than 500 people,” she said. Gallagher said Labor is hearing “on the grape vine” that the Senate will have no opportunity to see the deal before the vote. This chamber has every right to stand up and demand that any detail of the deal that’s been done should be provided to this chamber. We should be allowed to debate it, we should be allowed to disagree with it. Greens senator Nick McKim says there are lives at real risk. He says doing secret deals on such a critical piece of legislation is one of “the most reprehensible things you could do as a member of parliament”. The debate we are currently having is literally a life-or-death debate. It is literally a debate that will make such a difference, will have such an impact on so many people. He says such a critical debate cannot be allowed without senators knowing what deal Lambie and the government have done. I can only urge both parties of that deal to come clean on what they have agreed on. How can we have this debate when the majority of the Senate is in the dark about what that agreement is? How can we actually have a debate that is going to determine whether some people die or some people live without the full facts at our disposal? He continues: Don’t do a secret deal when people’s lives are in the balance. Because that’s what I fear has occurred ... playing through people’s lives through some secret arrangement is one of the most reprehensible things you could do as a member of parliament. Things are moving rather quickly now. The government is moving a motion to effectively push through the medevac repeal bill as soon as possible this morning. This would suggest it has done a deal with Lambie. The process from here is as follows: There will be a debate on the government’s motion to suspend standing orders. That will last 30 minutes. If they’re successful, debate on medevac will continue until about 11am. If not all speakers are finished by that time, debate will be gagged and the vote will come on. Keneally turns to One Nation, who have already given their support to medevac. She asks: Does senator Hanson know what is in this secret deal? Does senator Roberts know what is in this secret deal? She says Lambie cannot trust whatever promise the government has made to her. Do you trust this prime minister? I say to senator Lambie, think about this prime minister he will say anything to get himself out of a bind. Cormann says it is in the “national interest” to bring on a vote. That is why I am moving this suspension and of course intend to move the motion circulated in the chamber. Labor’s Kristina Keneally says it is clear there is a “secret deal” between Lambie and the Coalition. Is this what this government has come to? Secret deals done behind closed doors, and now dragging it in here, guillotining debate. The Senate is sitting and we’re expecting debate on medevac to kick off fairly early. It’s the first item on the government’s business orders of the day. Finance minister Mathias Cormann is suspending standing orders and is up speaking. This suggests they may have come to some arrangement with Jacqui Lambie. Nothing is certain yet. Stay tuned. Jacqui Lambie delivered a fairly damning speech on foreign influence in the Senate last night. She lambasted both parties for not doing enough to combat Chinese government foreign influence. It’s about time the people in this place woke up to China’s attempts to infiltrate our economy and our democracy. I can tell you that the other 25 million Australians out there have. Both sides of politics need to take a good, hard look at themselves and make sure they’re acting in our national interest. Quite obviously, over China, they are not. To be really clear to the Australian-Chinese community: I’m not talking about you. I’ve made that very clear in the past. Chinese-Australians have been here since the gold rushes, and their place in and contribution to Australian life is profound. I’m sure they join all Australians who are watching on in horror at the stories that have come out recently. It’s unbelievable what is being tolerated from inside this chamber. Lambie referred to the NSW Icac’s inquiry into the $100,000 cash allegedly delivered in an Aldi bag to Labor HQ by Huang Xiangmo, a Chinese billionaire. She said at least NSW had an integrity commission to investigate and detect that kind of activity. The fact is that there are basically no protections from stopping this happening at a federal level – not because there can’t be but because there’s no courage to make it happen. There’s no enforcement of the rules and there’s no follow-up if things look off. The scale of the problem is huge, and we’ve just been tinkering around the edges. The fact is that we’d never pick that sort of thing up if it happened at a national branch. Lambie said Australia needed to develop a national strategy to handle the relationship. The crossbench senator is wielding a fair bit of power at the moment, given the government’s desperation to repeal medevac. There’s a few other tidbits around this morning. Channel Nine newspapers have reported that Gladys Liu, the Liberal MP, lobbied on behalf of a Chinese Communist party-endorsed company that was a large Liberal donor and was involved in some fairly shady dealings. The papers have also reported that Kristina Keneally was set to become Australia’s ambassador to the US if Labor won office. Mike Bowers caught Anthony Albanese talking to the media a little earlier. We learned this morning that the government plans to bring back its union-busting bill in the lower house today. That, of course, is the bill that was defeated by One Nation on Friday, despite the government making changes to assuage their concerns. We’re not expecting a vote on the legislation until the new year. Albanese said: This is a government that needs an agenda for the 2020s. We’ve now just got a few weeks of this decade left. Their agenda for next year is that it’s the same as last year ... they’ve just got old stuff, that’s all they’ve got. A coalition of legal groups, including the Law Council of Australia, have issued a statement calling on the government to scrap plans to merge the various family courts into a single specialist court. This week, the government reintroduced legislation that would merge the family and federal circuit courts. But the coalition said the legislation was flawed and would do little to “alleviate the fundamental problems plaguing the family law system, including the risk of victims of family violence falling through the cracks”. It instead wants the government to act on recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission and retain and enhance specialists courts and consider a “a specialised, standalone family law court system”. To allow this to occur the joint select committee on Australia’s family law system should consider the bill. Its terms of reference are clearly inclusive of this as they require consideration of reform that may be needed to the family law and the current structure of the family court and the federal circuit court. The Nationals remain under considerable pressure from the Murray Darling Basin plan protests in Canberra. Farmers yesterday labelled Nationals leader Michael McCormack spineless and lacking passion, and warned him his party faced looming electoral destruction unless they stood up to the Liberals. NSW threatened to pull out of the basin plan yesterday, and the Coalition announced yesterday it would review water allocation arrangements between states. Barnaby Joyce has been out and about this morning, calling for amendments to free up more of the commonwealth’s environmental water holdings for farmers. He told the ABC: It’s got to deal in a more precise way with critical human and critical economic needs. Just so your listeners understand the biggest irrigator in Australia is you. You hold about 2.848m litres of water ... so you the taxpayer, the Australian government, holds the water that can alleviate some of these problems. There’s got to be a capacity to say well we’re going to use more of that water for the critical needs of the irrigation towns, and deal in some way with the concerns these people raise. Joyce said he was thankful for the protests because they had focused the mind of politicians. He said he understood farmers’ venting. I went down the day before and got a dose of it myself, you know you just accept it. You’ve got to face up to your constituents. You’ve got to make sure you hear their message, that’s what’s a democracy is about. One Nation and Bob Katter have been attempting to win over some of the Nationals’ traditional constituents on the issue. Malcolm Roberts was out the front of parliament yesterday trying to fan the flames of protesters and direct their anger towards the government. Matt Canavan this morning criticised the approach of those with “big hats and dyed hair” who “like to jump up and down” for their “15 minutes of fame”. “That’s not the approach that works, that approach does not work,” he told Sky News. We’ve had a few voices out already today speaking about Australia’s poor school results in the Program for International Student Assessment. Australia recorded the sharpest fall of any nation in the Pisa, which has caused considerable alarm. Labor leader Anthony Albanese has said the results were a “shocker”. “This is an f for fail in Australia for education,” he said this morning. “We’re falling so far behind our competitors. We live in a globalised world, we can’t afford to be going backwards.” Education minister Dan Tehan said simply injecting more money into the system was not the answer. “I think we all now realise that equally important is school results and outcomes, that now needs to be the focus,” Tehan said. “We’ve got to put aside this obsession that some have of money, money, money.” Here’s what we’re expecting from today. The GDP figures are out this morning, about 11.30am. The numbers are expected to be less than rosy for the government, given the last figures put Australia’s growth at the lowest level since 2009. Labor has been leading its attack on the government this week with criticism of its economic mismanagement. Protests over the Murray Darling Basin plan are continuing to spur debate in parliament. The protesters are angry over their lack of access to water under the plan and want it scrapped. There was a little bit of movement yesterday when drought minister David Littleproud announced a review. The Nationals have been having a torrid time with it. Pictures of Michael McCormack being given a healthy serve outside parliament have been played ad nauseam on TV and radio. Not a great look. Debate will continue on the medevac repeal bill. We’re still none the wiser on Jacqui Lambie’s position, which will be critical in deciding the fate of medevac. Lambie’s demands are still unclear, though she did last night make a fiery speech in the Senate about inaction on Chinese government interference. Angus Taylor will be back in some form, I can assure you of that. Whether it’s the grasslands controversy, the forged documents controversy, the Naomi Wolf controversy, the phone call controversy, the pecuniary interests controversy, or some other unknown controversy yet to emerge. I’ve never said controversy so many times in a single sentence and doubt I ever will again. We’re also likely to hear some debate over the terrible school results out today. Australia recorded the sharpest falls in performance of any country in the Program for International Student Assessment. Hello friends and welcome to the last sitting Wednesday of the year. We’re expecting another busy one, likely dominated by economics (GDP figures are out), further debate on the medevac bill, the Murray Darling Basin, Chinese influence and, of course, your man Angus Taylor, who is hard pressed to find a way out of the news at the moment. Grab a cuppa and settle in."

          "bodyText": "That’s where we’ll leave the day for now. Thanks again for following along with the day’s events. It’s been another frantic day, so let’s recap: The government has met with former fire chiefs, including Greg Mullins, about the climate and bushfires. Mullins says he hopes the Coalition can look past politics and act seriously on climate change. The prime minister was not in the meeting, leaving it up to Angus Taylor and David Littleproud. Labor called for a royal commission into veterans’ suicides. The government said it was open to the idea, but would need more time to consider it. The RSL national president, Greg Melick, said there had been enough inquiries, and that the problems and solutions were known and needed to be acted upon. The day began with reports that Ken Wyatt, the minister for Indigenous Australians, had handed a contract to a company linked to a Liberal donor and former candidate without an open tender. Labor used question time to attack Angus Taylor again on multiple fronts, accusing him of misleading parliament in his first ever speech, and attempting to draw Scott Morrison and Christian Porter further into the City of Sydney forged documents scandal. Taylor revealed he had not yet been interviewed by police. The government failed to produce a transcript of the phone call between Mick Fuller and Scott Morrison about the police investigation into Taylor, despite a Senate order, which prompted criticism from Labor and the Greens. Question time got fiery when Michael McCormack and Joel Fitzgibbon clashed. Fitzgibbon was ejected. McCormack became animated about his interactions with farmer protesters out the front of parliament. Those protesters had told McCormack he lacked passion and that the Nationals would not exist unless it took a bolder stand on water and the Murray-Darling Basin plan. Speaking of the Murray-Darling Basin plan, the government announced a review of its water management policies to ensure they are not inhibiting access. Anthony Albanese addressed the Labor caucus, rallying the troops and promising more pressure on what he called Scott Morrison’s “Angus Horribilis”. See you tomorrow for another round. The emergency services minister, David Littleproud, addressed his meeting with the former chief of NSW Fire and Rescue Greg Mullins a little earlier at a press conference: What I said to Mr Mullins and the other former fire chiefs ... [was] that they can take great comfort and great pride in the new breed of fire commissioners. They have planned meticulously for this fire season. I’ve only been emergency services minister since June and the first advice I got is we would expect to see the fire season start in August and be severe. Littleproud said the peak council of fire commissioners had advised that Australia has “sufficient assets” in the form of 100 firefighting aircraft. If the season is extended and is more severe the federal government will “continue to be agile with the states” which have primary funding responsibility to provide firefighting services. It has always been the responsibility of states to look after emergency management but we support them and the federal government has proven that – we topped up last year’s [funding]. Zali Steggall, the independent MP, has been on the ABC talking about the federal government’s proposal for its commonwealth integrity commission. She’s had a briefing from the attorney general, Christian Porter, on the design. We’re still waiting to see draft legislation. It was promised by the end of the year, initially, but is now not likely until next year. Steggall still has some concerns about the proposal. From my point of view, what is still extremely important from me but also for other members of the crossbench is the issues around the referral pathway, and the ability to have open hearings. The national integrity commission needs to be seen to be holding MPs and their staff to account. There needs to be that integrity process, but also the public needs to have confidence that it is being seen to happen as well. Still on bushfires, the crossbench MP Andrew Wilkie has reiterated his calls for the defence force to develop a firefighting capability. Wilkie asked a question on the issue during question time, warning the deteriorating climate and prolonged fire seasons were making it difficult to access foreign firefighting resources. David Littleproud said he was advised there was no issue with access to resources. Wilkie has issued a statement saying he met with representatives of emergency leaders for climate action after question time. They advised him much greater investment in aerial firefighting was needed. The fact is that the national fire threat will continue to trend badly and any sensible government would see the importance of thinking strategically and planning for the future. Regardless of whether or not there are adequate firefighting resources currently, and that is arguable, there is no doubt that in years to come the country will need much greater capability and that must include a much enhanced heavy aerial firefighting capability. There is a strong argument that this will require an expanded role for the RAAF, a capability which could take years to work up, which means capability decisions need to be made by the government now. Former fire chiefs, including Greg Mullins, have met with the energy minister, Angus Taylor, and the drought minister, David Littleproud – but not Scott Morrison – to discuss their concerns about climate change. Mullins says he is hopeful the government can “reach out across the boundaries of politics and do more”. He says the extremes being seen due to climate change are not mere “business as usual”. This is different. The science is very clear. This is driven by the burning of coal, ore and gas. I hope that the government can reach out across the boundaries of politics and say we need to do more, we need to do our bit internationally. Asked whether the government can do more than its current commitments to the Paris agreement, Mullins says: I hope so because it’s simply not enough. Mullins also asked for national investment in heavy firefighting aircraft. He said they are used across states and territories and are truly a “national resource”. When we’ve only got seven of those nationally. When we have every state and territory burning at the same time, there’s going to be a big call on their use. Labor has seized on comments from the RBA governor on subdued wage growth, made during the central bank’s decision to leave rates on hold. Down in the Senate, a motion has been passed that calls on the government to include changes in the robodebt processes in the government’s midyear economic update. You’ll remember the government recently announced changes that would stop over-reliance on income averaging, a fundamentally flawed and frequently erroneous way of calculating welfare debts. The Greens senator Rachel Siewert said including the changes in Myefo would help Australians understand what was truly changing with the robodebt system. “There are so many unanswered questions and it’s absolutely outrageous that the government is once again leaving people worried and in the dark about what is happening,” Siewert said. “After all that people have been through the government owes them an explanation at the very least.” Melick says there is no evidence that a royal commission would find anything different from inquiries by the productivity commission, joint standing committees or the national mental health commission. All have considered the problems with veterans’ support services. “It’s an enormous distraction. If there’d been no inquiry and we didn’t know what the problem was, that’d be different,” he tells Sky News. The head of the Returned and Services League, Greg Melick, said he has reservations about calls for a royal commission into veterans’ suicides. Melick said there have been a large number of inquiries into the issue. The recommendations were all consistent. They should be acted upon, he said. I still have reservations. I think it’s counter-productive. We’ve had seven inquiries in recent years.” Just back on water, we’ve just heard the government will review its water policies to understand whether they are unfairly inhibiting access to water. The drought minister, David Littleproud, and Mick Keelty, the inspector-general of the Murray-Darling Basin plan water resources, have just made the announcement. “Governments can’t make rain, can’t make water, but they can make policy,” Keelty said. You can chalk that up as a win, of sorts, for the protesters who have converged on Canberra to protest the basin plan, though many of them have been calling for it to be completely scrapped. Labor used question time to pick up on where it left off yesterday: attacking the Coalition’s economic management and Angus Taylor. Labor began question time by calling on the government to support a royal commission into veteran suicides. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said he remains open to the idea, and will consider it further over the Christmas break. Labor moved its attack to economic management. It said the government must wake up to the “floundering” economy. Morrison said debt had not grown under the Coalition. Labor later said that was misleading because debt had doubled. Anthony Albanese said Morrison had misled parliament four times in the last four sitting days. Things got rather heated when Michael McCormack got up to answer a dixer on the drought. Someone made a quip about fiery criticism of him by farmers outside parliament this morning. McCormack flung himself into a rage when Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon got up on a point of order. “What are you standing up for? You don’t stand up for anything.” The ensuing high drama ended with Fitzgibbon being booted from the chamber. Labor continued the attack over the Angus Taylor controversy. It asked why the government had not complied with Senate orders to produce the transcript of the Morrison-Fuller phone call. Morrison said it was “question time, not smear time”. Taylor then confirmed he had not been interviewed by detectives. In the Senate, Simon Birmingham said the government would fully cooperate with police. Labor also attacked Taylor on the two fresh controversies. Firstly that he misled parliament in his first speech over an experience with Naomi Wolf, well-known US author. Secondly, that he failed to disclose financial interests in a company. The last question is to the veterans affairs minister, Darren Chester, who is asked on the level of support being provided to veterans. This has become an issue of importance amid growing calls for a royal commission into veteran suicides. Chester says $11bn is spent each year supporting veterans, but acknowledges more must be done. The government is listening. We do understand the concerns that are being expressed by our veteran community and the families that support them when it comes to matters of suicide prevention. And just like the prime minister, I have met with family members directly impacted by mental illness. I know some members opposite have also met with members of the defence community that have been impacted by suicide and mental wellbeing concerns. As a minister, as a government, and I’m sure as a parliament, we all agree the only acceptable number for us all when it comes to veterans’ suicide in Australian defence force personnel, the only acceptable number for us all is zero.” Senate question time ends with a very fiery exchange about whether Simon Birmingham can guarantee that government staff will be available for interview by the police on NSW strike force Garrad investigating the use of a falsified document by Angus Taylor to attack Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore. Birmingham said that the government will “cooperate with the police”. Labor’s Murray Watt notes that that is what Michaelia Cash had said about the AWU raid leak matter, but then she provided a written statement and refused to be interviewed. Penny Wong shouts: “You’re hiding staff! What’s so hard about making staff available?” Mathias Cormann labelled the referral to the NSW police “politically motivated”. Birmingham noted that the record of the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, on police referrals is “eight zero – zero findings” (of criminal guilt). The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, asks Christian Porter: Malcolm Turnbull, former judge David Ipp, and Icac counsel assisting Geoffrey Watson have all labelled Scott Morrison’s phone call to NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller inappropriate. Why was it made? Christian Porter responds that Dreyfus’s judgment hasn’t been so flash hot. Porter is referring to the eight police referrals Labor have made without any charges. Your judgment is just simply awful. Absolutely awful. And I know that you’re very interested in the next time that you might be able to exercise your judgement, perhaps as a judge on a court of appeal.” Labor’s Tony Burke asks a cheeky question about Angus Taylor’s first speech to parliament, in which he recalled living as a student alongside Naomi Wolf, a famed US author. In Taylor’s version, she wanted to remove a Christmas tree in case people were offended, something he described as “political correctness”. Wolf, you may have heard, was not at Oxford at the time. In fact, she was on the other side of the world touring her new book. Burke asks: Given that the minister has been misleading the parliament since the day he arrived, is he proud of his consistency, that he has continued his career as he began it?” Needless to say the question is not allowed. In the Senate, Labor’s Catryna Bilyk is asking about this report by Sarah Martin about a bullying complaint against National Llew O’Brien. The agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, confirms only that the Nationals have a process for investigating bullying complaints, but she first dodges then rejects the part of the question about whether her handling of the dairy code of conduct is the cause of tensions in the Nationals. McKenzie: “I reject the second part of that long-winded question.” Labor’s Mark Butler picks up the attack on Angus Taylor. He asks further questions about an alleged failure to declare interests in a company GFA F1 Pty Ltd. The interest is held through another entity, Farm Partnerships Australia. Taylor’s office has issued a statement saying he needs to declare only “direct and controlling interests”. Taylor is asked whether he supports that interpretation of the rules. The attorney general, Christian Porter, jumps up to answer the question. He says that’s always the way interests have been declared. The way in which that disclosure has always occurred is where there is a trust or where there is a company with interests in subsidiaries, the trust is declared, the company is declared, but those things inside the trust or the subsidiaries are declared by virtue of declaring the head company or the trust.” Scott Morrison is asked another question on the Angus Taylor scandal. This time it’s about why the government has not released a transcript of the Morrison-Fuller call, despite a Senate order to do so. He responds: I advise the members opposite, this is question time, not smear time.” Burn. He then goes on to explain. Mr Speaker, it is the practice of governments of either persuasion to claim exemption from Senate orders for various reasons where disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. In the case of the former government, they claimed those on numerous occasions on matters of freedom of information, Australian road rules, Australian vehicle standards rules. They claimed it in relation to carbon permits, the Australia network on communications policies, on any number of occasions, Mr Speaker.” Morrison says he will respond to the police investigation when it concludes. He then challenges Anthony Albanese to hold his side to the same standards it is demanding of the government. That is, that ministers would resign if they come under investigation before an investigation concludes. And if he doesn’t, he’s just the hypocrite people know him to be.” Morrison withdraws that last bit. Angus Taylor is asked whether he has been interviewed by detectives attached to strike force Garrad, which is investigating allegations Taylor relied on a forged document to attack Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore. Taylor answers simply: “No.” Over in the upper house, Labor has asked the agriculture minister, Bridget McKenzie, when she became aware Nationals senator Perin Davey had arranged a meeting between irrigators concerned with the Murray-Darling Basin plan and the water resources minister, David Littleproud. Labor’s Murray Watt heckles “You’ve been bypassed”, and McKenzie replies that she heard earlier in the week. Glenn Sterle follows up by asking if McKenzie was invited. McKenzie says “I’m not invited to a lot” of stakeholder meetings, in the same way that defence and skills ministers are not invited to every meeting. She says it is entirely appropriate that the meeting was organised with the water resources minister. The treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, is attacking Labor for talking down Australia’s economy. Economic management has been the focus of Labor’s early attention in question time this week. Frydenberg: Now it’s probably the first time and the last time I’ll say it in this place but the leader of the opposition should listen to Wayne Swan when he says: ‘It’s important our political leaders not be out there talking down the economy. Relentless negativity from the doomsayers insults the hard work so many Australians put in to make our economy strong.’ “ Scott Morrison is then again pressed on misleading the parliament. Anthony Albanese accuses him of misleading parliament in each of the last four sitting days. Morrison responds that Albanese is treating parliament like a “second-rate high school debating chamber” with his “stunts and his clever little lines”. Labor accuses the prime minister of misleading parliament by claiming the government has not increased debt. Labor’s Jim Chalmers says the government has doubled Australia’s debt. Scott Morrison describes Chalmers as “Obi Swan’s padawan” in his response. it is a complex sort of thing for him to understand. Because in the Labor party they haven’t had a surplus since 1989.” Andrew Wilkie has a question on problems with access to firefighting assets and equipment during the elongated bushfire season. He asks: Prime minister, access to foreign heavy firefighting aircraft is now problematic as the northern and southern hemisphere fire seasons overlap due to climate change, while domestic resources are stretched to fight simultaneous fires across Australia. Despite this, my repeated calls for a specialised RAAF capability have been dismissed by the government every time. The reality is that aid to the civil community is an accepted use of ADF assets, and existing RAAF aircraft, like the C-17 Globemaster, C-130 Hercules and C-120 Spartan could water-bomb. Would you now direct defence to develop a heavy firefighting aircraft capability?” David Littleproud responds to the crux of the question. He says he’s been assured by the Australasian fire and emergency service authorities council that the current access to equipment is suitable. They also, in that letter, outlined the fact that they are comfortable with the arrangements we currently have with the Australian defence force and the support they provide, logistic support they provide our firefighters.” Just away from question time temporarily, Paul Karp filed this from the Coalition party room earlier: At the Coalition joint party room, Scott Morrison suggested that all options are on the table on the issue of veterans’ mental health. While he didn’t explicitly say the Coalition is considering a royal commission, he said it is “giving active consideration to what further action we can take” over the Christmas period. Morrison addressed the government’s decision to delay the religious discrimination bill, thanking the attorney general, Christian Porter, for his work to date and acknowledging that “within the party room there are different views – even more so across the community”. Morrison said the government was “seeking the time to get this right” and credited the fact that “a listening and respect has been shown in the drafting process to date”. Morrison wants the bill to bring people together on matters of faith and belief, and he “doesn’t want a partisan element to this process” to ensure smooth passage of the bill through parliament – an interesting hint that perhaps the Coalition needs Labor support to legislate it. Morrison said the government was not backing down on the ensuring integrity bill – which will now be reintroduced to parliament. Morrison also made some comparisons between his government and that of John Howard: In the term from 2001 and 2004, the Howard government was able to deliver based on the groundwork they had laid in the previous six years of government – as we seek to do in this term. One backbencher asked the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, about penalties for banking executives - suggesting that fines hit shareholders so perhaps personal penalties for executives was the way to go. Frydenberg responded that penalties had been increased but it was important to get the balance right so banks keep lending. The prime minister said there are provisions which allow for removal of individuals from the banking sector. Labor continues to press its attack on the Coalition’s economic management. It results in the predictable response: Labor’s all about taxing and spending. Things have gotten slightly out of control in the House. People seem upset. There’s some yelling. Some name-calling. It’s been a long year, I suppose. The deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, gets up to answer a question. Evidently someone makes a quip about his, er, less-than-friendly interaction with farmers outside parliament this morning. McCormack thunders in response: Didn’t see you out there ... And I didn’t see any of the members for Labor out the front this morning. I always come up and talk to farmers, because farmers are the lifeblood of this nation.” Labor MP Joel Fitzgibbon stands to raise a point of order. McCormack: Oh! We’ve got a bit of reaction. What are you standing up for? You don’t stand up for anything.” McCormack continues on. Fitzgibbon gets up again. McCormack: What a soft touch you are.” The Speaker is telling everyone to sit down. Morrison is asked a dixer on the economy. He says the government is bringing the budget into surplus, not increasing taxes, and not growing debt. Jim Chalmers, the shadow treasurer, asks a question on the same topic: what will it take to wake the government up to the “floundering economy”? Frydenberg responds: When it comes to real wages, they have been growing at 0. 6%, and when we came to government, they were 0. 5%, Mr Speaker. I’m pleased to tell the House that employment growth is at 2%, and when we came to government it was around a third, Mr Speaker, of that. And at 2%, it’s more than double the OECD average, Mr Speaker. And I’m pleased to tell the House that since we’ve come to government, more than 1.4m new jobs have been created, Mr Speaker. And I’m pleased to tell the House that today the ABS have announced the current account surplus is the highest on record.” Labor’s Anthony Albanese begins question time with a call for the government to support a royal commission into veteran suicide. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the suicide rate is far too high among veterans. This has been a matter that has been made a national priority by my government.” Morrison says the government will continue to reflect on the issue of a royal commission over the Christmas break. I have remained open to this question and I remain open to this question.” He says every time a veteran suicides, there “must be justice”. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is 13 11 14. Other international suicide helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org. Bill Shorten is making a 90-second speech in the lower house on disability. Today is the international day of disabled persons, he says. Not everything is positive for Australians with a disability. They finish school less; they have lower home ownership; they’re poorer; they experience higher unemployment. Carers retire with less income themselves and they experience discrimination on the daily basis. But this is not the natural order of things.” Malcolm Roberts is on Sky News about One Nation’s shock decision to deny the government passage of its union busting legislation on Friday. Roberts reckons it was all about the merits of the bill, and not about a certain Queensland election and a possible union campaign against the party. We voted on the merits at the end of it. We fired a shot across the union’s bow.” A little earlier, a group of civil society organisations gathered at Parliament House to demand the government rule out any changes to secondary boycott laws. Secondary boycotts have become an important tool in driving social change. But they have drawn the ire of government. Scott Morrison recently told the Queensland Resources Council they were “a potentially more insidious threat to the Queensland economy and jobs and living standards than a street protest”. Morrison at the time pledged to introduce mechanisms to outlaw what he said were “indulgent and selfish practices”. Oxfam, 350 Australia, Market Forces, the Australia Institute, the Australian Conservation Foundation and Uniting Church in Australia gathered to call for the government to rule out new laws outlawing secondary boycotts. They were backed by Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young, who said such a move would impinge on democratic rights. “Australians of all political persuasions value their rights and freedoms to support products, services and companies that align with their values,” she said. “More and more Australians are using their consumer power to make good environmental choices and their right to do so should be protected.” Labor senator Catryna Bilyk is continuing. She asks the government senators: “Is this really why you entered politics? Was it really to deny healthcare to vulnerable people?” The Senate is back debating the medevac repeal bill. Liberal senator Sam McMahon is warning of doom and death if the medevac law is allowed to stand. She says medevac is a weakening of Australia’s sovereign borders. Labor senator Catryna Bilyk says the government believes “we can’t protect our borders and be compassionate at the same time”. This debate is likely to stretch on for some time. We still haven’t heard from Jacqui Lambie. Katy Gallagher, Labor senator, is on the warpath over the government’s refusal to provide the Morrison-Fuller transcript. She tells the Senate the government’s explanation that it’s not in the public interest to release the documents is “ridiculous”, when “we’ve got the prime minister calling his friend ... who’s just announced they’re investigating one of his ministers”. What are they hiding? Through this whole scandal with minister Taylor, the question I keep coming back to is: why aren’t they just informing the public? Who is minister Taylor protecting?” Cormann’s response to the order to produce the Morrison-Fuller transcript has been tabled. The full text of the letter is below. Dear president, I refer to the motion moved by the leader of the opposition in the Senate, senator the hon Penny Wong, and agreed by the Senate on 2 December 2019, requesting documents associated with a phone call between the prime minister and the commissioner of the New South Wales police force that took place on Tuesday 26 November 2019. To assist the Senate, I refer first to the answers and statements that the prime minister has made and tabled in the House of Representatives. This includes an outline of the substance of the call and confirmation that the nature of the call was appropriate. As the NSW police commissioner has said: ‘The prime minister didn’t ask me any questions that were inappropriate. He didn’t ask for anything that was inappropriate and I’m comfortable with the discussion we had over a few minutes.’ Plainly any documents of the kinds requested, if they existed, would not be able to be produced as they would properly be the subject of public interest immunity. That immunity would arise because the matter concerns police inquiries by state authorities. Kind regards, Mathias Cormann Labor is furious at the government’s response to an order to produce the transcript of the Morrison-Fuller phone call about the Angus Taylor police investigation. The Labor leader in the Senate, Penny Wong, read the government’s response to the Senate after it was provided to her at the outset of Senate proceedings by the finance minister, Mathias Cormann. The letter simply referred the Senate to previous answers and said the documents would be subject to a public interest immunity claim because they relate to a police investigation. Wong: This is transparency from the Morrison government. This is the transparency and integrity, or lack thereof from the Morrison government.” Greens senator Nick McKim says it “beggars belief” that the government has not provided notes or a transcript of the Morrison-Fuller phone call about Angus Taylor. We are left with only two conclusions that can be drawn here. One is that there are notes or a transcript and senator Cormann has refused to comply with an order of the Senate. Or secondly the prime minister and the attorney general are running such shambolic offices and such a shambolic government that they would struggle to organise a beer in a brewery. Now, it’s one or the other.” The Senate ordered the government to produce a transcript and associated documents for the call between Scott Morrison and Mick Fuller about the Angus Taylor investigation. Some news out of Queensland. The ABC is reporting that the LNP is taking disciplinary action against young LNP members over an online video showing one of its branch leaders laughing at comments about Indigenous Australians. The video was published on the Gold Coast Young LNP Facebook page. A teenager in the video said: “I mean, we’ve got to stop celebrating a culture that couldn’t even invent the bloody wheel for God’s sake. We’ve got to start enjoying and living in western culture.” Gold Coast Young LNP’s chairman, Barclay McGain, was conducting the interviews. The ABC reports that those involved in the video would face “internal disciplinary” action. The video has been removed. The Senate is sitting and Labor’s Penny Wong is straight on the attack. Her target? Angus Taylor, of course. She’s criticising Taylor for providing no evidence to support his claim that the falsified document he relied on when attacking the Sydney lord mayor Clover Mooore came from the City of Sydney’s website. I’ve got to say, I wonder whether his colleagues are sitting there as they have to defend yet another Angus stuff up... ‘what does he reckon he’s doing, what does he reckon his job is. and why is the energy minister picking a fight with the lord mayor of Sydney?’. NSW police are investigating the matter and Scott Morrison stoked controversy by calling the police chief Mick Fuller for an update on the status of the investigation. Labor used the Senate to order the production of documents relating to the call, including a transcript. They received a one-page letter and no transcript. It is a scandal that demonstrates yet again that this government under Scott Morrison they don’t like scrutiny, they don’t like transparency, and they certainly don’t like accountability. Labor MPs have resolved to move an amendment to a government push to change the Customs Act, which will change the way the product-specific rules of origin of six of Australia’s free trade agreements are given effect domestically. As Katharine Murphy has previously explained, the change would limit scrutiny, making some regulations (including provisions covering dumping, where countries “dump” goods in other markets at super cheap prices to try to expand market share) unable to be disallowed by the parliament. Amid concern from some Labor MPs about the proposal, MPs have agreed to put forward an amendment to protect the parliamentary oversight of the use disallowable instruments. Disallowable instruments are rules that must be tabled and are open to parliamentary veto or disallowance for a set period, usually 15 sitting days. If the party’s amendments are not supported, Labor will vote against the bill. It was an otherwise uneventful caucus meeting after Albanese’s earlier colourful comments, with the party agreeing to support a raft of non-controversial legislation. After Labor agreed to call a royal commission into veterans’ suicide, one MP also raised the issue of Indigenous suicide. Albanese said that he was “very conscious” of the importance of the issue and hoped to continue to work with the government on a bipartisan basis to address it. The press gallery took on the pollies in basketball this morning. Looks from the photos like the journos employed a fairly deliberate strategy: bashing Ed Husic out of the game (Husic in headlock, Husic at bottom of pile-on). Seems a sound tactic to me. But, alas, the journos went down. Mike Bowers was down there for all the colour. Ged Kearney, Labor MP, is speaking on the medevac repeal bill which is before the Senate. The critical vote rests with Jacqui Lambie, who is reportedly ready to give her support if the government agrees to the New Zealand resettlement deal, which would take the current cohort off Manus and Nauru. The government has shown little appetite for that proposal. Kearney is asked whether securing the New Zealand deal would be a better outcome than salvaging medevac. She tells Sky News the Australian government can do the New Zealand deal and keep medevac. That deal can be done anyway. We can have our cake and eat it too.” She said the laws have nothing to do with national security. The minister can still refuse medical transfers on the grounds of national security. We have to remember that it’s about people getting care when they are ill. And these people are seriously ill.” John Barilaro, the deputy NSW premier, has been speaking on the Murray-Darling Basin plan. He is threatening to walk away from it (again) if changes are not made to better suit NSW. Barliaro has a list of demands to be met by the federal government. He wants more water written out of the plan and for water management plans to be deferred until the end of the drought. “If this plan does not work for NSW, we will have to walk away,” he said. Barilaro is asked whether Gladys Berejiklian, the premier, knows of his announcement. He doesn’t directly answer the question. But he says the opportunity for the federal government to negotiate with NSW is now. He says the commonwealth gave some indication last night that it was ready to talk. We’ll have more on this story shortly. One new fact out of Labor caucus this morning: the opposition will introduce a private senators’ bill to make amendments to the encryption legislation to try to force the government to make improvements agreed by a bipartisan committee report last year. Labor passed the encryption legislation in the final week of parliament in 2018, later accusing the Coalition of reneging on a deal to make amendments including improving protections against the creation of “systemic weaknesses”. In a joint statement Labor’s Kristina Keneally, Mark Dreyfus, Michelle Rowland, Claire O’Neil and Tim Watts said it was one year since the government broke its promise to Australia’s tech sector “putting a handbrake on the digital economy, and hindering the creation of jobs, productivity and growth of the economy”. They said: Some customers are less likely to seek out contracts with Australian technology companies due to a widespread perception that Australia’s encryption laws may require them to introduce systemic weaknesses into their systems ... This is why Labor is repairing the Morrison government’s encryption laws by introducing legislation based on bipartisan recommendations of the [parliamentary joint committee on intelligence and security], those agreed to by Liberal committee members and promised by Mathias Cormann a year ago.” Another amendment would require judicial authorisation before law enforcement authorities can use their new powers to compel tech companies to provide assistance or create capabilities to enable spying on customers. This is designed to address concerns that the encryption legislation is not compliant with the US CLOUD Act, which Labor says will imperil cooperation between US and Australian law enforcement. The bill will be introduced tomorrow and debated in the new year. The Murray-Darling Basin plan protesters have made their way to the headquarters of the National Farmers’ Federation. The protest places the NFF in a tricky position. The organisation agrees the basin plan needs to be improved but it has split with protesters on their demand that it be scrapped altogether. Tony Mahar, chief executive of the NFF, spoke to the protesters outside his office. “We want to see change, I can assure you of that,” he said. He says the NFF will lobby for Mick Keelty, the inspector general of Murray–Darling Basin water resources, to have the proper powers to take action where needed. “We want to see change. We want to see the basin plan fixed.” Labor has issued a full statement on its decision to call for a royal commission into veteran suicide. It reads: Labor has announced today it will support a royal commission into veteran suicide. Official figures released last week showed a disturbingly high rate of suicide among current and ex-service men and women, with more than 400 deaths since 2001. This Australian Institute of Health and Welfare research indicated that suicide rates for current and former defence personnel compared to the rest of the Australian population are higher than ever. Australia can no longer tolerate this senseless loss of life. This is nothing less than a crisis and as a nation we need to do all we can to tackle this. Labor believes the best way to do this is through a thorough and comprehensive royal commission. We are calling on the Morrison government to do the right thing by our ex-service men and women, and establish a royal commission into veteran suicide as soon as possible. This will help to shine a light on the issue, investigate why so many of our veterans are taking their own lives, and determine what measures are needed to stop these tragic deaths. The terms of reference should include serving men and women, their transition from active service back to civilian life, and their ongoing circumstances. The men and women who serve our country deserve our gratitude and respect, and we owe it to them to have a comprehensive examination of how we can reduce, and hopefully eliminate, these tragic numbers. Their deaths are heartbreaking and cause immeasurable loss and grief for their loved ones left behind, their local communities, and indeed the nation. We know many veterans and veterans’ families have been calling for this for some time now – they want to prevent future suicides and other families from suffering in the way they have. And we have listened to courageous advocates like Julie-Ann Finney, whose son David took his own life in February this year after a battle with PTSD. Labor Members of Parliament have met with Ms Finney and she has made a strong case for a Royal Commission. We want this to be a bipartisan effort – we want to work with the Government, the Parliament and the veteran community and do all we can to address the scourge of veteran suicide. Just a reminder that parliament will not sit until midday to allow for caucus and party room meetings. Mike Bowers was down in Labor’s caucus where eader Anthony Albanese was given a standing ovation. Albanese says Labor will continue to pursue Scott Morrison over his “Angus horribilis”, a line that gets a decent guffaw from the Labor faithful. The test for this bloke isn’t whether a crime has been committed, although that’s being investigated by the strike force Garrad – someone has a sense of humour. The test is has he misled parliament? That’s the test to be a minister.” If you don’t understand that strike force Garrad gag, look up Garrad on urban dictionary. He looks forward to Labor’s strategy for the end of the year. He says the party will examine media reforms and measures to strengthen democracy. Labor will have the first meeting of its national policy committee on Friday. It’s all about confidence, he says. We will go into 2020 with confidence. Confidence that we can hold this government to account. Confidence that we can defeat legislation. Confidence that we can present an alternative vision for this nation and an alternative vision that’s based on fairness, that’s based on creating wealth but also is concerned about its distribution. Confidence that we can deal with climate change with a plan which creates jobs, lowers emissions and lowers emergency prices.Confidence that we can stand up for Australia’s view in international forums.” Albanese says when Scott Morrison says “quiet Australians” he really means “shut up and listen to me”. This prompts some applause. We won’t be quiet. Australians won’t be quiet. It’s not our nature as a people. We’re upfront. We’re bold. We talk about things. We put forward our view.” Albanese is now paying tribute to Labor’s Senate team for their work opposing the union-busting laws which were defeated on Friday. He tells caucus that the people in this room “made a difference”. Every single senator spoke and last Friday I went to Australia’s largest union – the nurses and midwives – and there we celebrated what was a great victory for working people. But also I want to say that it says something about this movement. We don’t shy away from our connection with the trade union movement. I’m a proud trade unionist. Without trade unions, we wouldn’t have the working conditions that enable us to enjoy the Australian way of life that we all enjoy today.” Albanese is now talking about Labor’s calls for a royal commission into veteran suicides. He speaks of meeting Julie-Ann Finney, the mother of a former sailor who killed himself after suffering PTSD. I spoke to Julie-Ann Finney this morning. It was a difficult conversation with her. She is a remarkable woman and an incredible advocate and there is no one who could sit in a room with her and have a discussion and not come to the view that I came to. She said today that for her, ‘a royal commission – I quote her and I asked for her permission to do that – ... is an act of love, compassion and gratitude for her son.’ That’s the way that these people feel.” Albanese pays tribute to Bill Shorten and Linda Burney for the work they did to oppose the robodebt system. He then turns to aged care. The fact that 16,000 older Australians who were entitled – had been ticked off – to get home care died while waiting for that care. And of course we know the bloke who ripped the money out of aged care was Scott Morrison, as treasurer.” Albanese describes Scott Morrison as “an ad man with no plan”. An ad man who dismisses any form of accountability. Who regards democracy as an inconvenience. This mob shut down debate, shut down questions from the media ... dismissing them as just gossip or just in the bubble, don’t want to be accountable. And the fact is that we have a job to hold them to account, hold them account on behalf of working people.” Albanese continues: We have a circumstance whereby the Reserve Bank is saying that low wages is the new norm, the new norm. How is it the case that in 2019, at a time when there is no global financial crisis ... how is it that low wages are the new norm? We know, because Mathias Cormann told us that it’s a deliberate design feature of government policy. Low wages. He has said it from his own mouth.” The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, is addressing caucus. He says Labor is moving forward. “That’s more than you can say for this economy,” he quips. Albanese says working people are struggling. What’s the government’s response? They’ve never had it so good. That’s the approach we see, the arrogance, the hubris, that we see every day in question time.” I’ve lost count of the Angus Taylor controversies, but at least two new ones emerged yesterday. One was sprung by Labor in question time. It says Taylor failed to declare an interest in a company named GFA F1 Pty Ltd. Taylor has a partnership interest in the company through a separate venture, Farm Partnerships Australia, which he has declared appropriately. But he hasn’t named an interest in GFA F1 on his pecuniary interests register. Labor isn’t alleging there is any conflict of interest. The second issue to pop up was on the stranger side. In Taylor’s first speech to parliament, he spoke of his memories of Christmas while studying at Oxford. He remembered “a young Naomi Wolf”, now a well-known US author and journalist, wanting to remove a Christmas tree from the common room “because some people might be offended”. Taylor described his outrage at this form of “political correctness”. Wolf subsequently raised the small issue of her not actually being in Oxford at the time of Taylor’s memory, and accused him of an “anti-semitic dogwhistle”. “I was a Rhodes scholar in Oxford 1985-88,” Wolf said on Twitter. “Angus Taylor recalls me in a fever dream at Oxford in 1991 among those warring on Xmas. I was in NYC. Plus I love Christmas, Hannukah, Kwanzaa. Flattered to be on this mythological hate list.” Mark Butler has just been on Sky News, talking about these various controversies. On Taylor’s defence of failing to declare an interest in GFA F1: The corollary of what he said is that a resources minister would only be obliged to disclose the fact they had BHP shares if they have a sufficient number of those shares to control the company. That is utterly ridiculous.” On the Oxford student story: So again Angus Taylor has misled the parliament. It just gives you the sense that this guy makes stuff up.” Of course, the issue continuing to pose the most trouble for Taylor is that he relied on a falsified document to attack Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, for her travel-related emissions. WikiLeaks’ editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, is also in Canberra this morning. He’s trying to raise Australian support for the imprisoned Julian Assange. He’ll be speaking at the National Press Club a little later. Assange is on remand in London’s maximum security Belmarsh prison while the US seeks to extradite him for soliciting, obtaining and publishing secret documents. The trial is set down for February. Hrafnsson says the case should concern all journalists. He told the ABC earlier: It sets a very serious precedent. It means that no journalist anywhere in the world is safe if the empire decides that some publication is an embarrassment, they can go after that journalist. and they will do, that is absolutely a certainty.” Assange has already won support from unlikely quarters. Barnaby Joyce has voiced his support for Assange, as has the former prime minister Kevin Rudd. We hope that many more will come on board as well. It is helping. It is very important to hear these voices and to get their input and to show that this goes noticed. We see this as not a partisan issue. This is a cross-party fight where we hope that everyone comes on board despite their differences, because it’s of upmost importance.” Nationals Damian Drum and Michael McCormack have been down to see the Murray-Darling Basin protesters out the front of parliament. And boy, did they cop it. The farmers’ frustrations were there for all to see. Mike Bowers was there and reports that the anger was palpable. Sky News had to apologise to viewers for all the swears, so you know it was bad. Drum was trying to calm everyone down. He says the public is now on the side of the farmers, after apparently abandoning them following reports about the Menindee fish kills earlier in the year. Now they’re saying no, we want to put the farmers first, so right now is the opportunity. We can take the sentiment that exists in Melbourne, the sentiment in Sydney, in Brisbane.” A protester, John Russell, is berating McCormack for not crossing the floor against the Liberals to stand up for farmers. The Nationals won’t exist after the next election if they don’t show some spine, he says: Where’s the passion? I haven’t seen any passion from you. You’re like a poker player.” Also in that interview, Mark Dreyfus denied any suggestion that Labor’s referral of Angus Taylor to police was a “political stunt”. Absolutely not. The referral to the NSW police is because, on the face of it, it looks like a criminal offence may have been committed. It wouldn’t be necessary to make this referral ... if Angus Taylor and Scott Morrison properly disclosed just what happened in Angus Taylor’s office. On the face of it, Angus Taylor has misled the parliament. It’s an obviously forged document and we don’t know where it came from. It’s scandalous that neither Angus Taylor nor Scott Morrison has launched an investigation.” The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has called for a royal commission into the shocking rates of veteran suicides in Australia. Albanese says: The fact is we’re not doing enough in this area and that’s why the call for a royal commission is reasonable. This is one that’s been led, not by politicians; this has been led by the families of veterans.” The shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, has been on Sky News also discussing the urgent need for a royal commission. He says the situation cannot be allowed to stand. There’s a shocking rate of suicides among our veterans. These are men and women who have served our country overseas and we can’t continue with the situation where we have a much higher suicide rate than the general population. The right way to investigate this is with a royal commission ... That’s what we need to get some answers.” Just a quick summary of what we’re expecting from today. Labor will continue its pressure on Angus Taylor over the controversy now engulfing him, the prime minister and the attorney general. Taylor relied on a falsified document to attack Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore. The revelations prompted a police referral from Labor, and NSW police have set up a taskforce to investigate. The scandal was moved along further by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, who called the NSW police chief, Mick Fuller, a personal acquaintance, to check up on the investigation. We now know Christian Porter, the attorney general, was also on that call. The Coalition has accused Labor of “vexatious” and frivolous referrals to police. The medevac repeal legislation will be debated again by the Senate today. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie still holds the critical vote, and faces lobbying from both sides. Lambie is yet to make her position clear. New figures were conveniently leaked to the Australian this morning suggesting more than one-third of asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea and Nauru have applied for transfer under the laws. As we mentioned, Ken Wyatt, minister for Indigenous Australians, is under pressure over reports that he handed a contract to the company of a Liberal donor and former candidate without tender. The report in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age suggested the contract was awarded contrary to internal advice. The Murray-Darling Basin plan protesters are still camped out the front of Parliament House. The protests are placing pressure on the Nationals. Many of their traditional constituents are furious with the government’s treatment of the basin, and want the basin plan scrapped or paused. Labor is also calling again for a royal commission into veteran suicides, saying it is unacceptable that those who served Australia face a higher suicide rate than the general population. Stay with us. We’ll keep across all the developments as they happen. Hello dear readers. Welcome to another day in the mad house. It’s Christopher Knaus here again, filling in for Amy Remeikis. I’ll be here with you all week. There’s plenty on. The Murray Darling Basin protestors are still in Canberra in relative force. We’re expecting another day of debate on the medevac repeal bill. And there’s likely to be follow-up to the revelation that Christian Porter was in the room for Scott Morrison’s controversial call to NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller but did not seek advice about what he said was a “simple” and “basic” call. The call related to an active investigation into cabinet minister Angus Taylor following revelations in the Guardian that he relied on falsified documents to attack the Sydney lord mayor Clover Moore. But the major story of the morning concerns Ken Wyatt, the minister for Indigenous Australians. The Sydney Morning Herald and the Age have reported that he awarded a $2.2m contract to a Liberal donor-linked company. The contract did not go to tender, and had the company conduct Indigenous eye surgeries at double the market rate. It was awarded despite internal objections, the papers reported."

          "bodyText": "If you do the kind of political journalism that involves talking to the general public, something faintly magical can sometimes happen. As events swirl around and you try to make sense of huge, complicated themes, a single conversation will bring everything into focus. And not via words alone: facial expressions, gestures, and the way individual words are emphasised can give you a vivid sense of how people think, and the way their feelings could create political change. The encounter might be fleeting, but a connection can be made; as one side understands, the other feels heard. Since 2010, we have been responsible for the Guardian video series Anywhere But Westminster, in which we try to explore the gap between high politics and life as it is lived. With so much political coverage now based on opinion polling, we are interested not just in how people might vote, but what is behind their political choices. Vox pops have long been a crucial part of what we do. In the summer of 2014, our travels brought us to the town of Clacton-on-Sea in Essex. The local Conservative MP, Douglas Carswell, had resigned from his party and joined Ukip, then led by Nigel Farage. For us, the resulting byelection was a reason to visit the neighbourhood of Jaywick, which government statistics showed was the poorest place in England. It was here that we first got a sense of something potentially seismic. At that point, Ukip were largely understood as a new presence on the political right, who were appealing to habitual Tory voters. But things were shifting. When we arrive in a new place, the drill goes something like this. Find a location: a high street, or shopping parade; maybe a residential street, or the entrance to a railway station. Acknowledge the awkward nature of what you are about to do, but get over your nerves, and grit your teeth. Survey the people you can see. Then find your first potential interviewee, switch the camera on, and begin: “Excuse me. We’re making a film. Do you mind if we talk to you for a bit?” In Jaywick, sitting on a bench on a raised step outside his house, was a retired man who had once been a railway worker in east London, and a member of Aslef, the train drivers’ union. We shared his company for a quarter of an hour. Just about everything he said highlighted the unexpected turns politics was suddenly taking, and we have returned to the footage we shot time and again. Sometimes, we don’t ask for people’s names (it can make people feel a bit like they’re being interrogated), so we have always referred to him as “Step Man”. Our exchange began when we showed him one of Carswell’s campaign leaflets. John Harris: “So you’ve had one of these through your door?” Step Man: “Yeah.” JH: “What do you think of him, and the fact that he’s left the Conservative party?” SM: “Good for him. It’s about time somebody got up and spoke.” JH: “Right now, what’s wrong with Britain?” SM: “Well, nobody’s doing anything are they? It’s all going around in circles. They do bugger all.” JH: “Have they done anything for Jaywick lately?” SM: “Nothing gets done for bloody Jaywick.” JH: “What needs doing?” SM: “Everything. Look at the roads. Look at the state of it. The alleyways, look. Look at it all. We’re a backwater, aren’t we? That nobody gives a shit about.” JH: “And do you think [Carswell], and Mr Farage, are any different?” SM: “I’m hoping so.” JH: “Who did you used to vote for in the past?” SM [Emphatically, before the end of the question]: “Labour. Always voted Labour.” JH: “And what changed?” SM: “Well, bloody Blair. Let’s face it, he did sod all for this country … And now he’s in Europe, pissing about there, making millions. He went more Conservative than the Conservatives.” JH: “But this fellow [Carswell], until a week ago, was in the Conservative party himself. And now you’re going to vote for him!” SM: “Well, yeah. But he wants to make a few changes.” JH: “Do you think he’ll help Jaywick?” SM: “I bloody hope so.” JH: “Time was, Labour was the party of the working man, eh?” SM: “Course it was. Course it was.” JH: “What happened?” SM: “Bloody Thatcher got in – destroyed it, didn’t she? Done the working classes, didn’t she? Pissed the miners off. Done the railways. She pissed us all off, big time.” JH: “But Ukip’s full of people who think Mrs Thatcher was the bee’s knees.” SM: “Nah … ” JH: “They are! They’re all Thatcherite… [Carswell] wants to shrink the state. He’s no fan of the trade unions and the working man.” SM: “I don’t suppose he is. Nobody is, are they?” JH: “But somebody with your politics shouldn’t be voting for him.” SM: [Defiantly] “Yeah, course they should.” Vox pops have a long history. A US radio series of that name began in 1932, sampling people’s opinions about the presidential election that would bring Franklin Roosevelt to power. In 1961, an influential French documentary titled Chronique d’un été (Chronicle of a Summer) based a whole film around asking people on the street a simple but provocative question: “Are you happy?” Vox pops were popularised on British TV by the trailblazing presenter Alan Whicker (“I went out with my cameras into the monstrous avenues of Houston, stopped passersby and asked whether they owned a gun – I discovered it wasn’t a question of yes or no, but how many,” he once said). By the time we started doing them, they were an established part of TV news packages – the bit that usually comes near the end to show some “extra views of the subject matter in hand”, to quote one set of BBC guidelines. But Step Man represented something different. In the footage of our conversation, interviewer and interviewee are sitting at the same level, instead of a TV crew being ranged in formation against their quarry. The interview turns into an exchange between equals, and by the end, the power structure is reversed. In effect, Step Man told us not only that the old political certainties are dying, but also that a different kind of political journalism is called for. Reporters needed to go to places outside the traditional centres of power. The story must be dictated, not by a script they bring with them, but by what they find when they get there. * * * The initial spark for Anywhere But Westminster was the headache-inducing tedium of covering party conferences. The first time we worked together, in the autumn of 2009, we walked out of Labour’s annual gathering in Brighton and asked members of the public what they thought of the party’s sudden fixation with a group of voters termed “the squeezed middle”. In response, people talked about their exasperation with such phrases (“I’m working-class,” said one man, “why’s it always about the middle?”), and their overwhelming sense of distance from an event that was happening only a few minutes away. With the arrival of the coalition government in 2010, we believed there was a damaging estrangement between politics and the public. We decided to put this alienation at the centre of our work, and started travelling around the country, talking to ordinary people in places that were rarely visited by journalists, TV news crews or political reporters. The after-effects of the financial crash of 2008 had yet to make an impact on British politics, and the UK seemed locked into certainties that had prevailed since the 1990s. Viewed from on high, a lot of voters seemed either uninterested in politics or sufficiently becalmed that they would behave mostly as the main parties expected. But out in the country, dissent and resentment were bubbling away, and through the prism of vox pops, we were starting to understand what was happening. We talked to people who had strong opinions, but were often not the kind of voters who had either the time or inclination to make their voices heard via the traditional forums: party activism, public meetings, protest marches. As journalists employed by the Guardian, we needed to be fair and balanced, but not necessarily impartial. We were trying to expose our viewers to opinions they were probably not used to hearing. Our own views came into the conversations we had, and made these exchanges more equal, authentic and spontaneous. The people we met during this initial period have been stuck in our heads for years. From 2011: the two young men selling paintball sessions in central Birmingham – one of them just back from military duty in Afghanistan – who were lucky to even make the minimum wage, and completely detached from politics. In 2013: the two older men in Merthyr Tydfil who answered our questions about the death of Margaret Thatcher by telling us they still thought about the 1980s miners’ strike “every day”, and a 17-year-old student who did not know what a trade union was. In 2014 we met Debbie, a young mum from a council estate in Falkirk, Scotland. At a packed pro-independence public meeting on a Sunday night, she told us that the referendum had ignited her interest in politics for the first time. It had been, she said, “One of the most exciting things that’s ever happened.” Standard TV news packages tend to be scripted by the reporter, and vox pops are added to show what the public think of the story that’s just been told. For us, although we always pre-arranged some encounters, vox pops were the first thing we did when we hit town. The views we encountered then guided a lot of what we did. We asked the people we met where we should go next, or who else we should meet. If a conversation with someone was particularly interesting, we would take their number, with a view to meeting them again. The films we were making were shaped by what we divined from talking to people, rather than the other way round. When we spoke to people for any length of time, our questions tended not to begin with “Who are you going to vote for?” or “What do you think about Brexit?”, but much more open, contextual lines of enquiry: “What’s it like living here?” or “How do you feel about the future?” We did not wear suits, or carry off-puttingly cumbersome equipment, or shine lights in people’s faces. If the interviewee had the time, the conversation often lasted for 10 or 15 minutes. As we spoke to people, we sensed that the gap between politics, the media and the public was widening. It was also becoming unsustainable. “They’re all in it for themselves, they don’t care about us” may have become the great cliche of vox pop journalism. But before it was a cliche, it was a warning. * * * From the early 1990s until around 2010, mainstream debate was personified by such politicians as Tony Blair and Bill Clinton: men with an alleged genius for understanding public sentiment, and manipulating it. But since then, politics has been upended. Within a couple of years of David Cameron taking power, an often angry and unpredictable public was starting to render the usual rituals – big speeches, appearances on daytime TV – increasingly useless. Now, three years after Cameron left the stage, voters increasingly set the agenda. Not surprisingly, the vox pop – the literal “voice of the people” – has itself become the focus of angry debate. Last month, an Ofcom review found that many viewers thought the use of vox pops in the BBC’s news and current affairs coverage gave more prominence to extreme views at the expense of the “middle ground”. On Twitter you will find hundreds of tweets expressing exasperation with the form. There is a certain irony in people who habitually sound off online taking issue with other people voicing their opinions, but that doesn’t seem to stem the torrent: “I’m fed up of seeing vox pops of closet racist Dave from Blackpool and closet xenophobe Tony from Skegness.” “Ban all vox pops on the news. I really don’t care what Pete the electrician from Stoke-on-Trent thinks about constitutional law.” “Another day, another set of BBC vox pops from a load of pensioners at a ballroom dance.” In March this year, as Theresa May’s Brexit deal collided with parliament, the writer and comedian David Baddiel expressed his dismay on Twitter: “BBC News are once again doing that thing: ‘We sent our reporter to … a Leave constituency, always. Because that’s where people will be crossest. Which they think makes for better vox pops.” Back in 2017, The Radio Times published a piece by the columnist Alison Graham: “If I were Queen of the world I would draw up an Act of Parliament on fancy notepaper banning television vox pops from the minute an election is called until the result is declared. Then I’d give myself emergency powers to ban them for an unspecified period after that, too. Then I’d hope that in a world where, thanks to social media, no opinion ever goes unexpressed in a torrent of online detritus, vox pops will surely, finally, be dead.” These furies seem of a piece with the regular explosions of annoyance about audience members on BBC1’s Question Time, and viral mockery of the contradictory opinions of participants in radio phone-ins. Hostility to vox pops arises from the feeling that too much media attention is focused on a particular kind of leave supporter – white, old, working-class. It’s true that the 48.1% of voters who backed remain often seem to play only a minor role in the media’s portrayal of where Brexit sits in our politics, but there is perhaps a snobbish idea that some people are beyond the pale, and things would be a lot better if they were returned to a state of voicelessness. But there are questions to be asked about how vox pops are used, and what they say about the media’s attitudes to so-called ordinary people. These interviews come at the end of a package – suggesting that the substance of the story has already been largely decided – and follow a basic formula: one for, one against, and one comedy reply. The superficial presentation of people’s views in hasty vox pops is a key part of one of the biggest political stories of our time. In Britain and elsewhere, a constructed idea of “the people” is now both central to events, and deeply problematic. The new breed of populist leaders use public appeal to justify a politics of division and nastiness. The same reductive approach is common to Nigel Farage, Donald Trump, the Italian politician Matteo Salvini. Want to keep out immigrants? Build a wall. Fear for the nation’s social fabric? Classify incomers by usefulness, according to the “Australian-style points system”. This kind of politics never deals substantially with the complicated, difficult stuff woven into a lot of people’s sense of grievance – deindustrialisation, housing shortages, a world that has long since started moving into an era of automation and insecurity. In the populist worldview, “the people” are one-dimensional; so are the solutions. * * * On Wednesday 6 May 2015, opinion polls were still suggesting the next day’s election would be very close. In the weeks immediately beforehand, 56% of published polls had put Labour ahead. That day, we published a film put together over two days talking to people in the bellwether Midlands constituency of Nuneaton. We had been exploring the effects of five years of austerity, and a narrative had taken shape in our heads that the country might be ready for a change. But the vox pops we did in Nuneaton hit us like a blast of cold air. Our film rejected the fashionable idea of a “change moment”, and instead highlighted the tangle of resentments – against benefit claimants, immigrants, and the supposedly cushy lives of people who lived in Scotland – that seemed to be driving people’s political thinking. It wasn’t what we wanted to hear, but it was pretty much all we found. When the Conservatives won a parliamentary majority, there was a great deal of soul-searching among the editors, reporters and commentators who had been taken by surprise. Some theories held that there had been specific problems with the pollsters’ methodologies (over-weighting particular groups of Labour voters, underestimating “shy Tories”). There was also general acknowledgement in the media that political journalism had relied too much on data, and not enough on qualitative conversations with voters. But something else was going on. In left-leaning political circles, people wondered how they had not seen the Tory victory coming. Part of the explanation came from an effect of social media, identified by the internet activist Eli Pariser in 2011 as the “filter bubble”: an effect of endless personalisation, which, he said, “moves us very quickly toward a world in which the internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see, but not necessarily what we need to see.” We were not aware of it at the time, but doing vox pops had become a way of bursting our bubbles. By going to locations we wouldn’t normally visit, and allowing random chance to dictate who we spoke to, we had rediscovered some kind of antidote to the data-driven approach of polling and the algorithms of social media. But by the end of that year, it was our turn for some soul-searching. A December byelection in Oldham West and Royton was the first test for the Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn. We arrived in town buoyed by the sense that we had successfully divined the likely result of the election, and by our early coverage of the rise of Corbynism. It was raining torrentially for much that day, which makes for harder work than usual. We took cover in an indoor market, and got to work talking to people. We were shocked by the hostility towards Corbyn among older Labour voters; in our minds, the force of their opinions signified a serious possibility that the party would lose the seat. In fact, Labour won with a majority of more than 10,000. We learned several lessons. First, predicting political outcomes was a mug’s game. Second, we had been guilty of creating our own filter bubble, by relying too much on a particular type of voter found in a particular place. Statisticians call this “availability bias”. In simple terms, you can’t base political coverage only on the sort of people you find in a market in the middle of the day. * * * In May 2016, the referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU was looming. Polls were tight, but the general consensus was that the remain side would win. As we began a new series of Anywhere But Westminster, we were determined not to repeat our own mistakes. We spent a week driving from Merthyr Tydfil (we like it there – people talk) to Manchester, via the English Midlands. We had nothing set up: our only aim was to speak to as wide a variety of voters in as wide a variety of places as possible. We listened to Labour-voting leavers in Merthyr, and wealthier Eurosceptic Tory supporters in Leominster, Herefordshire. In the inner-city neighbourhood of Handsworth in Birmingham, we got a sense that assumptions of a remain victory were by no means well founded. There, we tested the received view of Brexit as a cause that only appealed to a certain kind of white person. At that point, many people were describing the respective sides of the battle as “in” and “out”. In a downpour, we spotted a British-Asian man taking shelter, wound down the car window, and asked him which side he was on. “Out,” he shot back. In Soho Road, the multicultural thoroughfare that is Handsworth’s main drag, we talked to Sikh business owners – who, in defiance of the facts, seemed to think that people from EU countries were a drain on the state and on taxpayers, and other people whose support for Brexit seemed to be down to the decay and decline they saw in their immediate environment. We then went up the M6 to Manchester. At a university recruitment fair, 10 vox pops turned up only one leave supporter. When we asked them how they felt about the future, most of the students we met were optimistic. But 15 minutes drive away, in the deprived northern Mancunian neighbourhood of Collyhurst, the polarities were reversed. “I fear for the kids – for my grandkids and that,” said one woman. “Jobs, and things like that: so I’m looking at pulling out.” Her neighbour had come to the UK from Malawi. “I’m looking at immigration,” he said. “I studied environmental health, and I can’t even get a job. As a person that came into the UK, I’ve seen the change. I know what is happening. It’s affected me. And the thing is … I’m pulling out.” We stopped to talk to two women next to a burned-out pub called the Billy Greens. Close by was an abandoned playing field, where rusty goalposts protruded from an expanse of overgrown grass. The conversation was brief, but it got to the heart of how the leave campaign had managed to frame its campaign as the vehicle for an unlikely kind of class war. JH: “How is Collyhurst doing?” Woman 1: “Collyhurst is coming up again. It’s a really nice place to live. But we do need more money spent on it.” JH: “Have people in power talked about spending money here?” W1: “They’ve had the gardens done, but that’s it. Nothing else. There’s nothing for the kids to do. Nothing for the kids to play on. Nothing at all. And yet it’s a lovely place to live.” JH: “But booming, thriving Manchester’s only 10 minutes’ drive down there.” W1: “Years ago, when I grew up here, there were places to go: playschemes, and everything. There’s nothing for kids. Nothing at all. You can look round and see.” JH: “It’s home, though, right? You feel very connected to it. W1: “Oh yeah. [Pointing at the pub] My mum had her wake there, God rest her soul, in the Billy Greens.” JH: “What I find odd coming here, is that they’ve spent millions of pounds regenerating the middle of Manchester … ” W1: “Oh yeah.” JH: “But you haven’t had money spent here.” Woman 2: “In Miles Platting [nearby area], they closed the swimming baths and all that lot.” W1: “And the library. They’ve got nothing. And I feel sorry for them. For those six weeks [of school] holidays, if you haven’t got a lot of money, you’ve got nothing.” John Domokos: “I’m curious about why you think that happens: all the money gets spent there, not here.” Woman 1: “It’s people with money. People with money. Money talks!” JH: “Last question. How are you voting in this referendum?” W1 and W2, loudly and emphatically: “Out!” JH: “They’re all voting ‘in’ in town.” Woman 1: “Course they will! ‘Cos they’ve got that!” [rubs thumb and finger together to suggest money] JH: “So it’s down to a very simple thing for you – those who’ve got money vote which way?” W1: “To stay in.” JH: “And those who haven’t got as much money?” W1: “To come out.” We didn’t predict the referendum result. But for us, the film that finished in Collyhurst helped to frame what had happened. Lots of analysis and data since that referendum has cast doubt on the idea that Brexit was some kind of working-class revolt. But all across Britain, in neglected places that rarely saw TV cameras, we had met people who were voting to leave the EU as a way of calling for change: to be heard. The idea of listening to the “left behind” briefly took hold, and found its way into Theresa May’s early speeches as prime minister. It felt to us like Brexit might be a turning point for Britain, and that the vox pop was somehow part of what was changing. * * * A year later, Theresa May called the general election of 2017. Mostly because we had never been there, we decided to begin our coverage in the Cornish town of Redruth, where the last Cornish tin mine had closed 20 years earlier. Partly because tin is a crucial component in smartphones and electric cars, there had recently been talk of reopening the mine, something that seemed to interest a lot more people than party politics. The campaign had yet to ignite: the people we spoke to seemed largely detached from it, and the few people we could persuade to talk specifics said they would be voting Conservative. Theresa May was ahead in the polls, and there was a sense that right-leaning Brexit supporters would have things their way. But as we kicked our heels on an almost deserted, pedestrianised street, a man on a mobility scooter came into view, and clocked our camera. He would identify himself only as “the tin man”. Tin Man: “Are you making a film about the deprivation in this country? This fascist shithole?” JH: “Is it that bad?” TM: “Well, don’t you think it’s that bad? Or do you not see it as it is? If you fell down dead now, mate, no one would give a shit. Isn’t that a sign of a fascist country?” JH: “I meet a lot of people who seem quite cheered up, because they voted Brexit and we’re getting out and things are going their way.” TM: “Yeah, brilliant. Prices are going up, and it’s costing another $30m to reopen the tin mine because of the fall in the pound. This wonderful country doesn’t manufacture anything any more. We’re totally reliant on Swedish mining equipment, which is costing us more money. It’s not helping us, mate. People have been conned.” JH: “Do you have a meaningful option in this election, do you think?” TM: “Absolutely. For the first time ever I think we’ve genuinely got a choice.” JH: “And the choice is?” TM: “To do things differently. There are countries that do things differently. I want to vote against crony capitalism. And the only way to do that is to vote for someone like Jeremy Corbyn.” JD: “What’s it like being disabled in the current climate?” TM: “It’s an absolutely miserable experience. Constantly picked on and harassed by the government. I got myself a cracking job down the mine: a job I was born to do. Now I get problems with my health, and I get treated like dirt. I’m running around on a scooter that was given to me [by a friend]. I don’t get any help from the government whatsoever. And this is after I put millions of pounds in the economy, working at the tin mine.” JD: “The crux of this is … ” TM: [loudly] “The crux of it is, surely society can be better than this!” JH: “We met a woman down there who said she thought Jeremy Corbyn was dangerous.” TM: “That’s just ridiculous, isn’t it? He’s a man who wants to change things for the better. Change the priority. Stop spending money on bloody war, feed and clothe the poor. Not one person excluded, yeah? And then we can start to progress as a species, for the first time ever.” We met the Tin Man when Labour were 15 points behind in the polls. The encounter with him was cut into a short standalone video that was posted on Facebook. It quickly amassed 2.2m views, and he was the subject of a story in the Camborne and Redruth Gazette. Labour came within 1,500 votes of winning the seat. * * * Now another election is looming, and we are still doing vox pops. But in the course of the last three years or so, encounters between the media and the public have been so built into the Brexit moment that they have become ritualised. In terms of the sheer amount of vitriol, mistrust, mocking memes and conspiracy-mongering, we are arguably in the middle of Britain’s first true social-media election. In some ways, Twitter is one giant vox pop. But there are crucial differences. Most people don’t have a huge Twitter following. And the things that make vox pops both revealing and satisfying are absent: all context and local surroundings, all the non-verbal communication that humans use to signal respect and empathy. One thing seems particularly striking while going back through our archive of roughly 140 films, and probably more than 1,000 hours of footage: almost all of our encounters have ended on friendly terms. No matter what political differences come to the surface, the encounters usually proceed respectfully – that’s how people tend to behave when they come face to face. Ten years of vox-popping has taught us that calling the results of elections is not our job. But if Anywhere But Westminster has one key purpose, it is to at least try to transcend the polarisation and mutual loathing. At the risk of sounding sentimental, we want people to listen to each other. Two weeks ago, after we had finished filming in Southend-on-Sea, we drove the 30 miles to Jaywick, and went back to find Step Man. At the local convenience store, the woman behind the counter told us that people in Jaywick now hated the media: there had been too many programmes, she said, reducing it to a caricature of deprivation. The worst, she said, had been a Channel 5 show titled Benefits By the Sea. It was surprisingly easy to locate his house: the same red car was parked outside, and the bench was still there, propped against the wall. But when we rang the bell, there was at least two minutes of complete silence, before an upstairs window opened. There he was: paler and more gaunt before, and half-hidden behind the pane. We spoke for 10 minutes. SM: “Hello there.” JH: “Hello. I don’t know whether you remember us. Five years ago, we were making a film in Jaywick. We spoke to you on that bench there.” SM: “Oh yeah?” JH: “Can we talk to you again?” SM: “Not really. I’m not very well at the moment. I’ve got emphysema.” JH: “What do you think of the state of the country?” SM: “[Laughs] Shit.” JH: “Do you think things are better or worse than when we met you five years ago?” SM: “Going like that [moves arm downwards], isn’t it?” JH: “Did you vote in the referendum?” SM: “Of course I did. And I voted to leave.” JH: “How do you feel about that?” SM: “Well, I want to be out. Nobody seems to know what they’re doing.” JH: “And how’s Jaywick doing?” SM: “Oh, the same old same old. Nothing seems to change in Jaywick. Jaywick just rattles along. Like the rest of the country.” JH: “Are you going to vote in the election?” SM: “Of course I am.” JH: “Who are you going to vote for?” SM: “I’ve voted Labour all my life, and I’m not going to vote for Corbyn. He’s not doing the working classes any good at all.” JH: “So if not him, who are you going to vote for?” SM: “Boris.” JH: “God – you’re a lifelong Labour voter, voting for Boris?” SM: “Yeah, because I want to get out of bloody Europe.” JH: “But what’s he going to do to the country?” SM: “Well, I don’t know. But as long as he gets us out of the mire.” JH: “Eton-educated, very wealthy … ” SM: “I wish I was. But they need to get it all sorted.” JH: “And the future of the country? How do you feel about that?” SM: “Well, I’d love to see it blossom. The poor having a few bob in their pocket. Pensioners doing well. All looked after. Hospitals. None of this … Every time you go into hospitals, hanging about in corridors – I’ve been there many, many times. Friday and Saturday night – all these arseholes who’ve had too many shandies, cluttering it all up, and people lying on trolleys, here there and everywhere.” JH: “And you’ve had that experience?” SM: “Yes. Many, many times.” JH: “When you voted for Brexit, was the NHS in your mind? The idea of bringing the money back?” SM: “Of course it was.” JH: “It was a dirty lie, wasn’t it?” SM: “We don’t know yet.” JH: “You were a railwayman and you voted Labour all your life. You know of old that if we get Conservative governments, they don’t make anything better.” SM: “Yeah, but I can’t see Corbyn making it any better.” JH: “The conversation we had with you was a big thing for us. It changed the way we thought about politics.” SM: “Well … I hope we just get out [of the EU]. And do very, very well.” It was getting colder: he was starting to cough. We said our goodbyes – “See you later, my old mate,” he said – and he closed the window and went back inside, after we’d asked him his name. He told us it was Frank. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

          "bodyText": "I entered through a discreet door in Whitehall, that of the Cabinet Office, and passed down a long sequence of spaces – literally, corridors of power – that run parallel to Downing Street, a few metres to the left. I continued to the point where another door or two would, were I so authorised, have got me into No 10. I was admitted to the office of Peter Mandelson, minister without portfolio, at this time in 1998 the second most powerful man in government, sometimes called the Prince of Darkness. I didn’t know what to expect. Jonathan Glancey, then architecture and design editor of the Guardian, had been yelled at and threatened by a government press officer for his attacks on the Millennium Dome. I had written a front-page story for the Evening Standard, whose message – “New threats to the dome” – had graced newsstands all over London. It turned out I was getting the “good cop”. Mandy (as he was also tagged), reclining informally on one of the leather couches in his office, told me how terribly disappointed he was in my criticisms, as he particularly admired my writing. He complimented me on my shirt. We discussed its designer, Paul Smith, and the shop he had just opened in Notting Hill. He asked artful questions that seemed designed to extract the identity of my sources. And that was about it. But it was an unusually high degree of interest, in matters of architecture and design, for a minister in Mandelson’s position to take. This was because the dome was to be the ultimate symbol of the triumph of New Labour. “If we can’t make this work,” the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, had said, “we’re not much of a government.” It was to be, said Tony Blair, “Britain’s opportunity to greet the world with a celebration that is so bold, so beautiful, so inspiring that it embodies at once the spirit of confidence and adventure in Britain and the spirit of the future in the world.” It’s strange, now, to contemplate the passions it aroused. For millions of event-goers the structure is now the O2, where Harry Styles and Diana Ross are among the forthcoming attractions. The Millennium Experience that it contained then is dimly remembered, like a TV soap opera that didn’t catch on. It was eclipsed, as Blairite catastrophes go, by the invasion of Iraq three years later. In 2012 the London Olympics, many times more expensive but nonetheless perceived as a success, put the bad dream of the dome behind it. For a bad dream it was. Advance publicity had been both negative and positive. It will be a monumental cock-up, had been one narrative; the Daily Telegraph columnist Boris Johnson had said he would eat his hat if it wasn’t a triumph. Then the opening night happened, 31 December 1999, which must go down as one of the greatest PR disasters in history. Thousands of VIPs, invited to celebrate this night of nights, this once-in-a-lifetime event, among them newspaper editors and the CEOs and chairs of sponsoring corporations, were made to queue for an hour or more for security checks, in the winter cold, at the tube station in Stratford, east London, from where they were to take the train to the dome. Mike Davies, a director of the Richard Rogers Partnership, the architects of the structure, arrived with the Queen and some select others by boat. They found the place emptier than expected, he recalls, leaving them to make small talk with the monarch as guests “dribbled in”. (The architect Zaha Hadid, who refused to come unless by limousine, was also one of the earlier arrivals.) At about 2.30am the head of the British Airports Authority, says Davies, “grabbed me by the throat. He said: ‘You bastards, why didn’t you let us do the security? We know how to do it.’ His family had already stormed off. They were livid.” From then on, says Tim Pyne, a designer who worked on several displays inside the dome, “the press came down on the whole project, and us through association, like rabid dogs”. “Everything went right until the opening night,” says Michael Grade, the future BBC chairman who lent his expertise on showbusiness to the project, “and then the world turned against us.” The contents were panned. They were described as underwhelming, compromised, communicating nothing in particular. The long queues to get into the star exhibits made front-page news. “Is this the arse or the elbow?” went a Private Eye speech bubble, coming from a visitor trying to enter an opening in the arm of a giant figure that was in a “zone” based on the human body. At the end of January, says Davies, “the merde hit the Vent-Axia”: ambitious targets for visitor numbers were not being met, which meant that revenue was less than hoped. “You could blow it up,” said columnist Boris Johnson later in the year, “… there must be some form of public humiliation. I’d like to see all those responsible for the contents of the dome eating humble pie.” For a government famed for its supposed mastery of spin, it was about as bad a s it could get. It crystallised the doubts that floated around the New Labour project: this spectacular container of not very much made an easy emblem of the government’s preference for style over content, its attachment to vacuous statements of modernity, its use of messaging and focus groups to deliver meaningless platitudes, its tokenistic approach to regeneration. “I’m still haunted by the experience 20 years later, it was awful,” says Ben Evans, a member of Blair’s 1997 election campaign team who then worked on the dome’s content. Now director of the London design festival, he “came out of it thinking I was really unemployable”. Like other works of New Labour, it was a modification of something inherited from the previous Conservative government. The project that would evolve into the dome had been enthusiastically backed by Michael Heseltine, deputy prime minister in John Major’s government. It had started with the Millennium Commission, set up under Major, which was charged with spending a portion of the funds generated by the new National Lottery on things that had something or other to do with the impending new millennium. “We had billions of pounds to spend,” says Simon Jenkins, journalist and a member of the commission, “and why? On a date.” One idea was for some kind of festival to celebrate this momentous moment (although, as pedants never tired of pointing out, the third millennium would technically begin on 1 January 2001). “There was a general acceptance that it would happen,” says Jenkins, “although no one could think quite what it would be.” Bids were invited. The shortlist of locations consisted of Birmingham, Derby, Stratford and the Greenwich Peninsular, the latter the site of a former gasworks, its soil burdened with arsenic and mercury and unexploded bombs. It was the evil twin of the better-known version of Greenwich, the one with the lawns and old ships and baroque architecture. Greenwich won, both because it offered the opportunity for renewal of a brownfield site, and because the line of the meridian, zero degrees longitude, runs through it. Here, it was claimed, was the place where the millennium would begin. (Again, a pedant speaks: the millennium actually started on Caroline Island, Kiribati, which is just to the east of a westward-pointing projection in the International Date Line.) The Millennium Commission would run the project until a new organisation, the New Millennium Experience Company, was set up. Jennie Page, formerly of English Heritage, was appointed chief executive, first of the commission and then of the NMEC. Gary Withers, founder of the design and branding company Imagination, was invited to help deliver the project. The Richard Rogers Partnership, already responsible for masterplanning the hoped-for redevelopment of the peninsular, was also asked to advise. Still no one could decide what the festival was about, or what was in it. Withers, according to Mike Davies, gave a deadline of 25 March 1996 for the Commission to make up its mind. After this point he would be unable to produce the show, which was conceived as a series of pavilions in the open air, on time. The Commission didn’t make up its mind. Withers said he couldn’t do his job. It was then that Davies, along with his team at the Richard Rogers Partnership and the engineers BuroHappold, came up with the idea that became the dome – a great oversailing roof, in fact a tent rather than a dome, within which individual displays could be constructed. Protected from the weather, these could be simpler and quicker to build, more like stage sets than buildings. The structure that still stands was thus a clever way of buying time, a monument to the indecision of the Commission. With Tony Blair’s election in 1997 came the danger that his predecessors’ project would be cancelled. Jenkins wrote an eloquent letter on its behalf, inviting Blair to imagine the joy of his young son Euan attending the event. The cabinet, many of them sceptical, discussed it. Prescott said his piece. It was given the go-ahead, on condition that the roof covering be upgraded such that what had until now been planned as a temporary construction could become permanent. Mandelson was made the minister in charge. It was an appealing detail that his grandfather, Herbert Morrison, had played the same role for the 1951 Festival of Britain, which for Jenkins and others was the main model for the proposed millennium event. From now on, as Jenkins puts it, it would be “a showcase for New Labour, for Cool Britannia”. Blair had publicly aligned himself with a vision of Britain as a creative, dynamic country: food and furniture by Terence Conran, buildings by Richard Rogers, art by Damien Hirst, music by Oasis. The dome and its contents would be its expression. Major corporations would sponsor different elements – a process that had started under Heseltine. This would show, as Jenkins puts it, “that New Labour was friendly to capitalism, that business was part of one big national family”. It would be, if it hadn’t been before, a political project, with potentially fatal consequences for true creativity. It would come with the legendary New Labour demand that everything should be on message, that interactions with the media be strictly controlled. “If you talk to the press,” one participant remembers being told, “we will destroy you and you will never work again.” Still, though, nobody knew what it was all for, or about. If Page was an able administrator (“a genius,” says Jenkins, “a genius,” Grade concurs, “a very strong person,” says Davies), she was no visionary. There were calls for a creative director, what Jenkins calls an “impresario”, calls that were satisfied and then not satisfied by the appointment of Stephen Bayley, founding director of the Design Museum. After a difficult few months, his short-term contract was not renewed. He left a trail of eloquent barbs as he went. “Every sensible opportunity to make sense of the dome’s extravagant uselessness has been ignored,” he wrote in his book Labour Camp, “it is a pseudo-event.” The hole in the dome’s heart, the place where a big idea should have been, became a void into which competing interests – political, commercial, cultural, individual – rushed in. The contents would be divided into 12 “zones” on different aspects of contemporary life – work, rest, the body, the mind etc – but it was still open what might be said about each. A “Litmus Group” of the great and the good was set up, to give feedback on ideas. “Does your name mean,” asked one intellectual contributor, “that you change from blue to pink depending on which party is in power?” Page had the task of reconciling the unreconcilable, with results that were broadcast in The Dome: Trouble at the Big Top, a BBC Two documentary series produced at the time by Robert Thirkell and Adam Wishart. They paid particular attention to the faith zone, where the architect Eva Jiřičná wanted to create a spiritual space specific to no particular creed. Her ideas were mashed into a pulp by the Lambeth Group, a commission of clerics consulted by Page: Jiřičná’s early proposal for an asymmetric pyramid was felt to be too pagan, too new age; the Christians in the group complained that there should be more attention to the fact that the date in question, 2000, had something to do with the birth of Jesus. The end result, in one of many moments reminiscent of Spinal Tap’s micro-Stonehenge, included a curving plasterboard wall indented with crosses, each one carrying a TV screen in its centre. The designer of one of the zones now recalls an attitude that was “so condescending”. Zaha Hadid, asked to shrink the mind zone that she was designing, was furious. “You can’t slice my work like a salami,” she said. Tim Pyne recalls the pressure from sponsors: his living island zone, on the theme of the environment, had the misfortune to be sited next to the transport-themed zone, sponsored by Ford, who “started to attack me for a negative story we were telling about car emissions”. They also demanded “that we remove an old VW Beetle, and a rusty Mini Cooper from the top of our recycled white cliff because they weren’t Fords. These were populist references to Herbie and The Italian Job; hardly controversial.” He tried to stand his ground. “The Beetle and the Mini were craned down, however, by the NMEC as an appeasement, and replaced with Vespas. Wimps.” All the time there was the relentless pressure of the deadline of deadlines, 31 December 1999, the one that under no circumstances could be missed. Page’s achievement was to meet it, against considerable odds. But “in that drive,” as Ben Evans puts it, “anything that got in the way was swept aside”. He also wants to stress that, although the project’s £789m cost sounds large, the huge area of the dome meant that the “per metre spend was woefully inadequate”. Small wonder, then, that most of those involved now describe the contents as “ultimately unsatisfactory”, as Evans puts it. Charles Falconer, the minister who took over responsibility for the dome after Mandelson resigned from government in December 1998, now says that “it didn’t succeed in its short-term goals. It was meant to be an inspirational exhibition that captured the imagination of the country at the turn of the millennium, and it didn’t do it.” Most, though, want to say that the show that was eventually put on wasn’t all bad. The body zone, designed by Nigel Coates as a fusion of a male and a female figure, was memorable. Evans has a fond memory of the rest zone, a “zen-like space” in which he remembers “a coach-load of pensioners just lying against the wall, bathed in light. I thought: ‘fantastic, that’s worked’.” People speak fondly of what Grade calls the “pretty sensational” acrobatic performances, “the most dramatic flying that had ever been done indoors”. And 6.5 million people came, making it the most visited paying attraction in Britain. The trouble was that the unrealistic figure of 12 million had, against the advice of Jennie Page and others, been made the official target. Most say that the dome itself, the structure of masts and its fabric covering, is what Falconer calls an “inspirational building”. Mike Davies emphasises its efficiency and economy: it cost £43m, which is not much for something covering 87,000 square metres; at less than 20kg per sq m, it is “the lightest building in the world. That’s magic stuff.” Above all, say Falconer and others, the dome was vindicated by its “enduring and powerful legacy” – the still-ongoing building of homes and offices in “what was a deprived part of London”, the success of what Grade calls a “brilliant venue”, the O2 Arena. What actually happened was the 48-acre site that included the dome was sold to a consortium called Meridian Delta for a nominal sum, with an additional 86 acres of adjoining land thrown in, in return for a share of future profits on the site. At the time of the transaction it was promised that “up to £550m” would be returned to the public purse, and at least some of it has. Nick Shattock, a developer who was part of the Meridian Delta bid, says that “the government will get far more than that. I’m sure of that.” He says the dome shows how “events venues can be great drivers for residential and commercial development”. Given that the site was boosted by additional hundreds of millions of public investment – the extension of the Jubilee line there, decontamination of the land adjoining the dome site – the staging of the Millennium Experience seems like a roundabout way to achieve a profitable private-sector entertainments complex plus a development that is still not complete. Falconer, though, argues that it “focused the resources of the state” on this difficult location. Regeneration there “could have happened without the dome, but it wouldn’t have happened without the dome”. More generally, it is striking on how much those involved now agree – that the main problems were political interference, the lack of creative direction or clear statement of purpose, the unrealistic target for visitor numbers, the relentless timescale and deadline, the compromises that came with large amounts of corporate sponsorship. My own aversion to the dome, at the time, came from its undermining of the hopes raised by the Blair government about both urban renewal and design. The talent arrayed there, which might have been put to use in the parts of cities where people actually live, was corralled into a compound. It was buried in a Thames-side bog with a plastic bag over its face. It set a pattern for the next decade of urban regeneration in which the power of iconic objects was overrated, in which bold-sounding political statements were then undermined by risk-averse delivery, in which the skills and integrity of architects and artists were crushed by the mechanics of public-private partnerships. In which partnerships the real power lay on the private side. At the time that Blair’s cabinet gave the dome the go-ahead, it was spurred on by what Evans calls “the motivating factor of jealousy from other countries”. This was to be a rival, or more, to the grands projets that had appeared in Paris over the previous decade. Evans also believes that the Blair government was taken by surprise by the scale of their victory in 1997: “They didn’t quite see what they could do with their power.” Perhaps the dome might be seen as a sign of their insecurity, a manifestation of impostor syndrome. Liza Fior, of muf architecture and art, whose proposal for an ice rink was binned early in the proceedings, argues that what would have been really impressive would have been to define British greatness in a different way. “Instead of making exhibitions of ideas” – for example, about investing in the local, or about the environment – “they could have really pursued those ideas.” Well, yes."

          "bodyText": "The Leaping Hare, Wyken Vineyards, Stanton, Suffolk IP31 2DW (01359 250 287). Starters £6.95-£9.95, mains £14.95-£29.95, desserts £4.95-£6.95, three-course lunch £22, wines from £22 The good ones have a soundtrack all of their own; a gentle hum of easy, contented chatter, with the occasional clink of cutlery on plate and bottle to glass keeping time. The Leaping Hare at Wyken Vineyards, not far from Bury St Edmunds, is one of the good ones. Outside, on a calm autumn day, a few diners sit at tables, soaking up what feels like the last breath of the year’s warm sunshine, tucked in against the high, foliage-clad walls of the old barn. A herd of sheep and what appear to be a couple of llamas – I’ve never been that great on my camelids – keep the grass short beyond the fence. The air smells sweetly of leaf mulch on the turn. Inside, a certain kind of England is being fed, and being fed exceptionally well; it is that part of England, to be fair, which would think it has little interest in this newspaper. And yet, here I am, on the site of one of the country’s oldest vineyards, about to have a very lovely time. The late Beryl Cook would have recognised some of the ladies here from her own paintings, their glasses perched just on the bridge of the nose, as they give themselves to a good lunch. The men too, for that matter. It is a place for people-watching. This older crowd, a lot of them now untroubled by the call of daily work, has nowhere better to be than here, inside this vaulting space, the walls traced by gnarled beams only just about managing a straight line. The art is tasteful. The paintwork, in muted tones, is tasteful. There is a cleaned, blue-black mussel shell staring at us from the bowl of snowy sea salt, the better to scoop it up. It’s that kind of tasteful. Come friends, and slip gently with me into the restaurant equivalent of the bubble bath you never quite want to leave. I am late to this party, by about a quarter of a century. The Leaping Hare has been in the Good Food Guide for 25 years, and has held a Bib Gourmand, the most interesting award from the tyre company, representing good food at a reasonable price, for more than 20 years. There are hints on the menu of an awareness of the times and their passing. The word “foraged” appears. There are asterisks to indicate that certain dishes are made with ingredients from the estate or from within five miles of it; on others, that the key ingredients are from Norfolk or Suffolk. The whole “diving into hedgerows to find wild things that taste much like farmed things” has never quite excited me; as I’ve said before and I’ll keep saying, if foraging were so great, presumably we would want everyone to be doing it. If that happened, the eco-system would collapse. Farming was a great invention. What’s more, it’s all irrelevant if what happens to those ingredients when they reach the kitchen misses the mark. Here, it doesn’t. The cooking at the Leaping Hare isn’t innovative. It’s British produce, given a proper seeing to with lots of classic French bourgeois technique and an emphasis on big, crowd-pleasing flavours. You may not coo over the first mouthful. Instead, gently, as the meal goes on, you will clock just how well you are being cared for. A partridge breast is seared and roasted, but there is still a crimson blush within. There’s more partridge broken into the rich stew of white beans and lardons upon which it sits. A scoop of golden fried breadcrumbs, flecked with the green of herbs, is spread across the top to give it a texture. It’s a lot of starter for £7.95. That understanding of the need for crunch is obvious in a second starter of spiced and roasted monkfish, with golden onion rings, looking like something you could wear as a dainty bangle, speared by crisp batons of green apple. It comes on what is described simply as “curry sauce”. It is the deep yellow of the best butter. It is sweet. It is only very lightly spiced. It’s the perfect sauce for a coronation chicken, and lubricates the fish perfectly. It makes me laugh out loud. It’s like meeting an old friend unexpectedly, after a long time separated. Venison, served rare enough for you to imagine you could test the blood type, comes with roasted shallots, savoy cabbage and their version of clapshot – mash mixed through with parsnip – and a rich game jus that’s so shiny you could see your face in it. There are onion rings, again, for that bit of texture. They are tiny this time, as if designed for your pinkie rather than your wrist. It’s also a menu that recognises the value of letting a dish give up its own secrets. Duck breast has been rendered so that there is only a thin layer of fat beneath the bronzed skin. Here are damsons from the estate, and whorls of a smooth, duck liver parfait and a few crushed hazelnuts. Here, too, is the advertised dauphinoise, served as a crisped rectangle. We are pleased to see it. But hang on, what’s this in the middle? The two slabs of potato are sandwiching long-cooked then shredded duck, as if it were some savoury bourbon biscuit. It feels like you’ve been lobbed a freebie. Yours for £19.95. Their dark chocolate sorbet is good; the lip-puckering passion fruit flavour is better. Best of all is a pavlova, the meringue part fashioned through some sort of kitchen witchcraft into a cup, filled with damsons and damson ice-cream and sugared nuts for crunch. It disappears quickly. Service is of the smooth, unobtrusive kind that recognises that people eating here probably want to talk to each other, more than they wish to hear long speeches. There is a bustling café down at the other end of the room, knocking out fishcakes, pasta dishes and bowls of mussels. They don’t miss a beat, in either space. This, of course, is a vineyard. It is only right that we drink some of what might be called their rosé, were it not the deep pink of pear drops. It is luscious, a last taste of the summer just gone. We pay up and wander into the “country store” out the back, selling picture frames and children’s books, salad servers and vases and all manner of things you didn’t think you needed until you saw them. Outside the breeze blows, the leaves fall and all is very much right with the world. News bites My strongest memory of Maison Bleue in Bury St Edmunds, from my visit a few years back, is of a lady in a hat, eating oysters off the half shell by herself. It was all very civilised. If anything, the offering has stepped up a notch since then. Go for the likes of crab with apple, caviar and lemon grass, or rabbit with kohlrabi and oyster ice cream, followed by halibut with a cauliflower crust and a cockle emulsion (maisonbleue.co.uk). Despite the collapse of the Jamie’s Italian chain earlier this year, Jamie Oliver is pushing ahead with his mid-market restaurant interests, only outside the UK. He is to launch Jamie Oliver’s Kitchen, an all-day concept, in Bali and Bangkok. According to the company the menu could be ‘easily adapted to local flavours and food trends’. In Bangkok, for example, this will include a soft shell crab burger with green papaya salad. A simple marker of the economic challenges faced by the UK’s hospitality industry: according to research by accountants UHY Hacker Young, the country’s top 100 restaurants recorded a combined loss of £93 million in the past year. In the previous 12 months it was a £37m profit. Email Jay at jay.rayner@observer.co.uk or follow him on Twitter @jayrayner1"

          "bodyText": "Chinese students in Australia have been accused of trying to stifle freedom of speech on campus, of attacking pro-democracy protesters and of undermining the quality of education at our top universities which are increasingly dependent on the money they bring. They stand at the centre of many of our political debates as we navigate the increasing influence of China in our region, its attempts to infiltrate our politics and institutions, and Australia’s increasing economic dependence. In all this, the voices of individual Chinese students are rarely heard. Over the past 10 weeks Guardian Australia has interviewed Chinese students studying in Australia in an attempt to get at the humanity and the diversity behind the headlines. Most of those we approached felt that the Australian media was hostile to them, always writing about Chinese in Australia as a threat. Getting their trust was difficult. The interviews were conducted in Mandarin by a former Chinese journalism student who has now graduated, and on the understanding that the students not be identified. Several, particularly those who were critical of their home country, worried about the consequences of their names being known. International education is one of Australia’s largest export industries, coming in fourth behind coal, iron ore and the natural gas industry. But the education of young people is a more complex business than digging up and shipping out coal and ore. International students bring in an estimated $35.2bn, or 8% of total exports. It’s a massive business that is transforming our cities, with student accommodation driving much of the high-rise apartment boom, and noodle and bubble tea shops springing up in the streets around university campuses. Chinese students represent about one-third of the students who come to Australia, but bring in a larger proportion of the money because they gravitate to the more expensive, prestigious universities. So what do Chinese students make of the debates that swirl around them? Does their Australian education alter their attitudes to their home country? And how do they process western media coverage of the Hong Kong protests and the anxieties about China’s rise? Are they altered by their education, or do they only seek to alter us? A complex human picture emerged from our interviews. Some of our subjects envied and aspired to the free-thinking education available in Australia. Others thought such freedoms were appropriate for the west but not for China. Some didn’t feel safe here. They noticed different things: cleaner streets than at home, but also racism, and what they perceived as shallow cultural roots. For some, love of country was the same as loyalty to the Chinese Communist party. Others drew a distinction between love of China and love of its government. They talked about media censorship at home, and the great firewall of China which prevents internet access to international media. There were lots of different views and attitudes but a common thread was an increased national pride and confidence. This is China’s time, many said. They want to be part of a better future for China even if they don’t necessarily agree on what that might mean. Wendy Wendy is studying a master’s of media and communications. She has worked as a teacher of Chinese language in Thailand and Britain. I love my country. I love traditional Chinese culture, the verses, the ditties, odes and songs in Chinese history and the heritage left by ancient people. I’m not a believer in socialism. I think so-called socialism now is not exactly as it was defined originally. Socialism happened to be the right way for China at a specific historical stage. If another system fitted into the historical stage, the society may still have developed well. I was brought up in the Chinese education system, so I learned the idea of respecting your teacher and his teaching. China is a country with clear hierarchies, and the teacher is in a high position. Most of the time we don’t have the guts to question what we are taught. I want to choose what kind of life I want to live and what ideas and values I want to believe. After I lived abroad, this feeling became stronger. I hope Chinese students in Australia can get rid of their biased thinking, their mental block and fixed mindset, to accept some new ideas and values. I thought that the students who attacked the Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations represented a group of people who are brainwashed and have lost the ability for critical thinking. They do not represent all international students. They gathered in patriotism parades and shouted dirty words and didn’t allow others to question. They didn’t know what the Hong Kong demonstrators were demanding. They didn’t allow any questioning of the authorities. There’s an old saying: scholars need to question. Only questioning can make progress. If we lose the spirit of questioning, how can our society and country improve? Many mainland Chinese people are brainwashed too severely. I am not a secessionist. I certainly hope China would become a unified country. But if Hong Kong and Taiwan have different ideas, I support them too. The people living on those lands are the people who have the right to choose, not us, who are not living on those lands. I support social stability, but not by brainwashing. This stability is a fake stability. But the worry is that if people have the right to choose, the options will be too many for the huge population. The Chinese Communist party dragged China out of war. So many people are grateful. I think being grateful is good. But making your people live a peaceful and happy life is not a bonus, but an obligation for any party. As a former educator, I very much hope China will become a well-educated, civilised country. China develops very fast. The rising power of one country will always make others nervous. Our nation leaves a not so gentle impression on others, not as gentle as in history. Australia and China understand each other more than many other countries do. But in term of understanding, you can never have too much. Yao Yao is a PhD student in Melbourne, researching Chinese media. She comes from Shaanxi province. I am a patriot. Patriotism is hoping the country and the people will be better. The government exists to serve the people. If you serve the people well, yes I can love you. Loving my country and loving the Chinese Communist party surely should be separated. But we are always told that China and the CCP are the same. I watch Chinese and western media. I am against looking at China only with western values. And I am against looking at the west with only Chinese values. The conflict between the two is irreconcilable. Each media cannot help being biased when reporting foreign news. I understand that the Chinese government restricts and controls the media because otherwise social conflicts would be too intense. From my perspective, the great firewall of China shouldn’t be there, while from the government’s perspective it is an effective way to guide public opinion. There are too many people; you cannot handle them. That is the thinking. I think some Chinese people don’t have much national confidence. If you cannot accept criticism, then you are not confident. I think national confidence is that I’m not afraid of others’ words. I hope China and Australia come to understand each other with an open mind. When you criticise China’s system, you need to understand China’s position and its history, instead of criticising only from the position of a liberal democracy. I hope Chinese people come to have more compassion. Don’t just care about your surroundings, know more about the world. Don’t restrict your opinions in China. Look at the world. It’s so big. As Chinese society develops, it is good that education becomes more mobile. I support this kind of globalisation. Shao Shao came to Australia one year ago. He was raised in Anhui province, and has done voluntary work in Africa and gained a degree in psychology in China. He is studying strategic communications. China hasn’t been very powerful. But now we are powerful enough to not tolerate what we shouldn’t tolerate. As world power transfers, some people need to stand out and question the west. I’m a nationalist. I therefore think of the western world as being in the opposite position to me. It is dominant, but it should be China that is dominant. Since the industrial revolution it has been the westerners who dominated the world. Now the trend is towards China. I think one of our problems is that before we did not see the western nations as our enemy. Now we should, in a little part of ourselves, see the west as an enemy. When our country was not strong, we wanted to keep a low profile. We could not be too aggressive. But now we have more power we shouldn’t be like we have been in the past. Western media are too strong. China needs the great firewall to guard against the influence from an untested value system of the west. Democracy and freedom seem to be right because the west has developed to be so dominant. But these ideas have never been tested by history. China has too many people and the level of education is limited, so it’s hard to gain stability if public opinion is influenced by the untested values from outside. As for the issue of the South China sea, it is survival of the fittest. These countries in the region are pitiful. You have demands in front of China but you don’t have the power. Then don’t speak! Just as when the United States was powerful, so China did not get full sovereignty in the South China sea. Australia is not important in my expectations about the future. It just follows the US. The future of China is about surpassing the US, which is our competitor. Actually we are not ‘climbing’ to No 1. We were No 1 in history. We are simply reviving and ‘going back’ to the No 1 place. Under the western system, they separate the love of country from the love of government. But is this correct? You cannot use the western system to judge ours. The western system is not right for all societies. The Chinese Communist party is great, but we have to acknowledge it didn’t do very well on some things. Our system has the ability to correct its errors. It is wrong to talk about China’s problems to outsiders. When you are strong enough you can talk about your problems, because you don’t care – you are already the strongest, such as America now. But China is not at this stage. Some problems, we know them ourselves and solve them by ourselves. But don’t talk about them to others. From the beginning I thought western countries were behind the Hong Kong protests. I think the protesters have problems. Working hard or studying hard is enough. Why do these meaningless things? Freedom and democracy … are they basic needs of human beings? … I think they are just a dream weaved by western media. Hong Kong’s problem is far more complicated than we as individuals can solve. Therefore we need to believe in the Chinese Communist party and the Hong Kong government’s wisdom. They will solve it in the best way. I want to contribute to my country and the people. The most ideal way is to get into the ministry of foreign affairs and become a diplomat. It would be better if I become an ambassador. I cannot only help our fellow people overseas but also promote the image of China. Venus Venus is from Xi’an, in Shaanxi province, and is studying marketing. She has joined the campus Chinese debating team because she enjoys thinking critically. I am a confident person – 70% of my confidence may come from my personality; 30% comes from a strong country behind me. China does well in patriotism education. We are instilled with the national sense of honour at a very young age. We are educated that everyone needs to contribute to the development of the country and society. I don’t love every part of China, but I’ll accept its good and bad things. I’ll face them. I think this is a healthy love. My parents are not perfect but I love them. My love for the country is a bit like this. I study to understand China’s history and culture. I think understanding is the first step of love. Second, I will defend my country – not irrationally, but more spiritually. If I meet a foreigner and talk about political issues, I will acknowledge our shortcomings and say it’s OK, we will try to improve. The party and the country are bonded. This is something we cannot deny. Personally I separate them. I will only say I love the country. The history and culture I love is not created by the party. I don’t understand the party very much. In my family, half are CCP members and half are not. So my position is in the middle. I hope Chinese people can be more confident, culturally and nationally. I think differently about this confidence to many Chinese people. I think confidence means acknowledging both good and bad things and facing them frankly. A lot of radical patriots find it ear-piercing when hearing any criticism. This reaction actually shows you are not confident enough. If I am truly confident, I accept all the strengths and weaknesses of myself. I get my news from Weibo, Instagram and WeChat. I normally wouldn’t figure out whether the information is true or not, because I know all of it must be polished. I naturally believe that each piece of news is half true and half fake. Fake news might be ethically wrong but sometimes there are no other choices. If you completely release the truth it may arouse social panic. Some people may not be as calm as me. They are more likely to be provoked and may cause some unknown consequences. From this angle, media control is excusable. So I think fake news is not completely wrong. As for the Hong Kong protests, expressing your appeals lawfully is not wrong. I think Hongkongers should lawfully express their appeal while not resorting to extreme, violent and even terroristic ways. I am a patriot so I spiritually support territorial integrity and oppose independence of Hong Kong. Miami Miami was raised in Hebei and learned English in China. He played rap with African Americans at home, and was deeply influenced by American street culture. He is studying strategic communications. When I saw our military force in the military parade on our national day, I wanted to cry. This is the strongest national confidence. Like president Xi said, there is hard power and soft power. Soft power is our culture. Soft power can also bring national confidence. But personally I value hard power more. Australia embraces all cultures while losing its own. It feels like a Chinatown. I can even communicate in Chinese in the city. Australia sits on the fence. I don’t really care about Australian opinions. Australia’s opinion on political issues follows that of the US. At first in Australia I really wanted to jump out of my circle and communicate more with Australians but I found I couldn’t do it. It was more efficient to communicate with Chinese. I sometimes played rap with some black people in China but here I find that street culture is not popular. Australian ways of communicating are quite different from American ways. Enduring loneliness is a compulsory course when studying overseas. Yet I have found the joy of learning here in Australia. The cramming method of teaching in China is completely different. In China the teacher will teach you everything and tell you what to do in each step. People may think this is more efficient in the short term. Personally I choose the western education but there’s nothing wrong with the Chinese way. We must understand that China has a huge population. It’s impossible to have everyone doing their own thinking. I think white people intrinsically have a sense of superiority. I have experienced discrimination at the university. When I was seeking some information about my subjects, the white person there was laughing all the time. I asked her why and she said she couldn’t understand my accent. She found another person, another white guy. When I was talking, they both started laughing. I want to go back to China because my country is not strong enough. It’s already very strong but not enough. I hope it has more voice worldwide. I want to contribute to this course. Some people go abroad to stay there. Some people go abroad to integrate the foreign culture into their way of thinking. I’m the second kind of person. I can go back to China and solve problems in a Chinese way but from a global perspective, to make my country better. I was angry about the Hong Kong protests at the beginning. I thought the protesters had forgotten their origins. Now I feel that this isn’t an issue any more. I see them as clowns. They won’t influence us much now. All they can do is influence some public opinions worldwide. I don’t want to see western media discussing this. Your discussions are making it harder for us (China and Hong Kong) to live peacefully. It’s like I want to reconcile with my husband while western countries are like a mistress sabotaging us, making the process slower and slower. Hong Kong is part of China. China always sees Hong Kong as a son. A special son. This son may not be so intimate to us. But we need them to understand the parent more. The leaders will have their solutions. Of course I hope it’s peacefully solved. I want to see my country peaceful and stable. Ethan Ethan came to Australia on the advice of a relative after failing to get good enough marks to enter a good university in China. He studied English at school in Jiangsu province and was strongly drawn to all things foreign. He is studying accounting. One thing that struck me here is that people clean the streets. In China people care only about their own spaces and the public space is the dirtiest. I like this about Australia. The sense of community here is great. I was a person who worshipped and had blind faith in foreign things when I was in China. After I came to Australia, I found there were not strong cultural roots here. I look back at China and think that I was shallow in my love of foreign things. China is not shallow. China has very deep historical roots. We are the generation under the one child policy. I have to say we are spoiled. As long as you are the only child, your parents’ investment in you makes you less independent compared with the children here. I don’t accept the pure pursuit of individualism. I’m still a Chinese and I’m still family-centred. People here say to me, ‘You should move out of home’ and ‘You don’t need to give the money to your parents because it’s your money.’ I can understand, but I won’t do this. In nature most animals kick out their children when they grow up. Westerners are also like this, like animals. But what makes China great is that in its culture there are things that can challenge nature. There is the filial piety of Confucius. The continuing heritage of a family. Patriotism is loving your country. Loving the 9.6m sq km. It’s loving your history, your people, your government and your party, all of these. But I don’t think loving the country means that you cannot criticise your country. My life since I was born has been under the leadership of Chinese Communist party. Personally I’m quite satisfied. I didn’t suffer a lot and experience unfairness. My position is that I love CCP. I read some books about the Communist party and appreciate their pure spirit. Of course I wish the Cultural Revolution had never happened. But can everything be perfect? It’s an unexpected thing at a certain age. As long as we can face it, it’s OK. And Deng Xiaoping apologised. People have been rehabilitated. The great firewall is not really so strict. Those who are easily influenced are kept inside, but those of us who know how to use a VPN can easily get over it, and we have enough knowledge to distinguish between right and wrong. But it keeps those who are too easily influenced by western values inside. Sally Sally has completed a master of journalism course in Australia and has remained here after graduating, working with Australian journalists writing about China. I came to Australia because my mum thought it was a good place for immigration. I didn’t really experience much cultural shock as I humbled myself to learn more about all aspects of Australia. My friendship circle consists of local people mostly from church and some international students. Compared with Shanghai, Melbourne is not safe as there are more crimes around me. But it depends on how you define ‘safe’. As a journalist, Australia is way safer than China. There are a lot of CCTVs in China, which makes me feel safe when I walk home late at night, but also makes it less safe because more information is in the control of the government. I’m not sure if I can be defined as a patriot. I would say I hope Chinese people live a better life and China would become more civilised. I don’t intentionally do things to show I love China but objectively some things I do will help others have better impression of China. For example, I will answer questions about China to help more people understand. I separate loving China and the Chinese Communist party. I don’t think there’s a conflict between emigration and patriotism. Most people emigrate to get a life they couldn’t get in China but it doesn’t mean they don’t love China. Personally I don’t have much feeling when I hear the Chinese national anthem. To be honest, I can’t even remember all the lyrics. I hope Australia and China can benefit each other. They don’t understand each other enough. I took part in journalism about Chinese influence in Australia and I think it’s very necessary as Australian people have the right to know. I don’t see Australia as a threat to China because Australia is a peaceful country. America is not a threat to China because the first and foremost purpose of America is to develop itself, rather than attacking others. The biggest threat to China is the problems in China itself. Actually, the biggest threats to most countries are not from outside but inside."

          "bodyText": "How has Boris Johnson come to be in charge? Even committed Conservatives must have been asking this over their cornflakes as they watched their indefatigable leader being overpowered by a mop. They may happily overlook the casual racism, the sexism and the gaffes. But how can a man who can’t count his own children (or mistresses) or stick to a core party policy become prime minister? How can a deeply untrusted person, who cynically ignores the rules of public life, present as the de facto leader of the British establishment? Perhaps the more important question is what does Johnson’s elevation say about the political and electoral conditions that have enabled his kind to rise ever upwards? For one, his ascendency suggests that the Conservative party has simply run out of a set of ideas it can unite behind. Johnson’s post-Brexit economic plans are more nostalgia fest than grand vision. The manifesto offers little beyond the partial restoration of the public services that the party has been devastating for a decade. Can anyone recall an innovative Tory policy idea in the last three decades beyond basic Thatcherism 101? But his rise also tells us that the UK establishment has become socially and ideologically incoherent. Globalisation severely divided their ranks. Eton and Oxbridge may be overrepresented in recent cabinets, as well as in the judiciary and other elite pockets – but such pedigree means less among the more transient ranks of today’s international CEOs and financiers. In those circles, economic capital is the only cultural capital one needs. Decades of neoliberalism brought a shake-up of establishment winners and losers. While City players reached ever greater heights, the old Tory shire faithful were pushed to the margins. As private business consultants and magic circle lawyers flourished, BBC top brass and Whitehall mandarins saw their public servant status diminished. Brexit is likely to produce a new set of elite victors and also-rans. What this means is that Johnson’s policy flip-flops are acceptable because there is no clear direction of travel that unites either party or establishment. His incoherence should be seen in the wider context of elite incoherence. The elite can however only agree on what they don’t want: a Corbyn government. For that they need “an election winner” more than they need a big thinker. Many Conservatives held their noses and picked David Cameron and Theresa May for that reason. As Johnson survived whatever Ian Hislop or Ken Livingstone threw at him, they believe victory will surely be theirs again. However, Johnson’s rise is about more than his perceived electoral value to his wealthy establishment donors and the party faithful. He is also there because his personal failings seem to matter less, either to his elite backers or to many undecided voters. This is part of a wider problem. The deterioration of expertise and knowledge stretches much further than Johnson. He is not the only frontline MP who doesn’t seem able to master a simple brief. Professional politicians, of the kind who have come to lead the main parties in recent decades, have gathered little experience or specialist expertise outside the Westminster village. They have moved rapidly from ministerial post to post, rarely staying long enough to understand their policy areas. Their networking skills and media savviness gave them quicker routes to the top – journalism and PR experience were useful political apprenticeships. Johnson and his on/off allies, David Cameron and Michael Gove, all followed such pathways to the top of their party. In any case, “expertise” has become a highly devalued commodity. The term itself is almost an insult and not just because Gove has said so. For years, politicians and business leaders agreed on the merits of an economic policy consensus that neither predicted nor explained the great financial crash. While leaders lauded their policy triumphs to the public, and the ranks of the super-rich kept rising, a growing number experienced wage stagnation, unaffordable housing, precarious employment and debt. Inequality kept growing. Similarly, Johnson’s willingness to lie and bend the rules of the game to breaking point is only an extension of recent trends. In the 1980s the economic victors of the Thatcher revolution were those who were the quickest to disregard the mores of gentlemanly capitalism. The old corporate and City leaderships were ruthlessly replaced by those ready to ignore business traditions and long-standing relations. In the 1990s and 2000s, New Labour’s spin machine was notorious for its elasticity with the truth, be it selling the Iraq war or the merits of big finance. Now, institutionalised lying, obfuscation and dirty tricks are the new normal. For the voting public looking on, all this means that the political classes in general are no longer seen as credible. Nor are government institutions, business leaders or journalists. British electorates are as volatile and unaligned to parties as they have ever been. Trust in even respectable news content has reached new lows. Social media fabrications, PR spin and lying authority figures – against the backdrop of an industry struggling financially – makes the task of reporting even harder. Thus, in a world where politicians bluster, where experts are proved to be wrong, where lies and deception are commonplace, where neither politicians nor commentators are trusted, why not pick Johnson? Such failings are far from terminal. They weren’t for Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro or Benjamin Netanyahu. On the contrary, Johnson’s skill sets are to be prized by those who just want a winner. Teflon Johnson, with his carefully honed media shtick, is able to deflect all comers with a ruffle of his hair, a classics reference or Brexit rallying cry. The public knows he lies but his open acknowledgment of that can seem almost “refreshingly honest”. He is happy to publicly ditch any Conservative ally or policy shibboleth if it contributes to a victory (while signalling his traditional Tory credentials). In the dishevelled void that is British politics, why not pick a ruthless, Churchill-style leader to guide us out of the national existential threat that is Brexit? Such “strong” leaders are gaining in public support, in the UK as elsewhere. One big question remains though. In the glare of a real national election, one taking place outside the Westminster bubble, will Johnson prove to be the winner the Tories and establishment assume he is? • Aeron Davis is professor of political communication at Goldsmiths, University of London.

Crack open the dried limes – a light bash in a mortar is very efficient and satisfying here – then put the pieces of lime shrapnel in a small saucepan with the cream, vanilla, sugar and honey. Stir to combine, then put over a very low heat to infuse for 10 minutes, stirring now and then: it should not simmer or boil at any time. After the 10 minutes, crank up the heat a little. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove from the heat and strain over the chopped chocolate. Scrape and press the lime and vanilla against the sieve to extract all of their flavour, then discard. Add the salt and whisk until you have a smooth ganache. Pour into a shallow container and set aside, uncovered, in a cool place for an hour, then cover and refrigerate until just firm – about two hours. Line an oven tray with baking paper. Remove the ganache from the fridge and, using a teaspoon, scoop out small mounds of truffle (just over 10g per truffle) and put on to the lined tray – don’t worry about shaping them at this stage. Refrigerate the truffles for half an hour to firm up, then hand-roll each mound roughly into a ball. Put back in the fridge until very firm. To coat the truffles, put two thirds of the chopped chocolate in a medium heatproof bowl set over, but not touching, a small saucepan of simmering water. Stir gently to melt the chocolate, remove from the heat, add the rest of the chocolate and stir until smooth. Using two skewers, dip each truffle ball into the melted chocolate, leaving the excess to drip back into the bowl, then put back on the lined baking tray. Leave the chocolate to set a little, then roll in the chopped pistachio nuts or gently dust with cocoa powder. Refrigerate until completely set before packing in gift bags. The truffles will keep for up to two weeks in an airtight container in the fridge. Hazelnut and seed brittle Prep 10 min Cook 30 min Makes 4-5 small bags 1 tbsp sesame seeds 150g skinless, roasted hazelnuts, roughly chopped 2 tsp caraway seeds 2 tsp coriander seeds ¼ tsp flaky sea salt 2 tbsp water 135g brown sugar 135g caster sugar 115g unsalted butter, cubed 1 tsp vanilla extract ½ tsp baking soda 130g chocolate (60-70%), melted Roughly chop the hazelnuts (you want fairly big pieces) and transfer to a small bowl. Toast the sesame seeds in a dry frying pan over a low heat. Shake the pan regularly until they begin to take on some colour, then toss into a bowl with the hazelnuts. Toast the caraway and coriander seeds in the same pan for about a minute, then transfer to a mortar or spice grinder to grind coarsely, then add to the hazelnuts. Add the salt and mix to combine, then set aside. Line a large oven tray with baking paper and put it close to the hob. Put the water in a small saucepan, add the sugars and butter, and put on a low heat. Stir gently until the butter has melted and the sugars dissolve. Turn the heat up to medium-high and bring to a boil. Simmer, stirring regularly to prevent it from catching and burning, then put a sugar thermometer into the caramel and cook until the temperature reaches 150C/300F – it will begin to smoke a little, but don’t worry. Remove from the heat and add the vanilla and baking soda. Stir gently, being careful as the caramel will bubble up a little, then quickly pour the caramel evenly on to the tray. Using tea towels, carefully tilt the tray so it forms an even layer. Do not spread or touch the caramel as this will alter the consistency of the brittle. Set aside to cool and harden. When the brittle has cooled, spread the melted chocolate all over in an even layer, then immediately sprinkle the nut and seed mix over the top. Set aside in a cool place (but not the fridge or freezer) for the chocolate to set, then break up into large shards to put into gift bags; you should get four to five small bags. The shards will keep for seven to 10 days stored in an airtight container. Marmalade and almond rugelach Prep/chill 2 hr 30 min Cook 25 min Makes 24 For the pastry 160g plain flour ¼ tsp baking powder ⅛ tsp salt Finely grated zest of 1 small orange Seeds of ¼ vanilla pod 125g unsalted butter, cold, cut into cubes 125g cream cheese, cold For the filling 40g flaked almonds, lightly toasted, crushed 80g light muscovado sugar ½ tsp ground cinnamon ¼ tsp ground cloves 150g fine-cut marmalade To glaze 25g flaked almonds, finely crushed ¼ tsp cinnamon 1 tbsp demerara sugar 1 egg, lightly beaten Make the pastry up to two days ahead. Put the flour, baking powder, salt, orange zest and vanilla seeds in a food processor and pulse twice to combine. Add the butter and process until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the cream cheese, and pulse until the dough just begins to come together in a ball around the blade. Tip the dough out on to a lightly floured worktop and knead a little to bring it together. Divide the pastry into two, wrap loosely in clingfilm and press into flattish discs, and transfer to the fridge for at least an hour and up to two days. For the filling, put the almonds in a small bowl with the muscovado sugar, cinnamon and cloves, and set aside. Line a large oven tray with baking paper. Roll each piece of dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 25cm circle about 2mm thick (use a plate or saucepan lid to trace into a circle if your pastry looks very irregular). With a small spatula or back of a spoon, spread the marmalade evenly over each surface, then sprinkle with the almond sugar mix. Use a knife or, even better, a pizza wheel to cut the dough as though you are slicing a cake into 12 equal triangles. The best way to do this is to slice into quarters, then each quarter into thirds. One at a time, roll each wedge starting from the wide, outside edge and working towards the point of the triangle, so that it looks like a miniature croissant. Put on the baking tray, spaced 3cm apart, then leave to rest in the fridge for about 30 minutes. When ready to bake, heat the oven to 200C (180C fan)/gas 6. For the glaze, crush the flaked almonds with a rolling pin into very fine pieces then combine in a small bowl with the cinnamon and sugar. Lightly brush the tops of the rugelach with the beaten egg, and sprinkle with the almond sugar mix. Bake for 20-25 minutes until golden brown all over, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. These will keep for about four days. Black treacle gingerbread Prep 30 min Chill 2 hr Cook 20 min Makes About 50 420g plain flour 1 ½ tsp baking powder ¼ tsp bicarbonate of/baking soda 2 tsp ground cinnamon 1 tsp each ground cloves, 1 tsp ground ginger, ground allspice ¼ tsp freshly grated nutmeg ½ tsp salt 125g unsalted butter, room temperature, cubed 200g light muscovado sugar 200g black treacle 1 egg, lightly whisked 30g candied orange peel (optional), finely chopped For the glaze 100g icing sugar, sifted 2 tbsp water (or rum) Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt into a bowl and set aside. Put the butter, sugar and treacle in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, and beat on a medium-high speed for about two minutes, scraping down the sides of the bowl a couple of times to ensure it is evenly mixed. Add the egg and beat to incorporate, then, on a low speed, add the candied peel (if using) and the dry ingredients. Mix until a dough comes together around the paddle, then tip out on to a clean, lightly floured worktop. Knead gently to bring together, then split roughly into two. Cover each half with a wet tea towel, then press gently to form flattish discs, put in the fridge for at least two hours and up to three days. When ready to bake, heat the oven to 195C (175C fan)/gas 5½ and line two oven trays with baking paper. Working with one piece of dough at a time, unwrap and put on a lightly floured worktop. Roll the disc out to 6-7mm thick, then use biscuit cutters to cut out shapes. Transfer to the lined trays, then bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. The biscuits will be crisp around the edges and slightly soft in the middle. While the biscuits are cooking, make the glaze by whisking together the icing sugar and water/rum). When done, remove the biscuits from the oven, leave to stand for two minutes, then brush with the glaze while the biscuits are still warm. Cool completely before wrapping. The biscuits will be crisp to begin with and will soften over time, and will keep for three weeks. • Helen Goh is co-author of Sweet (Ebury Press, £27) and product developer at Ottolenghi."

          "headline": "Britain's last EU commissioner: 'There isn't any pomp, but it is a moment'",
          "bodyText": "The cardboard boxes were packed and the photograph of the Queen is in bubble wrap. After a slight delay to Julian King’s scheduled departure day on 29 March, the 15th British commissioner to take a seat in the EU’s executive branch, and most likely the last, walked out out of the European commission’s Berlaymont headquarters in Brussels at midday with his belongings under his arm – including a couple of EU-branded cushions given by an impish Jean-Claude Juncker. The commission president had them delivered to King’s office after being unimpressed to learn of the union jack soft furnishings scattered on the Briton’s office sofa. “He is a good man,” King says fondly of Juncker. “I shall miss being hugged by my boss and even getting the occasional kiss.” Should Boris Johnson win a parliamentary majority in the early hours of 13 December, King’s exit will mark the end of a chapter in Britain’s relationship with the institutions of the European Union that began on the UK’s accession to the European Economic Community in 1973 and the dispatch of Winston Churchill’s son-in-law to sit at Brussels’ top table. The former Labour chancellor Roy Jenkins went on to lead the commission between 1977 and 1981. The Conservative cabinet minister Arthur Cockfield laid the foundations of today’s single market in the late 1980s and major political figures, including Leon Brittan, Neil Kinnock, Peter Mandelson and Chris Patten, played their roles through the decades as the UK shifted its focus from the old empire to a European partnership. The Labour peer Cathy Ashton was the first leader of the EU’s foreign affairs wing. But there is a new commission from this weekend, and the UK has not put forward a representative. The country’s place in the project is in its denouement. “And let’s be honest, it is not quite the pomp and ceremony of [Chris Patten] leaving Hong Kong,” King admitted, shortly before departing his bare office. “It is a lot more Saigon than Hong Kong, it really is. But it is a moment.” A career diplomat rather than a politician, King was not dealt an easy hand when strong-armed into leaving his post as ambassador to France in September 2016. He took over from Jonathan Hill, who had resigned as the commission’s financial services chief, at a time of high emotion and even anger in EU capitals in the immediate wake of the Brexit referendum. “[Juncker] said: ‘This is going to be difficult,’” King explained. “He said: ‘Look, there are quite a few people who are saying: “Why are we having a Brit? And if we have got to have a Brit, put them in a cupboard.” But I am not going to do that. We are going to do this properly.’” King was given the security brief, a new but increasingly significant portfolio following terror attacks in Paris and in the Belgian capital. The rise of cybercrime and the need to defend Europe’s future 5G network kept him occupied through the UK’s three Brexit extensions. “The last thing you wanted to be was hanging around like the ghost at the feast.” He also made one eye-catching intervention in British politics when Johnson dismissed as “humbug” the claims of female politicians that they were endangered by a hardening of the political rhetoric. “Crass and dangerous,” King had tweeted. “If you think extreme language doesn’t fuel political violence across Europe, including UK, then you’re not paying attention.” “I think you have to say if something is causing a problem,” King said. “So my observation was just that there is a link between the nature of mainstream political discourse and some of the ways that can be used and abused by more extreme opinion, and I stand by that. I always did my job.” King, previously ambassador to Ireland and one-time director general of the Northern Ireland Office, had no role to play in Brexit negotiations. But his advice was privately sought by Juncker during the commissioners’ discussions with the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, as to “what was behind a particular position and how different things were going to land if the commission took particular positions”. “Maybe that was helpful. I don’t know,” King said. “The historians will no doubt trawl all over this.” He certainly has views and concerns about the next chapter. The danger is that fundamental issues such as security and police cooperation could be left by the wayside in the rush for the political prize of a trade deal, he suggests. “Clearly, there is a very strong political impulse in the next stage as set out by the prime minister to move quickly, very quickly, in discussions on goods, especially. There is a certain amount of discussion about whether you can do a trade deal in 12 months – of course you can do something in 12 months. The question is what is it?” However those coming negotiations play out, the UK will not be leading in the EU’s decision-making bodies. King’s suite of offices is to be taken over by Thierry Breton, the French businessman chosen by Emmanuel Macron to oversee the internal market. Different political cultures are in the ascendancy. “He came round the other day for a look – I wasn’t here but some of the others were – and the first thing he said was: ‘I am not having all that glass,’” King said of the clear wall that had once allowed visitors a view of his offices from the corridor. “He said: ‘Oh, no, no. We are not having that. That’s far too much transparency.’ I came back this morning and there is a wall.” As for King, he is going to have that holiday he booked for 29 March. “You don’t have regrets – you move on.”"

          "headline": "Heartache in golf shoes: how Odd Future brought fresh energy to rap",
          "bodyText": "Last year, the three most streamed artists across the globe on Spotify were all North American rappers – Drake, Post Malone and XXXTentacion – the culmination of a decade in which rap became the world’s dominant pop music. It’s a genre now so wide and plural that sweeping statements about it become nonsensical, and so many figures in the last decade have helped move it to its current place in the firmament: the DIY spirit and uncontained impulses of Lil B; the monolithic repetitive one-bar melodies of Chief Keef; Nicki Minaj’s weaponising of drama and persona. The scene’s biggest star, Drake, is interestingly both highly influential and heavily influenced. But one rap collective is a case study in how the genre flourished, expanded and culturally dominated this decade, and also functions as a Seven Up-type social experiment in seeing people grow in real time. Odd Future – or Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All to give their full name – emerged as teenagers from Los Angeles in 2008, in a hail of encrusted tube socks and profanity. After a flurry of group mixtapes, its members grew up and amicably became independent of one another, just as groups of teenagers are wont to do. Various artists from their number would go on to release some of the best rap, funk and R&amp;B music of the period – Frank Ocean, Tyler the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Syd – and others, such as Domo Genesis and MellowHype, put out future cult classics. Normalised to the always-on broadcasting of social media and the droll surrealism of meme culture, they carved out new space for rap, becoming the bards of the confessional impulse that gripped our culture from Twitter to reality TV. The first time I saw them live was the first time anyone in the UK had seen them: their first London gig in 2010, in the basement of the Stoke Newington pub where I worked. I let myself downstairs and all I remember is a hail of limbs; everyone on stage seemed to be like one of those flappy inflatable humans you see outside car showrooms. Here and on record, they were being powered by the same batteries that juiced up Jackass, or punk, or anything else that has historically annoyed parents. This energy fed the genius of Tyler, the Creator, the group’s central MC. His early work sounds like it’s coming from a mouth with just the faintest hint of a sly grin curling up at the sides – he dares you to think he’s being serious. It’s the deadpan cruelty of a kid too advanced for the rest of his class, and even the teacher. As well as playing up, he shows off – there is a brilliant musicality to his Ren and Stimpy vision of sex on French!, for instance: “I guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber / And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers / Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba / This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp”. Unfortunately for him, Theresa May’s Home Office banned him from the country, a decision that led to feverish excitement on his eventual return, and an edge of outlaw danger. The lurid gross-out vibe had previously worked for Eminem, who similarly spiked his tracks with comic ultraviolence, and whose whiteness made him that much more relatable (or, depressingly, palatable) to the large white audiences in the US and UK – no travel ban for him, of course. Odd Future were black, but sat closer to the traditionally white-majority space of skate culture than mainstream rap – and they were “moving from middle to upper class”, as Syd would soon rap. The “super rich kids” Earl Sweatshirt complains of on the Frank Ocean song of the same name are a class above him, but he’s still in their bratty orbit. The glamorous underclass violence and sheer otherness of gangsta rap had been alluring to ogling white audiences, but here was something even more enticing: authentic for being black, accessible for existing in middle-class white spaces, and saying crude, funny, clever things. This blend attracted a cult following, which was swiftly monetised through the kind of hypebeast-streetwear merch (branded Golf Wang, a play on Wolf Gang) that tends to be bought by those with a considerable disposable income. Sure enough, when I next saw Tyler perform, this time in London’s Roundhouse, sat behind me were five white pubescent boys all wearing Supreme caps in different designs. It’s a tension that Odd Future noticed: the cerebral Earl Sweatshirt complained of being “too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks” on his track, Chum, while the hornier Tyler fretted on Bastard: “I’m tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck / Drunk white girls the only way I’ll get my dick sucked.” These jaded half-boasts also point to another key part of Odd Future’s appeal: vulnerability. You could probably plot their rugged, slapdash production and fiendishly clever, free-ranging flow in a line with Wu-Tang Clan or MF Doom, but you’d rarely hear those artists be as confessional as Odd Future’s members. There was plenty of hip-hop’s boastfulness, but various other rap cliches were nowhere to be seen, be they luxury brands and cars at one end, or guns on the other. Some filed them alongside the schlocky violence of horrorcore rap, but Tyler rejected this. For years America had focused on its feelings, from expensive therapy to TV shows such as My So-Called Life and Dawson’s Creek, whose plots were driven entirely by remarkably articulate expressions of emotion (and seemed as exotic to Brits as US gangsta rap). Blogging and social media allowed this impulse to flow naturally, and Odd Future came of age during this time when it became normal, even expected, for you to spill your inner life into a public realm. Tyler even used the framing device of a therapy session – another middle-class trope – to give structure to his diatribes against his absent father and his new urges. Indeed, daddy issues were a notable theme. Tyler was unrepentant: “Fuck a deal, I just want my father’s email / So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail”, but Earl was more even-handed: “I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest / When honestly I miss this nigga”. A later Earl track, Playing Possum, extended an olive branch by poetically weaving speeches by his parents over each other – tragically, his father died before he could hear it. Earl’s radical emotional transparency is essayed in the very way he raps, his words endlessly rolling over line breaks, the sound of that constant spill. One line sums it up: “Say goodbye to my openness, total eclipse / Of my shine that I’ve grown to miss when holding shit in” – a paradoxical admission, being candid about staying silent, knowing that his candour is both soothing and the source of his creative “shine”. The rhyme scheme, as ever, has a casual perfection. This frankness, and willingness to explore one’s interior life, extended to sexuality. Rap has often been homophobic, with plenty of use of the other F-word – one of the buttons that Tyler himself pushed, reasoning that “it hits” – and as recently as 2017 you had mainstream stars such as Offset claiming he was unaware of the homophobia in his line “I cannot vibe with queers”. But Syd, once Odd Future’s DJ and then a solo artist and member of cosmic funk band the Internet, was out and proud – it was refreshing to have her bedroom-R&amp;B solo record be so open about lesbian sex. At one point she coos admiringly, with that aforementioned yuppie aspiration, at a woman who “drive a Beemer and she got it on her own”. Tyler has gone from being accused of homophobia to sort-of coming out with a jokey tweet, dropping in lines such as “I’ve been kissing white boys since 2004” and eventually writing an entire album, Igor, about a love affair with a man. His unwillingness to put a neat bow on his sexuality chimes with a world where, in the UK, 54% of 18 to 24-year-olds say they are not 100% heterosexual, and his playful lack of clarity is testament to the messiness of that journey for many people. It is all uncharted territory for him, indeed for hip-hop; it is impossible to quantify, but it feels as if he is influencing this sexual culture as much as it is influencing him. You could say the same for Frank Ocean. Mainstream male R&amp;B can be even more heteronormative than rap, with the likes of Luther Vandross closeted by music that acts as a lubricant for sex in a majority-straight culture; as Ocean himself said in 2012: “In black music, we’ve got so many leaps and bounds to make with acceptance and tolerance”. But Ocean broke the rules, not just for what a male R&amp;B musician could be, but also of the genre itself. Like Tyler, he is part of a generation less inclined to label themselves, never describing himself as gay or bisexual – “life is dynamic”, he once said – but singing candidly of love and sex with men. Is this resistance, even subconsciously, borne out of fear of rejection by their audiences? That’s perhaps a reach; more interesting is how that resistance to being boxed in also shapes their music. Ocean is the great poet of modern R&amp;B and Odd Future’s most revered member of all, with his album, Blonde, rightly being canonised as the finest of the decade. Its impressionistic daubs sit outside genre concerns altogether; it is “rhythm and blues” in those words’ most pure, literal sense. The album as a whole has a rhythm, is a rhythm; there are blues in the sense of different sadnesses, different shades, from inky midnights to duck-egg mornings, and of course he plays the blues, too. Tyler meanwhile now sings as well as raps, and Igor, adding to the cosmic-boogie leanings of previous records, is essentially a neo-soul album. At his UK comeback gigs, thousands of people were singing “don’t leave, it’s my fault” along with Tyler, certainly an oddity at a rap show. With his Flower Boy album, stoner humour, and the bucolic vibes of some of the Golf Wang clothing (such as a hoodie reading Save the Bees) there’s a strain of Cali psychedelia, too. Praising skate brand Fucking Awesome, Tyler once said, resisting definition: “I think that vibe defines my music. It’s not rap, it’s not jazz – it’s Fucking Awesome!” The arrival of social media and interconnectedness perhaps informed not just Odd Future’s emotional candour, but their tastes, and they typify the cultural omnivorousness of their generation, who – outside the intense tribalism of stan culture – are normalised to liking a bit of everything, because there’s always a bit of everything on offer. This permissiveness, where everything can be cool if you say it is, has dissolved irony, and Tyler is the perfect example of that too: his fondness for jauntily dapper suits and golf clothing is sarcastic and sincere all at the same time. In their punk energy, blithe attitude to sex, and their willingness to be vulnerable and confessional, Odd Future’s merry, messy band have been a definitive force in rap this decade, using their charisma and business nous to bring the underground and overground together just as digital culture was also erasing all the old cultural borders. What’s most startling is how young they still are. “Feeling rushed, grew up quick / Trip around the sun, this my 25th,” Earl raps on the excellent recent mini-album Feet of Clay. He also admits: “Sunny day but I’m cooking inside / Muddy path but I’m taking my time.” They’ve spent more than ten years churning up the ground behind them, cooking inside, and there’s still so much more ahead."

          "bodyText": "Well, that has been quite the day! There will be a few rough heads from the government side early tomorrow morning, methinks. Because even if you don’t drink, you’d probably want to take it up after those last few days. A week is a long time in politics and next week the government could be in a completely different position. But for right now, Labor MPs return back to their electorates secure they have had a small win. They’ll all be back on Monday though, with medevac the big legislative ticket item. The Angus Taylor issue will still be ticking over. As will the fallout from One Nation’s last minute switch on IR. Make sure you check back on the Guardian for the latest on all of that over the next few days – you’ll have all the news and analysis you would need until the blog is back for the final sitting week on Monday. Sadly, I will not be with you. I have been called away on personal business, meaning I will miss the final week. It’s not goodbye though – I’ll be back on the blog in February when parliament returns for 2020. Let me just say though this year, it has been an absolute pleasure and honour to steer the politics live ship. You guys make turning up to work a dream. As do the entire Canberra team – Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp – and the rest of the Guardian brains trust. I am truly sorry I miss the final week of 2019 batshit insanity, but I will be with you in spirit. And I know that Chris Knaus will take very good care of you all for the final four sitting days. I hope you all have a wonderful holiday period and summer. I hope your Christmas, if that’s your thing, is full of love and laughter. I hope you get time doing the things and seeing the people who make you shine. You can find me on the socials if you need to send me any missives. Thank you for a wonderful year. And please – take care of you. “Scott Morrison has been a marketing man, not a governor,” says Malcolm Roberts. He wants the government to “start governing”. Jacqui Lambie has now released a statement on ensuring integrity: I’ve been very clear from the start. Thugs like John Setka should not be allowed to hold office in their union. He has to go. I’ve always said he has to go. I said I’d vote for a bill that would get rid of John Setka and put the CFMEU on notice. The government didn’t want to work with me to get the bill to that final form. If the government really wanted to get rid of Setka they wouldn’t have drafted the bill like this. They would have backed amendments that would have lined him up and taken him down. They would have supported my amendments. They had the chance to. But they didn’t because they were too cocky that they’d get their win without me. Well, guess what. Look where that gets you. Let me be crystal clear – the decision to not get rid of John Setka wasn’t mine. It was the government who decided to let him off with a warning. The government amendments would have left him there with a clean slate and a blemish-free record. They would have given him a 10-year window to just play nice and go with grace. That’s not something I am going to abide by. And without my amendments, I had to decide whether to support a bill that both wouldn’t remove Setka and would throw every other well-behaved union under the bus. I had to make a call whether to support a bill that makes out like teachers, nurses and fireys are as bad as the CFMEU. It puts the bloody Musicians’ Union of Australia in the same camp as the ETU for goodness sake! There’s no need to put everyone in the firing line. My amendments would have applied serious penalties to serious conduct. The bad guys would have been taken out. But the good guys would be spared. I gave the government the chance to support amendments that protect good unionists and line up bad ones. They said no, we’ll go it alone, and they lost. Now there’s nothing. And thanks to the Coalition’s bloody-minded arrogance, they have nothing to show for their work. Criminal officials bring their union into disrepute. These people don’t deserve to have a leadership role in a union. By being there, they undermine the union movement and they actually hurt union members. I’m the only person in this place who had proposed realistic solutions to address these problems. I gave the government a chance. I put together amendments that hit the worst offenders and spared the overwhelming majority of union members and officials who aren’t big bloody thugs. They said no. They didn’t want to bother. They lost out. Finally, I have a message to the broader union movement that I stood up for today – it’s time they cleaned house! “My vote and my opinion will never be based on that...no way in the wide world,” Pauline Hanson says, when asked if this was about the upcoming Queensland election. “If you think that, then you don’t know this lady,” Malcolm Roberts says. Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts are holding a press conference. She says it is all about the workers. “Especially this week, when Westpac had 23m breaches...and Scott Morrison said ‘this is not for us to deal with’...it wasn’t good enough.” “I just feel that it is not fair on the Australian people. This is a warning shot across the bows of the unions and the Australian government.” Hanson says the unions need to “clean up your act”. And the government: “Clean up the white collar crime, go after the banking officials and prove to the people of Australia that you are here for everyone.” Tony Burke has issued a statement: Scott Morrison’s anti-worker union-bashing laws have been defeated in the Senate – and should now be abandoned. These were extreme laws that would have given the government unprecedented powers, unparalleled anywhere in the developed world, to sack union officials and shut down entire unions for minor breaches. The government arrogantly believed they had this vote in the bag – but the Senate has delivered them a humiliating rejection. This was a week in which Scott Morrison sought to impose standards on unions that he refused to impose on banks or members of his own Cabinet. Throughout this debate, Labor has been proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Australian workers and the unions that represent them. From the largest unions like the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation to the smallest volunteer-run unions – Labor stood with them to resist this attack on their capacity to organise. These are the organisations that fight for higher wages, combat wage theft and exploitation and keep workers safe. Labor thanks the crossbenchers who voted with us to oppose these dangerous and extreme laws. But while this bill has been defeated, workers should not rest easy. This has always been two-stage attack from the government. This year, the government has gone after the organisations that represent, protect and fight for workers. Starting next year, they will come after workers’ pay and conditions directly. The Liberals are already talking about watering down unfair dismissal laws and scrapping the Better Off Overall Test. Just a small point - Queensland goes to the polls in October next year. Can’t imagine Pauline Hanson would have been too happy with a union campaign being run against her, with the parliament looking like heading to another minority, given the Palaszczuk government run lately. Even a whiff of holding the balance of power in a home state can be enough. And here is the whole statement from Pauline Hanson on why she switched sides in the final moment: Pauline Hanson has spoken: Penny Wong on Christian Porter saying he will working on bringing the vote back: “If he does bang his chest and brings this forward next week, my question would be ‘what’s changed?’” That moment you realise it has all gone wrong. If you go frame by frame on the tape, you can see the exact moment the heart breaks The Senate has moved on to its adjournment debate. Seems time this had a run again The government was aware that Jacqui Lambie was a no, after it rejected her amendments. But it didn’t think that mattered, because with One Nation, they had one more vote than it needed. Eggs in the hand and all that. It is understood that One Nation confirmed its support for the amendments as recently as today. But the government did notice that the unions did go quiet on social media today. Apparently Pauline Hanson has not yet explained herself to the government. This has been a pretty big win for Penny Wong, and Anthony Chisholm (who often does a lot of negotiations with the crossbench) as well. Michele O’Neil says “we have been talking constructively with senator Hanson, but we did not know the final vote”. Michele O’Neil says the unions have been talking to all the crossbenchers. “We are convinced not just the time we have spent talking to them, but all the thousands of people who contacted them, made the difference.” But she adds that they weren’t sure of the vote until it happened. Asked about the government bringing back the bill, O’Neil says, “Well, if they want to be humiliated twice, they should do that.” Michele O’Neil says the bill’s defeat is a “victory for democracy”. “It is the efforts of ordinary workers who have defeated this bill,” she says. She also thanks the crossbenchers – Jacqui Lambie and One Nation for “taking the time” to listen to concerns and defeat the bill. Sally McManus says she has a message for Scott Morrison: “Don’t underestimate working people ... they don’t like double standards.” So many headlines are being re-written right now. Which is why we have sentences like “the Morrison government has secured a shock defeat on industrial relations, with a bill cracking down on rogue unions failing in the Senate.” Christian Porter has released a statement: Obviously I am very disappointed in the result in the Senate. It’s for Pauline Hanson to explain why she voted against a bill that met every requirement she sought through extensive consultation. This is important reform which seeks to ensure that registered organisations obey the law. It is as simple as that. We remain committed to this reform and will be seeking to reintroduce the bill at an appropriate time. This is a pretty big troll. The Greens are the first cab off the rank about the government’s loss on ensuring integrity. From Adam Bandt: “This is a victory for working Australians and for Australia’s democracy. This is a victory for the power of organising and of everyday people power. We have a government who is determined to limit the power of workers and their unions and reduce their ability to stand up to the powerful, but today, they lost. If this government was really committed to integrity, then we would have a federal anti-corruption watchdog to hold politicians to account. Instead, the prime minister is prepared to let a minister continue to serve while being investigated by the police. This government has no integrity when it comes to integrity. The Australians Greens will always stand up for unions and working Australians in their effort to fight for higher wages and better working conditions. The Greens are proud to stand alongside the union movement and Australian workers in celebrating this victory.” Sally McManus and Michele O’Neil will hold a press conference at 5.30. That’s been a heck of a campaign. To be even clearer - that bill was meant to be the government’s one guaranteed win this week. And then... One Nation just voted with Labor, the Greens and Jacqui Lambie to block the Ensuring Integrity bill. It wasn’t a mistake. Liberal senators were staring at their phones trying to work out what had happened. Labor and Greens senators cheered - and one bitter Coalition senator shouted out “thanks Malcolm [Roberts]” across the chamber. On my way back to the Guardian office I saw a clearly shocked Labor senator Catryna Bilyk profusely thanking Hanson and Roberts. Hanson said that One Nation “votes on merit”. As we’re not allowed to interview people in the corridor I asked if Hanson would like to invite me into her office to explain. She declined. Paul Karp says One Nation knew what they doing - and they deliberately sat with the government. So the government could bring it back to a vote - a tie means that the status quo remains, but the government can bring it back. Again - what even is today. So just to be clear - One Nation switched its vote at the final hurdle and the bill was defeated. The Senate is dividing on the question that the bill as amended be agreed to. Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts are voting with Labor, the Greens and Jacqui Lambie! It was tied 34-34 - so the question was negated. Labor and Greens clap. We see it but we don’t believe it. Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts just sat with Labor to oppose the Ensuring Integrity Bill. Final vote: Ayes – 34 Noes – 34 That means that the Bill has a tied vote has NOT passed. Moving off Greens amendments to government ones – at first it looked like Pauline Hanson and Malcolm Roberts were split on one set. But the vote was re-run and Anne Ruston dispatched to explain what was what. Both One Nation senators (and Centre Alliance) voted with the government – a pattern which, if it continues, will see the bill pass. Then came Jacqui Lambie amendments, which are designed to ensure unions are not deregistered for taking industrial action; and to ask for a review of the bill after 12 months. Here One Nation were split – with Hanson voting with Labor and the Greens, and Roberts voting with the government. Still, Lambie lost the vote 35 to 33. The last of the ensuring integrity amendments are being voted on. Once this is done, the third reading vote will be held. Then it goes back to the house to be agreed upon with the amendments. Then it goes back to the Senate for one last time. Then once it passes there (which it will, because the crossbench is on board) it just needs royal assent, and then it’s law. Voting has started on a series of amendments to the Coalition’s bill to facilitate deregistration of unions and disqualification of their officials. We’ll get a series of votes on amendments then a final vote at the third reading stage to pass the bill. First up is the Greens amendments, the most controversial of which stipulates the law will not come into effect until after the establishment of a National Integrity Commission. The first Greens amendment – raising the threshold of demerit points for deregistration – was voted down 36 to 32. Jacqui Lambie voted with the Greens and Labor in favour; Centre Alliance voted with the government against. I can’t see Pauline Hanson or Malcolm Roberts in the chamber. Labor has put together what it says is the four times Scott Morrison has misled the house in the past 24 hours: Morrison’s misattribution of a radio talkback host quote to a Victorian police officer (which he wrote to the House and corrected), accusing Labor of gagging debate on veterans when it was about the Naif (although Phil Thompson did mention veteran suicides) claiming Labor voted against the second reading of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill (Labor voted for it) and then correcting the record by saying Labor voted against the third reading of that bill (when Labor voted for it). Angus Taylor has responded to Labor’s rejection of the pair: I sought a pair to attend the International Energy Agency’s conference in Paris to finalise discussions with counterparts to address fuel security issues in Australia. At this meeting I was planning to further discussions with the US about access to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and push Australia’s case to modernise the IEA’s outdated rules that disproportionately affect Australia due to its geographic remoteness. Labor have rejected that pair – they are clearly not serious about fuel security and protecting Australia’s interests. Ensuring integrity is about to get back under way in the Senate. Today, the Greens MP and justice spokesperson David Shoebridge has referred the NSW police commissioner to the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission as a result of his disclosures to the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about an ongoing police investigation into the emissions reduction minister, Angus Taylor. Here is an excerpt of the referral: There are two significant concerns that arise as a result of this. This first is that Commissioner Fuller either knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that Prime Minister Morrison and Minister Taylor were close political colleagues. Given this, it was highly inappropriate for Commissioner Fuller to be disclosing any details of the police investigation into Mr Taylor to Prime Minister Morrison other than those that were on the public record. It goes without saying that Prime Minister Morrison has a vested political interest in the police investigation failing to find any misconduct by his Minister. The second significant concern arises from the personal relationship between Commissioner Fuller and Prime Minister Morrison and the fact that this relationship constitutes a clear conflict of interest on the part of Commissioner Fuller. This relationship includes, according to Commissioner Fuller, having been neighbours during which time Morrison would collect his rubbish bins for him. The exact nature of this relationship now appears to be contested by the two men in their very recent public debate. Shoebridge said: No one, not the prime minister and not the police commissioner, is above the law and people in high office are expected to abide by high standards. We have referred this matter to the LECC because it is a genuinely independent and non-partisan body that’s job is to investigate these kinds of matters. We cannot allow any political interference in a police investigation and both the police commissioner and the prime minister should have known better. Our colleague Naaman Zhou has just spoken to David Shoebridge, who says he has referred Mick Fuller to the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission over the phone call with Scott Morrison regarding the Angus Taylor investigation. Shoebridge is referring Fuller under section 10 of the LECC Act for serious misconduct. “Commissioner Fuller either knew, or reasonably ought to have known, that Prime Minister Morrison and Minister Taylor were close political colleagues. Given this, it was highly inappropriate for Commissioner Fuller to be disclosing any details of the police investigation into Mr Taylor to Prime Minister Morrison.” Shoebridge also claimed there was a conflict of interest between Fuller and Morrison because of the “personal relationship” the pair have previously spoken of, and being neighbours (or bin-gate) which they now claim was a joke. The talks go from 2 December to 13 December – so Angus Taylor could still attend the tail end, if he so wished. Labor received a request earlier this week to pair Angus Taylor for Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday next week, so he could attend United Nation-led climate talks in Paris and Madrid. Labor wrote back today to say no – the reason being it doesn’t think it is appropriate that a minister under police investigation should be granted leave, when there are still questions to be answered. Marise Payne who is going to the same talks, has been granted a pair (as is precedent). The government now needs to decide whether Taylor misses the talks or loses a number. The matter of public importance begins – it is on robodebt and is being led by Bill Shorten – and Tim Wilson starts non-stop heckling about the number of Labor MPs who have left the chamber (there are still more Labor MPs in the chamber than Coalition MPs though). “Will you shut up,” someone from Labor yells. Andrew Giles appeals to the deputy speaker, pointing at Wilson, but Wilson seems to get bored of his own steam and wanders off. Anthony Albanese associates the opposition with the comments of Darren Chester about the need to do more on veteran suicide. Tony Pasin is muttering loudly about the “disrespect” Labor showed earlier. Scott Morrison adds his words and thoughts to the question. He calls an end to question time, but moves to correct the record first and says that Labor voted against the “third reading” of the defence force homes legislation. He walks out of the chamber as Labor goes nuts, calling Morrison a liar. They can’t bring Morrison back in, because question time is over, so Albanese makes a personal explanation. The prime minister has suggested that I as leader of Labor and the rest of my team voted against the second reading of the legislation, we did not, he just suggested we voted against the third reading, we did not.” It is pretty extraordinary – the votes are a matter of public record. Labor loses its bid, and the house returns to its seats. We have at least one more dixer. The folders are stacked and the phone has been placed on top, so hopefully Scott Morrison just has one more question in mind. The dixer is from Phil Thompson on veteran suicides. The Labor benches are s i l e n t as Darren Chester speaks. In the most shocking news this week, Tony Pasin has avoided the front bench in this division. Luke Howarth is there though. Karen Andrews and Clint Eastwood’s imaginary Obama sit next to Angus Taylor. We get to the final division, where they swap sides. Or as Tony Pasin thinks of it “frontbench time”. The screen which shows what the procedure is on the floor of the house just said: “That the member be no longer hard” following Mark Butler’s contribution, which caused a lot of mirth on the floor of the chamber. Marise Payne, representing the attorney general, has just made a statement about the mysterious imprisonment of Witness J. Payne said that court orders prevent publication of information about the case and the orders were made with the consent of the parties. “In any legal proceedings the commonwealth attorney general or other parties can seek orders to protect sensitive information. It is always at the discretion of the court whether to make such orders.” Nick McKim took note of the answer: “In the 21st century there is a person who has been secretly charged, secretly sentenced and secretly imprisoned in Australia ... “When asked to provide further information, the attorney general’s representative has refused or been unable to provide further information. This is a shocking example of secrecy and abuse of state power, and our descent into a police state. “Open justice is critical to the rule of law, which in turn is critical to our democracy.” McKim concludes by suggesting Australia is now an “authoritarian state” and calling for a bill of rights. Mood The motion I seek leave to move the following motion — That the House notes that this week: detectives from the NSW Police Force’s State Crime Command Financial Crimes Squad launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate whether the Minister for Emissions Reduction committed a crime; the prime minister refused to stand down the minister while the subject of a criminal investigation notwithstanding the Ministerial Standards; the prime minister called the NSW Police Commissioner and discussed the nature, substance and instigation of the criminal investigation; former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, former NSW ICAC Commissioner David Ipp QC, and former NSW ICAC Counsel Assisting Geoffrey Watson SC have criticised the prime minister’s call; the prime minister misled the House while defending the deliberate misleading of the House by the minister and refused to apologise and correct the record; the prime minister failed to answer questions about his conduct, or the conduct of the Minister, and prevented Parliament debating this scandal 20 times; and therefore, the House calls on the prime minister to: acknowledge the Minister for Emissions Reduction deliberately misled the House; acknowledge the prime minister’s decision to call the NSW police commissioner was inappropriate; correct the record in person and apologise for misleading the House on Wednesday; correct the record in person and apologise for misleading the House today by claiming the opposition voted against the second reading of the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill 2019 when it supported it; undertake to fully cooperate with the NSW Police Force criminal investigation; and stand down the minister for emissions reduction. Would really like someone to unchain my heart from my love of politics at this stage. Labor is now moving to suspend standing orders in question time for what is the third day in a row. Former foreign minister Julie Bishop spoke at lunchtime in Sydney at the Centre for Independent Studies, on “Waking up to the China Challenge”. She said she was asked “almost daily” about the choice Australia was allegedly confronted with, a choice between China (the trade relationship) and the US (the security alliance). Bishop argued it was a false dichotomy. “We back ourselves, our interests, our values, our principles. We always choose Australia.” “I do believe Australia can continue to maintain its relationship with China while remaining an ally of the US.” Asked about self-declared Chinese “spy” Wang Liqiang, who this week outed himself in the Australian media as he seeks asylum, Bishop said she would not rush to judgement. “I understand that Asio and security agencies are working hard to establish the veracity of the allegations. The fact that he has sought to out himself raises fascinating questions. In my experience, if there were truly a spy, from any nation, that person would be enveloped within our intelligence community and would be nowhere near the media.” Barely half a kilometre away at the Lowy Institute, at the same time, Bishop’s erstwhile colleague, former prime minister Tony Abbott was speaking about ... China. He told the audience there Australia’s China choice was becoming more difficult as the country grew more and more assertive. “It was much easier to avoid hard choices when China appeared to be liberalising,” he said, citing its militarisation of the South China Sea, its repression and imprisonment of members of the Uyghur minority, and President Xi’s consolidation of power. Abbott said when a country’s biggest trading partner was also its greatest strategic challenge “living with trouble has to be taken for granted ... we will need to become less starry-eyed about the Chinese government”. If only there was a way MPs could enter information into some sort of internet search engine thing and find the answer to questions they yell out in QT. Scott Morrison: As I assured the House earlier this week, the government of course will cooperate fully with the New South Wales police investigation and as I said, Mr Speaker, we will wait for that investigation and if there are any further matters for me to consider at that time of course I will. The matters I was invited to address earlier this week by the leader of the opposition was the application of the ministerial standards and I addressed myself to those issues in the way I outlined to the House. That’s where the matter stands now. I note in the matters - that the leader of the opposition has raised with me, he has established this principle which says that when a member, when a minister, a senior member of my team, Mr Speaker, who is the subject of an investigation that they should, Mr Speaker, immediately have to stand aside. And I note that that was not a standard that the Labor party pursued when they were in government. I note that it is not a standard that they have sought to apply in opposition when members of their own frontbench, Mr Speaker, have been the subject of police investigation for very serious issues in the past, that has not been the cause for those members to stand aside. What is clear now is the leader of the opposition today was not prepared to apply the same standard that he seeks of the government to his own frontbenchers. He refused to apply this standard to his own frontbenchers. That’s called a hypocrite. That’s called a hypocrite Mr Speaker. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: I refer to the Strike Force Garrad investigation and to a report that just before 2pm it has taken copies of correspondence and the metadata showing details of any alterations from the City of Sydney website relating to travel and the suggestions from the minister for emissions reduction. Has the government also provided all relevant emails, documents, text messages, phone records, data, metadata and encrypted messages to the New South Wales police and will it ... “How do you know that,” comes from the government backbench, including Tim Wilson. Oh I don’t know? Perhaps because it is in the public domain? Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: My question again is to the minister for emissions reduction. On 24 October the minister told the House, and I quote, ‘The document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney’s website. It was publicly available.’ A claim he repeated in a written statement tabled in the parliament on Monday and stood by in his previous answer today. Does the minister stand by his statement on 24 October? There is a lot of back and forth over whether or not Taylor should answer this question. We eventually get to him returning to the despatch box. Tony Smith looks like he is going to be chewing panadol like peanuts after this session. Taylor: Yes, I do stand by that statement, and I remind those opposite that I said in that statement, ‘I reject absolutely the suggestion that I or any members of my staff altered the documents in question.’ But the Labor party has, in typical fashion, dramatically overreached by claiming these documents were forged or altered. The Labor party has a track record of using police referrals as a political tool, Mr Speaker. Albanese points out that Taylor himself has apologised over the wrong figures. But we move on. Ed Husic has just been told to “just end the conversation with yourself”. Husic takes it with good grace. I mean, at least it was a conversation with someone he liked. Here is the the bit the prime minister is talking about, in terms of shutting down Phil Thompson’s contribution: Phil Thompson: I’d like to start by addressing some of the falsehoods that the shadow minister decided to throw around just previously, and then I’ll talk on this bill as well as suicide prevention, and that all comes into the cost pressures, especially in north Queensland. We’re talking about the NAIF, and I found it quite ironic that someone from the south-east corner would be sitting across from me, pointing and saying that we’re not doing anything in the north. Shayne Neumann: What would you know? PT: Maybe you should stay in your patch, mate. Because the NAIF has rolled out some projects within north Queensland which include at JCU and at the airport – and the JCU did take quite a while to get over the line because the Labor state government decided to put up roadblocks because that’s how it works. It’s OK, I’m happy to educate the shadow minister on how the NAIF works a little bit later, because that’s not why we’re here. We are here to talk about the prime minister’s and Minister Chester’s announcement that we would extend the eligibility – Deputy speaker: The member for Herbert will resume his seat. Michelle Rowland: I move: That the Member be no longer heard. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Has the minister or his office had any communication from the prime minister or the prime minister’s office about the content of the phone call between the prime minister and the New South Wales police commissioner on Tuesday? Taylor: I’ve said to the prime minister what I have said to the House. And I will remind those opposite - I’ll remind those opposite that I made a statement... And I stand by the statement that I made - that I tabled in the House earlier and I have nothing to add to it. Now, as I have said repeatedly to the House, I reject absolutely the suggestion that I or any members of my staff altered the documents in question. Butler jumps up on relevancy, but Tony Smith tells him he has wasted his point of order. Taylor, thinking he has had a win comes back, but badly misjudges the speaker’s mood: This is a pathetic, outrageous accusation by those opposite. We know exactly what this is about. It’s about distracting us from our strong focus on delivering a better deal ... I’ll say to the minister. I’m pleased to report that according to the ABS we’ve had the first ever ... Tony Smith: The minister will – he’s now straying beyond the question. The minister needs to be directly relevant to the question. The question did not ask about ABS figures or anything of the like so the minister needs to be directly relevant or resume his seat. Taylor, looking a lot like how baby Amy did after getting caught giving my baby sister a haircut (it was eventually evened out after a few subsequent haircuts) returns to the despatch box. “Those opposite are all smear and no idea.” Christian Porter is vying for “best dramatic performance of union thuggery” and you know what, I think he might have it. Anthony Albanese to Tony Smith, seeking to table Hansard: “I seek leave to table the Hansard that shows that the member for Herbert was talking about NAIF, Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and attacking the Palaszczuk government. Not talking...[about suicide] Smith: I understand the point the leader of the opposition’s trying to make but I’m not going to allow Hansard to be tabled. I mean, there is nothing more accessible than Hansard as the leader of the opposition has shown. Christian Porter: Well, you know on this occasion we’d probably be willing to provide leave to table Hansard given that what the member said was ‘Then I will talk on this bill as well as suicide prevention.’ So table away. [Imagine the mic drop here] Ed Husic: “It would have been better if you did Blue Steel. Smith [using his best exasperated dad voice] Sorry, I don’t think anyone was listening. I’m not having Hansard tabled. We move on. Mark Butler to Scott Morrison: (Butler’s brow is still appropriately furrowed for those playing at home) Did the prime minister or his office brief Phil Coorey from the Australian Financial Review that, and I quote, ‘Morrison reported back to the House that he was not standing Taylor aside basically because Fuller told him the investigation was not much more than a phone call to Moore’s office.’ Morrison: I refer the member to my response that I tabled in this House ... as to the nature of my call with the Commissioner of police and I refer them also to the statements made by the commissioner about the contents of that call. Mr Speaker, once again, that is the 64th time I think that the – those opposite have asked questions about that – this matter. That is four times the number of questions they have asked on drought and drought policy in this chamber since the election. Mr Speaker, it’s more questions than they’ve asked on the economy, it’s more than they’ve asked on childcare. They’ve asked two questions on national security, three on education, six on health, but 64 on this matter. You know what it says about the leader of the opposition? He’s more interested in the political games of Canberra than he is the real issues that the people of Australia voted for us to focus on. And we’re totally focused on those. Mr Speaker, I’m not distracted by the desperate political games by the leader of the opposition. The leader of the opposition would be the Manager of Opposition Business than he would be the prime minister. Because he’d rather engage himself in all the silly little games and tantrums and sooking and sulking that we have seen from this leader of the opposition. Mr Speaker, but all of that comes to naught when you compare it with the depth of the tactics he stooped to today by silencing a veteran of this country. Senate question time has been all Angus Taylor all the time. Mathias Cormann stuck by Taylor and read a long list of his achievements - a list which did not include reducing emissions, despite him being the minister for emissions reduction. Then Labor switches tack to Simon Birmingham - querying why he had said on the ABC that Taylor sourced the erroneous document from the City of Sydney website, but in the Senate he said only that that is what Taylor has advised. Murray Watt started singing The Wheels on the Bus (Go Round and Round), in reference to his belief Birmingham’s earlier answer had thrown Taylor under the bus. Birmingham said he received briefings from Taylor, and repeated that he was advised it was sourced from the City of Sydney website. “They can continue to ask again and they’re going to get the same answer again.” Labor’s Penny Wong then asked who doctored the document, and Birmingham rejected the premise because “according to Mr Taylor” it was downloaded from the council website. Wong makes much of the fact he won’t say in parliament that he doesn’t know who doctored it. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. How can the prime minister claim that the opposition made no objection to his statement that he would call the New South Wales police commissioner about the substance of Strike Force Garrad into one of his cabinet ministers when the prime minister has prevented the Parliament debating this deepening scandal 20 times this week. Morrison: I’m sorry to have offended the precious sensitivities of the leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker. On the issue of gag motions, Mr Speaker, that he has raised in his question. The one thing the leader of the opposition should apologise for is by running the sort of political game tactics we have seen on display this week and in its worst form today where the leader of the opposition voted to gag a veteran of this country who was seeking to speak about veteran suicide in this country. He was on the top of the list of those who vetted to gag that member. But it wasn’t only that. The very bill he was speaking on was about the defence service homes amendment bill which expands eligibility for the defence service homes insurance scheme to current and former members of the Australian Defence Force. Mr Speaker, on the second reading, they voted against this bill. The only people who should be apologising in this chamber is the leader of the Labor party. For his grubby political games. Labor points out it did not vote against the bill, but the prime minister has concluded his answer. So many chains to pull. So little time. It’s a small point, and I am sure a lot of people would argue semantics, but on the “who did you think I was going to call defence/I told you I was going to do it” that Scott Morrison is using, he didn’t actually say he would call the NSW police commissioner - my look over of the Hansard shows he said variations of this: I will be taking advice from the New South Wales police on any matter that they are currently looking at, and I will form a view, based on taking that advice, in considering these issues.” Which is not ‘I am calling the police commissioner’. That could have meant a departmental officer will call a NSW police departmental officer, to receive the same advice. Not I’m going to give the Commish a call directly about an investigation involving one of my ministers. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister. Former council assisting the independent commission against corruption Geoffrey Watson SC said the prime minister’s phone call to the New South Wales police commissioner should never have happened. Stating, ‘It just looks like he’s applying pressure and it can’t be anything else. It must be a favour because why else would he be calling?’ I again ask, how on earth was that phone call appropriate? Morrison: I refer the leader of the opposition to my earlier answers. The leader of the opposition invited me earlier this week to inform myself of the matters that he’d raised in the parliament. And in relation to the statement of ministerial standards. And, Mr Speaker, in this very chamber ... Members on my left ... I told him exactly what I was going to do to inform myself both to comply with my duties to this House and to comply with my duties as prime minister under the ministerial statement of standards, Mr Speaker. So, Mr Speaker, I did what I said I was going to do, I was upfront about it with the Australian people. I was upfront about it with the parliament. I went and told them what I’d done. I made a decision. What we have seen since that time is the political games being played by a leader of the opposition who is more interested in the drama and the carryings on of Canberra politics than he is in the serious issues that are being raised in this place. Now, Mr Speaker, I know that because he was on the top of the list when it came to shutting down and gagging a veteran in this chamber who had said they wished to speak on the issue of veteran suicide. Now, the leader of the opposition can use all the fine words he likes, but in this chamber, on his direction, one of his members moved that the member for Herbert no longer be heard. And he wished to speak about veteran suicide. Shame on you. The man who accused those of caring about climate change of being inner-city raving lunatics, wants the chamber to know he has been “really disappointed in the antics this week”. Excuse me while I wipe that wet lettuce off my face. If you ever wandered what a fusty nut missing a kernel looked like, I invite you to look into the chamber as the deputy prime minister takes this dixer. ARE YOU FRICKING KIDDING ME? Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Former anti-corruption commissioner and supreme court judge David Ipp AO QC has said in relation to the prime minister’s phone call to the New South Wales police commissioner, and I quote, ‘You can’t see that it’s information that relates to matters of state interest. It can only relate to matters of party interest.’ How on earth was that phone call appropriate? Morrison: Once again I reject the premise of the question which was raised by the leader of the opposition and I refer the member to the response by Commissioner Fuller yesterday, who said, very plainly, ‘The prime minister didn’t ask me any questions that were inappropriate. He didn’t ask for anything that was inappropriate and I’m comfortable with the discussion we had over a few minutes.’ They’re the words of the police commissioner, Mr Speaker. If the leader of the opposition wants to cast aspersions against the New South Wales police commissioner he can do so. But I say this. The leader of the opposition raised a very serious issue with me at the beginning of this week. On Tuesday, Mr Speaker, I undertook to fulfil my obligations which he invited me to do under the statement of ministerial standards where I had to assess whether a minister should stand aside in the circumstances he’d presented. I sought to inform myself as is entirely appropriate of the nature and substance and instigation of that investigation. I was upfront with the parliament about doing it. ... So I undertook that action as I in this House and then I went outside this place. I undertook that action and I came and reported back to this action in the parliament and the decision I have taken. What I find strange, Mr Speaker, is that at no time during that period yesterday, I should say the day before, Mr Speaker, did the Leader of the Opposition during the course of that evening and the many interviews that he gave or indeed even after I had come back into this place and explained I’d had that conversation with the Police Commissioner, did he raise any objection. He raised no objection all night. There he was. He didn’t do it until the next day I’m advised. He didn’t do it until the next day until he read it in the Guardian. We know who’s pulling his chain. Zali Steggall used her 90-second statement just before question time to call for silence for Australia’s domestic violence victims: I call on the members of the 46th parliament to remember what we are elected to do in this place, to respect the institution and to fulfil our responsibility to find solutions. One of the biggest issues facing communities out there - beyond these walls - is the scourge of domestic violence. The statistics are horrific. On average, at least one woman dies each week as a result of intimate partner violence. Yet again this morning, we wake to the news of another woman killed. Where is the outrage? Every member of this House either has a mother, wife, sister or daughter. I call on this parliament to draw a line and give this issue the urgent attention it deserves. To show our respect to those women and families that we have failed to protect, I will use the remainder of my speaking time in this Chamber to pause in silence with fellow MPs. Anne Davies has an update on the Angus Taylor investigation: Guardian Australia can reveal the council has also already retrieved data logs, which would reveal details of what was downloaded and the IP addresses of the devices that downloaded pages, including details of who downloaded the 2017-18 annual report, following a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia two weeks ago. So far Guardian Australia has been told that the information would need to be sorted to extract downloads of the annual report at the centre of the controversy and may raise privacy issues. Discussions on how the information might be released are continuing. However, the New South Wales police would be able to access the logs including more detail about an IP address beyond the general geographical location of the machine and the identity of the internet service provider that services that machine. Scott Morrison: The Leader of the Opposition has authorised political games in this place which has gagged a veteran of this country speaking about veteran suicide. The Leader of the Opposition should grow up from his political games and he should focus on the real issues that Australians wish to focus on and get over the politics and get on with the policy. “Political games” is getting quite the go here. Looks like the government has found it’s line for the day. If you have a go at political games, you’ll get a go at political games. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: This morning [Scott Morrison] refused to attend this chamber and correct the record and apologise for misleading the House. Why does the Prime Minister think the usual standards of integrity and accountability don’t apply to him? Morrison: I don’t accept the assertion that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition. The matters that he referred to yesterday, Mr Speaker. With regard to the attribution of a quote. When it was brought to my attention I took immediate action to ensure that the House was informed of that correction. Now, Mr Speaker, I hear the interjection of the Leader of the Opposition ... The reason I wrote a letter last night is because I was on a plane on the way to Sydney for a family event which the Leader of the Opposition knew about. ... Mr Speaker, that letter which I authorised was provided to the House and it was tabled here by the attorney general to ensure the House was immediately informed of the necessary correction that had to be made. ... Now, Mr Speaker, that was followed up with a further letter to the clerk and as you advised the House last night these are the appropriate forms of the House to correct the record. So if the Leader of the Opposition wants to take issue with the Speaker on this matter he’s at liberty do so. But here we are in question time, in the nation’s capital... The Leader of the Opposition is bickering about a quotation in an answer to a question which has been corrected for the record. This is what the Leader of the Opposition believes are the real issues facing this country. And the political games that the Leader of the Opposition, the tawdry political games ... has been engaged in, in this House this week, found their overreach particularly today when the Leader of the Opposition voted to see that the member for Herbert could no longer be heard when he was speaking, Mr Speaker, on the issue of veteran suicide. ... So the political games being played by the Leader of the Opposition and the Labor party this week descended so low that a veteran of this country speaking about veteran suicide ... Anthony Albanese has taken the rare step of making a 90-second statement (they are usually for backbenchers) – and he has timed it on the list for just as Scott Morrison walks into the chamber. “An ad man with no plan, a showman, covering up a scam,” says Albanese, as Morrison takes his seat. Who’s that MP? It’s Tony Pasin. It was just hard to place him, given he was sitting in the back benches (Pasin likes to make a beeline for the front bench during division votes. Almost without fail. A MP can dream, I suppose) Members have begun their 90 second statements in the House, which means it is almost time for question time. We’ll head into the chamber, but we all know what this hour will be about. Five. More. To. Go. Labor is still gagging government ministers and MPs in the chamber to make their point about the government gagging debate on Angus Taylor. Every time a division is called, all the MPs have to run back to the chamber. Labor MPs might be prepared, but the government MPs are not. The focus. The stance. The furrowed brow. Take note, fellow nodders. On the ministerial standards questions, this is what Anthony Albanese had to say: Q: So, you would stand down one of your shadow ministers in similar circumstances, and you undertake here today to do that if any of your shadow ministers are under police investigations? AA: If I was a minister, if I’m elected to government, I will uphold the ministerial code of conduct. Q: So, only in government? AA: Well, the ministerial code of conduct – the hint is, it’s a ministerial code of conduct. So, in terms of processes, the ministerial code of conduct should be followed. That’s why it’s there, for a reason. Because ministers make decisions, and they can’t be in a situation whereby they are compromised. Q: So, there are different standards for shadow ministers under investigation, they can continue? AA: Well, I’m not going to answer hypotheticals. I’m answering this specific question about ministerial code of conduct that applies to ministers and has applied for a very long period of time, and has always, always been the case. And what we see here, unlike what happened under Prime Minister Howard, but also under Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull, where we had people like Arthur Sinodinos, Sussan Ley, other people, standing aside. Sam Watson will be very missed. Ken Wyatt has issued a statement on his passing: I was saddened yesterday to learn the news of the passing of a great Indigenous Australian, Sam Watson. I extend my deepest condolences and sympathies to his family, friends and his community. We have lost a remarkable man whose lasting influence is felt across the country. Sam was a courageous advocate for justice here in Australia and around the world. He was never afraid of tackling some of the most complex issues that Aboriginal people faced, and continue to face, and worked tirelessly to bring these to the fore. I engaged his wise advice and guidance in my early years as a young man. He helped bring about a fundamental and permanent shift in Indigenous policy at the local, state and federal level through his ability to bring people together for a united cause. He was respected by all sides of politics due to his clear commitment and passion to better the lives of Aboriginal people. This is shown in his more recent work with Link-Up Qld which has seen many affected by the stolen generation reunited with their families and culture. He was dependable, always present, and had a way of taking people on the journey. The importance of his life cannot be understated and Sam will be remembered for improving the lives of generations of Indigenous Australians. Anthony Albanese and Tony Burke have put out a statement on Clive James: Clive James was a giant of Australian letters, and one of the greatest poets and intellectuals this country has ever produced. Clive passed away at his home in the UK at the weekend after a long illness, aged 80. The ‘Kid from Kogarah’ started his working life as an assistant editor at the Sydney Morning Herald before forging a 50-year career as a scholar, poet, lyricist, essayist, novelist, memoirist, critic and broadcaster. At home and abroad, he entertained and moved readers and TV audiences with his profound and provocative insights, acerbic wit and boundless sense of humour. ‘Common sense and a sense of humour are the same thing, moving at different speeds,’ Clive once wrote. ‘A sense of humour is just common sense, dancing. Those who lack humour are without judgement and should be trusted with nothing.’ Despite all the impressive achievements that made him a household name in Australia and the UK, he never lost his connection to his working-class roots or his commitment to a ‘fair go for the workers’. He was made a Member of the Order of Australia in 1992 and that was upgraded to Officer level in 2013. He was similarly honoured in the UK for his services to literature and the media. As Clive once said: ‘Fiction is life with the dull bits left out’. Clive’s life was certainly not dull – but the world without him is a less intelligent and less colourful place. Vale Clive James. This is now on its way to the Senate Why we are all talking about Scott Morrison taking in Mick Fuller’s bins when they were Shire neighbours being a “joke” (which Ben Fordham also raised as a joke on his 2GB show yesterday), just a reminder that on 13 December last year, following the original bin revelation, was this conversation: Ben Fordham: Because, once upon a time when you were neighbours, according to the commissioner, and I think this has been confirmed, you used to bring his bin in. When he’d leave the bin outside, the wheelie bin outside, and he was too lazy himself to bring it in, you would collect his bin and wheel it in for him. True or false? PM: That’s what good neighbours do. That’s what they do. Mick is a great bloke and that’s the Shire way. BF: How come you don’t do it anymore? PM: Well, I don’t take the bins out anymore. BF: Why? PM: Because I haven’t even found where they are yet. BF: Ah of course, at Kirribilli House. PM: At my place, Jen would be home more often than not to take the bins out as I’d be travelling or something. BF: Hang on, hang on, hang on. When you say my place, you mean our place? PM: No, no, when I lived in the Shire. BF: Oh OK, I’m just clarifying there. PM: That’s very true Ben, and you’re right to point that out. Often neighbours would do that for each other, mate. I think that’s done in most parts of the country and Mick’s a good bloke. BF: Well if you really loved him you’d be driving from Kirribilli House back to the Shire just to make sure the bin was in. PM: Fair point, I think that’s a fair point. World Vision has brought three former Miss World Australias to parliament as part of its “peace pledge” initiative. The women have been spotted in the Parliament House cafeteria, which we all call the trough – so, really, they have already gone above and beyond. So Labor says that as Anthony Albanese stood up to move the motion to suspend standing orders to bring Scott Morrison into the chamber to apologise for attributing a Ben Fordham quote to a Victorian police officer, the government asked to pair Morrison. Labor says it asked on what grounds, at which point the pair request was withdrawn. Morrison did enter the chamber to vote against the Labor motion. As my Oma used to say, ‘always look up’. Question: Mick Fuller expects that the investigation, the strike force, will be wrapped up next week. Are you confident the investigation will be independent? And conducted thoroughly? Anthony Albanese: Well, look, I have – I have no reason to doubt the confidence of the New South Wales police force to conduct investigations. But the problem here is that the prime minister’s intervention will have members of the public thinking, well, if one of my mates has a police inquiry, can I pick up the phone to the police commissioner and ask about that inquiry? That’s why the prime minister’s statement, that the inquiry wasn’t just whether there’s an inquiry or not, that release was out there. And I note Commissioner Fuller also said he had at least four phone calls from the prime minister. Three missed calls from a mobile that he didn’t have before he eventually took the call. Now, I have been a minister of the Crown. The normal processes are not a prime minister ringing on his mobile the head of a police commission. What would happen would be advice would be got from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet about appropriateness of it. You would have note-takers, you’d have – we asked yesterday in the parliament, would that information be released. But, of course, as all of you who are involved in the right to know campaign, this government wants to operate in secret. How is it that that happens? That isn’t the way phone calls happen, from the leader of a nation to the police commissioner about an investigation into one of his ministers. The way that it should happen, if it does at all, is through proper processes. It would appear that none of them were followed in this case, and that, I think, has the public scratching their heads. Anthony Albanese: Yesterday under some pressure he quoted – allegedly – a Victorian police detective, when it was, in fact, 2GB radio host Ben Fordham he was talking about, and hasn’t had the courage to come in and do the right thing and correct the record and apologise. What’s more, they have shut down debate. I have been here a while under Prime Minister Howard, under Kevin Rudd, under Julia Gillard. There were debates in the parliament. Indeed, under Tony Abbott. If Christopher Pyne was still the leader of the house there would have been debate about serious matters. You can’t hide from scrutiny. Parliament has a role. Our current prime minister thinks he’s above scrutiny. Scrutiny from the media, scrutiny from the public, where when asked questions he says it is just gossip or it is just in the bubble. He doesn’t hold serious press conferences too often. Today he actually put in a request for a pair – at 9:32 – to avoid going in and voting on it, something that was withdrawn some 10 minutes later. For reasons that are beyond anyone’s comprehension ... Well, he can’t continue to duck and weave. He has to be held to account. And what Labor is trying to do in parliament is to do just that. Anthony Albanese has begun his press conference: In attempting to defend a minister who has deliberately misled the parliament, the prime minister himself yesterday misled the parliament. And he has not had the courage to do what other prime ministers, other ministers, have done, which is to go into the parliament and have the courtesy of advising the parliament of the mislead, and then apologise to the parliament. That is the normal procedure that occurs. The letter to the clerk provision is for when parliament is not in session. This morning the prime minister was prepared to enter the parliament to vote in gagging this debate, but wasn’t prepared to take that opportunity to correct the record and to treat the parliament with the respect that it deserves. This mob say that they are conservatives. But the truth is they have shut down debate on 20 occasions this week. They are not prepared to allow for a proper debate about the actions of an embattled minister, which arose from him being too smart by half, sending a letter on his letterhead, with his signature, to attack Clover Moore and her position on climate change. That’s why this has arisen. This was raised more than 80 days ago. For 80 days this minister has refused to say where the document came from. Because we know it isn’t what he told the parliament. We know it wasn’t downloaded from the City of Sydney website. And instead of him doing the right thing, fessing up early on, he’s just dug in and dug in and dug in, and sunk deeper and deeper. We have a prime minister whose depth is a mile wide but an inch deep. He is incapable of acting in the national interests. So, instead of standing aside the minister under section 7.1 of the ministerial code, he has continued to dig in, made a phone call, which on any assessment he then went into the parliament and said he’d discussed the substance of an investigation with the New South Wales police commissioner. And yesterday implied in parliament again that not everyone has all the facts about that matter – this matter – and implied he had more facts about the investigation than what has been publicly released, in spite of the fact that the New South Wales police, as is normal practice, issued an immediate release about Strike Force Garrad and said they wouldn’t be making any further comment. So we have a minister who’s embattled, we have a prime minister who has intervened directly by making that phone call into the investigation. The Senate seems excited to be talking about something other than the ensuring integrity bill. It’s moved on to its housekeeping section. But it will be back on the IR train soon enough. The government has declined to table the legal advice it had on robodebt into the Senate. From the Greens: Using the excuse of ‘long-standing practice’ and ‘public interest immunity’ is not a legitimate reason to not provide this information which is in the public interest. Clearly this government has something to hide. They continued with this draconian program long after the harrowing evidence of the Senate inquiry in 2017 and the recommendation that it be put on hold while issues of procedural fairness were dealt with and long after the major flaws with the income averaging process were identified. We need to know when and for how long the government had information on the legality of robodebt. The government is trying to evade responsibility for what they have done, years of trying to scrape savings from people on the lowest income in our community and the government have been caught out. At this stage, Westpac is not being recalled to front the economics committee – but Apra will be appearing, as scheduled on Monday. From the committee: The Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) will appear before the House Economics Committee at a public hearing on Monday, 2 December 2019, as part of its review of the 2019 APRA Annual Report. Chair, Mr Tim Wilson MP, noted that ‘APRA appeared at a public hearing in August this year; however, the committee determined that additional information and questioning was required to properly scrutinise APRA’. ‘The hearing will provide the committee with the opportunity to further question APRA on its performance and operation and, in particular, how it is implementing the recommendations of the Hayne Royal Commission and the APRA capability review.’ Mr Wilson said ‘a common theme across the Royal Commission and capability review reports was that APRA is a strong regulator in the area of traditional financial risk, but that more work needs to be done to ensure APRA is prepared to respond to future challenges, particularly in relation to non-financial risk’. Mr Wilson added ‘the committee will scrutinise APRA on how it promotes financial stability through the prudential regulation and supervision of Authorised Deposit taking Institutions, insurers and superannuation licensees, and other related issues.’ Anthony Albanese and Mark Butler have called a press conference for 11.30 in the opposition leader’s courtyard. I wonder what on earth it could be about. Peter Khalil wants you all to know he pulled a hamstring and that is why he missed the division. Could this have had anything to do with Peter Khalil coming up short in the division run this morning? These MPs lead the national security conversations when it comes to parliamentary committees. So when they get together, it always raises a bit of “what’s going on” interest. You might remember a little earlier this week Josh Frydenberg said the government would introduce two new bills in response to the banking royal commission recommendations. He has just released a bit more information on what those bills are: The financial sector reform (Hayne royal commission response – protecting consumers (2019 measures) bill 2019 addresses four recommendations from the Hayne royal commission into misconduct in the banking, superannuation and financial services industry including: Recommendations 1.2 and 1.3 – requiring mortgage brokers to act in the best interests of consumers when providing consumer credit assistance; reforming mortgage broker remuneration by requiring the value of upfront commissions to be linked to the amount drawn down by borrowers instead of the loan amount; banning campaign and volume-based commissions and payments; and capping soft dollar benefits. These measures will apply from 1 July 2020. Recommendation 4.2 – ensuring that the consumer protection provisions of the financial services law apply to funeral expenses policies. • Recommendation 4.7 – banning unfair contract terms in standard insurance contracts. This will apply from 5 April 2021 which is consistent with the commencement of the design and distribution obligations. The government will also introduce the financial sector reform (Hayne royal commission response – stronger regulators (2019 measures) bill 2019. The bill implements a further four additional commitments the government announced at the time of responding to the royal commission and will ensure that Asiccan effectively enforce existing laws. How Mike Bowers saw the divisions in the house this morning: From Peter Dutton’s office: The Australian government has declared three terrorist attacks for the purposes of the Australian victim of terrorism overseas payment (AVTOP) scheme. The 15 March 2019 attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand; the 15-16 January 2019 attack in Nairobi, Kenya; and the 8 May 2002 attack in Karachi, Pakistan, have been declared as “terrorist acts” under the scheme. On 15 March 2019, a single perpetrator conducted consecutive mass shootings at the al‑Noor Mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand. The attack killed 51 people and another 49 people were injured. From 15-16 January 2019, five perpetrators conducted a complex attack on the dusitD2 hotel complex in Nairobi, Kenya. The attack killed 21 people and another 28 were injured. On 8 May 2002, a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device was detonated outside the Sheraton Hotel in Karachi, Pakistan. The attack killed 15 people and another 40 people were injured. The Australian government condemns the attacks and extends its deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those killed and injured, and to the governments and people of New Zealand, Kenya and Pakistan. The declaration of these attacks means that eligible Australians who were harmed, or lost a close family member, as a result of the attacks may seek a one-off payment of up to $75,000 in financial assistance. The AVTOP scheme ensures Australian victims of terrorist events overseas have access to financial support. The declaration of these attacks brings the total number of overseas terrorist acts declared by the Australian government for the purposes of the AVTOP scheme to 45. Information on declared attacks and how to apply for financial assistance through the AVTOP scheme is available here or by calling 1800 040 226. The Senate is finishing up its divisions on the ensuring integrity bill. That’s brought on the second reading debate, where we go into the amendments. We’ll be in amendment hell until about 11.45am. Then it’s usual Senate business for a bit, and then straight back into the IR bill. The only thing that will interrupt it then, is question time. Then more amendments, and then once that is done, we hit 4.30pm when the final votes begin and then boom - it will be the third reading debate and it’s done. Honestly, with John Alexander on the pollies team, this is never a fair contest Peter Dutton was on Sydney radio 2GB this morning – he said he can’t comment on Jacqui Lambie’s condition to vote for the repeal. “I think Jacqui can support the bill,” Dutton said. Anthony Albanese says Labor would give leave for the prime minister to approach the despatch box “given he is here” and “say sorry”. Surprisingly, Scott Morrison does not take him up on the offer The divisions end, as expected. Numbers don’t lie - except when you use the wrong ones. Meanwhile And the third division is brought on. The gag motion wins 73 to 66 We move onto the next division to gag Mark Butler. Scott Morrison has walked into the chamber to cheers from Labor. While we wait for the divisions to come to their inevitable conclusions (remember, it is a numbers game. And you don’t even need to have passed primary school maths to work that out) we have an Adani update: Regional Queensland has been handed another major win on the Carmichael project today when Toowoomba-based company Wagners was announced as the lead contractor delivering a $35m+ quarry operations package. The contract will see Wagners build and operate the quarry, which will be located about 160km outside Clermont, and deliver quarry materials for supporting infrastructure on the Carmichael mine and rail projects, such as roads, camps, pads, dams and mine civil works. So Labor’s attack has moved from Angus Taylor to the prime minister misleading parliament. Morrison did table a letter. But Labor wants the images of him saying he was wrong. There won’t be enough coffee in the world for today. Christian Porter moves to gag the debate – and to the divisions we go. Anthony Albanese just had to shush his own side, after he gets up to object to Christian Porter speaking to a motion which has not been allowed. If that gives you some indication of the mood in this place today. Porter looks a little stressed. This is not the week he wanted to have – especially when he is just about to get a win in the Senate that his colleagues had previously failed to negotiate. The motion: I seek leave to move the following motion — That the House: notes that: in attempting to defend a minister who has deliberately misled the parliament, the prime minister misled the parliament; yesterday in question time, the prime minister told the House that in March 2013, a then detective in Victoria police’s fraud squad, Ross Mitchell, made a statement about former prime minister Julia Gillard; that statement was made word for word by radio host Ben Fordham – a fact which was clear from the Australian newspaper article dated 27 April 2013 by Hedley Thomas which reports that statement; late yesterday, the prime minister admitted that he had misled the parliament but despite House of Representatives practice being clear that a misleading of parliament can be corrected by either making a statement to the House or writing to the Clerk of the House, the prime minister instead directed that a letter to the Speaker be tabled by another minister; and the prime minister has refused repeated calls from the leader of the opposition to attend the House at 9.30am today to correct the record in the form demanded by the House; and therefore, the House calls on the prime minister to do what is required by both House of Representatives practice and his own ministerial standards and immediately attend the chamber to correct his misleading statement. Scott Morrison tabled a letter correcting the record yesterday. He had been paired because he had a matter outside of Canberra. Labor wants him to come into the chamber and do it verbally. Christian Porter is trying to shut it down. Anthony Albanese is in the House moving to suspend standing orders to bring Scott Morrison back into the chamber to correct his mistake from yesterday. Meanwhile in the Senate, it is all all ensuring integrity. Mathias Cormann is moving to suspend standing orders to bring on the IR bill. Labor is going to be pissed, but there is nothing they can do about it - the crossbench is on board this time. The bells are ringing. So it begins. Anthony Albanese was also asked about whether or not Labor would support the New Zealand option, if that is indeed what Jacqui Lambie’s condition to repeal medevac is: AA: Labor has been saying for a very long time that Australia should have accepted the offer from New Zealand originally made with John Key’s government and when prime minister Gillard began those discussions. Since then, prime minister Key made it very clear, as did his two successors, including prime minister Ardern. The government needs to, once again, needs to have an outcome focus here. They’re all interested in the politics and in conflict. They need to be concerned about an outcome. They haven’t been. And it’s not surprising that the crossbenchers would have a look at what the government’s rhetoric was, about what would happen if medevac was introduced and what has actually happened. Q: Would that deal make the legislation more palatable for Labor? AA: Well, we think that medevac is working. And we think that the government, if it wants to resolve the issue, we think that it needs to work out third-party settlement options. There’s one that has very clearly been available for some time, in New Zealand. And that would resolve the issue because no one would need to be transferred to anywhere from Nauru or Manus because there wouldn’t be people on there. Thanks very much. The Australian Council of Social Services is releasing a survey today, showing the impact of the low rate of Newstart on younger people: The National Union of Students, YOUNG Campaigns, and the Australian Council of Social Service, will today launch a joint report exposing the alarming rates of deprivation among young people currently receiving Youth Allowance and Newstart. The report is the result of a survey 892 people aged between 16-30 who are currently receiving an allowance. Key findings from the survey include: - over 60% of respondents have less than $14 a day left after paying their rent, - over half have couched-surfed or used other unstable forms of accommodation, - more than 9 in 10 skip meals - more than 1 in 3 have withdrawn from their studies because of a lack of funds That will be around 11am And a recap of the whole Angus Taylor day, yesterday, from Katharine Murphy: Scott Morrison has rebuffed an invitation by Labor to release any officials’ notes of his conversation with the New South Wales police commissioner Mick Fuller, and insisted there was nothing inappropriate about approaching the police chief while he was investigating the conduct of one of his ministers, Angus Taylor. Morrison mocked Labor for pursuing the propriety of the call in question time on Wednesday, declaring no objections were raised by the opposition on Tuesday when he flagged his plan to make contact with Fuller. The prime minister also accused Labor of double standards, declaring both Julia Gillard and Bill Shorten faced police probes and did not vacate their posts. But Morrison ran into trouble later on Wednesday when it emerged he had misled the House by incorrectly attributing a comment about the historical police investigation into Gillard to the detective handling her matter, when the comment had been made by Sydney talkback radio host Ben Fordham. This quote from the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, which was mentioned by Scott Morrison in question time yesterday, is also raising some eyebrows. Fuller said he expected the Angus Taylor investigation to be wrapped up quickly: I just gave him an assurance that we would move the matter as quickly as possible and I didn’t say that was because of any particular person. To be honest with you, these types of investigations can consume an enormous amount of resources from New South Wales police and they area great diverter of my time. There is a whole range of reasons why I want the matter finished quickly but professionally and many of those are selfish. Labor will move to suspend standing orders at the start of parliament – Anthony Albanese said yesterday he wanted Scott Morrison to front the parliament to correct the record, rather than just send in the letter and, well, we know how that will end. So I would say the smart money would be on an immediate suspension. Anthony Albanese: Well, what’s extraordinary is that the prime minister uses a 2GB presenter’s comments, purportedly to be from a Victorian detective, against former prime minister Julia Gillard. What should have occurred here is that minister Taylor’s position is, quite frankly, untenable in terms of the deliberate mislead of the parliament. What Westminster requires – and these people are supposed to be conservatives, they’re supposed to respect tradition – the fact is that you mislead parliament when you’re a minister, you end your ministerial career. That’s what should happen here. We now have a police investigation. There are three issues, potential breaches, here, two of which are punishable by 10 years in prison. Anthony Albanese has stopped by doors – which is something he does when he feels like he has something to say to kick the day off. It is unusual for the leader to drop by doors (named because they are tiny press conferences held as the MPs enter the building – but because there are so many ways to enter the building, including ways where you don’t have to go through the doors and can avoid the media if you so wish. So if an MP wanders past the doors, it is because they have something to say publicly). It’s about Angus Taylor, because of course it is. The prime minister should this morning at 9.30 come into the parliament, correct the record in person, and apologise for misleading parliament yesterday, when instead of the quote that he used allegedly from a Victorian detective, it was actually from a 2GB presenter. An extraordinary error in a pre-prepared answer, word for word, extensive quotes used to attack former prime minister Julia Gillard. It just shows yet again the lack of judgment that’s been on display for all to see from this prime minister when placed under pressure. This is a prime minister who doesn’t want scrutiny from the media. He doesn’t want scrutiny from the parliament. He thinks that he can just bluff his way through everything, shutting down debate, as he has done consistently. And remember where this began. This began with a minister in the third scandal in which he’s been involved in just this year, saying that in a letter to Clover Moore that there had been $15m of travel, $14m from her and her fellow councillors on the Sydney city council, with the documentation that we know wasn’t downloaded from the City of Sydney website, even though that is what he said to parliament. On Monday he repeated that in a letter that he tabled. A deliberate mislead, which is ongoing. This minister has had over 80 days now to actually say who gave this document, how was it formed, how is it that he came to refer to it in the letter to Clover Moore. And yet we’ve seen no explanation, just an attempt to cover up, dismiss. And now we have a prime minister ringing the New South Wales police commissioner on the very day that the investigation, Strike Force Garrad, was launched. And in circumstances whereby, in the media release, they said, “No further comments would be made about the strike force,” and yet the prime minister told parliament that he discussed the substance of the investigation with the New South Wales police commissioner. And there’s a big gap between what the New South Wales police commissioner is saying happened with that conversation and what the prime minister told parliament. Jacqui Lambie is still not confirming anything about what her “one condition” is. Rebekha Sharkie on RN: I think that in this case, given that on Monday, members of the parliament asked for Angus Taylor to speak to the parliament about what he knows about the the actual document and the document that he referred to in his letter to Clover Moore and to detail to the the parliament the circumstances around how he obtained that document. Angus Tyler did not accept that request. And now we’ve come to a point where we understand the conversations been had between the prime minister and the police commissioner on the day that an investigation was announced … I think if the prime minister releases his transcript that will certainly shed some light on the conversation. If the if the conversation is as the prime minister says, which I’m sure it is, it would would then provide that clarity and that confidence needed within the parliament. The Centre Alliance lower house MP, Rebekha Sharkie, is speaking to ABC radio about how the Angus Taylor saga is just further proof that Australia needs a federal Icac. She also wants the prime minister to release his transcript of his phone call with the NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, to put to bed any lingering questions. Christopher Knaus spoke to David Ipp about Scott Morrison’s phone call to Mick Fuller: Former anti-corruption commissioner and senior judge David Ipp says Scott Morrison’s phone call to the New South Wales police chief appears to be an inappropriate attempt to use his position to make a political decision. Ipp, who served on the NSW court of appeal and as an Independent Commission Against Corruption commissioner, said the call was clearly not appropriate. He said it appears to have been made to aid Morrison’s party-political decision making, rather than the interest of the state. “An ordinary citizen would not be able to get that information from the police … so what is it about the prime minister that entitles him to that information?” Ipp told Guardian Australia. The ensuring integrity bill didn’t pass last night because there are a truckload of amendments that need to go through, but it will. Pretty much every single Labor senator has something to say about it, with the opposition pointing to repealing it if it wins the next election. But One Nation and Centre Alliance are on board, and that is enough. We enter the fifth last sitting day of the year still talking about Angus Taylor, with a big dose of Scott Morrison as well. The prime minister was forced to correct the record after attributing a 2GB Sydney radio host Ben Fordham quote to Victorian police during question time yesterday. Morrison had said that a Victorian detective had said Julia Gillard “is under investigation by police, this is a fact” in 2013 as part of a defence arguing that Labor ministers had not stepped aside during police investigations. But after reporting from the Australian, which showed the quote was actually from Fordham talking about the issue during a radio broadcast, Morrison was forced to write to the Speaker and admit his mistake. Labor is not letting it go. The government is still trying to talk about the economy but it has lost the entire week to this, with each press conference and question time taken up with defending Taylor. Morrison’s judgment, in making a phone call to NSW police commissioner, Mick Fuller, about the investigation has also pulled the prime minister into the saga. Both Fuller and Morrison say there was nothing untoward about the call, and that Morrison had received information which was already available in the public domain. But a political leader calling a police commissioner about an investigation into one of his MPs is not a great look, and the defence – I told you I was going to do it – isn’t helping matters. Labor wants the phone call documents. That’ll drag on throughout today. There are also the negotiations over medevac. Jacqui Lambie said she would vote for the repeal on one condition but won’t say what the condition is. The government knows but the public doesn’t. Nine newspapers are reporting it is the government accepting the New Zealand offer to resettle some of the Manus Island and Nauru asylum seekers. We couldn’t confirm that yesterday, with nothing ruled in or out. We’ll have all of the ongoing shenanigans and whatever else happens in this increasingly insane place. Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp are with you. I’ve had three coffees and am looking for my fourth. Ready? Let’s get into it."

Decorate the top however you like, to create your own autumnal scene. Serves: 8 For the cake: 5 medium eggs 125g caster sugar 1 tsp vanilla bean paste 80g plain flour 35g cocoa powder 10g boiling water For the filling: About 400g ice cream (any flavour you like) Strawberry jam For the ganache: 200g dark chocolate 200g double cream To decorate: Crumbled walnuts, fresh fruit (blueberries, blackberries and raspberries work well), biscuits and fondant leaf cutouts (both optional) Spoon softened ice cream into a rough log shape (about 18-20cm long) on greaseproof paper. Lift the sides over, then twist the ends together. Freeze until solid. Meanwhile, prepare decorations for the top of the roll. I made a biscuit squirrel and some painted fondant autumn leaves. Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)/425F/gas mark 7. Grease and line a 10 x 15in swiss roll tin (try to have the greaseproof paper overhanging, so it’s easy to lift out). Make the cake: whisk together the eggs and sugar on high speed for seven minutes. Slow the mixer and add the vanilla just before the end. Sieve in the flour and cocoa. Gently fold to combine. Add the water and fold in again. Spoon into the prepared tin, and smooth. Bake for 8-13 minutes, or until slightly springy on top. When baked, lift from the tin (using the greaseproof paper handles to help) and place on a wire rack. Leave for five minutes, then roll up loosely while still warm and leave to cool in this rolled-up shape. Leave the baking paper on. Then gently unroll and spread with strawberry jam. Remove the ice-cream roll from the freezer, peel off the greaseproof paper, and place the ice cream on the end of the cake roll. Roll up the cake to fully encase the ice cream, peeling off the baking paper as you go along. Place back in the freezer while you make the ganache topping. Finely chop the chocolate and place in a heatproof glass bowl. Pour the cream into a small pan. Heat on low, until just starting to bubble (don’t boil!). Pour to cover the chocolate. Leave for two minutes, then stir until all the chocolate has melted. Leave to cool until spreadable, but not too thick. Take the roll out of the freezer, then spread the ganache all over it. Once set, use a sharp knife to neaten up the ends of the roll. Decorate the top as desired. Serve straight away, or tightly wrap in clingfilm and return to the freezer."

          "bodyText": "Much as the police like to analyse the handwriting of serial killers to find clues, so I enjoy peering through the anonymised handwritten notes supposedly passed to politicians on the campaign trail, desperately squinting to see who might have written it – and which tics and “voter voice” cues a clueless spad might have dropped in there to make it more real. Thank you, Boris Johnson, then, for this, which will keep me occupied for about the next 40 years. Nicola, you are my Zodiac Killer: “Dear Prime Minster,” the letter starts, because, as we know, The People cannot spell. “I cannot let this opportunity go by as I am travelling on the train with you to Birmingham.” This, also, is a normal way in which people talk: they explicitly stage-set where they are and where they are going in the introduction to a handwritten letter passed to someone on the train they already know they are on. “My husband and I wish you every success in the coming election. I can not say I am a great supporter of Brexit – ” unclear why you would support the only loudly pro-Brexit candidate, then, but go on – “but I am a committed supporter of Great Britain.” Is it just me reflexively humming Jerusalem right now or are we all doing it? I … I think I love the Queen a good 60% more than when I started all this. More letter: “We need clarity in our direction. We need strength in our leadership. We need G-d” – I’m not sure quite how ringing an endorsement it is for the righteousness of Brexit that The Big Man himself needs to get involved but there we go – “on our side to make a miracle majority.” Ah yes, the “miracle majority” that the honest-to-goodness man-on-the-street can’t stop talking about. At this point in the letter, before she’s even reached, “Channel your inner bulldog to be the leader we need”, it’s veering a lot further from “sweet lady on a train” to “subject of a decades-long manhunt”, isn’t it? I’m not going to speculate any more whether the letter is real or whether Michael Gove wrote it desperately in a Virgin Trains toilet with his finger on the lock button to keep a queue of genuine piss-needers out (“Occupied!” Michael Gove is saying, the sweat from his frantic little forehead steaming up his glasses) because, whichever way you spin it, there is a real person on the end of that pen, whoever they are. That’s the terrifying thing about this election: for every normal person in your little bubble who is going to vote along the same lines as you, there’s a possibly fictional, possibly real Nicola Murder–Bulldog out there, quietly writing blood letters on the train, creeping around Birmingham eyeing up the next non-believer to bounce bodily into a canal. Similarly, and I know it isn’t “cool” or “trendy” to say it, but … I think I believe the BBC. Just as we had #Wreathgate to spice up Armistice Day, we now have #Gigglegate: the straight fact that, in an edited video the BBC uploaded to social media following Friday’s Question Time debates, a small flutter of audience laughter was cut after a question was put to Boris Johnson about the importance of telling the truth. This has fed into a now gorgeous recurring theme of this election: the BBC messes up calamitously, and amateurishly, highly tuned conspiracy-minded individuals – those who have ruined at least one house party already this year with an Epstein theory and have plans for two more – accuse the broadcaster of fake news, and people who don’t believe that it is fake news sneer at the idea of it being fake news. Everyone is sort of right and sort of wrong at the same time, and the BBC issues a fumbling apology (the clip was “shortened for timing reasons” for the lunchtime bulletin, apparently, which was why it was uploaded to social media: they, simply, had it lying around). So what’s it to be: that the anonymous letter passed to Johnson on a train will win this year’s Didn’t Happen Of The Year Awards hands down, and the BBC is now a state-run propaganda machine? Or the BBC made a split-second thoughtless editing decision and Nicola (Mrs) actually exists and actually wants to invoke the spirit of the bulldog? The truth to both is, probably, somewhere in the grey lull between. But who cares about that! There’s an election going on! Other things to hate or enjoy – delete as appropriate It is my grave and sad duty to announce that the youth today are actually very good, as evidenced by the campaign on social media to register under-25s to vote. The trick is this: irresistibly clickbait headlines (“David Attenborough, 93, Taken to Hospital”, “Meghan Markle Expecting Second Child” and, the one I have to admit gave me a jolt of panic and actually made me click on it, weeping, “Nando’s Goes into Administration”) repurposed to forward on to the government’s register-to-vote website, and, lo and behold, there’s been a spike in voter registration. (YouTuber and boxer KSI tweeted a similar link around the same time as Stormzy did – the number of people on the website surged by tens of thousands.) It’s a canny trick – using the language of clickbait against those who simply can’t resist it, like slugs trapped in beer – and weirdly wholesome to see, a sort of mass bonding of the youth on the platform that birthed them as they all come together as an election looms. Finally, fake news as a force for good. If you had “hot mic disaster” on your election bingo card, cross it off now: Ashfield Conservative candidate Lee Anderson has blown bigoted-woman-gate out of the water and into a new postmodern dimension. Basically, Michael Crick found the prospective MP apparently calling on a friendly voter before doorstepping him on camera. I think my favourite part of this Hindenbergesque attempt as self-flattery is the fact that, even if Anderson wasn’t exposed as already knowing the man he was knocking on the door of, the ensuing comments were so erratic and unusable they basically made him look bad anyway. “I think he was a bit soft,” the man says, in response to Anderson’s proposal this week that unruly council tenants should be forced to live in tents. “I’d give them [the] cat o’ nine tails,” he said. “Make them wear a pink tutu.” Ah yes, that famous campaigning trick: call on someone you already know, while mic’d up in front of the press, and get them to say something so bizarre and alien that your threat to make council tenants take cold showers somehow looks reasonable. Ashfield is a crunch battleground seat: we’ll find out on 13 December if they are for or against whipping benefit claimants and making them work the fields in ballet outfits. • Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"

          "bodyText": "Visitors entered this summer’s Sweet Harmony exhibition through a tangle of ripped-up fencing, as if stealthily gaining access to a forbidden ritual. Inside, old-skool rave anthems rattled the Saatchi Gallery’s window frames. On the walls were hundreds of flyers alongside photographs of saucer-eyed youngsters waving air-horns and wearing T-shirts adorned with amusingly brazen drug references. Dave Swindells, the man responsible for many of these classic photographs – and, indeed, many of the most memorable visual documentations of 1988’s summer of love – was struck by how much his images meant to strangers whose reckless youth he captured. “It’s emotional. I was getting messages from people saying how amazing it was that they were on the walls of the Saatchi!” These ravers will be deep into middle age by now, so it is easy to forget that today’s gallery-fodder was yesterday’s tabloid terror. “Shoot These Evil Acid Barons!” screamed a Sun headline in November 1988. But perhaps the fear and fury generated by rave’s first wave is why this year’s significant flurry of interest in the UK’s last great pop-cultural sea change feels like more than simple nostalgia. Alongside Sweet Harmony, Joe Muggs’s book, Bass, Mids, Tops explores a wider continuum of British sound system culture that encompasses everything from lovers rock to grime. There are also forthcoming books on London rare groove (by Caspar Melville) and Yorkshire bleep and bass (Matt Anniss). Meanwhile, Jeremy Deller’s documentary Everybody in the Place, which aired on BBC Four in August, traced the roots of rave, locating its importance in terms of both folk memory and cultural subversion. But why has our desire to explore the breadth and depth of rave’s wider implications surfaced now? Have we simply reached the inevitable moment when the nation’s editors, curators and controllers are drawn from the rave generation? Or is our troubled present finding an echo in the late 1980s? Everybody in the Place, with its classroom setup and audience of modern teens, could easily have been the 2019 equivalent of a middle-aged man in 1988 expecting the original rave kids to be wowed by footage of Bill Haley and the Comets. But, somehow, it felt altogether more vital than that. The distinct but intersecting scenes played out in the 1980s and 90s and documented this year shared an unmediated, self-generated quality. These events were communal and often lawless. They were not happening with anyone’s permission but instead were reactions to the prevailing currents of their time. Deller’s film analyses rave’s role in the traumatised aftermath of the miners’ strike. Rave, he proposed, was “a death ritual marking the transition of Britain from an industrial to a service economy”. Swindells – who also took photos at the 1984 battle of Orgreave – agrees that “there was a strong anti-Thatcher thing going on” in early rave. His Sweet Harmony images and archive film in Everybody in the Place feel simultaneously distant and recognisable; familiar faces waving (and gurning) to us across an unbridgeable chasm. Maybe this explains its resonance in 2019. We have no shortage of things to be furious about. After years of fragmentation and polarisation, the joyful militancy of early rave feels poignant; the kind of unified response to political strife that this era is yet to produce. Yet the potential for this kind of unity feels stifled by changes that can never be reversed. There is a moment in Deller’s film when one student has a realisation. “There’s no technology or nothing,” she says. “So everyone’s just in their own space.” This speaks to a modern fear concerning a loss of freedom, in the context of both state surveillance (pertinent given the regularity with which original rave culture involved breaking the law) and a more personal issue related to the self-curation of social media. However, Muggs senses change in the air: “There will never be another acid house because it was a reaction to its times. But I think we are entering a period of backlash against this isolation and being in your own bubble.” Muggs’s book Bass, Mids, Tops sidesteps obvious figures, instead celebrating continuity – from production great Dennis Bovell to underrated Bristol breakbeat duo Smith &amp; Mighty. “Bass culture,” writes Muggs in his introductory chapter, “is folk culture.” Perhaps that is what we’ve seen the beginnings of this year. The sudden glut of related writing and film and art is an attempt to place these subcultures in a wider social context. While books and exhibitions make it easy to get lured into nostalgia about the past, Muggs is optimistic about the present. “There’s so much going on in club culture now. The number of women DJ-ing, non-white women coming through. If you go to places like Manchester and Nottingham, you realise how multiracial the scenes are. Things are cross-fertilising like they did in the 80s.” Nostalgia implies a dead end. But this year’s bracing blast of yesterday’s hardcore is more like a celebration; a reminder that another chapter can always be written. Bass, Mids, Tops is published on 13 December by Strange Attractor Press"

          "bodyText": "So with parliament right back to where it started – talking ensuring integrity – we are going to wrap up the blog for the night. Stay tuned for the news stories and analysis on yet another extraordinary day in the Australian parliament which will be coming your way. A big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp for dragging me through the day. I could not do this project without them, and the Guardian brains trust you don’t see bylines for, but are just as crucial. But as always – the biggest thank you is to you, for following along with us. We truly appreciate it. We’ll be back early tomorrow morning. In the meantime, please – take care of you. And around and around we go: The Australian Republican Movement is holding an event at Old Parliament House tonight – Malcolm Turnbull, Anthony Albanese and Richard Di Natale are all slated to speak. Personally, I think it would be a lot easier to just put up a giant photo of Prince Andrew, but I guess words are cool too. Adam Bandt on Angus Taylor: Scott Morrison is deep in denial. The PM has thrown integrity overboard to hang on to a 1 seat majority on the floor of Parliament. The government says unions need special ‘integrity’ legislation because they can’t manage their own affairs, then the Liberals keep a Minister under police investigation on the front bench. If you’ve got a blue collar the Liberals throw the book at you, but if you’ve got a white collar they turn a blind eye. Not only is Scott Morrison refusing to accept that burning coal makes bushfires worse, he’s backing a Minister being investigated by police for using forged documents in a climate-related attack. For those asking, and this is from my memory as a police reporter, a strike force is just the name given to an investigation which involves specialists – investigating different crimes needs different skills, and when those skills are called upon, a strike force is called in. It doesn’t necessarily mean a team of people are working on it. Goodness – do they know they let a woman in? The emojis will never stop now. We are stuck with them. The speakers list for this debate is very, very looooooooooooooonnnnnnng And some more Mike Bowers: How Mike Bowers saw question time and some of those divisions go down: And here is what Anthony Albanese managed to get out in that motion: And I move that so much of standing orders be suspended as would allow the leader of the opposition to move the following motion immediately. That the House, 1. notes: a. that on the evening of the 23 October 2019, the Guardian reported that the Minister for Emissions Reduction had used incorrect figures from the City of Sydney’s annual report 2017/18 in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney; b. on 24 October 2019, the minister told the House that the document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney’s website; c. despite the minister’s claim, all the evidence to date is that no such documents ever existed on the website, the altered document has only ever been produced by the minister’s office and the doctored figures have only ever been used by the minister in his official ministerial correspondence; d. today the New South Wales Police confirm that it had launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate the matter; e. paragraph 7.1 of the ministerial standards makes clear that it is for the Prime Minister to stand aside a minister if that minister becomes a subject of an official investigation of alleged illegal conduct; f. In question time today the Prime Minister stonewalled, ridiculed Labor for demanding the Minister for Emissions Reduction be immediately stood aside and shut down debate on the minister’s conduct. and 2. therefore condemns the Prime Minister for his contempt for this Parliament and the principles of ministerial integrity and accountability. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am astounded that the prime minister has shown such contempt to come into this parliament and to stonewall again further for this minister. This minister must go. This minister must go. There was a reason the random name generator of NSW police investigations made some headlines... It might be the Queenslander in me, but I don’t think it’s great that a prime minister can ring up a police commissioner and ask for information about why they have launched an investigation. Here’s the whole statement Scott Morrison made to the House: Coming back to the House in question time today I undertook to make contact with the New South Wales police to inform myself on the matters that were the subject of the questions raised by the leader of the opposition regarding the statement of ministerial standards, specifically clauses 7.1 and 7.2. I take matters of ministerial standards very seriously. I’ve since spoken with the NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller about the investigation and the nature and substance of their inquiries, which he advised me were based only on the allegations referred by the shadow attorney general. And based on the information provided to me by the commissioner, I consider there is no action required by me under clauses 7.1 and 7.2. The NSW police should now be left to complete their inquiries which will be considered upon their completion. The motions in the House are coming to their inevitable conclusion – the government has the numbers and the debate will end. Simon Birmingham: No, I’m saying that the police need to do their job as I said before. I’m sure the federal Labor party would criticise the police if they didn’t look at this letter that the Labor party have sent them and investigated, so the police are quite possibly in a no-win situation there, but I have no doubt the police will do a thorough job and the government will cooperate with them in so far as this is required. Patricia Karvelas asks Simon Birmingham if he feels comfortable standing by Angus Taylor while the police investigation is ongoing: Governments are judged on all manner of things. Ultimately the Australian people want us to get on with looking after their interests. Their interests, giving them the confidence to plan for the future, giving them the confidence that there will be jobs for them and their children, giving them the confidence that the services they want will be available to them and that is exactly what we as a government are focused on. The federal opposition and the Labor party can play all sorts of games on side issues, but our focus is about actually, in my case today, having passed through parliament legislation for the Indonesian free trade agreement. The Senate is now getting on with talking about how we can actually make sure that our construction industry works more effectively and reduces costs in the future so there can be more jobs and more building opportunities without the type of union lawlessness we have seen in the past. These are the things that mums and dads around the country care about. Simon Birmingham: You want to draw analogies. It is not that long ago that in your home state that 21 members of the Victorian Labor party in the Victorian government were under investigation including six ministers. I didn’t hear Anthony Albanese or any other members of the Labor party suggesting that those [members should stand down]. Simon Birmingham is defending the decision not to stand down Angus Taylor while the police investigation is carried out to Patricia Karvelas on ABC TV: Let’s put the investigation clearly in context there. The prime minister having had these matters raised purely at the start of question time has come out of question time, has spoken to the police commissioner, has ascertained that apparently the only information there is the referral by the federal Labor opposition to the NSW police. The prime minister of course has indicated that, as you would expect, the government will give full cooperation to their investigation but we have the minister, who has made clear his position for quite some period of time now, in terms of where the information was sourced from, from the City of Sydney website, he has made his public statements, these matters really have been dealt with. Yes, the NSW police are acting on a request from the federal Labor party to look at this matter. We will cooperate with that but that should really be the end of the matter while we get on with governing the country. The government gags the debate – Labor loses its mind – and we go to a division. Anthony Albanese is denied a statement on indulgence – because there is no precedence for it. Tony Smith says he denies it regretfully. Albanese is now trying to suspend standing orders to discuss the issue. “I am astounded that the Prime Minister has shown such contempt.... This minister must go.” Scott Morrison announces he has spoken to the New South Wales police commissioner, Mick Fuller. He says he takes “matters of ministerial standards very seriously”, but he has determined there is “no action” required. I have since spoken with the NSW police commissioner about the investigation and the nature and substance of their inquiries, which he advised me were based only on the allegations referred to by the shadow attorney general. Based on the information provided to me by the commissioner, I consider there is no action required by me under the clause. Labor is back in the federation chamber – the suspension lasted just under five minutes. But it is about making the point, not actually shutting down parliament. The MPI continues – Fiona Phillips is getting her five minutes now. Scott Morrison is still at the table, writing notes. Bob Katter has a minute 1.10 on the clock. Bob Katter, talking on the dairy industry as part of the MPI, has never had such a big audience. Scott Morrison has just walked into the chamber and is sitting at the table. Bob Katter is about to be cut off. The Office of National Intelligence has given evidence to a spillover session of budget estimates for the Finance and Public Administration committee. Under questioning from the Liberal senator James Paterson, the director general of the ONI, Nick Warner, said he was “loath” to comment on recent reports on an alleged Chinese plot to infiltrate Australia’s parliament, saying it was a matter for the Department of Home Affairs and Asio. But Warner said he supported the former director of Asio, Duncan Lewis, on the current threat of foreign interference. “As Duncan Lewis ... used to say with some frequency, foreign interference into Australia and espionage against Australia are at unprecedentedly high levels and we need to take these issues very seriously.” The federation chamber (where speeches go to die, but still get a guernsey in the Hansard) has been suspended – because of a lack of quorum. Labor is going on strike over the government having gagged the debate on Angus Taylor. The backbench cleared out of QT, and now it’s cleared out of the federation chamber. We are just waiting on the matter of public importance to finish up, and then we are expecting Scott Morrison to address the chamber. On Scott Morrison’s call for an apology if the allegations go nowhere, Anthony Albanese says: There is a strike force, that has been established by the New South Wales police. Have a look at what the prime minister was saying today in question time. I certainly have no influence over what the NSW police do and whether they establish a strike force. They do not do it because they wake up in the morning and say, how about we have a strike force into a federal cabinet minister. They do it because there is a clear case to be made. Anthony Albanese: Angus Taylor should not be a representative of anybody at this point in time. He should be a backbencher. He is under investigation for very serious allegations. You can’t go around producing documents defaming someone, giving them to the media, which aren’t factual documents. And be a minister of the crown. This is the most open and shut circumstances I’ve seen and the fact that yesterday, when we moved to suspension of standing orders, not a single minister was prepared to stand up and to defend minister Taylor. I’m not surprised that they weren’t and say again, they were prepared to do that and indeed, they weren’t even allowed... They weren’t even good enough to allow to have a debate. To shut down the leader of the opposition when we had made a very clear case. Every question, in question time, was about this. There is a police strike force into a cabinet minister and into a fraudulent document and this government does not think that is worthy of even discussion. They are showing contempt for the parliament and in terms of a lack of scrutiny, now they can’t avoid the scrutiny. The prime minister must ask the minister to stand aside today. The hours motion has passed 39 to 33 – reordering debate to allow more time to discuss the Ensuring Integrity bill. The motion said: (a) the routine of business for the remainder of today shall be: (i) consideration of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019, second reading speeches only, (ii) if a division is called after 7.20 pm, the division shall be taken on the next day of sitting, and (iii) the Senate shall adjourn without debate after the conclusion of the second reading debate, or at 9 pm, or after a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister, whichever is the earlier; and (b) on Wednesday, 27 November 2019: (i) the routine of business from 7.20 pm shall be consideration of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019, second reading speeches only, and (ii) if a division is called after 7.20 pm, the division shall be taken on the next day of sitting, and (iii) the Senate shall adjourn without debate after the conclusion of the second reading debate, or at midnight, or after a motion for the adjournment is moved by a minister, whichever is the earlier Anthony Albanese: This prime minister will do anything to avoid scrutiny and today the shutting down of the debate in the parliament about his embattled minister for emissions reduction just highlighted the lack of respect for scrutiny that this prime minister has. The prime minister mightn’t want scrutiny from the parliament or from the crossbench or indeed from the media where he refuses to answer questions but he can’t avoid scrutiny by the New South Wales police force with their strike force that they have launched, operation Garrad, into the behaviour of the minister for emissions reduction. ... We know from the scrutiny that has occurred from outside of the metadata from that website that this document did not come from the website. We don’t know where it came from but we know that it was given to the Daily Telegraph by the minister’s office. And now we have an investigation, a strike force by the NSW police force into this fraudulent document and the minister under section 7.1 of the ministerial code of conduct is subject to the prime minister’s decision as to whether he should step aside or not. Now Arthur Sinodinos stepped aside, no doubt with the encouragement of the then coalition prime minister, over something where there wasn’t a police investigation, there was an inquiry by the ICAC into his conduct. He stepped aside voluntarily. This minister cannot survive this day. The prime minister needs to stand him aside today. This farce whereby a minister has continued to just have this born to rule mentality on display for all, thinking that he can get away with anything he likes because he’s above the common people, and indeed the parliament, well the fact is he is accountable. Scott Morrison will make a statement to the house in a few minutes. Anthony Albanese and Mark Butler will hold a press conference in a couple of minutes – it’s in the opposition leader’s courtyard, which is Labor’s most serious press conference spot. As the frontbench of the government moves out, Scott Morrison reaches across and pats Angus Taylor on the back. But he does it just inside the door, where it starts to go dark. Question time ends. Scott Morrison also makes notes of the Labor backbench having cleared out. It is great to see the leader of the opposition’s backbench support here in full swing. Greg Hunt gets one more dixer. Question time has been extended as a ‘whatevs’ to Labor having attempted to gag Sussan Ley, but we should be done after this. Mark Butler gets another question – to Angus Taylor: The minister’s department blocked access under freedom of information to two sets of emails sent to his office on the very day his conduct was referred to the NSW police. Those emails also been withheld from the NSW police and will they now be provided to the NSW police strike force Garrad? Taylor: Well, thank you, Mr Speaker. After being in opposition for seven years you’d think the member for Hindmarsh would know how FOIs work. Freedom of information requests are being, as they always are, processed in accordance with the Act. Now I tabled my statement from 25 October in the House and I stand by that statement. But, Mr Speaker, the poor understanding of FOI from the member for Hindmarsh isn’t his only mistake. It isn’t his only mistake. We know he was the architect of Labor’s energy and climate policies in 2013, 2016 and 2019. (Scott Morrison nods along with each of these dates.) The member for McMahon. He was the architect of all of those election-losing policies. He is an election-losing machine. (“Good stuff,” Morrison mouths.) Now he is the self-proclaimed master tactician who couldn’t even hold the Labor party presidency is at it again. The member for Hindmarsh is Labor’s special weapon. He’s an election-losing machine. Labor’s backbench has cleared out. That gag motion is also lost. Shockingly. Sussan Ley returns to answer the dixer. And then we can all go. Which for some of us, straight to the principal’s office, me thinks. The hours motion to allow further debate on the union penalty (ensuring integrity) bill, has really set the Labor Senate leader, Penny Wong, off: The government is moving this motion so it can ram through it’s extreme anti-worker legislation. It doesn’t apply to banks. It doesn’t apply to Angus Taylor. It doesn’t apply to Senator Cash. It only applies to working people and their representatives. It is an attack on nurses, police, and their representatives... I was here for the Work Choices legislation – and you lot haven’t changed. After that Wong hit the Coalition for slow pedalling on the national integrity commission, the banking royal commission and leaving it up to Westpac’s board to respond to allegations of 23m breaches of anti-money laundering laws. Wong notes that in Senate question time, the government refused to rule out changes to unfair dismissal laws and the Better Off Overall Test: Wong concludes: It’s the same ideology and the same agenda as WorkChoices... You think there should be one standard for workers and their representatives and one standard for everyone else. This government doesn’t care about integrity, it doesn’t care about lawlessness, it doesn’t care about workers. Scott Morrison looks like my dad did when I got home from my “friend’s” house when I was 16, after his police friends told him I had been seen pouring vodka into a slurpee cup in the Surfers Paradise mall at 4am. That did not end well for me, FYI. Scott Morrison has the folders stacked. Sussan Ley moves up for her dixer – and Tony Burke moves that the minister no longer be heard. A bit of tit for tat there, as a gag motion, and also extends the awkwardness for a few minutes longer. The members return to their seats. Scott Morrison indicates there will be one more dixer. Andrew Laming and Tony Pasin once again took the opportunity to sit on the frontbench during the division. Warren Entsch is also there, but it looks like he has some business with Sussan Ley and is seizing the opportunity for a chat. Angus Taylor found a friend in Alan Tudge, who made a beeline to sit next to him in the division. They are having a good old chat. Hey, it’s one way to ensure you’ll get your face on the TV. Better plan than this, anyway. Scott Morrison is VERY busy on his phone We are at the swapping sides of the never-ending division. 73 to 67, the government wins. We move to the final gag motion. Tony Burke moves to second Anthony Albanese’s motion, but that too is gagged (which is normal). We divide again. The government has the numbers, so you know how it will end. Meanwhile, the question remains – was question time the first Scott Morrison was aware of the police investigation? Because it certainly seems that way. Meanwhile, in the Senate: Jacqui Lambie has asked the government about three Rwandan refugees brought to Australia who had been charged (but not convicted of) murder. “What kind of deal is this? The US clearly didn’t want them in their community – they held them for more than a decade in immigration detention. Do they pose a risk?” Michaelia Cash chooses her words very carefully – noting Scott Morrison confirmed earlier this year that two of the Rwandans had come to Australia because they were found to be refugees, and were subject to strict security and character tests. She doesn’t confirm the third Rwandan has come to Australia. Lambie suggested it looks like Australia is sending genuine refugees to the US and getting back accused criminals. Cash responds that the Rwandans did not come to Australia as part of a deal with the US. This is mid “this is a disgrace”: Meanwhile: Christian Porter has moved to gag the debate – Labor is very upset about that, but it is pretty normal practice for a question time suspension. The motion: I seek leave to move the following motion – That the House: notes that: on the evening of 23 October 2019, the Guardian reported the Minister for Emissions Reduction had used incorrect figures from the City of Sydney Annual Report 2017-18 in a letter to the Lord Mayor of Sydney; on 24 October 2019, the Minister told the House: “The document was drawn directly from the City of Sydney’s website”; despite the Minister’s claim, all the evidence to date is that no such document ever existed on the website, the altered document has only ever been produced by the Minister’s office and the doctored figures have only ever been used by the Minister in his official Ministerial correspondence; today, the NSW Police confirmed that it had launched Strike Force Garrad to investigate the matter; paragraph 7.1 of the Ministerial Standards make clear that it is for the Prime Minister to stand aside a Minister if that Minister becomes the subject of an official investigation of alleged illegal conduct; and therefore, calls on the Prime Minister to do what only he can under the Ministerial Standards and immediately stand the Minister for Emissions Reduction down. Christian Porter has denied leave to move the motion. Anthony Albanese is moving to suspend standing orders over the Angus Taylor saga. This will fail. The government backbenchers – Julian Simmonds and Phil Thompson, I hear you – seem to think that mention of the Guardian is worth a guffaw or two. Labor’s Murray Watt has asked the government why just $44m of Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility funding has been spent, and how many jobs have been created. The resources and northern Australia minister, Matt Canavan, replied that $1.5bn of investments will create 4,000 jobs, although he acknowledged it “got off to a slow start” before changes to the investment mandate 16 months ago. “There is a reason the Australian people don’t trust Labor with money. [The reason not all the money has been spent is that] money is provided as milestones are met,” he said. Watt then asks about a $610m loan for a pumped hydro project in Queensland, which has been delayed. Canavan confirms that funding for the investment “remains on the table”. Watt heckles “one day, maybe, eventually, down the track” to reinforce his argument the jobs are not real (yet). Angus Taylor: And as I said yesterday, I made a statement on 25 October, which I tabled in the House yesterday. And as I said in that statement, this is an outrageous accusation against me by the Labor party. But to answer the question, Mr Speaker, to answer the question, of course I’ll cooperate with any matter of this sort. Now, as I said in my statement, I reject absolutely the suggestion that I, or any members of my staff, altered the documents in question. And, Mr Speaker, I won’t be lectured to by the party of Aldi bags and wine boxes full of cash, Mr Speaker. I’m not going to be lectured to about integrity in the week that Labor is celebrating Eddie Obeid coming out on parole. Mark Butler to Angus Taylor: Why did the minister block access under freedom of information to more than 200 documents about his use of false figures in official ministerial correspondence? Is it because he knows that the documents reveal that he misled the House when he claimed he downloaded false figures from the City of Sydney website? And will he now assure the House that all 200 documents will be provided to the NSW police strike force Garrad? Christian Porter gets up immediately, while Scott Morrison speaks to Angus Taylor, who is displaying the body language of the school prefect sent to the principal’s office. Porter: The first is with respect to the standing order, around inferences and imputations. The word “block” contains a strong imputation. I might note if that word is to be included in the question, then the question needs to be directed to me as the minister in charge of freedom of information pursuant to standing order 98. I would be happy to take the question on notice to determine whether or not that inference and imputation is correct. But I very much doubt that it is. Burke: I would simply refer to your earlier rulings about the opportunity for the minister, if he disagrees to the words of the question, to make that clear in his answer. Tony Smith: I thank both the leader of the House and the manager of opposition business. As I’ve made clear before, and for a number of years now, as have previous Speakers, particularly Speaker Andrew on this topic, that whilst the standing orders obviously were quoted accurately by the leader of the House, the practice has been lenient with respect to inferences and also on imputations. That’s certainly been the case. And, indeed, Speaker Andrew pointed out that if they were strictly enforced, most questions would simply not be in order, or not be able to be asked. I’ve always said I’m happy to look at how we might change things in the future. But if we had a strict reading of questions, I would have a very strict reading of the standing orders around answers. And that can obviously change the nature of things. The other point Speaker Andrew made was, in ruling questions out of order on that basis, it does prevent the minister from having any opportunity, as the manager of opposition business says. So, on this occasion I’m going to allow the question to proceed, and it’s up to the minister how he deals with that. Mark Dreyfus has been told not to speak for an hour after being caught making a bunch of interjections. The chamber is taking bets on whether he’ll make it. Scott Morrison continues: And to go to the question again, of course we will cooperate with any and all matters, Mr Speaker. I would just hope that the leader of the opposition, once we’ve had the opportunity to review these matters fully, if it is indeed the case, Mr Speaker, that he has jumped the... They’re getting a bit excited, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, once we have worked through this matter, I would just simply hope that the leader of the opposition will do the decent thing if, indeed, Mr Speaker, this is just one of the many occasions upon which the opposition have made these references and they’ve ended up nowhere, that just once, maybe, Mr Speaker, they might want to – they might want to walk back from the breathless accusations that they’ve made. Except, in this case, the police are the ones who have decided to investigate the referral – the police have announced the task force and the police have confirmed the investigation. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister, and I refer to his previous answers, where he said he will contact NSW police about Strike Force Garrad into the minister for emissions reduction and the doctored document about Clover Moore. Will the prime minister commit to fully cooperate with any request for information from the NSW police about this scandal? Morrison: Mr Speaker, like with all matters that are pursued by any law enforcement authorities, the commonwealth always cooperates fully with all of those matters, Mr Speaker, which you would expect us to do, and of course we would, Mr Speaker, of course we would. But, Mr Speaker, just because the opposition has referred matters to the NSW police, and just because the opposition have referred so many matters on so many members, Mr Speaker, and they’ve all ended up going absolutely nowhere at the end of the day, forgive me, Mr Speaker, for not, for not leaping to the conclusions that the leader of the opposition had on this day, Mr Speaker. And breathlessly coming to the dispatch box and making the allegations that he is making against the member, and the minister, Mr Speaker. I understand, I understand why the leader of the opposition wants to distract attention today. It’s not just because there are 65 representatives of the CFMEU before the courts across 28 separate matters, brought by the ABCC, Mr Speaker. Albanese has a point of order: I don’t have the capacity to demand the NSW police launch a strike force into one of his ministers. Tony Smith tells the prime minister to stick to the topic. It is all very, very tense in here at the moment. Anthony Albanese asks Scott Morrison to withdraw the union thuggery line. Morrison does not. Someone in the government benches is heckling something about “the Guardian” but it’s not loud enough for me to hear to judge whether or not I should respect it as a burn. This is not a place for grown-ups. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: And I refer to his previous answers, where he said that he will contact the NSW police about Strike Force Garrad into the minister for emissions reduction. Will he assure the police and this House that the minister will do what he hasn’t done to this parliament, and state exactly what the origins of this doctored document about the City of Sydney Mayor was – what the origins of it were? Morrison: I’m going to leave the matters of pursuing these issues to the NSW police. And I will speak directly to the NSW police, Mr Speaker. And I will consider the information they provide me about this matter. And I will exercise my responsibilities under the standards once I have had the opportunity to have those discussions. What I won’t do, Mr Speaker, is engage in the breathlessness of the leader of the opposition. I won’t engage in that, Mr Speaker. I calmly consider my responsibilities. I soberly consider serious matters, Mr Speaker. I don’t rush to the judgment of the leader of the opposition. And I know why this is happening today, Mr Speaker, because in the other place, in the other place, Mr Speaker, we are dealing with the ensuring integrity bill. Ah! That’s the bill we’re dealing with over there. And the militant unionism that this mob over here, Mr Speaker, want to engage in a protection racketed. Mr Speaker, I was wondering what the collective noun was for a group of militant unionists, and I think they’re called a “thuggery” of unionists, Mr Speaker. And it’s that thuggery that this leader of the opposition wants to protect by not supporting the government’s bill to ensure that union thugs are held to account. Peter Dutton delivered his daily dose of JUST HOW SAFE ARE YOU. Breaking: STILL AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE BUT OMG L A B O R I’m not sure about the prime minister’s assertion that he will speak to the NSW police about the investigation, because in my experience, police tend to keep that stuff under wraps, because you know – it is a police investigation. And I also don’t understand the constant comparisons to Eddie Obeid, who actually went to jail. What is the relevance? Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again to the prime minister and it goes to events under a different Coalition prime minister, when Arthur Sinodinos had the integrity to stand aside from the ministry even though a police investigation was never commenced. Strike Force Garrad has now commenced. It’s investigating the potential criminality of the minister for emissions reduction. Why is he still here on your frontbench, prime minister? Morrison: And I would refer the member to clauses 7.1 and 7.2 of the Statement of Ministerial Standards, and that makes it very clear the process, Mr Speaker. And so I don’t take the leader of the opposition’s word for these matters, Mr Speaker. What I will do is what I said in response to the last question, and I will speak directly to the NSW police force and understand the nature of what these reports are... And then, Mr Speaker, I will make the necessary assessments of that case at that time. But, Mr Speaker, I’m not going to take lectures from the leader of the opposition, who is a member of a NSW branch, Mr Speaker, who had NSW government ministers imprisoned, Mr Speaker. Imprisoned. I mean, Eddie’s coming out in December, Mr Speaker, but it doesn’t make any difference to the fact that he is a member of a rotten branch of the Labor party. I missed a question – this was the second question and answer exchange between Anthony Albanese and Scott Morrison: Albanese: The ministerial code makes it the personal responsibility of the prime minister to decide whether to stand aside a minister in the exact circumstances that the minister for emissions reduction now finds himself in. Prime minister, the NSW police have established Strike Force Garrad into the potential criminal behaviour of a minister sitting on your frontbench right now. Prime minister, why is he still sitting there? When will you stand him aside? Scott Morrison: The matters that the opposition leader refers to have not been provided to me or been presented to me by the NSW police. I have not been advised of those developments, Mr Speaker. And so I think that deals with the issues that he has raised in relation to the code. But Mr Speaker, can I say, about the minister for energy and the minister for emissions reduction, I think I can understand why those opposite have taken such a keen interest in him, Mr Speaker, because he’s responsible for policies that we are finally starting to see stabilise electricity prices in this country. And take the pressure off... and he’s overseeing an emissions reduction program, Mr Speaker, which is taking action on climate change without taking the jobs of Australians, Mr Speaker. Which is the policies of those opposite. I am enabling the minister to continue to get around his job, his job, Mr Speaker, which is about getting power prices down, and which is about meeting our important commitments to take action on climate change. Now, Mr Speaker, they might not like the progress that he is making as a minister. They may feel uncomfortable, Mr Speaker, about the progress that this minister is making. But, Mr Speaker, at the end of the day, the Australian people know when they see their power bills start to stabilise, and when they see the fact that we are taking the action that we need to on climate change without taking their jobs, they will know that the Labor party, once again, is on another frolic, Mr Speaker, and we know where these frolics always end. Labor’s Kristina Keneally has started the opposition question time attack with quotes from groups representing senior Australians, after the announcement of 10,000 more home care packages on Monday. Leading Age Services Australia described the $537m package as a “missed opportunity” that would disappoint the rest of the 120,000 people on the waitlist for a home care package. National Seniors Australia noted the 10,000 packages is “less than the number of people who died last year waiting for a package” (16,000). The aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, boasted the package was good news, and resorted to his standard defence that the rollout can’t be rushed, or else it will cause “Pink Batts” style problems of encouraging shonky operators. That set off a slanging match between Penny Wong and Eric Abetz about which issue was more serious – elderly people dying waiting for home care, or installers of home insulation dying on the job. The first dixer also goes to Colbeck. Perhaps the government sees this as the way to give a vote of confidence to ministers in Labor’s sights, or it wants to boast about the aged care package. In any event, the shouting continues. This is what happened just before Scott Morrison’s last answer on Angus Taylor. He’s just taking another document and is using the Josh Frydenberg dixer on how amazing the economy is to chat to advisers who sit in the wings. The phone is in hand and is getting a workout at the moment. In the meantime, Michael McCormack, displaying the leadership charisma of a bowl of soggy rice bubbles, attempted to deliver sentences featuring infrastructure. Angus Taylor has spent those questions grinning and tapping his feet. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: What actions is he taking, given the Strike Force Garrad investigation of the minister for emissions reduction, given his ministerial statement says, “Ministers must accept it is for the PM to decide when and where a minister should stand aside if that minister becomes subject of an official investigation of alleged, illegal or improper conduct.” 7.1, prime minister – what are you gonna do to implement it? Morrison: Now, this is a very recent matter, and I will be happy to take advice from the NSW police in relation to any matters that they’re pursuing. I will be taking advice from the NSW police on any matter that they are currently looking at. And I will form a view, Mr Speaker, based on taking that advice in considering these issues. And, Mr Speaker, I would only note this – I would only note this, Mr Speaker. And the leader of the opposition may want to reflect on the standard that he is setting, Mr Speaker. And I would simply note this – if there are questions ever being raised in any such investigations by any member sitting on that bench, well, Mr Speaker, he has clearly set a standard. Question time is turning into the Angus Taylor hour. Understandably. After Anthony Albanese’s line to caucus about the religious discrimination bill, the shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said this to Guardian Australia: Labor has been consulting widely across the entire community, holding dozens of meetings and roundtables with LGBTIQ groups, religious organisations and other community representatives. We will need to see the actual legislation the government proposes to bring before the parliament before we can decide whether any changes are needed. We agree with the core principle in the bills: that all Australians should be able to go about their lives free from discrimination. But any laws aimed at protecting Australians from discrimination because of their religious belief must not compromise anti-discrimination protections that already exist in the law for LGBTIQ and other Australians. The first question is on Angus Taylor following Anne Davies story: Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Moments ago, it was revealed that the New South Wales Police have formed a Strike Force to investigate possible criminal behaviour connected to the Minister for Emissions Reduction. What action will the Prime Minister take? Morrison: I would simply note that any investigations that are undertaken are a matter for authorities in other places other than here. And I would refer the member to those authorities in terms of what they are doing...Mr Speaker, there seems to be a presumption made by those on the other side, which they have a habit of making, Mr Speaker, and they...If they wish to make smears against members, Mr Speaker, there are standing orders that prevent them from doing that. And I assume that’s what they’re seeking to do on this occasion. A delegation from the Northern Territory is in parliament to talk to crossbench senators and MPs about the government’s proposal to expand the cashless debit card into the NT, replacing the Basics card. The delegation includes representatives from the Central Land Council, the NPY Women’s Council and the Arnhem Land Progress Association. Senator Malarndirri McCarthy said the group was advocating against the expansion of the cashless debut card, legislation for which has been introduced into the House. Dr Josie Douglas from the Central Land Council said there had not been consultation with affected Indigenous communities. The delegation has met Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie and Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie, as well as government representatives and Indigenous Australians minister, Ken Wyatt. She said the group had been “strongly encouraging” the crossbench to vote against the bill and had been given a positive reception, particular from Lambie. “We are thankful that the senator has listened to us and appreciates and understands there has been a lack of consultation,” Douglas said. Anne Davies has this update on the Angus Taylor document saga: New South Wales police have contacted the City of Sydney requesting information about downloads of its 2017-18 annual report after an altered version was relied upon by the energy minister, Angus Taylor, to lash the lord mayor, Clover Moore, over the council’s carbon footprint and accuse her of hypocrisy. NSW police said the investigation was in the early stages and detectives from the state crime command’s financial crimes squad had launched Strike Force Garrad to determine if any criminal offences had been committed. The doctored document, which contained grossly inflated travel figures for the 10 city councillors – it claimed they had spent $15m in a year – was quoted in a letter sent by Taylor to Moore on 29 September and provided at the same time to the Daily Telegraph, which used the figures in an article published the same day. In what Chris Kenny on Sky News has declared “very surprising comments” from Pauline Hanson, Hanson has implied China is attempting to take over Australia by bringing people here because the number of Chinese immigrants are “ever increasing”. “Yes, that is how I see the future, yes I do,” said Hanson to him a little earlier. This has now made Barnaby Joyce the voice of reason. We have every right to discuss influence on our nation, ownership of our nation, absolutely that is our sovereign right as a sovereign nation, but when you bring in this sort of stuff you actually reduce the argument. Because people say, ‘I told you, it’s all bat poo crazy what you were saying’ and this is an example why. If you actually go to the history of China, they are not an expansionist – there has never been, when they have been the pre-eminent power in the world – their desire to go live in other parts of the world, that is not how the middle kingdom works. But if you said there is an instance where the autocratic power of China tries to create supplicant states, well, yes, that is the case. You see that in places such as Cambodia and Laos. There is a desire of them to have an economic control which could be to the detriment of the people they have control over ... That is definitely something we should consider and definitely something we should make sure we protect our nation against. We are in the invidious position where we have to recognise they are our biggest trading partner ... and we have to recognise that China currently, the autocratic power that many people, Hong Kong for example, that many people don’t support, but as they push forward, we are very reticent to push back because we are aware of the consequences. For any power, that works very well, they just say, ‘We’ll keep pushing forward and pushing forward,’ but they are pushing forward on an economic basis and in some instances in a military basis. But they are not pushing forward by pushing their people into other countries. They haven’t done that before in history; they haven’t done that now. And it is a little perverse to suggest that for some unknown reason, people in China are going to stop wanting to live in China. It’s where Chinese people prefer to live, generally – China.” Pffft. Scientists. What do they know? Kevin Rudd, and his hand movements, were back in the building to launch Peter Hartcher’s Quarterly Essay today (Sarah Martin was there and has given you a taste a few posts down) In October the federal court ruled in favour of the Australian Workers Union regarding the Registered Organisations Commission raids, finding the “suspicion” that the union had breached its rules was not a reasonable ground to conduct the raid. But the case continued in order to decide what flowed from that in terms of whether evidence collected would need to be returned. On Tuesday Justice Mordecai Bromberg gave orders including: THE COURT DECLARES THAT: 1. The decision of the first respondent by his delegate Mr Chris Enright made on 20 October 2017 to commence investigation INV2017/30 into the applicant (“Decision”), is invalid. THE COURT ORDERS THAT: 2. The decision of the first respondent, by his delegate Mr Chris Enright, is quashed. 3. The second respondent (by himself or by his servants or agents) return to the applicant the documents seized pursuant to the warrants issued by Magistrate Reynolds on 24 October 2017 pursuant to s 335L of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (Cth). So the AWU has had the documents returned. Kevin Rudd has launched Peter Hartcher’s Quarterly Essay on Australia’s relationship with China, talking about the “difficult” relationship and making recommendations on what the government can do to improve ties. He would not comment on this week’s explosive revelations in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age about an alleged infiltration plot of Australia’s parliament, saying he was “out of the loop”, but said asylum should be considered for Liqiang Wang, the self-declared defecting Chinese spy who has sought protection from the Australian government. Rudd directed his barbs at the Liberal party’s approach to China after the change in government in 2013, saying both Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull had “capitulated” to the Chinese on a range of issues. He singled out Australia’s retreat from the Pacific as having “opened the door” to Chinese influence in the region, pointing to Australia’s cuts to the aid budget and weak climate change policy. Australia had been “reckless” by cutting the aid budget. He also criticised the Turnbull government for allowing the Chinese to lease the port of Darwin, saying the port was the point of entry for US marines and equipment. “The Americans were horrified, while the Chinese couldn’t believe their luck.” However, the former PM also warned against “yellow peril”, saying the crackdown on foreign influence could easily lead to a form of racial profiling and warned against a “populist witch-hunt”. The AWU has had a win in the federal court, with Justice Mordecai Bromberg ordering a return of the documents seized during the 2017 raid on the AWU offices. The ACTU has announced the news, linking it to the ensuring integrity bill: Justice Bromberg has ruled that the [Registered Organisations Commission] did not have grounds to order an AFP raid on the offices of the AWU and has ordered the return of the documents that were seized on behalf of the regulator in their first act after being established by the Liberal government in 2017. The decision comes as the Morrison government attempts to pass the ensuring integrity bill in the Senate which would give the ROC the extreme power to determine which unions are deregistered and which officials are disqualified under the dangerous and hypocritical new union-busting law. Under the EI bill the ROC would have the power to begin deregistration proceedings against a union which had made a handful of paperwork mistakes over a period of 10 years. Josh Frydenberg said the government would be introducing two more pieces of legislation related to the banking royal commission recommendations this week. Labor says only six of the 76 recommendations have so far been implemented, meaning the government is running out of time to meet its own timetable. Stephen Jones: After yet another banking scandal, it’s clear the government haven’t got the message. Only six of the 76 banking royal commission recommendations have been implemented. It has been 299 days since the government received the royal commission recommendations. I think it’s fair for the public to be asking what the government has been doing. The government talks a big game on banks, but we all know that their heart isn’t really in it. The Nationals water minister, David Littleproud, is calling for “calm, leadership and common sense” in the NSW water debate and I cannot stop laughing at the irony. Littleproud says it’s important the New South Wales government understands the full ramifications of withdrawing from the Murray-Darling basin plan. “The federal government would be potentially forced by NSW to recover water by buybacks, not the $1bn of water infrastructure we are prepared to deliver,” he said. “I don’t support buybacks. They destroy communities and I don’t want to be forced by law to undertake them if NSW pulls out. “That would be the outcome of leaving the plan. “We want to spend that money on water infrastructure to help stimulate NSW basin economies and create jobs. “The facts are clear: pulling out of the plan would not deliver one drop of water to a NSW farmer. “Ripping up the plan will only result in a worse one. “This is a time to show leadership and work together to get the best outcome in these difficult times.” Parliament’s human rights committee is unusually torn, AAP reports. Labor and the Greens are arguing against the government to seek an urgent change to laws aimed at reducing restraints in aged care. The deputy chair of the traditionally bipartisan committee, Labor MP Graham Perrett, says the legislation creates confusion that could lead to physical and chemical restraints being used without consent. “The dissenting report recommends that ... a new instrument be urgently reintroduced that ensures there is informed consent for the use of chemical restraints, a reduction in the use of restraints, and oversight and effective reporting on the use of restraints,” he told parliament. Andrew Leigh had a chat to Adelaide radio 5AA this morning, which included this exchange: AL: There is some great economic research that suggests that much of the pleasure of holidays comes not from having them, but from anticipating them. So our family always tries to plan our holidays as far in advance as we can, so we can have that anticipation effect. Question: But Andrew, isn’t that about everything in life? Isn’t the anticipation, the pre-savouring of something, far more interesting than the actual meal? AL: Everything except chocolate, sex and television, I entirely agree. Question: [laughter] Chocolate, sex and television. AL: They’re the three that I think don’t let you down in the enjoyment. Question: Now is this going to be the title of the next book? AL: It could be, couldn’t it? Television?! “I’d like to see the banks reined in a lot more ... I am not saying where I stand on the integrity bill. I still need to have more discussions with the unions,” Pauline Hanson says. Hanson says she was busy at the weekend so has only just had a chance to look over the amendments Christian Porter released on the bill late on Friday. “I will not be rushed on this,” she says. Pauline Hanson is on Sky, saying she believes there is “a place for unions in Australia, by all means” but by the sound of things, she is close to agreeing to the bill. There are whispers around that the government will seek to reorder business in the Senate this afternoon to bring on the ensuring integrity debate – but not the vote. We’ll keep an eye on that. Josh Frydenberg: I’ve been consistent and clear. Decisions about who are on boards are matters for shareholders. Decisions about who are on senior management teams are decisions for boards. But these alleged breaches are of the most serious nature. And there needed to be accountability. You heard very strong language from our prime minister, from myself, and from other ministers, about the seriousness of these issues and the need for accountability at the bank. I also want to point out that our financial services sector contributes about 10% of GDP, employs more than 400,000 Australians. It’s a vitally important sector to our economy. And we need to continue to ensure that they uphold the highest standards of professionalism, but also that we have strong financial institutions. Because it’s our banks that ensure the flow of credit to households for their mortgages and for other borrowings and to businesses as they continue to innovate, to expand, and grow. So it’s very important that we have a financial services sector that only upholds the highest standards of professionalism, that that continues to prosper, and to support the Australian economy. The Greens also want to cap banking executive pay. That comes after the news Brian Hartzer will get a year’s payout – just over $2.6m. Just picking up from Paul Karp’s tweet a bit earlier about the Labor caucus, the main development was the opposition bracing for the religious freedom debate. In his leader’s report, Anthony Albanese told the troops that Labor ended the year with “a clear strategic plan”. He said the campaign review had been handed down, and that drew a line over looking at the past. He said the next of his vision statements would be delivered on 7 December. Albanese has done two of these thus far, the first on jobs and the second on the economy. The next one will be on the theme of democracy. Labor has begun the process of selecting members of the national policy forum ahead of the party’s national conference, which will be held in Canberra at the end of next year. There was a briefing for caucus members about the constitutional recognition of Indigenous people and the voice to parliament. Albanese also said it was “beyond belief” that Angus Taylor remained a minister of the crown after the botched criticism of the Sydney lord mayor, and he signalled Labor would continue to pursue Taylor. Asked if he, or the government put pressure on Brian Hartzer to resign, Josh Frydenberg says: I’ve had conversations with Westpac and those discussions were constructive. I made clear the seriousness of those issues, but also the bank itself and the board itself has been having many meetings – including with its own shareholders – and in our conversation this morning with the chairman he told me, before the public announcement, of what was to take place. Josh Frydenberg says more legislation inspired from the banking royal commission recommendations will be coming this week, as he officially responds to the Westpac news: A lack of appropriate oversight by the board, and a systemic failure by the bank. As you’re aware, both Apra and Asic – in addition to Austrac – are conducting their own inquiries. And Apra is doing that under the Banking Executive Accountability Regime at that the coalition introduced and that took effect in 2018. Together with the Bear – the Banking Executive Accountability Regime – we’ve also increased both the civil and criminal penalties for misconduct in the financial sector. We’ve boosted the resources of our regulators. We’re putting in place a criminal division of the federal court. And we’re taking action on all 76 recommendations of the royal commission. And this week, I’ll be introducing two pieces of legislation which will implement more of those royal commission recommendations. For some reason, I am reminded of Edgar Allan Poe’s line of: I swung the chair upon which I had been sitting, and grated it upon the boards, but the noise arose over all and continually increased. It grew louder – louder – louder! In other news, the parliament bells are ringing. This is interesting as well Looks like the official government response on the Westpac news is coming – Josh Frydenberg has called a press conference for 11.50am in the Senate Courtyard-Mural Hall- Senate Courtyard* That is 10 minutes before the parliament sits, so it limits the questioning time as well. *Seems like there has been some moving around of the press conference at the last minute, but they’ve decided on the Senate courtyard From AAP: An unlikely alliance of federal politicians have joined forces to demand WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange be brought back to Australia. The group, which includes Tasmanian independent Andrew Wilkie and Queensland conservative George Christensen, are concerned about Assange’s health and potential extradition from the UK to America. The pair described his treatment as a direct attack on journalists. “The group is unanimously and strongly of the view that the US extradition request of Mr Assange be rescinded and that he be allowed to return to Australia,” Wilkie said on Tuesday. The politicians want to meet with the US ambassador and UK high commissioner to Australia to discuss Assange’s case. The parliament will begin sitting at midday. Woo. Hoo. Penny Wong was also doorstopped about the China situation this morning. Here is some of what she had to say in the hallway: Question: Should there be vetting of candidates before the election? And do you think Gladys Liu owes the parliament an explanation? PW: Well in relation to the second part, Gladys Liu has refused to give a statement to the parliament. She has been protected from doing so by Mr Morrison. I do believe that in circumstances where discrepancies have been raised on the public record, where issues have been raised, parliamentarians should make a statement to the parliament. Mr Morrison has never explained why he refuses to do so. Q: And in terms of potential vetting of candidates? PW: Look, I think all political parties, particularly parties of government, do have to ensure that our processes are robust and that Australian sovereignty is safeguarded. You might recall that in the last parliament, Labor sought for a number of years – and the government finally reluctantly agreed – to the banning of foreign donations. Rex Patrick has been pushing for more security vetting of candidates and MPs, and wants MPs to have security checks done, similar to what staffers and public servants undergo, with the results presented to the prime minister of the day, who can then determine the response (what, if any committees they would be eligible to sit on, cabinet positions, access etc). So far, it has not received a lot of support from the major parties. Chris Bowen was also asked about the government’s assertion that it was taking its time responding to the aged care royal commission interim report, because it did not want another “pink batts” situation. This was Scott Morrison yesterday: Now, I’m not going to rush that and see things put into legislation that could have been addressed through the consultation period that would otherwise have avoided some unintended consequence. I’m going to make sure we give that time to work with the sector to make sure that these legislative responses are correct. I don’t understand Labor’s position. What are they expecting, that we should have some rushed and harried legislation? That’s how you end up with pink batts fiascos and overpriced school halls, when you don’t take care on making responses to these things. And we are taking care. This is a very, very significant priority of the government, to get this right. Just as all the other matters are, and we will continue to just work through that process of delivering on our agenda. Bowen: What an insult what a disgusting insult to Australians on the waiting list for in-home care packages or on the waiting list for aged care. I mean, this is a government who is funding 10,000 extra places when the waiting list is over 100,000, with 16,000 Australians dying on the waiting list last year, and to justify the paltry rollout of care places, he compares it to pink batts. That is a disgusting insult and he should withdraw and apologise today. Sarah Hanson-Young has written about her defamation court victory against David Leyonhjelm in the Guardian today: Chris Bowen is responding to this story: (As reported by Melissa Davey) Private health insurance will continue its slow death spiral unless unnecessary private hospital costs and exorbitant specialist bills are reined in, a Grattan Institute report has found. The report, written by health economists Stephen Duckett and Kristina Nemet, said a small minority of greedy specialist doctors billed their patients at more than twice the official Medicare benefit schedule fee. Patients were not being told about the fees in advance. “Only about 7% of all in-hospital medical services are billed at this rate, yet these bills account for almost 90% of all out-of-pocket medical costs for private hospital patients,” the report said. “If these high-charging specialists only billed patients 50% more than the official Medicare benefits schedule fee then patients would save $350m each year.” Bowen: Greg Hunt is fiddling while private health insurance burns and across Australia people know it is broken and not working for them and they are voting with their feet. Greg Hunt has been warned and warned and warned and he’s refused to act and he’s told us he’s delivered the biggest reforms in history. Newsflash, Greg, all of Australia knows they haven’t worked and today we have another report pointing out that private health insurance needs big reform. What is minister Hunt’s answer? To try to distract with a thought bubble. A thought bubble which I put to you has not been to the cabinet of Australia. Release your policy, Greg, show us the modelling and tell us the details about how your idea will fix private health insurance and how it will make it more valuable for Australians. Extending private health insurance to some procedures currently done in hospital and could be done at home and elsewhere is a worthy enough idea but it is not the holistic reform that private health insurance needs. Private health insurance needs a big fix, not fiddling. The Greens have once again picked up their fight against political donations: “The fact is that if we banned political donations and introduced election spending caps, then no foreign entity or vested interest would be able to buy their way into parliament,” Richard Di Natale said. “The additional safeguards against foreign interference supported by both major parties will fail unless real action is also taken on donations reform,” Larissa Waters said. “It’s time for Labor and the Coalition to join the Greens in calling for banning political donations from all big for-profit corporates and foreign entities so no one – not Clive Palmer and no foreign government – has more influence on Australia’s democracy than our citizens do.” Meanwhile, Katharine Murphy has the latest Guardian Essential poll (caveats on polls implied). An increasing proportion of voters worry Australia is not doing enough to reduce the risks of climate change, and more people see a direct link between warming and bushfires, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. Ominously for the Morrison government, which bristles at regular public criticism it is not doing enough to reduce the risks of the climate crisis, 60% of the sample of 1,083 voters believes Australia should be doing more. This is up from 51% in March. Just under half the sample, 43%, believes it is likely bushfires are linked to climate change, and argues it is entirely appropriate to discuss that link during an emergency of the scale we’ve seen around Australia over the past fortnight. When this question was last put to survey respondents in 2013, only 27% of the sample had this view. Medevac is still listed for debate tomorrow. Peter Dutton is still working on negotiating with Jacqui Lambie for her support. Kristina Keneally is working to debunk some of Dutton’s public claims on medevac: If you listen to Mr Dutton, you would believe that he is somehow powerless when it comes to medevac. Nothing could be further from the truth. And the Independent Health Advice Panel reports that are tabled in the Senate show that under the medevac laws the minister retains the power to determine who comes into the country when it comes to security grounds – that is un-appealable and unquestionable. Those reports also show that when the minister or doctors the minister appoints, approve a transfer on medical grounds, people are able to get the healthcare they need. Those reports also show that when the minister refuses a determination on medical grounds – a recommendation on medical grounds – that has been more often than not upheld by the doctors the minister has appointed. In every step of the way the minister or doctors appointed by the minister make decisions about who needs a medical transfer. And around and around we go. There have been some reports about some of the charges some of the medevac transfers are facing. It is worth mentioning that people transferred under medevac remain in detention and under guard. And also, as you may have noticed, we still treat people who have been convicted of some pretty heinous crimes. Ivan Milat, for instance, received the necessary treatment for his cancer in the last months of his life. The argument that we should not give the necessary treatments independent doctors have decided are necessary because of either charges (and you know, innocent before being proven guilty and all that) or crimes, is a very slippery slope for a democratic and compassionate society to start wandering down. The government is still attempting to extend the cashless debit card – which would include installing it across the Northern Territory. Labor’s NT senator Malarndirri McCarthy has been fighting against it. She had a chat to her local ABC this morning, ahead of when the bill is slated for debate: MM: My hope is that if there is still concern amongst the crossbenchers, if they haven’t made a decision then that may mean the government isn’t confident enough to bring it into the House. But that’s a hopeful scenario obviously that I’m hoping for and the delegation from Central Australia is hoping for but it’s quite likely that it possibly still will go through the House. Question: Can you tell us who’s been there from central Australia? MM: Yes of course. We have here in Canberra walking the halls is the Central Land Council representatives, also the NPY Women’s [Council] and also the Arnhem Land Progress Association from Arnhem Land who’ve come down as well so there’s quite a large delegation who have come down in the hope that they can stop the cashless debit card being passed. Q: Jacqui Lambie is seen as being the key vote in the Senate. Have you got any idea of which way she is leaning at the moment? MM: Look I’ve been working very hard with the crossbenchers and certainly with senator Lambie. What I have asked is for time to take her to the Northern Territory, to Central Australia and to Arnhem Land to actually hear from people herself. If she had that opportunity, Stuart, I do believe that she would have a better understanding of the concerns that people have and the fact that they don’t want it in the Northern Territory. Kevin Rudd is in Canberra today – he will be launching Peter Hartcher’s quarterly essay (on China) at midday Tis the season His face sums up how I feel seeing a Queenslander wear blue for a footy match And here is another indication of where question time is headed: A group of north Queensland dairy farmers are on their way to Canberra to express their frustrations at what is happening within their industry. That’s at the same time the Nationals are trying to get ahead of Pauline Hanson, who may have come late to the issues, but certainly has been running full steam ahead since becoming aware of it. And Joel Fitzgibbon from Labor is very happy to poke that particular wound. This was him on Sky News this morning: David Littleproud, the drought minister, some time ago said he fixed the supermarket [milk price] problem. He said he thumped his chest, waved his fists at them, and demanded they put their milk prices up. Well, we know that solution lasted about five minutes. They are still fiddling with this dairy code of conduct. It’s now more than 20 months since the ACCC recommended we have a mandatory code of conduct for the dairy industry. The Labor party has been supporting one for a number of years, so there has been no interference from the opposition party. There is no excuse, and yet they’re still arguing within the National party and the Liberal parties about what this diary code of conduct should look like. This is after, of course, introducing a sugar code, a code of conduct for the sugar industry literally overnight a number of years ago when Scott Morrison was the treasurer.” That came after Queensland LNP senator, Susan McDonald, told ABC radio that consumers should be telling supermarkets to raise the price of milk in order to pay farmers more. Fitzgibbon says it is not up to consumers to fix the problem. Stuart Robert is the latest MP to decide Twitter streams just really need more emojis: He has a long way to go to catch up to Kimberley Kitching though. The “keep medevac” advocacy is still going strong. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is the latest to urge senators (meaning Jacqui Lambie) to stay the course: GP and chair of the RACGP Refugee Health Network Dr Kate Walker said that repealing the legislation would be a huge mistake. Asylum seekers and refugees must be able to receive a proper level of healthcare as determined by qualified medical professionals. What this legislation does is give doctors, not administrators, greater power in determining whether people on Manus Island or Nauru require transfer to Australia for medical treatment. At least 200 patients have been transferred for urgent medical care using the medevac legislation. That is how it should be – doctors making a judgment on what type of care is needed. It is party room time, so the building has gone quiet. We’ll bring you the updates from that very soon Jim Chalmers also gave us an idea of where Labor’s attacks will be going today: My criticism of the government when it comes to the banking royal commission is that they talked a big game before the election when they knew people wanted to hear tough talk on the banks and then afterwards they dragged their feet. Now they’ve got a roadmap for implementing the banking royal commission’s recommendations that needs to be adhered to. They’ve got the so-called BEAR legislation that they passed a couple of years ago. They should be looking for every avenue and every opportunity to hold the banks accountable and to clean up the banks so that Australians can have confidence in the system again. Labor, today through Penny Wong, is continuing to raise the issue of Gladys Liu never having provided a statement to parliament about her associations with groups linked to the Chinese Communist party. It is almost impossible to separate Chinese businesses from the Chinese Communist party. And there is no suggestion Liu has any issues herself. But Labor says she should have provided a statement to the parliament to put any lingering concerns to bed. I think from my perspective, it’s less it’s not of ethnicity, it’s an issue of transparency,” Wong told RN. And I have been critical of of Ms Liu, the member for Chisholm, and I was critical because, her story had discrepancies and there was a failure of disclosure in relation to substantial donations. This is not about ethnicity, this is about making sure we have appropriate transparency. And it is, I think, a matter of record and a matter of regret that this government has been – dragged its feet when it comes to a whole range of transparency issues around foreign donations, which at their heart are about protecting the integrity of Australia’s democratic system. The medevac repeal bill is still ticking away in the background. It is meant to come up for debate on Wednesday, but it is a moving feast at this stage. Jacqui Lambie will decide the bill’s fate. There is some suggestion floating around that Lambie may seek to amend the bill to give the minister more powers. Critics say if that happens, the whole point of medevac – to give doctors more power to make independent medical decisions – will be moot. Negotiations continue. I think Greg Hunt really wants you to know Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg were VERY CLEAR about what they wanted to happen in terms of Westpac. Here he is after his Sky interview, where he said much the same thing: I think is appropriate. I think it is necessary and it follows the strongest, clearest comments from the prime minister and treasurer about community and government expectations in the face of a serious and profound breaches.” In case you missed it yesterday, Paul Karp had a story on the latest with FOIs surrounding Angus Taylor: The environment department has blocked access to two emails about Angus Taylor’s use of incorrect figures to attack the City of Sydney’s travel spending, claiming they are exempt from freedom of information because they relate to an unspecified “ongoing process”. In response to Labor’s FOI request, the department has refused access to two emails sent at 8.52am on 25 October – the day after Guardian Australia revealed the controversy – and a second email chain at 3.23pm on the same day. Penny Wong was on RN this morning talking about China. Sorry for the delay – the Westpac news interrupted my transcription time, but here is some of the interview: You know, China is continuing to develop and change politically and we need to have a very clear understanding of that. I mean, I think the China relationship should be above domestic partisan politics. And I’d encourage the prime minister, Mr Morrison and the foreign minister, Senator Payne to make it so. Wong agreed that this was a “tricky time” for Australia: I again, go back to where I started. This is a complex, consequential relationship. It’s a relationship that, you know, we need to continue to engage – but we have to recognise that engagement does entail us ensuring we safeguard our sovereignty in our democracy. And that I think demands a discussion, and a policy framework that is led by the government, not – with all due respect to the media who are doing, you know their job in a in a making sure there is transparency – this should be led by the government and they should engage the parliament and the opposition. This is good news – from Ken Wyatt and Paul Fletcher: The Morrison Government welcomes the return of the remains of 45 Australian Indigenous ancestors from Germany to communities in South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. A ceremony will be held this week at the Grassi Museum in Leipzig, with five community members attending to receive their ancestors and accompany them home. Thirty-five ancestral remains will be returned to the Gunaikurnai people in Victoria, six ancestors to the Menang people in Western Australia; and one old person to the Ngarrindjeri people in South Australia. Three ancestral remains will return to Australia under the stewardship of the Commonwealth Government and be placed into temporary care while further research and consultation is undertaken to determine their community of origin. Minister for Communications, Cyber Safety and the Arts, the Hon Paul Fletcher said the repatriation brings the total number of Australian Indigenous ancestors repatriated to Australia from Germany through the Indigenous Repatriation Program to 150, and is the second repatriation from Germany this year. Jim Chalmers stopped by doors to give Labor’s response to the Westpac news: Labor welcomes the resignation of Westpac CEO Brian Hartzer. The behaviour at Westpac under Brian Hartzer’s leadership was nothing short of disgraceful. Brian Hartzer had no option but to resign after the extremely serious and appalling revelations of what has gone on in Westpac over a period of some years. After 23m breaches of the counter-terrorism and anti-money laundering laws, Brian Hartzer had no option. We welcome the decision that he’s taken today to step down. There was no other alternative for Brian Hartzer but to step down. This decision today doesn’t, of itself, fix all of the issues which have emerged in recent weeks about the behaviour of Westpac over a period of some years. There’s a legal process. I think Australians will be looking for all kinds of accountability when it comes to the behaviour of Westpac. They will welcome Brian Hartzer’s resignation, but they will be looking for every avenue for the bank to be made accountable for what are appalling, astounding and disgraceful actions, which have been uncovered. In a week when the Morrison government’s highest priority is to pick on workers and unions, it beggars belief that for so long now the Morrison government has gone soft on the banks, resisted a banking royal commission, voted against it 26 times, dragged their feet on the recommendations of the banking royal commission. We need to make sure that the Australian people can have confidence in their banks and in their financial system. It’s a key part of the economy. Actions like that, which has been uncovered at Westpac, only damage confidence in the banking system. We need to make sure that people can feel, with some confidence, that the banking system works for them and not against them. “You could not have heard stronger, clearer positions set out by the prime minister in response to what were frankly, quite shocking allegations,” Greg Hunt tells Sky in response to the Brian Hartzer news. Westpac made the announcement in a statement to the ASX. You can find that, here. Among the titbits – Brian Hartzer leaves with a year’s pay, $2.686m – but he loses out on some bonuses. Peter King becomes acting CEO, with a $2.1m pay packet. The Westpac statement announcing Brian Hartzer’s departure includes this line, just in case anyone was unclear about the motivations: As was appropriate, we sought feedback from all of our stakeholders, including shareholders, and having done so it became clear that board and management changes were in the best interests of the bank. Wow, a minute really is a long time in news these days. Just breaking – Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer will step down from the bank on 2 December, AAP reports. We’ll have more on that very soon. On the Westpac front, the Australian had quite the story this morning, with insights from a closed-door meeting with the Westpac boss, Brian Hartzer. From the report: Mr Hartzer, who is fighting to remain in Westpac’s top job, tried to assure the bank’s most senior leaders that the scandal “was not playing out as a high street issue”. “We all read the Fin [The Australian Financial Review] and The Australian, and we all read that and think the world is ending,” he said, according to the two people. “But actually for people in mainstream Australia going about their daily lives, this is not a major issue so we don’t need to overcook this.” You can find the whole report, here. The board, and Hartzer, are trying to find a way to hold on to their jobs in the wake of the financial intelligence agency, Austrac, announcing it had launched proceedings against Australia’s oldest bank for 23m failures to uphold its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism responsibilities. Among the alleged failures were transactions being used to facilitate child exploitation. Josh Frydenberg announced, since confirmed by the banking regulator itself, that Apra was looking at ways it could disqualify the board. All eyes will be on what shareholders do when the bank holds its annual general meeting on 12 December. Meanwhile, the bank has announced it has cancelled its Christmas party and that some bonuses (not all) will be scrapped or partly scrapped. “Yeah, nah, that’s not it” has never seemed more relevant. We enter the seventh last sitting day for the year at a slightly calmer pace than yesterday. The big story from yesterday – allegations Beijing attempted to infiltrate our parliament – is still ticking over. China’s foreign ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang, spoke of the issue during his daily news briefing yesterday, telling journalists that some of Australia’s media and politicians had “become seized with imaginary fears” about China’s influence. “They constantly fabricate cases of so-called Chinese spies infiltrating Australia ... However bizarre the story, lies are still lies in the end, whatever new guise they wear.” In the meantime, we are watching our politicians try to balance Australia’s trade relationship with China – which accounts for about a third of our export revenue – and cracking down on alleged attempts to influence our political system. That will continue to unfold today. But domestically, we have other worries. Among them is a growing concern about the climate. The 2019 Scanlon Foundation’s Mapping Social Cohesion report found we have bumped up climate change and its effects on our list of nightly worries. As David Marr reports: This is the verdict of the Scanlon Foundation’s 2019 Mapping Social Cohesion report, published on Tuesday. The mission of the foundation for the past decade or so has been to measure how this migrant nation hangs together. In that time an extraordinary 50,000 of us have been polled to track the hopes and fears that sweep Australia – and not just about immigration. The author of the reports, Prof Andrew Markus of Monash University, finds most Australians now share “an underlying concern about the government not properly managing the situation – the impact on overcrowding, house prices, environment”. We’ve already seen that play out in recent weeks, with the debate over whether or not a bushfire emergency was the right time to talk about cause and effect. Overwhelmingly, our leaders said it wasn’t (and yes, despite the term “leader”, I include Michael McCormack in this) but it turns out, they probably got that wrong. We’ve seen Scott Morrison go quiet and then come back talking about how his government acknowledges climate change, and has policies in place to deal with it. But it’s getting harder to spin such a flimsy message, and summer hasn’t properly begun as yet. We’ll have that as well, plus party room meetings, plus Westpac’s ongoing fallout and whatever news happens on medevac and ensuring integrity. Mike Bowers is here, as is Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. I’ve had two coffees and am headed for a third. So let’s get into it."

          "bodyText": "When Victoria booked an adventure holiday to Iceland in 2016, she wasn’t expecting anything more than a break from her job as a midwife. But after Bernie met her on the group tour, he fell for her immediately. “I think I was probably chasing her all week,” he says. The trip was packed with outdoors sports and sightseeing, but he couldn’t focus on the activities. “People ask me what they should do in Iceland and I have no idea,” he says. “All I remember is being blown away by Vic.” After forging a close friendship, neither of them felt ready to say goodbye. “He said he’d come to the airport with me,” says Victoria. Although his flight back to New York was much later, he wanted an excuse to spend more time with her. Bernie asked if she had more holidays on the horizon. “I had a few days off several weeks later,” she recalls. “So he asked if I wanted to meet up again.” Inspired by the flight board in the airport, the pair decided to visit Dublin for a mini-break. “I said yes, but I never expected him to travel all that way,” says Victoria. “It was much easier for me, being based in the UK.” For the next few weeks, the couple sent each other flirty texts while they planned their trip. “I had no idea if it would be more than friendship,” says Bernie. “I booked loads of tours and two hotel rooms.” While he didn’t want to be presumptuous, he says he packed some chocolates and bubble bath “just in case”. When they shared their first kiss, they both knew it would become more. “We didn’t go on any of the trips I booked, but it’s the best money I ever wasted,” says Bernie. Over the next two months they travelled to Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and Puerto Rico. Bernie also flew to the UK, to spend Christmas with Victoria and her family. Not long after they met, Victoria accepted a nine-month midwifery job on the island of St Helena in the South Atlantic. Despite their budding romance, Bernie was supportive. “He encouraged me to do it.” Once she was there, they had to cope with poor internet and phone services. “We wrote each other hand-written letters to stay in touch,” Victoria says. And then he made the five-day voyage from Cape Town on a Royal Mail ship to visit her. “There were no flights available at the time. I arrived totally emaciated. My seasickness was so bad that they had to give me injections every day.” He looked “terrible” when he arrived, Victoria says – but she knew he must be serious about her. After St Helena, Victoria took a sabbatical to be with Bernie. They spent several months living in New York before travelling to Argentina, where they married in early 2018. “This meant that we could live together in the UK while Vic went back to work as a midwife in London,” says Bernie. “I run a nonprofit sustainable-food organisation called Food Tank, which I was able to do remotely.” The time difference meant he started later in the day, and could walk his wife to work beside the Thames every morning. While Victoria says she loves Bernie’s sense of humour and his zest for life, he was attracted to her compassionate nature. “I’ve never met a kinder human being. And she makes me laugh constantly. She’s pure joy.” In April 2019, the couple moved to New York to begin their next adventure. “I’ve been working on an off-Broadway musical about climate change called Garjana, which is going to be on stage next year,” says Bernie. Victoria is studying at Columbia University to get the extra qualifications she needs to be a midwife in the US. They live in Manhattan with their cockapoo puppy, Charley. “Bernie is amazing and such a great doggy dad,” says Victoria. • Want to share your story?

          "bodyText": "Until recently, I was firm in my Scrooge-like belief that the only good Christmas sandwich was the kind cobbled together before the Boxing Day movie starts on the TV. Perhaps we all soften as we get older, but having tried 23 of the current commercial crop and lived to type the tale, I think 2019 is a vintage harvest: most of the turkey versions have ditched that sinister smooth “stuffing” sausage that was once all the rage, and some contain actual vegetables, although it’s a shame how few use free-range meat. On the non-traditional front, the world’s blandest combination– brie and cranberry – finally has some more interesting competition. If someone makes one with bread sauce next year, I might even declare myself a convert. FC Turkey sandwiches M&amp;S Turkey Feast Sandwich, £3.50 M&amp;S is donating 5% from the sales of its festive food to the homelessness charity Shelter, and I recommend you give generously. This is a sandwich as rich as Herod himself, packed with turkey and herby stuffing mayonnaise – the cranberry sauce might be a step too far if you’re hoping to get any work done afterwards, though. Alas, it comes on terrible bread. 3/5 Asda Turkey Tower, £3 This one truly boggles my baubles. Apparently, it contains smoked pulled turkey, stuffing and a cranberry coleslaw, but all I could focus on was the huge slab of bubble and squeak that takes up half the bun. As a fully paid-up member of the carb-on-carb fan club, this very much appeals. It’s a bit different, at least. 3/5 Waitrose Coronation Turkey Wrap with Spinach and Coriander, £3.30 A welcome hit of spice – and I love the freshness of the spinach and coriander, although the wrap itself dissolves into a bland mush in the centre; the honey, whisky and apricot chutney might have been a step too far. 3/5 Greggs Christmas Lunch, £2.75 Lots of filling, and a decent crumbly stuffing, but the limp pancetta and lettuce and overabundance of mayonnaise made it feel as if I was eating a club sandwich from Pret. Not bad, but not very festive. 2/5 Lidl Festive Turkey Wrap, £1.79 Most of these turkey sandwiches are daringly low on vegetable matter – a few spinach or rocket leaves hardly count – making Lidl’s sprout and onion coleslaw feels like a touch of genius, supplying a rare freshness and crunch the others lack. Extra marks for bravely leaving out the cloying cranberry sauce. 3/5 Pret’s Christmas Lunch, £3.95 – **WINNER** As the only sandwich that claims to use free-range meat, this one won my heart even before I discovered that 50p from the sale of each Pret Christmas sandwiches goes to help the homeless. Fortunately, it’s not just a worthy gesture: generously filled, the crumbly apricot-sweet stuffing is a distinct improvement on the last Pret Christmas sandwich I tried, and I like the chunky cranberries. Could do with being on more robust bread, though. I hate wet bread. 4/5 Tesco Finest Turkey Feast Sandwich, £3 Another respectable effort let down by disappointing stuffing: soft but sturdy bread and lots of filling, but the pork, chestnut and onion stuffing has an odd, faintly musty flavour that I’m blaming on the dried sage. 2.5/5 Pret’s Christmas Lunch on Gluten-Free Bread, £3.75 This is an open sandwich, a wise choice as gluten-free bread tends to be dense. It’s pretty good, but you’re destined to get mayonnaise on your Christmas jumper. 3/5 Aldi Turkey Feast Sandwich, £1.69 More like turkey mayonnaise than turkey feast – and no salad. It is cheap, though. 1/5 Boots Christmas Turkey Feast Sandwich, £2.75 There’s so much mayonnaise in here that I found myself desperately searching for solid bits of turkey. 1/5 Non-turkey sandwiches EAT Brie, Cranberry and Nut Stuffing on Onion Seed, from £3.99 Woof, there’s a lot going on here – the nuts give it chew and the bread’s good, but the nigella seeds make it feel as if I’m eating a naan, which is confusing. 3/5 Morrisons Wensleydale and Spiced Fruit Chutney, £3 – **WINNER** Essentially an eccles cake and cheese between two slices of lightly fruited panettone, but although the boozy chutney is a bit sweet, it’s also pleasantly zesty, and works well with the salty, creamy Wensleydale. 4/5 Waitrose Brie and Cranberry Sandwich, £3 A generous amount of brie, but it’s so young and under-seasoned that, in combination with the sugary cranberry sauce, it felt as if I was eating a butter and jam sandwich with spinach and mayonnaise. Public service announcement: a brie sandwich does not require mayonnaise. 2/5 Sainsbury’s Christmas Market Sandwich, £3 I was initially puzzled as to why a ham hock, gherkins, sauerkraut and beer-flavoured mayonnaise would remind me of a Christmas market, but it’s a good, emphatically savoury offering, so I was prepared to let it pass even before I discovered it’s a tribute to German Christmas markets, rather than the British kind selling unlocked mobiles and bowls of onions. 3/5 Waitrose Pigs Under Blankets, £3 Deeply unpleasant. 1/5 Greggs Pigs Under Blankets baguette, £3 Equally damp and sad as the above. 1/5 Vegan sandwiches rated by Meera Sodha Asda Roasted Cauliflower And Hummus This is the type of innovation I am curious about. A mashup of Israeli, Lebanese, Indian and British cuisine. It’s substantial but, sadly, I don’t think any of these flavours work together. And this is the cauliflower of the 1980s ... boiled and a bit soggy. 1/5 Boots Vegan Sausage This looks really unappetising, doesn’t it? But never judge a sandwich by its colour – it’s quite tasty. The sausage, mustard and onion flavour combination is comforting and reminiscent of childhood, which is quite lovely. 3.5/5 Starbucks Very Merry Vegan Wrap This is really vibrant looking and I’m glad Starbucks has done something different to the traditional roast. I suppose it doesn’t really say Christmas, does it? I guess they’ve gone down the joy route – lots of colour, crunch and hoping for the best. 4/5 Waitrose Smoked Carrot And Dill It looks like rabbit food and I’m not sure it would be very filling. It’s more of a sandwich for a summer picnic. It does, however, smell amazing; the dill and the smokiness work really well together, but it sets you up for smoked salmon and ends up tasting like … well, carrot. 2.5/5 Wicked Kitchen Pea Protein (Tesco) “We’re proud graduates of the university of common sense,” it says on the packet. That is vomit-inducing, and the phrase “pea protein pieces” is never going to create a fire in anybody’s belly. But it’s not bad as a lighter option – like a fresh Christmas salad wrapped in a tortilla. 3/5 M&amp;S Nutcracker - **WINNER** It feels as if this is going for a hashtag with that name. There’s sweet potato, cranberry, nut roast and almond butter dressing. Plus, some nice crunch from the pistachios. It has been made with love and I’d be really happy to buy one. 5/5 Sainsbury’s Christmas New Yorker This conjures up images of 90s films about Christmas in New York. This has a “coconut based vegan alternative to cheese” which is a wild idea and it works. The pickles give this sandwich quite a striking personality, it just needs a bit more filling. 4/5 Pret’s Very Merry Christmas Lunch Vegan Sandwich Pret never lets you down on filling. The quality of bread is good, the spinach is fresh and I think there’s some cumin in there. It’s just a bit stodgy. It reminds me of vegetarian food of the past which was always in need of something more to lift it up. This might send me to sleep after eating it – which would, at least, be reminiscent of Christmas dinner. 3/5 Waitrose Christmas Vegan No Turkey Feast “Soy protein” doesn’t set my heart alight ... I don’t see it and think “yum”. But this is not bad as a meat substitute. It has nice bread, fresh spinach and a good balance of Christmas flavours – it’s an excellent sandwich full of festive cheer. 4.5/5 Co-Op Vegan Festive Feast I love the pink and yellow, but of all the sandwiches I’ve had, this is one of the most forgettable. It’s bland and the parsnip fritter has lost its fritteriness. This might be what you give to someone who hasn’t been very good this year. 1.5/5"

          "bodyText": "Two years ago the Tory party election campaign started to fall apart after the launch of the manifesto on a Thursday in Halifax. This time round, the Conservatives were determined to make sure that didn’t happen again by choosing a Sunday for their launch. A day when almost everyone would either be watching football, Sir David Attenborough or Countryfile. Anything to get away from the election for at least 24 hours. A day when any car crash would pass more or less unnoticed. Just before 2pm the entire cabinet – needy Matt Hancock bouncing up and down excitedly and taking selfies to try to reassure himself he really did exist – trooped in to the main hall of the Telford International Centre and took their seats in the front row. Well not quite all the cabinet. There was no sign of Jacob Rees-Mogg who has been locked in solitary ever since he insisted that those who had died in the Grenfell fire had got what they deserved for being too stupid not to disobey instructions. One upside to this election is that we should all be seeing a lot less of the Moggster in the next parliament. Then a bemused James Cleverly took the stage to say he didn’t really have anything much to say. Sadly Cleverly isn’t bright enough to realise that the only reason he had been chosen to introduce the event is because he is at his best when he doesn’t have anything to say. It’s when he tries to pretend he knows something that he comes unstuck. Cleverly sat down to a huge ovation for having said precisely nothing. Mission accomplished. Isolated cries of “Bo-Ris, Bo-Ris” broke out from isolated pockets in the room as the prime minister bumbled his way to the front. After tugging his hair to make sure it was sufficiently artfully messed up – there is no beginning to his vanity – Boris Johnson raised his arms for silence. Then as he began to speak, it became clear that the Tories had decided to double down on their no-cock-ups Sunday launch by delivering a manifesto with almost nothing in it. After all, no one can tear apart an empty manifesto. Genius. Politics at its most meta. Classic Dom. So what we got was Classic Boris. A lazy, second-rate standup routine that would have been booed off stage at a newcomers’ open mic night at a comedy club just down the road. Stolen gags that were tired even in the 1970s, plenty of familiar abuse directed at Labour and Jeremy Corbyn and the same old, same old lies. Amazingly he never seems to tire of this. In his narcissistic bubble, his reflection – and Matt Hancock – fall about laughing at his comedic and improv genius. Johnson started off with his usual shtick of “Get Brexit Done”. More accurately known as Get Brexit Don’t. He is totally unaware both that no one did more to make sure that Theresa May’s Brexit deal did not get through the Commons than him or that his deal is one that he himself rejected 18 months previously. His denial is so complete he has blanked out the need to negotiate a free trade agreement with the EU within six months. All that matters is winning the election. Breaking promises and letting people down can start on 13 December. What followed was mostly just filler. He would be building the 40 hospitals that would never be built. There would be 50,000 new nurses, providing the 20,000 nurses he wouldn’t deport were included in the headline figure. There would be £2bn for potholes and £1bn for childcare. Because one child was worth half as much as one pothole. He’d do something about social care though the details temporarily escaped him. And he could promise all this was true because it had been ruthlessly audited by a bunch of twenty-somethings in CCHQ who were running FactCheckUK. The closest he came to telling the truth was admitting that equality of opportunity was not distributed evenly. Because if it was, then someone like Boris would never have become prime minister. Without his privilege and overbearing sense of entitlement, Johnson would be just another low rent grifter, hawking fake brand goods out of a suitcase on Oxford Street. He ended with a lame Franglais ramble about the shadow cabinet that ended with a dig at “Madame Abbott”. That got the biggest cheer of the day. Tory activists love a bit of dog-whistle racism. No one can say that Boris doesn’t understand his audience. Once the applause had died down, Johnson nervously took a few questions. His bumper hamper of non-existent giveaways would be funded by a Brexit dividend that would make the country significantly poorer. “Can people trust you?” was met with an answer that contained at least three lies. Sadly he can be trusted. To almost never tell the truth. Nor could he explain the fake news campaign at CCHQ. A complete mystery. “I don’t really understand the Twittersphere,” he said sadly, lapsing into total incoherence. I guess that must have been one of Jennifer Arcuri’s IT lessons he failed to learn. “That’s all folks,” Johnson burbled, while everyone was still trying to take in the fact that he hadn’t really said much. All was well. The manifesto had been launched. Now it need never be mentioned again. Onwards and sideways to victory.

          "bodyText": "With its stunning coastal views, buzzing hipster nightspots and beach lifestyle, Mount Maunganui on New Zealand’s North Island makes for an unlikely place to find a torture chamber. Yet at the seemingly pleasant Bay Oval Joe Root’s tourists were given the Iron Maiden, the Heretic’s Fork and the Scold’s Bridle all in one. BJ Watling’s 205 –the first Test double century by a wicketkeeper against England – and Mitchell Santner’s 126 – his first century in Test cricket – made you wonder whether the Black Caps might be rebranded as the Black Hoods. They are such friendly people in these parts this is clearly a nonsense. But nevertheless, when Kane Williamson declared on 615 for nine after 201 overs, leaving frazzled English minds the best part of four sessions to bat for the draw, and Santner then struck three times to leave their guests 55 for three at the close on day four, they had still inflicted some serious pain. This was not an entirely unfamiliar experience for England, who for the sixth time in four years shipped over 600 runs overseas after similar punishment in Cape Town, Chennai, Mumbai, Sydney and Perth. Root keeps talking about building a side to win back the Ashes in Australia in 2021-22 but across the Tasman Sea, in the here and now, this still looks fanciful by way of threat with the Kookaburra ball. And then there is the batting. England’s first innings 353 was fully shown up on this relatively benign surface by Watling and Santner’s subsequent display of bloody-mindedness, as the pair put on 261 for the seventh wicket over 83.2 overs – just shy of a whole day’s play. When the openers fell meekly on the fourth evening, it completed a personally golden day for Santner. As is often the way in these situations, the tails-up New Zealand quicks had more zip than their English counterparts and, having been responsible for their side’s previous 101 wickets on home soil, looked to be the threat once more. But instead it was the left-arm spin of Santner that prevailed in a crazed final hour. Watling, who wearily feathered behind after tea to give Jofra Archer his first wicket from his 252nd delivery, had spent just over 11 hours at the crease and took time off the field as Tom Latham deputised behind the stumps. When he returned at drinks it looked possibly too soon, missing an inside edge off Dom Sibley. But the Santner-Watling axis was not to be denied, Sibley perishing caught behind when pushing out to a wide ball on 12. If the debutant looked troubled against the spinner then the dismissal of Rory Burns for 31 – top-edging to short fine leg attempting a slog sweep – was similarly soft. When nightwatchman Jack Leach fell to a dubious bat-pad and didn’t review, it brought about stumps and England’s torture was at least paused. This was Santner’s day but it has been Watling’s match. Resuming on 119, it was a case of repeating the methods that had brought about Test century number eight to surpass Brendon McCullum’s record 185 as a Kiwi wicketkeeper. The 34-year-old returned to his impervious bubble: defending and leaving with surety, before picking off the loose ball whenever England’s heavy-legged bowlers erred in line or length. Santner meanwhile was a different beast to the one who had done well to survive a short-ball barrage the night before. Known as “Slink” by his New Zealand teammates and “Flatline” by those at Northern Districts – he has a fairly laid-back demeanour – his defence was now sound and his approach fittingly relaxed, chiselling out 170 balls for his half-century before taking 83 more for three-figures. A scratch golfer, rated among the very best on cricket’s rest-day circuit, Santner wasn’t afraid to bring out the driver either with five sixes. And when he teed off against Leach, launching him back over his head three times, one bespectacled left-hander was suddenly being taken down by another. Watling and Santner shrewdly opted to grind England down first thing, scoring just 19 runs in the first hour and 58 in the session. But during the afternoon they stepped on the accelerator as New Zealand put on a further 138, overcoming the third new ball and greeting their respective milestones with typically ego-free celebrations. Root, who had burned both reviews 24 hours earlier, found himself the subject of ironic jeers from the grass banks on the rare occasion he let out an optimistic appeal. But the captain will be more concerned by his seam attack – both by way of fatigue and threat - looking ahead to next week’s second Test in Hamilton. Archer and Stuart Broad sent down a combined 75 overs for figures of one for 171. For the former it was his first gallon in a first-class innings from 42 overs of toil, as well as his heaviest workload by 12. Broad continued his miserly ways but Root needs more than just control of the run rate. And then there was Curran, manhandled by Santner such that he scarcely celebrated eventually when winning out. The left-armer is just 21 years old and was ever-willing for his captain despite also shipping three-figures. But away from home, like this England side as a whole, he has so much work to do."

          "bodyText": "Cars. What? Cars, yes cars, planet-eaters and child-killers, climate-chokers and city-wreckers, antisocial, aggressive, exclusionary, tools and symbols of a world of consumerist selfishness. Un-woke. A subject that the Victoria and Albert Museum, currently under fire for taking money from the opioid-selling Sackler family, might want to avoid. In, though, it has plunged, with Cars: Accelerating the Modern World, a major exhibition on these motorised demons. The exhibition has been a long time in the offing, with Norman Foster at one point involved, whose preference (one might guess) would have been for a celebratory parade of shining technology. Foster is still credited as an inspiration behind the show, but in the hands of the curators Brendan Cormier and Lizzie Bisley it is something nuanced and multifaceted. The idea, says the assistant curator Esme Hawes, is to show both the original promises of the motor car and its unintended consequences. So it treads a path between Jeremy Clarkson and Greta Thunberg, a broad-enough terrain but a fraught one. There are cars – gleaming, drool-worthy objects such as the Czech Tatra T77 of 1934, a pioneer of streamlining, or an opulent Hispano-Suiza custom-built for Suzanna Deutsch de la Meurthe in 1922. There are also film clips, documentaries, trade union banners, advertisements, car-related clothing and artefacts, science-fiction comics. Specially commissioned films show the grassroots sport of car-spinning in South Africa and of the highly ornamented vehicles – great rolling palaces of glitter and electric light – of Japanese truckers. The dark side of cars is included – the conditions of assembly-line workers, the death toll from accidents, the effects on climate – though doesn’t dominate. There is a compelling section on the ways in which Henry Ford learned from the production lines for dismembering pigs developed in the state of Ohio; a certain spirit of ruthlessness was carried over from the process of taking animals apart to that of putting cars together. A breathtaking 1970s advertisement for the Humble energy company, shocking and ironic at once, is displayed: “Each day Humble supplies enough energy to melt 7 million tons of glacier!” A photo of such a glacier appears above the strapline. You see Jimmy Carter speaking from the Oval Office, with some of the downbeat tone that helped to make him – for all his many virtues – a one-term president. “Tonight,” he said, “I want to have an unpleasant talk with you.” The bad news he had to impart was that the United States was going to have to change its relationship to the artefact it had made its own, that defined its industrial might and its version of freedom. Americans, he said, would have to be more careful with their fuel consumption because the world was running out of oil. Like some other recent and current shows (the Design Museum’s Moving to Mars, the Barbican’s AI: More Than Human, the V&amp;A Dundee’s Hello, Robot) the exhibition has to demonstrate why it would not be more at home in the Science Museum. It is not just about technology, is the point, but about culture. The aim is to show how profoundly cars have changed almost every aspect of human life: social life, geopolitics, gender politics, city building, tourism, economics, ecology, landscape, industry, art, to name but 10. For, if cars are all the bad things listed above, they have also been emancipating, energising, socially and economically transformative. They inspire devotion. They are objects of intense invention and creativity, as seen both in Henry Ford’s production lines and in the iridescent greens and yellows of Tipsy/Guardian Angel, a 1962 Chevrolet Impala convertible customised by a Latino Angeleno called Tomas Vasquez. A short distance from the glum Carter clip is a map annotated by his fellow Democrat Franklin Roosevelt, a little more than 40 years previously, on which lines of blue pencil denote the freeways that were to sweep across the United States. For FDR, during the depression, cars were signs of hope. A recurring theme, indeed,, indeed, is the attachment of national significance to cars. There is the Paykan, a variant of the British Hillman Hunter, which in the time of the Shah became an unlikely symbol of Iranian identity. There is the Delahaye Type 145 of 1937, the successful outcome of a patriotic campaign to build a French car that could win races against the then-mighty products of the Nazi-backed German car makers. With cars, fantasy and function have always been entwined. On arrival at the show you are greeted with a 1950s film envisaging a future in which a uniformed official in a control room – a sort of inefficient prototype of Google Maps – radios to drivers the best routes for them to take. Nearby you can see a drawing by a Soviet design student that, as early as 1928, proposed a car-like, bubble-shaped living pod of a kind that is still a popular version of what the future will look like. Next you see the Firebird 1 concept car of 1953, which set out to look like a jet fighter. There’s an arresting section on the ways in which General Motors, in seeking to compete with the efficient monotony of Ford, started styling mass-production cars. Later they wanted to appeal to women, who, their research showed, had the “final say” in the majority of car purchases, with such things as pearls stitched into the seats and compartments for makeup. The exhibition touches on the ways in which, following the world of fashion, car manufacturers started restyling the product range every year to stimulate the appetite to keep buying new models. It shows the reaction against the imposition of corporate taste by, for example, customisation. Cars now are on the brink of becoming something different – driverless, electric, networked – which may or may not make them more benign. The V&amp;A show touches on this, with a final room showing a hypothetical car of the future, but the main aim is to show how the car got to be what it is now. The material is mostly from before 1980 – just as well, as the subject is already vast enough. Given that almost everything about life has been touched by cars, it would be possible to mount 50 different exhibitions on the theme, each with its own set of exhibits, each equally valid. This one does a good job of navigating the difficult territory between piston-engine porn and climate apocalypse. It doesn’t try to draw conclusions or give lectures – in which respect its retrospection makes its avoidance of contemporary controversy easier. The viewer is allowed pleasure at the beauty of some of the creations, fascination with the human brilliance and human foibles at work, and recognition of the accompanying destruction. It’s not agitprop, it’s arguably a touch complacent, but it provides a valuable and arresting set of insights into one of the makers of the modern world. Which, in fact, is quite a lot for one exhibition. At the V&amp;A, London; until 19 April 2020"

          "bodyText": "David Hytner was our man out east today. He witnessed the dawning of a new age, and perhaps the end times of another. Here’s his report. Thanks for reading this MBM! The turn of the under-pressure Manuel Pellegrini. “There is frustration because we did not win a home game, especially because it is the derby against Tottenham. It’s a victory we wanted to have for our fans, to return to a winning performance, but we couldn’t. Antonio could not play the whole game, but we hope in the future he will contribute to a win. When you don’t have the result you want, you must trust more than ever. Our players never gave up, they continued to fight until the last minute. The moment we have the first winning result, the pressure will be gone.” And now a word with the man of the moment, Jose Mourinho! “I was really happy for an hour. We were playing well, doing things we spoke a lot about. I think we are lucky that I have so many years of Premier League that I told the players at half-time, even if it is 3-0, minute 85 the game will be open, and I think they understood that. But for the last 20 minutes, fatigue, people coming from the national team, all the emotions of losing their manager, another one comes ... there was clearly fatigue. And we were playing a very good team with good players, and their coach tried different things, playing more direct to avoid our pressure. It was not easy. But I really liked very much our first 60 minutes. I enjoyed it. The most important thing was not to win 3-0 or 4-0, the three points were a mental barrier. The boys are happy, and I really wanted them to be back to happiness. Dele Alli is too good not to be in the national team, too good not to be one of the best players in the world. The best Dele has to be back.” Dele Alli speaks: “It’s been a tough week for us emotionally. We’ve all spent a long time with Poch and were shocked when we heard the news. It was very sad. But we have a job to do. We have to go out and perform for the fans and for the club. No matter what happens, we have to stay together as a squad. In football things change.” Son Heung-min adds: “For almost five years we have tried to play from the back, but now we are trying something new. We adapted well, the lads did a really good job. We have to fight for the second ball.” That result catapults Tottenham up to sixth, at least for a couple of hours. West Ham are still stuck in 16th place, currently five points clear of the relegation zone. Should Watford beat Burnley later, though, that’ll just be two. And as good as Spurs were for most of that game - Son and Alli were sensational in the first half - West Ham turned in the sort of performance that usually leads to a relegation scrap. Not a perfect day at the office for Mourinho, as it looked like being midway through the second half, but more than good enough. Onwards and upwards. West Ham by contrast are in all sorts of bother; those late goals don’t mask anything. Manuel Pellegrini is on very thin ice. But it’s too late for West Ham. Spurs have their first away win since January ... though those late West Ham goals mean Jose Mourinho doesn’t look quite as pleased with his team’s performance as he was a little earlier. Antonio, who has been the one plus point for West Ham this afternoon, races along the byline to the left of goal. His low cross-cum-shot pinballs off Alderweireld and Gazzaniga. Half the ground celebrate a goal, but the ball has somehow squirted wide of the bottom left. No matter! From the resulting corner, Ogbonna loses Sanchez and slams a shot into the bottom left! 90 min +4: Kane purchases a cheap free kick from Noble in midfield. That’s the pressure off Spurs, who are closing in on their first away win in the Premier League since January. 90 min +3: Another corner for West Ham. Snodgrass takes. Too long. Rice tries to recycle the ball from the right. Alderweireld clears. 90 min +2: West Ham have enjoyed 82 percent of possession in the last five minutes. Spurs fans better get used to matches ending like this, it’s how Mourinho rolls. 90 min +1: There will be six added minutes. During the first, Snodgrass digs a cross out from a deep position on the left. Haller rises and heads straight at Gazzaniga. 90 min: ... West Ham score! Ogbonna rises highest. The ball’s going wide left, but Rice turns it in by the post. The referee awards the goal ... but VAR snatches it away quickly. Rice was clearly offside, so much so that the home fans didn’t really bother celebrating properly in the first place. 89 min: More good work by Antonio, who battles to win possession. Fredericks scoops a cross from the right. It’s deflected out for a corner, from which ... 87 min: However, after giving it some thought, Michael Oliver books Kane and Snodgrass, who, it should be pointed out, are both grown men. 86 min: West Ham refuse to put the ball out of play with Sissoko down injured. Kane has a nibble at Snodgrass, who reacts angrily and throws the Spurs man to the floor. Just for a second, it looks like developing into a bit of rough-house, but everyone calms down quickly enough. 84 min: Spurs are now sitting back. The plan presumably being to keep their shape, and keep hold of what they’ve got. Cresswell crosses from the left, but Sanchez heads powerfully clear with ease. 82 min: Moura knocks Cresswell to the ground, and it’s a free kick out on the left. West Ham load the box. Snodgrass can’t find anyone, though. That’s Moura’s last act of the afternoon, as he’s replaced by Sissoko. 81 min: Moura is bowled over by Sanchez, 25 yards out. Kane takes the free kick and belts it straight at Roberto, who gathers without fuss for once. The home crowd again with the ironic cheers. 79 min: Eriksen comes on for Alli, who takes his sweet time to leave the field of play. Noble gets up in the referee’s grille, pointing out that he should have departed at the nearest point of exit. That may be reflected in the time added on. Or it may not. 77 min: Suddenly West Ham look lively. Noble launches long towards Antonio, who chests down on the edge of the box for Haller. Unfortunately Haller can’t get any purchase on his snapshot, and Tottenham can clear. But this is better from the home side, who have finally turned up, just the 70-odd minutes late. 75 min: Davies injured himself while fouling Antonio back there. He limps off, to be replaced by Rose. Antonio has been West Ham’s one success story this afternoon, putting himself about since coming on, a whirlwind of desire and talent. There’s some pinball in the Spurs box. The ball breaks to him. He slips Alderweireld with a deft shimmy right, then slaps a low shot into the bottom left from the edge of the area! A lovely finish, and there’s life in this match yet. 72 min: That was really brave from Kane, who resisted the temptation to raise his hands to save himself. He took that full in the face, standing firm. He’s good to continue, though. 70 min: Cresswell belts the free kick very hard. It hits poor old Kane flush in his startled coupon. Ooyah, oof, that’s going to hurt a lot. He lies face down in the turf awhile. Selflessly, the Spurs captain has given the put-upon West Ham fans something to cheer. 69 min: Antonio shines for West Ham, dribbling past Davies and Dier, cutting in from the right and drawing a foul from Davies, who had come back for more. A free kick in a dangerous position. 67 min: Aurier nutmegs Snodgrass out on the right wing, and scampers off tittering, like a cartoon character with a bag of sweeties. Snodgrass tilts his head back, scrunches his eyes, and emits a loud AW NO. It’s been that sort of day for West Ham. 66 min: Spurs are strutting around like they own the place. Which, this afternoon, they sort of do. They’re hogging possession, stroking it around in the grand manner. It’s very easy on the eye. Could this day be going any better for Jose Mourinho? 64 min: Diop is put out of his misery, hooked for Carlos Sanchez, whose arrival isn’t met with uniform enthusiasm by the West Ham faithful. 63 min: Now it’s Son’s turn to beat the West Ham offside trap. He scoots down the left and wins a corner. The set piece leads to nothing, but there are more goals in this for Spurs. 61 min: West Ham United force Gazzaniga into a save! Antonio glides in from the right and curls towards the top right. It’s an easy catch for the keeper, who immediately launches long. Diop, who has been awful today, misjudges the flight of the long blooter, and allows Kane to tear clear on goal! To be fair to Diop, he mops up his own mess by powering back and blocking Kane, who dithered uncharacteristically. But still. What a mess. 60 min: Moura dinks a reverse pass down the left, nearly setting Kane clear. Fredericks does well to hook the ball away from danger. 58 min: West Ham have shown very little fight. Fornals tries to inject a bit of energy by bustling down the right, but nobody other than Noble seems particularly interested in joining in. The move peters out. 56 min: Yarmolenko isn’t happy either. He’s been totally anonymous today. But there he is anyway, a face like thunder as he’s yanked for Fornals. 55 min: Cresswell slips a ball down the left in the hope of releasing Antonio, but the striker’s gone too quickly and it’s an easy offside decision for the linesman. The home crowd are restless. 53 min: West Ham are all over the shop. Alli is allowed to trundle down the right, and nearly releases Kane into the area with a deft flick. Diop is on point this time, and intercepts. This particular panic is over, but the Hammers can’t keep on like this, or things could get extremely embarrassing. 51 min: Kane twisted his ankle while landing, but after a grimace and a rub, it looks as though he’ll be fine to continue. Moura’s miss matters not. Aurier is afforded space down the right. He crosses high. Kane rises and plants a downward header past the flapping Roberto. Kane beat a snoozing, dizzy Diop with ease there. 48 min: Antonio has clearly been given a remit to put himself about up front. He battles with Sanchez down the left and wins a free kick. Snodgrass’s delivery is appalling, and Spurs clear easily ... then break at great speed. Moura exchanges passes with Son, and he’s clear in the box. He should score, but drags a miserable effort across the face of goal and out to the left. He might have been trying to play in Alli, tearing down the inside left, caught in two minds. 47 min: Fredericks plays a ball down the right wing to nobody in particular. It dribbles out of play apologetically for a goal kick. Most of the folk in the London Stadium groan in unison, then fall silent. The misery is palpable. 46 min: Aurier slides through the back of Snodgrass in midfield. It should be a booking; it’s not even a foul. There have been some strange decisions in this match. West Ham get the second half underway. Anderson has been hooked; Antonio comes on. Half-time entertainment. A full 45 minutes into the Jose Mourinho era, and a first Premier League away win for Spurs in ten months is on. As for the Manuel Pellegrini era at West Ham ... well, his coat’s on a shoogly peg. His team are booed off. 45 min +2: A corner for Spurs down the right. From which, Sanchez heads towards the top right. It’s going over, but Roberto takes no chances. He tips over the bar. And that’s the end of the half. 45 min: Snodgrass has a speculative dig from distance. It forces Gazzaniga to scramble in a panic towards his left-hand post, but the ball’s always whizzing wide. This is a great goal. Alli, falling backwards on the left touchline, keeps the ball in play by backheeling it towards Son from a prone position. Sensational! Bet his brother can’t do that. Son tears off down the wing, his ankle seemingly fine, and curls a low cross towards the far post, where Lucas races in to slam home. West Ham are a shambles, but Spurs have been very impressive. 41 min: The resulting free kick is swung into the mixer. Roberto comes out to punch, succeeding only in clattering his own man Ogbonna. The ball drops to Alli, who hooks goalwards. Roberto sort of claws it away, just, but as the ball bounces around, the play’s stopped and he gets away with it. Roberto should be soundtracked by this at all times: 40 min: Fredericks slides in late on Son, who was preparing to make off down the left. He studs Son on his planted ankle, and is booked. That really should have been a red card. It’s checked by VAR, too, but the decision stands. A really sore one, and Son takes a while to recover. 38 min: Roberto offered no resistance to Son’s shot, though take nothing away from the crispness of the finish. Son is such a fine player. Spurs come at West Ham again, Alli whipping a shot inches wide of the bottom left. Diop is stripped with embarrassing ease by Alli, out on the left. He feeds Kane, who is blocked by Rice. But Spurs come straight back at West Ham. Alli slides a pass down the inside left to release Son, who shimmies and shakes to confuse Diop, then whips a shot across Roberto, who might as well not be there, and into the bottom right. On the touchline, Jose punches the air. It’s on! 34 min: A warm round of applause for West Ham season-ticket holder Lily Harris, who passed away recently. 33 min: Kane and Alli combine cutely in limited space down the inside-left channel, releasing Son into the box. Son is shaping to thread the ball into the bottom right when Rice slides in. A magnificent saving tackle, and nothing comes of the resulting corner. Spurs are knocking at the door. 32 min: Space for Son down the left. He earns a corner off Diop. One Winks corner leads to another. And another. Roberto punches the third to the feet of Alderweireld, who swivels to shoot but can’t get anything meaningful away. West Ham finally clear their lines. 30 min: Spurs stroke it around the middle of the park awhile, subduing the crowd. At least Roberto’s out of harm’s way. 28 min: Kane drops deep to quarterback, nearly releasing Moura on goal with a long rake. Roberto comes to the edge of his box to claim, and is rewarded with ironic cheers from his own fans. Memories of Allen McKnightmare come flooding back. 26 min: Noble flicks a gorgeous first-time pass down the left wing, with the outside of his right foot, towards Anderson. What a spot! Anderson scampers down the wing and slips a pass inside for Haller. But it’s a poor pass, just behind the striker, and the move breaks down. For a second there, West Ham were three on two, and Spurs were in a world of trouble. Full marks to Noble for both vision and execution. 24 min: Kane gets pelters from the crowd for needlessly shoving Fredericks to the ground, as the defender was ushering the ball out of play for a goal kick. He’s lucky not to go in the book for that brazen nonsense. His manager will be pleased with the way he’s putting himself about, though. 22 min: Anderson makes good ground down the left, but Aurier does well to stick to his task, and the winger runs out of space. A nice, breezy, open game, this, if not yet drama-packed. 20 min: Son is a sensational player, like that’s breaking news. He conjures space out of nothing, just to the left of the D, and snaps a curler towards the top right. It’s going in, and, fair’s fair, the oft-hapless Roberto does well to punch it away from danger. 18 min: Yarmolenko curls a ball into the Spurs box from the right. Snodgrass prepares to head goalwards only to be nudged in the back by Aurier as he rises. Snodgrass falls over and demands a penalty. He’s not getting it. You’ve seen them given, though it would have been very soft. Even so, Aurier’s challenge was clumsy; a little more force and the referee might have been minded to point to the spot. The man’s an accident waiting to happen. 16 min: The game goes a little bit scrappy. On the bench, the all-new PR-friendly Mourinho makes a few notes, quietly and calmly. This can’t last. It won’t last. 14 min: More space for Fredericks down the right. He overruns the ball, which goes out for a goal kick before he can cross. Gazzaniga takes the goal kick ... and blooters it upfield. No playing out from the back for Mourinho, one senses. 12 min: An absurd decision by Michael Oliver, who books Diop after a battle with Kane out on the Spurs left. Kane had dragged Diop to the ground, the defender falling on the ball as he’s fouled. But Spurs get the decision, and Diop is carded for handling the ball! Plenty of boos for that egregious double insult, and no wonder. The resulting free kick’s swung in. Roberto flaps, misses an easy catch, and Sanchez heads wide right. The flag goes up for offside, but dear me, what dismal goalkeeping. 10 min: Spurs come straight back at the Hammers, Aurier making good ground down the right and cutting back ... to nobody in particular. Cresswell is able to scoop clear. This doesn’t feel like it’s going to be a goalless draw. 8 min: West Ham finally get their gamefaces on. Fredericks gets a bit of space down the right and crosses. Haller battles with Aurier and Sanchez for a header, six yards out. The defenders combine to win, and Gazzaniga claims. But that’s much better from the home side. 6 min: Spurs have clearly been working on something in training. Again Alli slips a pass down the inside-left channel for Kane; once again he’s just offside, as he rolls the ball across the face of goal, inviting a tap-in that never comes. Spurs have enjoyed nearly 80 percent possession so far. West Ham have hardly had a kick. 5 min: That disallowed goal momentarily sucked the life out of the stadium. The home fans are making noise again now, but not quite as much as they had been. Spurs have done a good job of quietening them down, dominating these early exchanges. 3 min: Alli, dropping deep on the left, slips a pass down the channel and releases Kane, who lashes a first-time shot into the top left! What a glorious finish. Sadly for Spurs and Mourinho, they’re denied a perfect start, because Kane had gone way too early and was clearly offside. The flag goes up accordingly. 2 min: Spurs keep hold of the ball in the sterile style. Then it’s shuttled down the left for Son, who twists and turns dangerously but can’t quite get the better of Fredericks. The derby atmosphere continues to bubble away. Spurs get the ball rolling. Mourinho is back, then. And he’ll be coming into contact with VAR in the Premier League for the very first time. It’s made for solid-gold entertainment, this. The teams are out! The denizens of the London Stadium wish with all their heart they were back at the Boleyn welcome the two sides ahead of this huge London derby. Pretty bubbles in the air. West Ham sport their current claret-and-blue seventies pastiche, while Tottenham are in their favoured lilywhite. Both kits very easy on the eye. Mourinho made his presence felt in the tunnel, incidentally, still beaming, slapping the back of every player on both teams. A masterclass in passive aggression. We’ll be off before you know it! contentment n. (kənˈtent.mənt) a feeling of happiness or satisfaction. A slightly downbeat Manuel Pellegrini speaks. “We have to concentrate in our defending. The games we have lost at home, against Newcastle and Crystal Palace, and the draw against Sheffield United, we have conceded six goals and five of those from set pieces. We must concentrate on those sort of balls, and we must play well because we are playing a big team with good players. Fortunately for us, we have Michail Antonio ready. Maybe not to play the whole game, but some minutes.” An extremely laid-back Jose gives his first pre-match interview as Spurs boss. “Sometimes people think when results are not good that it is something related to motivation, but that is not the case,” he tells BT Sport. “They are good professionals and they tried their best. And that’s what they’re going to do. Tactically, of course there are not big changes. Just little, important things that we think can help them to get our objectives. The match today is very important, but our future is also very important. So I need to understand what is in Christian Eriksen’s mind and heart, and we have to make the right decision for the club. But on top of that, I believe Lucas, Son, Alli and Kane are players with a good understanding. We are going to try to find, in the little time I have had to work, some dynamic to hurt the opposition. Let’s see if we can do it. I like the ideas but I like to work the ideas. And today was more about ideas than working the ideas. So let’s see if we can find happiness.” Some typically enigmatic flourishes at the end, there. Mourinho at his gnomic best. He’s back, baby. West Ham United make two changes to the side gubbed 3-0 at Burnley before the international break. Angelo Ogbonna comes in for Fabian Balbuena, while Andriy Yarmolenko replaces Pablo Fornals. Captain Mark Noble has passed a fitness test and is good to go. The much-maligned Roberto keeps his place in between the sticks. There are three differences between Mauricio Pochettino’s last Spurs team and Jose Mourinho’s first. Moussa Sissoko, Tanguy Ndombele and Giovani Lo Celso are out of the XI named for the 1-1 draw with Sheffield United. Ndombele is injured, while the other two are benched. In come Toby Alderweireld, Harry Winks and Lucas Moura. Christian Eriksen is on the bench. West Ham United: Roberto, Fredericks, Diop, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Rice, Yarmolenko, Noble, Snodgrass, Felipe Anderson, Haller. Subs: Balbuena, Zabaleta, Sanchez, Fornals, Martin, Ajeti, Antonio. Jose Mourinho’s first Tottenham Hotspur selection: Gazzaniga, Aurier, Alderweireld, Sanchez, Davies, Dier, Winks, Lucas Moura, Alli, Son, Kane. Subs: Rose, Walker-Peters, Sissoko, Lo Celso, Foyth, Eriksen, Austin. Referee: Michael Oliver (Northumberland). Mourinho is in the building. Looking very relaxed, as well. He’s even been high-fiving some young West Ham supporting kids. London Jose seems about ten years younger than Lowry Jose. When José met Dele he delved back into his old box of motivational tools … Well this doesn’t need much building up, does it? And there we were, thinking Manchester City versus Chelsea was nailed on as the biggest event of the day. Yes, it’s the long-awaited / dreaded (delete as you see fit) return of Jose Mourinho. The former Chelsea manager has pitched up on the north side of town, to see if he can bring Tottenham Hotspur the shiny silver success that proved tantalisingly out of poor old Mauricio Pochettino’s reach. You know Mourinho’s USP: trophies are guaranteed. Here we go, then! But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Mourinho’s first job is to rebuild stuttering Spurs’ confidence, and get them back up the Premier League. He couldn’t have picked a much better fixture to start with. Spurs have emerged victorious from their last three visits to the London Stadium, and today they’ll face a West Ham team in abject form: five losses and two draws from their last seven games. Jose will fancy this one. On the other hand, Spurs aren’t in the greatest nick themselves. Hence poor Pochettino’s sacking. They’ve only won five games all season, and two of those were against a risible Red Star Belgrade rabble. Infamously, Tottenham haven’t won on the road in the Premier League since January. And the Hammers are desperate to rise up the division themselves, and will take succour from the tail end of last season, when they became the first team to defeat Spurs in their sparkling new stadium. So a no-holds-barred London derby awaits. It didn’t need the extra spice that Mourinho will bring. But baby it’s got it. This should be a whole world of fun. The Premier League is back after the international break ... and it’s on! Kick off: 12.30pm GMT."

When we met for breakfast last month he was looking despondent. “Everyone takes selfies these days,” he said sadly, picking at his scrambled eggs. “It’s never autographs any more. They just want photos of themselves with celebrities.” Anyone who has attended a red carpet event or watched one on TV, knows that selfies have firmly supplanted autographs, with fans lurching desperately towards celebrities with outstretched phones instead of pens and paper. Celebrities have adapted accordingly. In 2017, a video of Liam Payne went viral that showed him miserably working his way down a line of selfie-takers, his smile lasting as long as it took for each fan to press click. A photo of oneself with, say, Tom Cruise, feels more personal than a mere scribbled signature, which he could have given anyone (and could have been signed by anyone). But the real reason selfies have abruptly rendered autographs as obsolete as landline telephones is because of social media. Instagram is made for photos, not autographs, and what’s the point of having your photo taken with Payne if you don’t then immediately post it and watch the “OMG!”s and “NO WAY!!!!”s come flooding in? If you stand next to a celebrity and your friends don’t like the photo, did it ever happen? Do you even exist? Instagram launched in 2010, four years after Twitter, six years after Facebook. Although social media was originally pitched as a way for people to keep in touch with their friends, it quickly also became a way for people to feel greater proximity to celebrities, and to flaunt this closeness to others. Facebook, with characteristic hamfistedness, attempted to monetise this in 2013, when it announced it was trialling a feature that would allow users to pay to contact celebrities for a sliding scale of fees: 71p for Jeremy Hunt, £10.68 for Tom Daley. But there was no need for people to spend money for the privilege, because celebrities had already proven extremely keen to bend down low and share their lives with the peasants. When Demi Moore appeared on David Letterman in 2010, she was already so addicted to Twitter she continued to tweet while live on air to millions. (“This stinks,” Letterman griped.) The appeal of social media for a celebrity is obvious, in that it allows them to talk to the public without those awful middlemen: journalists. The past decade is littered with examples of why celebrities (and their publicists) now prefer social media (which they can control) to giving interviews (which they cannot.) It’s unlikely that Michael Douglas would have tweeted that his throat cancer was caused by cunnilingus, as he told the Guardian’s Xan Brooks in 2013 (and for which he later publicly apologised to his wife, Catherine Zeta Jones). It’s even less likely that Liam Neeson would have made an Instagram story about the time he went out hoping to kill a “black bastard” after a friend was raped, as he said in an interview this year. Why risk such disasters when, instead, you can just take a flattering photo, slap a filter on it and post it to your already adoring followers? Mega celebrities with a hyper-online fanbase – Justin Bieber, Beyoncé, Frank Ocean – can now go for years without giving an interview and their careers are helped rather than harmed for it. Instagram is an airbrushing app, one that lets people touch up their photos, specifically, and their lives, generally, by deciding what they choose to post. (When Jennifer Aniston finally joined social media last month, and momentarily broke the internet, she naturally chose Instagram over the bearpit of Twitter.) Some are more honest about this than others: after he married Kim Kardashian – the celebrity who more than any other has made a virtue out of artifice – Kanye West proudly told reporters in 2014 that the two of them spent four days of their honeymoon in Florence playing with the filters on the wedding photo, that they eventually posted on Instagram, “because the flowers were off-colour and stuff like that”. You wonder what they’d do with all that time if the internet didn’t exist – cure cancer, perhaps? Musician John Legend and his wife Chrissy Teigen have established a new kind of fame for themselves with their regular social media posts: with Teigen complaining about Donald Trump on Twitter; both of them posting photos of their perfect family on Instagram. Teigen is considered more “real” than her friend Kardashian because she is funny and doesn’t take money to advertise dodgy weight-loss supplements. But their photos are as idealised and managed as any Hello! shoot. The reason Teigen – a heretofore relatively little known model – has over 26 million followers on Instagram is because she hits that social media sweet spot, which is to be (to use two of the more grating buzzwords of the decade) aspirational and authentic. At the beginning of this decade, it was the aspirational side of the equation that was deemed more important – leading to the rise of a new kind of celebrity: the influencers. This bewildering group of people suggest their lives are so perfect that, by showing us photos of how they eat, dress, parent, travel, decorate, exercise, put on makeup and even cure themselves of illness, they will influence us to do the same. For the successful, the money was suddenly limitless, as brands realised that the public trusted influencers more than adverts, and so threw money at them to endorse their products; Kylie Jenner, a makeup influencer, currently makes $1m per sponsored post. This was always a delicate bubble and it finally began to burst last year, when the Advertising Standards Authority decreed that influencers need to spell it out when they’re being paid to promote something. Writing “ADVERT” beneath that perfect photo of you chugging some Smart Water next to a waterfall doesn’t really boost one’s authenticity. Even more problematic were the Fyre Festival debacle and the fall of YouTube stars such as Logan Paul and PewDiePie, scandals that eroded the relationship between online celebrities and their followers. It turns out influencers weren’t more trustworthy than adverts; in fact, in the unregulated world of the web, they were markedly less so. An older demographic has sneered at influencers, as they did with the previous decade’s reality TV stars, suggesting they are not “real” celebrities. This is an absurd complaint, given that some influencers have more followers than traditional movie stars do. Yet influencers atomise audiences in a way traditional celebrities don’t: even if you have never bought Vogue, you’ll know who Cindy Crawford is; unless you follow Chiara Ferragni on social media you will likely have no idea who she is – and yet the fashion influencer has four times as many followers as Crawford. Ironically, the rise of the influencer began with a very old-school celebrity, one who is frequently accused of being the embodiment of the worst kind of elitist privilege: Gwyneth Paltrow. When Paltrow launched her wellness website, Goop, in 2008, few would have predicted it would reshape both Paltrow’s career and cultural notions of what constitutes an aspirational lifestyle. Paltrow helped usher out the 2000s trend for bling and Cristal, swapping them for yoga clothes and gluten-free kale crisps, making discreet asceticism the ultimate A-lister look. Which is more authentic is debatable, but the biggest swap Paltrow made was personal: she went from being an Academy Award-winning actor to online influencer. And, given that her company is now estimated to be worth $250m, she probably made the more lucrative choice. Happily, not everyone uses social media to hawk fantasy images of themselves. Occasional glimpses of reality peek through, to everyone’s delight, and by “reality” I mean “feuds”. We’ve had Katy Perry and Taylor Swift’s long-running snarky subtweets aimed at one another. There were Kim Cattrall’s explicit swipes at Sarah Jessica Parker on Instagram. After her brother died, she wrote: “I don’t need your love or support at this tragic time @sarahjessicaparker. Let me make this VERY clear. (If I haven’t already.) You are not my family. You are not my friend. So I’m writing to tell you one last time to stop exploiting our tragedy in order to restore your ‘nice girl’ persona.” Most recently, Coleen Rooney accused “Rebekah Vardy’s account” of selling stories about her to the tabloids. One can only feel deep pangs of regret that Bette Davis and Joan Crawford died before either had access to an iPhone. As much as young celebrities tout the importance of authenticity, those who come across as most genuine tend to be the older ones – perhaps because they are less internet savvy, or, more likely, have fewer media managers. Bette Midler and, in particular, Cher have really come into their own on Twitter, gleefully sharing their often emoji-heavy thoughts on Trump and politics in general. (“What do you think of Boris Johnson?” one tweeter asked Cher. “F-ing idiot who lied to the British ppl,” the goddess replied, rightly.) And while Instagram may be best known for hyper-stylised photos of, say, Beyoncé holding her newborn twins, the most purely enjoyable celebrity accounts belong to Glenn Close – she posts candid videos of herself and her dogs, always liked by Michael Douglas – and Diane Keaton, who posts decidedly unstylised photos of herself. “YES, I AM WEARING [TROUSERS] UNDER A SKIRT” is a typical all-caps caption. Ever wanted to know what Annie Hall would be like online? Now you know. Of course, the downside to being able to reach one’s public directly is that the public can reach back. Stars from Stephen Fry to Nicki Minaj have publicly left social media sites after the audience proved a little less admiring than they hoped. “Stan” – or obsessive fan – culture has blossomed. Sometimes this has been to the celebrity’s benefit: Lady Gaga’s fan squad, the Little Monsters, amped up her Oscar campaign for A Star Is Born. But if stans feel they have been let down by the object of their obsession, they will viciously bully the (usually female) star, as Katy Perry and Demi Lovato have experienced. As a result, many celebrities have turned off the comments on their accounts, so we can hear them but they can’t hear us. So much for getting closer. And yet, for all the fascination social media currently exerts, the celebrity stories that will have the most enduring impact did not start there. There had been rumours about Harvey Weinstein for years, but he was ultimately undone by good old-fashioned investigative reporting, by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey at the New York Times, and Ronan Farrow at the New Yorker. Michael Jackson, R Kelly, Woody Allen, Max Clifford, Kevin Spacey and Bryan Singer became pariahs (in Jackson’s case, posthumously) when their accusers spoke to journalists. Caitlyn Jenner introduced herself to the world, not on social media, but on the cover of Vanity Fair. When Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex, the artist formerly known as Meghan Markle, spoke out against the “campaigns” against her, they directed their anger towards the print media (and the Mail on Sunday in particular). Ironically, this could be seen as rather reassuring to the newspaper industry: sure, our sales are falling, but for a certain kind of celebrity, print is still what matters. Nonetheless, this decade has, in a very profound way, been shaped by the social media celebrity. Donald Trump did not emerge from the online world; he came to prominence through the traditional format of TV. But he has taken advantage of the way Twitter prioritises personality over expertise: it doesn’t really matter what you say, as long as you say it in a way that captures the most attention; and the public has grown accustomed to this kind of communication. In the early part of the decade, Trump gave himself a Twitter makeover; it was a platform where he could move from being the embodiment of obnoxious Manhattan privilege (bragging in interviews that he wouldn’t rent an apartment to anyone on welfare), to the say-it-like-it-is kinda guy, the one who tweets about the dangers of vaccination. When he ran for the presidency, Trump maintained this persona, and many people assumed that’s all it was – a persona – and one he would drop once in office. Well, we all know how that turned out. Now he, and in this country, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, treat their offices as if they were a form of social media: they rely on the web to build a devoted following, and complain about journalists who venture anything but adoring coverage. They disdain traditional interviews, preferring instead to put out their messages via Facebook or Twitter, metaphorically turning off the comments, staying comfortably inside their respective bubbles. Social media was never supposed to reflect the real world, but the real world is increasingly being bent to reflect social media. And it’s not only autograph sellers who will suffer for that. • If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."

          "bodyText": "Leimert Park in the early 90s was a unique place to be. South Central LA: the birthplace of west-coast hip-hop, jam centre for the now middle-aged instrumentalists of spiritual jazz, historical home to Ray Charles and Ella Fitzgerald, the outskirts of so-called Black Beverly Hills. An area also recently infamous for its street crime and gang affiliations, it was here that young saxophonist Kamasi Washington first became versed in jazz. At the age of 11, he was taken by his jazz musician father Rickey to see acts in the many clubs dotted around the area’s backstreets: artists such as saxophonist Pharoah Sanders at the 100-capacity World Stage club and pianist Horace Tapscott, who would perform with his Pan-Afrikan Peoples Arkestra. Tapscott’s work was particularly influential for Washington. He viewed the music he played not as spiritual jazz, nor even jazz, but simply “black music”, and pioneered the use of spoken-word artists who would chant sociopolitically charged lyrics over his compositions. On Why Don’t You Listen?, vocalist Dwight Trible lists jazz musicians from Billie Holiday to Duke Ellington to Dizzy Gillespie, interspersed with the titular refrain. Tapscott felt his work had a responsibility to its history and an ultimate emphasis on imparting this culture to younger generations. In his hands, this lineage would never die. Over the street from Tapscott and the World Stage, another type of spoken-word culture was forming: hip-hop. Acts such as the Pharcyde and Freestyle Fellowship would hold jams at Project Blowed, extending Tapscott’s lineage of black music and putting words to their heavily racialised social environment. A fluid scene was forming; in Leimert Park, the jazz kids would meet the hip-hop kids. Washington was both. Almost three decades later, in 2015, Washington released his debut album, The Epic. It would spark the beginning of a mainstream jazz resurgence across the US and in the UK, and the radical, politicised reclamation of a genre that had become deeply unfashionable. It was unshackled from the confines of the hotel lobby and thrust back into the clubs. When Tapscott died in 1999, jazz had been relegated to a traditionalist’s preserve – nothing as radical as its bebop heyday, nor as “cool” as its 50s Pacific incarnation, nor as indigestible as 60s free jazz. Instead, Wynton Marsalis was at the peak of his academic resurrection of swing in New York, while in the UK, Courtney Pine and the Jazz Warriors were drawing on their own African-Caribbean heritage to perform a cubist fusion. Music writers persistently proclaimed the death of jazz, its political edge dissipated in favour of the search for technical intricacy and introspection. But The Epic played like a revitalisation of Tapscott’s musical philosophy. Here was a three-hour, three-part record that called upon everything from Sun Ra to A Tribe Called Quest’s reprocessed jazz sampling and Parliament/Funkadelic in its ever-expanding definitions of black music. By this point, Washington had played in Tapscott’s Arkestra and put in his hours as a session player for jazz stalwarts Herbie Hancock and George Duke, and early 2000s hip-hop and R&amp;B acts Snoop Dogg and Raphael Saadiq. His most important collaboration was to come with another South Central rapper, Kendrick Lamar. Lamar followed his own lineage: the west coast sun- and blood-soaked aggression of NWA, Dr Dre and Tupac. Where the Pharcyde were easy-riding in the stargazing psychedelics of hip-hop, Dre, Tupac and co spat out a sometimes venomous, emotional rap fuelled by police aggression and widespread neglect of the immigrant communities of South Central. The communality that had been so important to Tapscott seemed at the risk of collapsing by the late 90s; this was its response. There was similar urgency at play in 2015 when Lamar enlisted Washington for his second major-label album, To Pimp a Butterfly. Where 2012’s debut Good Kid MAAD City was a cinematic retelling of a day in the life of Lamar’s seething Compton, TPAB cast its net far wider, enveloping black musical history through the meandering lines of Washington’s tenor saxophone. Take U, a dark, anguished number from Lamar, its introspection and self-critical lyrics – at one point calling himself a “fucking failure” – standing in stark contrast to the macho excess usually celebrated in rap. Lamar screeches and squeals, his voice breaking like the pre-lingual cries of free jazz trumpeter Don Cherry’s playing, while Washington’s mellifluous, keening lines provide a melodic dialogue, a background reasoning to Lamar’s uneasy questioning. The critically acclaimed TPAB brought Washington’s jazz to a new, young, globalised audience. Where jazz had been largely the preserve of the concert hall and clubs such as New York’s Blue Note and London’s Ronnie Scott’s, now it was being played at major festivals including London’s rap-focused Wireless and at club nights in major cities. Its sound was bubbling up to the mainstream for the first time in a generation. Perhaps it was the sociopolitical context of 2015 that made such fertile ground for the jazz revival brought about by Washington. Black Lives Matter had reached peak visibility following the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin and the ensuing acquittal of George Zimmerman, while President Trump’s overt racism proved shockingly mainstream. Lamar and Washington’s unapologetic, afrocentric music positioned jazz as a tactile, tangible form of resistance. As footage of crowds at anti-Trump rallies chanting the lyrics to Lamar’s Alright went viral, the radicalism of jazz had seemingly returned – that lineage of Billie Holiday and Strange Fruit, Amiri Baraka and black power, Sun Ra and black consciousness. Critic Greg Tate hailed Washington as “the jazz voice of Black Lives Matter”. When The Epic was released later that year, accompanied by its grayscale sleeve of Washington and saxophone looking down from a distant planet like a benevolent cult leader, its success was unexpected: it hit the year-end top 10 albums of the Guardian, Pitchfork and Wire, and was certified platinum in Germany. During the TPAB sessions, Washington had formed his own version of Tapscott’s Arkestra, the West Coast Get Down, featuring fellow LA locals including bassists Thundercat and Miles Mosley and drummer Ronald Bruner Jr. Washington’s 13-piece ensemble would lay down the 17-track record in frenetic sessions between sessions for Lamar’s album, resulting in a record that veers from a languorous, swampy rendition of Claire de Lune to gut-busting chromaticism from Washington and keys player Cameron Graves on Change of the Guard and Askim. Washington’s playing is always insistent, regardless of a song’s timbre. Where Charlie Parker’s most burning bebop plays like a fever dream and John Coltrane’s later playing hits like an anguished pre-lingual cry, Washington commands an ocean of tone. His heavy breath is just as important as the sound it carries, and both are heard in equal measure: the sound of raw physicality as well as melodic emotion, waves crashing upon the shore. The Epic is not a particularly easy listen, at turns impassioned (Askim), knotty and introspective (Change of the Guard), balladic (Cherokee) and didactic (Malcolm’s Theme). Perhaps its difficulty became a badge of honour for its new listeners, or maybe its aesthetic struck the right chord with a generation becoming more open to different musical genres thanks to streaming services. Regardless, the record’s challenging singularity of vision, combined with its positive critical and commercial reactions, created a new framework for jazz releases. Soon, The Epic’s influence was spiralling outwards from LA and sparking jazz resurgences in the UK and Chicago. In London, Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings released a breakbeat-heavy LP from Yussef Kamaal, AKA producer Kamaal Williams, and drummer Yussef Dayes, formerly of the jazz trio United Vibrations. The duo sold over 20,000 copies of their first and, so far, only record, Black Focus, a major success for an indie release. Black Focus was primed for dancefloor play in its machine-gun rhythms and headphone introspection in its sparse synth work. Its release opened the doors for a new generation of London-based jazz artists to further explore the intersections of electronics and improvisation, the club space and orchestration. Many young jazz musicians were trained by free grassroots organisations such as Jazz Warrior alumni Gary Crosby’s workshop Tomorrow’s Warriors, disrupting the traditional privileged pathway of jazz conservatoire education. Their music had a resulting diasporic fluidity, reflecting London’s cultural makeup. Mostly in their early 20s, artists including drummer and producer Moses Boyd, saxophonist Nubya Garcia and keys player Joe Armon-Jones played DIY venues off the traditional jazz circuit, such as Hackney’s Total Refreshment Centre and Deptford’s Steam Down jam, attracting an audience of students and curious locals. The aura of impenetrability that had calcified around jazz was dissipating, replaced by a vivid and multifaceted new identity: female-fronted group Nérija were signed to major independent label Domino in 2019 – a milestone in a consistently male-dominated genre. In Chicago, meanwhile, label International Anthem was taking an experimental tack, finding an eager audience for their releases from drummer Makaya McCraven, trumpeter Jaimie Branch and multi-instrumentalist Ben LaMar Gay. McCraven’s Where We Come From and Branch’s Fly or Die II albums were partly recorded in London and feature a number of the next-gen players such as Garcia. While British jazz had usually operated within the shadows of its American progenitor, here was a newfound parity for collaboration. The internet and social media were obvious facilitators of this increasing collaboration, along with the artists positioning themselves outside of traditional industry hierarchies, working in ever-mutating collectives. They staged their own shows and defined their own narratives. Rather than create a stifling atmosphere of control, this created a means of dialogue with the listener. Tapscott’s community was extending. Washington’s key work, the 2017 EP Harmony of Difference, is based on the idea of counterpoint: rhythm and harmony working together, yet with a friction that resists overarching unity. Each of its six tracks is named after differing emotions and features a distinct refrain, all of which combine in the final 13-minute opus, Truth. Here, movements bubble up from a down-tempo, meditative intro into a tightly swung solo from Washington before dropping to a half-time ascension and a choral close. Written for the Whitney Museum’s Biennial and presented alongside an impressionistic short film directed by AG Rojas, Truth is a warm and enveloping experience to behold – a slick culmination of Washington’s spiritual jazz. The following year’s Heaven and Earth LP continued the pugilistic ethos of The Epic, an anguished cry for change targeted at the world’s ills, featuring track titles such as Fists of Fury and Street Fighter Mas. The cover art once again depicted Washington and his saxophone, this time hovering above a plane of water. It acts as a deifying diptych to that of The Epic – from space to the earthly pursuit of heaven. By now, Washington’s maximalism had catalysed something new in the jazz revival, one which was building on and beyond his influence. UK quartet Sons of Kemet took the abstract empowerment of Washington’s music and radicalised it with precision. Their Mercury-nominated 2018 album Your Queen Is a Reptile indicted the unearned power of hereditary monarchy, positing instead their own lineage of “alternative queens” such as Harriet Tubman and Angela Davis. Where breath is a simultaneous signifier of force and fragility in Washington’s playing, for Sons of Kemet bandleader Shabaka Hutchings, circular breathing ensures that his saxophone is all power – a bursting forth of energy reminiscent of Albert Ayler’s reed-breaking laments targeted at 1960s New York. Coupled with Theon Cross’s susurrating tuba and dual drummers Tom Skinner and Eddie Hick, Hutchings’ honking sax fuses the kineticism of Afrobeat with the gasping urgency of free jazz. The mutations of this new scene have taken it to surprising places. Saxophonist Binker Golding and pianist Sarah Tandy are currently championing a return to the straight-ahead, air-tight swing of Wynton Marsalis and Michael Brecker – a mode previously dismissed for its fusty air of the conservatoire – while Joe Armon-Jones’s recent work is heavily influenced by dub and the patois rhythms of his vocalist Asheber. British Indian drummer Sarathy Korwar’s jazz pushes forward the hip-hop fusion of Lamar’s TPAB, this time enlisting the “gully” style of Mumbai Hindi rap, while Josef Leimberg is championing a new stonerism in spiritual jazz with his Astral Progressions project. Jazz-origin label Blue Note is ushering in a new era with vibraphonist Joel Ross, playing through the pert freneticism of Bobby Hutcherson. Critic Whitney Balliett describes jazz as “the sound of surprise” – the eternal present tense of improvisation – and the new jazz era resonates in the continual playfulness of this instant reaction. Perhaps in the instant-click era of streaming, jazz will always remain a fringe pursuit – or perhaps not, given that it has, crucially, re-engaged with a younger generation. Revivals and resurgences imply a preceding death, yet in the karmic philosophy of spiritual jazz, death can only mean rebirth, the onward movement of breath, sweat and melody. • This article was amended on 21 November 2019 because an earlier version attributed the “sound of surprise” quote to writer John Szwed. It was made by critic Whitney Balliett. This has been corrected."

The worsening outlook on US-China relations has been set off by, well, take your pick: the US Senate angered China with a new bill aimed at protecting the rights of protestors in Hong Kong; a former employee of the British consulate there alleged he was tortured during detention by China; and Donald Trump last night said tariffs could rise if no deal is agreed. And yet it has not apparently affected Alibaba, which managed to raise as much as £10bn on Hong Kong’s stock exchange. The ease with which Alibaba raised the money may be an indicator of the loose financing conditions about which the European Central Bank. The ECB said that financial risks are building, and that non-bank lenders could exacerbate market turmoil if they all rush to sell illiquid assets at the same time. Thanks for following our rolling coverage of business, economics and markets. Please do come back for more tomorrow. JJ Major indices on Wall Street have fallen across the board. The Nasdaq fell by 0.3%, the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.2% and the Dow Jones industrial average fell by 0.2% at the opening bell. *An earlier post has been updated to include Janus Henderson’s statement.

A quick look at futures shortly before the US markets open: The S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average are expected to fall by 0.25%, while the Nasdaq could fall by about 0.3%. And a quick chaser from the politics live blog: Boris Johnson’s big policy announcement appears to have been mistakenly revealed too early. “Some journalists think Boris Johnson may not have been planning to announce a huge proposed Conservative manifesto tax cut in a Q&amp;A with workers at an engineering company in Stockton-on-Tees.” The Guardian’s deputy political editor on Twitter: After three years of constant political turmoil, one of the stranger aspects of the general election campaign has been the relative lack of market-moving announcements: even Labour’s pledge to nationalise broadband infrastructure provider Openreach caused barely a flutter on the share price of current owner BT. However, there are some business and economics stories popping up. Today Boris Johnson pledged to raise the threshold at which workers pay national insurance on earnings to £12,000 a year, up from £8,632 currently. The Guardian’s politics live blog has the details – including the Institute for Fiscal Studies’ verdict on the tax cuts (TL;DR: they help low-paid workers, but they are not the most effective way of doing so). And the Liberal Democrat party has pledged to raise duties on frequent international flyers by £5bn a year. Read more here: Investment manager Janus Henderson has been fined £1.9m by the City regulator for not telling customers that their money was tracking investment indices, rather than being actively allocated by human managers. The Financial Conduct Authority said Janus Henderson had failed to treat fairly more than 4,500 retail investors in two of its funds, the Henderson Japan Enhanced Equity Fund and the Henderson North American Enhanced Equity Fund, by reducing the level of active management without telling customers. Retail customers were charged the same fees, despite the changes to the management. Major institutional customers, on the other hand, were informed, and Henderson offered to manage the funds for them for free. Fund managers charge significantly higher fees to actively manage money than those charged to users whose money tracks the performance of stock markets indices. However, more and more investors are using passive indices – as many studies have found that they rival active investment for value for money once fees are taken into account. Mark Steward, executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA, said: The FCA requires firms to treat all its customers fairly, not just some customers. In this case, retail investors paid fees for active investment management they did not receive. For retail clients, the Japan and North American Funds were in effect operating as “closet trackers” as the fees charged to them were inappropriate given the diminished level of active management. The matter is aggravated by the length of time HIFL took to identify the harm being caused to the retail investors and to fix it. A spokesperson for Janus Henderson said: The FCA’s notice relates to events in the period 2011 to 2016 prior to the merger between Henderson Global Investors and Janus Capital Group in 2017. Janus Henderson Investors accepts the FCA’s findings and the financial penalty and has co-operated fully throughout the process. Affected clients had already been separately contacted and fully compensated. Since the incident Janus Henderson Group has improved its systems and controls. More detail on the “female advisory board” that Aston Martin set up in 2015. “We’re not talking about making cars only for women, but rather to make our cars more practical for women and families, as well as men,” an Aston Martin spokesman said. In an interview with Yahoo Finance this year, Carlee Hardaker, Aston Martin’s senior manager of global customer and market intelligence, said: “It might be that their husband, boyfriend, or son, comes home and says, ‘I’m going to buy myself a supercar’ or’ ‘I’m going to buy a Ferrari or a Lamborghini.’ And the woman says, ‘No, you’re not, it looks like you’re having a mid-life crisis, but you can have an Aston’.” You can read the full report here: German car components maker Continental plans to cut about 5,500 jobs worldwide, in the latest sign of the struggles affecting the global automotive industry as it prepares to transition away from fossil fuels. The job cuts from 2024 onwards will fall at five plants in Germany, Italy and the USA, with the brunt of the cuts focused on factories producing parts used in petrol and diesel engines. Electric vehicle sales are expected to grow exponentially in the next decade, amid tighter emissions regulations. Continental said it planned to discontinue the business in hydraulic components for gasoline and diesel engines completely. In its statement, Continental said: This is against the backdrop of the automotive industry’s disruptive transition to electric mobility, which has been accelerated by stricter emissions laws, resulting in a drastic decline in demand for hydraulic components. The union representing Royal Mail workers has appealed against a high court judgment that their ballot in favour of strike action was not invalid. The Communication Workers Union tweeted that it has lodged its appeal with the high court, sending shares in Royal Mail to their lowest point of the day, down by 2.1%. Royal Mail successfully argued that the ballot was not carried out in accordance with legal rules as some workers had opened their ballots in sorting offices before they arrived at their home addresses. Royal Mail is keen to avoid strike action over the Christmas period, when parcel deliveries are commercially crucial. The privatised company also cited concerns over running postal votes during the general election on 12 December. Today is an important day for Aston Martin, with the launch of its make-or-break DBX, the company’s first sports utility vehicle. Chief executive Andy Palmer launched the car in Beijing, a clear indication of the company’s priority to sell to wealthy Chinese buyers. The company is particularly keen to increase its sales to women, diversifying a masculine-dominated image most associated with James Bond. It even hired a “Female Advisory Board” to help with design. Palmer has staked the future of the business on the SUV bet paying off. Carmakers have responded to surge in demand for the bulkier vehicles – despite the terrible toll for the planet of manufacturing less efficient modes of transport. Growing demand for SUVs was the second largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions from 2010 to 2018, according to the International Energy Agency. Aston Martin Lagonda is following the well worn path trodden already by Lamborghini’s Urus and Bentley’s Bentayga, and the car is priced similarly at £158,000, before extras. Those extras include a bumper protector and in-built hose to prevent dogs marking the car or boot warmers for cold weather. Aston Martin did not give details of how much the extra features will cost. Just after midday, shares on the FTSE 100 have lost 1.2%. Kingfisher remains the biggest faller, down 6.4%, while educational materials provider Pearson las lost 3.7% and insurer Aviva has lost 3.6%. Only four stocks were in positive territory at the time of writing on the blue-chip index. Mid-cap stocks on the FTSE 250 – less exposed to global trade tensions – were down by 0.5%. The Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba has raised about $11bn in a share offering in Hong Kong, the city’s biggest offering since 2010 despite ongoing protests against the Chinese-controlled regime. Alibaba said Wednesday that it has set the price for the offering at 176 Hong Kong dollars per share, raising 88bn Hong Kong dollars (£8.7bn) – the largest fundraising of 2019. That amount could rise to £10bn if bankers exercise options to sell an additional lump of shares over the next 30 days. In a statement, Alibaba said: The company plans to use the proceeds from the global offering for the implementation of its strategies to drive user growth and engagement, empower businesses to facilitate digital transformation, and continue to innovate and invest for the long term. The company’s share code, 9988, shares the same pronunciation as the Chinese expression for “eternal prosperity”. Shares are due to begin trading on 26 November. Back on the ECB, here’s a bit more detail on those building financial stability risks. Low interest rates – designed by central bankers to stimulate spending – have had the knock-on effect of making it more difficult for investors to make returns on their money. That has pushed investors outside the heavily regulated banking sector to look for returns, or yield, elsewhere. The ECB said: The ongoing search for yield across non-banks may exacerbate the build-up of vulnerabilities, not least by lowering financing costs for riskier borrowers. If markets do fall significantly investment funds, including hedge funds, could exacerbate any instability if they rush to sell assets that are difficult to sell, the ECB said. Funds invested in illiquid assets can face severe difficulties in dealing with large-scale outflows. Higher leverage, for example in hedge funds, can add to procyclical investor behaviour and accelerate outflows. The following chart shows the build-up in riskier bets. In the left-hand chart the two rings represent the credit ratings of companies in 2007 and 2018. The growth in high-yield debt (the yellow portion) is particularly striking; “high yield” is another way of saying riskier, in comparison to debt given safer A or B ratings. The right-hand side of the chart shows the growth in house prices across the euro area – another tell-tale sign of a growing bubble. South African investor Prosus has criticised Takeaway.com’s offer for food ordering service Just Eat as “unrealistic” as it pushes for shareholders to reject the Dutch company’s approach in favour of its own. Takeaway.com and Just Eat published the offer document for its £4.7bn bid – which is backed by Just Eat’s management – this morning, but Prosus is still holding out hope that shareholders will back its £4.9bn unsolicited offer. Prosus argues that Takeaway.com is underestimating the scale of investment needed in Just Eat’s own delivery capabilities, which face stiff competition from rivals such as Deliveroo and Uber Eats. Bob van Dijk, chief executive of Prosus, said the company was “excited about the prospect of adding Just Eat to our portfolio”. He said: Our cash offer provides compelling and certain value to shareholders at a premium to the Takeaway.com Offer and removes the downside risk for Just Eat’s shareholders. Our offer also reflects the substantial investment required in product, technology, marketing and own-delivery capabilities to make the most of Just Eat’s long-term potential. We believe that the Takeaway.com offer underestimates the substantial investment required in Just Eat to recapture market share and improve performance in an increasingly competitive sector undergoing global transformation. There’s a lot to digest in the European Central Bank’s financial stability review – the first under the leadership of newly appointed president Christine Lagarde. Some of the headline points from the ECB: The financial stability environment remains challenging, with “prominent downside risks to growth”. Signs of excessive leverage and risk-taking in some sectors – such as non-bank lenders, debt-burdened companies and property – “require targeted action”. Excessive risk and leverage in non-banks amplifies cycles in capital markets and contagion of stress to the wider financial system. Consolidation between European banks could help aid financial stability. Risks to the stability of the global financial system have increased as shadow banks have lent more money to businesses in place of traditional lenders, the European Central Bank (ECB) warned on Wednesday. Regulators around the world have increased their scrutiny on the banking sector since the financial crisis a decade ago. While central banks believe that has made the banking sector safer, there are growing concerns that a financial shock could leave shadow banks – such as investors, insurance companies and pension funds – exposed. The ECB said: In the event of a sudden repricing of financial assets, growing credit and liquidity risk in some parts of the euro area non-bank financial sector – coupled with higher leverage in investment funds – may lead non-banks to respond in ways that cause stress to spread to the wider financial system. Low interest rates have been an important part of the shadow banking phenomenon, as investors seek better returns. Luis de Guindos, vice-president of the ECB, said: While the low interest rate environment supports the overall economy, we also note an increase in risk-taking which warrants continuous and close monitoring. Authorities should use available tools to address the build-up of vulnerabilities where possible. An interesting story from the Financial Times (£) this morning for watchers of the UK’s most systemically important bank: HSBC is reportedly set to replace its investment banking head. Interim head Noel Quinn took over in August with a remit to cut thousands of staff, after his predecessor John Flint was ejected after barely 18 months in the job – reportedly for moving too slowly on improving returns. Now the shake-up could extend to the top of the bank. The FT said that Samir Assaf, head of global banking and markets, is expected to be moved to a non-executive role to allow a successor in who could shrink the unit serving the fundraising needs of large companies, citing people briefed on the matter. The top riser anywhere on the FTSE 350 is Mitchells and Butlers, the restaurant owners bucking the struggles of many other consumer-facing companies (cf. Kingfisher today). The owner of brands such as Harvester, Toby Carvery and Nicholson’s pubs reported like-for-like sales growth of 3.5% for the year ending 28 September. It increased adjusted operating profits by £14m, or 4%, and revenues and profits before tax also rose. It even managed to cut net debt (although it is still 3.6 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation). Phil Urban, the company’s chief executive, said: These strong results reflect the work we have done over the last few years, first to build sustained sales growth and then to convert that into profit growth. It has been extremely encouraging to see an improvement in like-for-like sales growth across the portfolio during the year, fuelled by our Ignite programme of work. This puts us in a stronger position as we move forward into the next financial year, in what we expect to remain challenging market conditions. An hour into trading, and blue-chip shares in London are down by 0.9%, accelerating losses from initial exchanges. The mid-cap FTSE 250 has lost 0.6%. Kingfisher is the biggest faller, down by 6.9%, while accounting tech company Sage Group and insurer Aviva have lost 3.6% and 3.3% respectively. On the latter two, from Reuters: Sage reported a 13% drop in full-year organic operating profit to £432m on Wednesday as its margin was squeezed by increased investment in its cloud and subscription products. Shares in Aviva slid on Wednesday after the British insurer announced it would reorganise into five divisions and sell its stake in its Hong Kong business, falling short of investor expectations for a broader change in strategy. But in a show of support for the beleaguered American manufacturer, Emirates revealed an $8.8bn (£6.8bn) order for 30 of Boeing’s 787-9 Dreamliners. However, Reuters reported the deal could allow Emirates – negotiating on its home turf in the Dubai air show – to reduce orders for Boeing’s other twin-aisle jet, the 777X, which has been delayed after engine issues. Air shows in recent months have been dominated by one thing: the crisis at Boeing over the grounding of the 737 Max. At the Dubai air show the top US regulator has indicated that it will have knock-on effects on the rest of Boeing’s business. The head of the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the regulator will be tougher on the certification of the Boeing 777x, its twin-aisle jet. FAA administrator Steve Dickson also repeated the message that the FAA was not following any timeline for the return to service of the grounded 737 MAX model, its lead single-aisle offering, and said time pressure cannot influence the FAA’s regulatory process. Here’s the full story on Twitter’s rebuke of the Conservative party over its misleading “factcheckUK” account. While Twitter has come out strongly against the tactic of renaming the account, the matter could reignite concerns over political misinformation on its platform. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Will Moy, the chief executive of indepedent checkers Full Fact, said Twitter should have acted sooner and could have forcibly renamed the account. Read more here: B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher is the biggest faller on the FTSE 100 this morning – with shares off by 7%. A quick glance at Kingfisher’s statement will give some clues why: there is a palpable sense of a new boss clearing the decks. The first five words of Thierry Garnier’s statement to the stock market might – to an uncharitable reader – be seen as diverting the blame for the DIY retailer’s problems towards former management: “In my first eight weeks” ... A 3.7% like-for-like sales fall in its third quarter and talk of too much complexity signal that there could be some more tough times ahead. Garnier said: As a team, our priority is to fix our operational issues – particularly in IT and supply chain in France – and refocus our efforts. This includes stopping or pausing a number of initiatives to concentrate on stabilising performance and trading. The effect of these changes will not be immediate. Analysts at MUFG Bank note that the response to the Hong Kong protests is a key diplomatic factor that could be affecting the trade talks. Lee Hardman and Fritz Louw, currency analysts at MUFG, highlighted a US Senate bill yesterday aimed at supportingprotesters in Hong Kong that warned China against a violent suppression of the demonstrators. China responded with a threat to retaliate if it becomes law. They wrote: The developments have put at least a temporary dampeneron building optimism over a US-China trade deal including the possibility of larger roll back of tariff hikes. Bloomberg reported yesterday that the two sides are locked in tough negotiations on a phase-one pact linking the size of tariff roll backs to the preliminary terms set in the failed deal from May. The White House is still reportedly debating the precise percentage of tariffs to roll back in response to China’s demand to remove all tariffs imposed after May immediately and then tariffs imposed before that to be lifted gradually. [...] A larger tariff roll back would be an encouraging development for financial markets and help further ease downside risks for the global growth outlook. Let’s have some more reaction to the big story driving markets around the world in the early morning (as so often in the last two years): the trade rhetoric rollercoaster. The back and forth can be contradictory and confusing but overall the US and China are making progress towards an interim deal, bets Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management. He said: In our base case we now see the US and China agreeing a Phase 1 deal that, at a minimum, averts additional tariffs. The initial agreement would likely include a resolution of less critical issues such as China’s purchases of US agricultural products and opening up of its financial services sector, as well as improving the transparency of its currency regime. We expect the more difficult structural issues, such as cybertheft and industrial subsidies, to be left for later phases. Our expected range for global equities in this scenario is for 0–5% upside from current levels. Just Eat has published the offer documents from Takeaway.com, meaning that the British tech firm will be acquired by the Dutch firm by 31 January if 75% of shareholders back the bid. The Takeaway.com offer, worth £4.7bn, is up against an unsolicited bid by Prosus, an arm of South African firm Naspers. Jitse Groen, chief executive of Takeaway.com, said: Today we are taking an important step towards the creation of what we believe will be the world’s leading online food delivery company. However, Just Eat’s shares are trading at a premium to the offer, indicating that investors are hoping for a better bid. European stock markets have caught a cold from Asia: the FTSE 100 is down by 0.5% at the opening bell. France’s Cac 40 has lost 0.5% and Spain’s Ibex is down 0.4%. Europe’s Stoxx 600 (which includes many of the above stocks) fell by 0.4%. Twitter has rebuked the Conservative party for misleading the public by changing its account name to “factcheckUK” during Tuesday evening’s general election debate. With the exceptions of Facebook and perhaps Google, Twitter is arguably the most powerful private company when it comes to the general election. The US social network has banned political advertising, but it usually steers clear of policing content or making decisions about “fake news” from politicians. However, it drew a line at changing a verified account – with the distinctive blue tick – to seemingly resemble an independent organisation. In a statement unprecedented in British politics, a spokeswoman said: Twitter is committed to facilitating healthy debate throughout the UK general election. We have global rules in place that prohibit behaviour that can mislead people, including those with verified accounts. Any further attempts to mislead people by editing verified profile information - in a manner seen during the UK Election Debate - will result in decisive corrective action. You can follow the political fallout here: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. A look at Donald Trump’s Twitter feed is enough to tell you that the US president has other things (impeachment) on his mind, but behind the scenes the wheels are still turning on trade negotiations between the US and China. And Trump’s feelings on the matter are still market critical: east Asian indices fell across the board on Wednesday morning following a threat of raising tariffs higher. The CSI 300 index, which measures the performance of stocks in Shenzhen and Shanghai, lost 0.99%, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong lost 0.71% and Japan’s Nikkei 225 fell by 0.62%. Speaking at a cabinet meeting at the White House, Trump said he had a good relationship with China, noting that China was “moving along.” However, he said China would have to make a deal “I like.” He said: If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher. Investor money flowed to safe-haven bonds in response. Yields on US 10-year Treasuries hit a two-week trough of 1.75%, as demand rose: yields move inversely to prices. That has set the tone for Europe, where futures indicate that stocks on the main indices are likely to fall in value. In UK corporate news, B&amp;Q owner Kingfisher reported like-for-like sales down by 3.7%, and new chief executive Thierry Garnier made it clear that the company has some upheaval ahead. My early assessment is that we have not found the right balance between getting the benefits of Group scale and staying close to local markets. We are suffering from organisational complexity, and we are trying to do too much at once with multiple large-scale initiatives running in parallel.

          "headline": "Love by Hanne Ørstavik review – a chilling study of emotional distance",
          "bodyText": "In this perfectly poised Norwegian novella, Vibeke and her young son Jon have recently moved to the far north of Norway. The book follows them through one long evening and into the dead of night, as the cold and dark press in. The first thing we learn about Vibeke is that she uses books to escape reality: “She wishes she could read all the time, sitting in bed with the duvet pulled up.” She drifts through the hours, thinking about her new job, cooking dinner, heading out to the library. Dreams of new clothes and the possibility of romance sustain her as she ekes out life’s small excitements. “Normally she keeps the library until Saturday, and today’s only Wednesday.” Jon, meanwhile, has his own projects – biscuits to snaffle, raffle tickets to sell for the sports club – and his own daydreams, mostly about trains and train sets. Tomorrow he will be nine, and he decides to get out of the house for as long as possible to give Vibeke the opportunity to bake him a cake. Vibeke has entirely forgotten Jon’s birthday. Ørstavik’s ingenious device is to toggle between their two consciousnesses from one paragraph to the next, so that their narratives run as though on parallel train tracks, never to meet, even as they lie cheek to cheek. Layers of unremarkable everyday intimacy and acres of emotional distance are compressed between the lines. The two strands are connected by gossamer threads – or perhaps only by the reader’s desire to bring them together. We cut between Vibeke turning on her car headlights and Jon at home, blinking; or Jon staring down the stairs in a neighbour’s house and Vibeke walking into her bathroom to look in the mirror. Ørstavik builds a cinematic sense of dread out of the plainest prose, phrase layered on phrase with the hushed implacability of falling snow. As Vibeke undresses for a bath, in that classic scene of female vulnerability, and Jon hesitantly descends into the neighbour’s mysterious basement – “‘You’ll like this,’ the old man tells him” – the tension is almost unbearable. And so is the contrast between Jon and Vibeke’s inner worlds. It quickly becomes clear that while Jon is always thinking of his mother – she even looms large in his dreams – Vibeke is thinking only of herself. Jon is obviously quoting Vibeke when he explains their arrival in town to a girl he meets: “My mom had to get away. She was too young to be tied down.” Vibeke, by contrast, can barely see her son. “Can’t you just go,” she thinks, as he tells her about a picture he’s seen in a magazine of a man being tortured. Ørstavik has written about the figure of the bad mother before, in her other book to be translated into English, 2014’s The Blue Room. It was a similarly chilling study of otherness and yearning; Ørstavik has found fertile territory here in which to dig into the raging solipsism of the inner life. One of the many uncanny things about this novella is that, though it was published in Norway more than two decades ago, it hasn’t dated at all (to the contrary: Jon’s obsession with images of torture has accrued a nasty significance after Abu Ghraib). Instead, it seems to float out of time. Everything becomes weightless in the cold, thinks Jon. “As if he were a bubble of air himself, ready at any moment to float into the sky and vanish into the firmament.” The extremity of the climate is an existential force within the book, serving to dwarf and muffle human interactions. Every interior space – the fairground trailer in which Vibeke chats awkwardly with a man she’s met, strangers’ houses and cars, that ominous basement – hovers between refuge and prison. At one point, she stares from the interior of the man’s car into a cafe: two sealed worlds separated by the darkness and cold of the night, but also by unbridgeable human desires. And if the characters are always retreating from the weather, they are also retreating from each other, closing their eyes and vanishing into the secret darkness of sleep or daydreams. “She likes him with his eyes shut too, immersed in his own world,” thinks Vibeke, staring at the man she hopes will offer her the love of the title. As the night wears on, Jon finds that he has forgotten his key. Vibeke’s quest for romance leaves him shut out of their home, just as he is shut out of her thoughts, and he begins his own faltering odyssey in her wake. “Didn’t your mother ever tell you not to go with strangers?” asks the unnerving woman who gives him a lift. “Not everyone’s as nice as me.” Every stranger is indeed strange in this eerie, devastating little book; but the same is true of family. We are all sealed worlds, Ørstavik seems to suggest; it’s dark outside, and it’s dark inside too. • Love is translated by Martin Aitken and published by And Other Stories (£10).

          "headline": "Jimmy Kimmel: 'Dolphins at Sea World have busier days than Trump'",
          "bodyText": "Late-night hosts ridiculed Donald Trump’s reportedly busy schedule while discussing his latest social media attacks. Jimmy Kimmel On Jimmy Kimmel Live, the host spoke about Jennifer Williams, an aide to Mike Pence who was one of a number of listeners on the Ukraine call. “There were more people listening in on this call than there were at his inauguration,” he said. Trump then attacked her on Twitter calling her a Never Trumper, despite the fact she works at the White House. “It’s like calling the Hamburglar a vegetarian. It’s ridiculous,” he said. Over the weekend, Trump took an unscheduled visit to the hospital, which his people have claimed is because he had a down day and wanted to get ahead with his next physical. “Every day is a down day,” Kimmel joked. He then showed a sample day of the president’s schedule which had just two afternoon meetings. “The dolphins at Sea World have busier days than our president,” he said. Trump is also apparently strongly considering whether he wants to testify during the impeachment hearings. “The only thing he ever strongly considers is original or extra crispy,” he said. Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert said that 70% of Americans agree that what Trump has done with Ukraine is wrong. “It’s nearly impossible to get 70% of Americans to agree on anything,” he said. “The only other thing I can think of is don’t eat Taco Bell before getting on a rollercoaster.” He also joked about recently unearthed information indicating that Gordon Sondland said to Trump that he could get the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to do whatever he wants because “he loves your ass”. “Oh, who doesn’t?” Colbert joked over a shot of Trump in tennis shorts. “That’s like two hams stuck in a surgical glove.” Marie Yovanovitch, the former US ambassador to the Ukraine, has said that Rudy Giuliani was trying to target her in a smear campaign. “If there’s one thing Rudy Giuliani knows it’s how to destroy a reputation,” he said. “So far, just his but he burned that mother to the ground.” Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about the unscheduled hospital visit, saying that while we have questioned the health of other candidates, Trump has remained “freakishly healthy”. Rumours concerning the specifics of the trip have been swirling, including some questioning whether it could be a stroke. “How would you even be able to tell?” he said. “Because the symptoms of a stroke are slurred speech, confusion and erratic behaviour. For Trump, that’s a Tuesday.” He continued: “If Trump starts speaking normally that’s when Melania should call an ambulance.” But given how the impeachment hearings have been going, Noah said: “It wouldn’t be surprising if he had a panic attack.” Noah then brought up the much-discussed call between Sondland and Trump that a US embassy official listened in on. “Not because Trump is on speakerphone but because Trump is a human speakerphone,” he said. Noah also couldn’t help making a joke about the comment suggesting that Zelenskiy loved Trump’s ass. “We all thought Trump’s leverage over Ukraine was military aid. Turns out, it’s that ass,” he joked. Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers detailed the six men linked to Trump who have now been convicted of a crime. “Who among us doesn’t have six work friends who are also criminals,” he said. He also brought up Trump’s attack on Yovanovitch with Trump tweeting that everywhere she went things turned sour. “Everywhere she went turned bad?” Meyers said. “You’ve gone bankrupt six times and botched everything from casinos to your charity to your dumbass businesses.” He joked about Trump’s failed vodka. “Only Trump could take something that’s supposed to be flavourless and make it taste like shit,” he quipped. Meyers said the timing of the tweet, during Yovanovitch’s testimony, was “like punching the bailiff during your assault trial”. He joked: “At this point he should just do DVD director’s commentary during the proceedings.” Meyers concluded with a reference to the Republican refusal to admit wrongdoing in the face of overwhelming evidence. “Republicans won’t budge unless we have a photo of Trump on the phone with a word bubble coming out of his mouth saying ‘I am doing a crime now,’” he said."

          "bodyText": "Those early days of a relationship often pass in a fog of bliss. Texts from friends go unreturned; entire weekends are lost in bed. But many relationships crumble by the three-month mark – when you start to see the other person’s flaws, but before the partnership becomes a solid, defined entity. If you can weather the three-month point, those early days will set the tone for your future relationship. What are the common mistakes people make at the start of relationships – and how can you avoid them? The experts weigh in. Coming on too strong It’s good to know what you want from a prospective partner, and to be clear about that. But it’s off-putting to lay everything out on the table straight away. “Don’t set out your 20-year plan on the first few dates,” says psychologist and relationship expert Emma Kenny. “It can be intimidating. It also means that you’ve negated the opportunity to see how things would develop naturally with that person.” Being too rigid in what you want It’s good to have an idea of the sort of person with whom you would like to settle down. But being too rigid in the early stages of a relationship can kill promising romances stone dead. “Think about what that other person is as an individual, not in terms of their political beliefs or whether they’re a vegan or whatever,” Kenny says. Put away the checklist. “It’s not a great idea to interview someone on the first few dates. Asking them how much they’re earning, or about their home-owning situation – it’s not an organic way to get to know someone. You’re a prospective partner, not a recruitment consultant.” Performing for them Early on in relationships, you often want to put your best foot forward – be the cool girl (or boy) who is up for anything, never complains and always looks fabulous. “When you start dating someone new, you can put on a bit of a show,” says dating coach Persia Lawson. “You’re trying to perform, instead of being authentic.” But it’s an exhausting pretence to have to maintain long-term. Why not just be yourself? “I try to encourage people to realise it’s cooler to just be yourself. If you’re trying too hard to perform around someone, they’re probably not the right person for you anyway.” Not learning from past relationships “I’m a big fan of relationship audits,” says Kenny. “Look back at your last relationship and see what went wrong. Ask yourself: ‘What am I doing wrong in relationships? How accountable should I be?’” Perhaps you have a habit of dating emotionally unavailable people, or you struggle to respect boundaries. By doing some work on yourself, you will be better placed for a future, healthy relationship. Moving too fast When you’re caught up in the dopamine rush of a new relationship, it’s tempting to want to crash through all the major milestones as fast as possible, as if you are collecting mushrooms in Mario Kart. “A lot of my clients make the mistake of moving too fast in general,” says Kenny. “Telling someone you think they’re the one and you’re deeply connected to them after date one or two is not great for everybody involved.” Don’t meet the friends and family for at least three months. “It’s OK to take things at a slower pace sometimes,” says Ammanda Major, a therapist at Relate. “People want to get in there and meet friends and parents and live in each other’s lives after a very short time. But it’s OK to take it at a slower pace. If you go rushing along and the whole thing collapses after three months, you may end up feeling bereft.” Ignoring red flags We’ve all been there. You have been dating someone for a few weeks, they seem perfect and then they’re rude to a waitress or trash-talk their ex. Don’t ignore red flags. “Red flags are important, because they mean you should step back from that relationship,” says Kenny. “Maybe you hate it when people raise their voice, then they shout at you – but you find them so attractive, you ignore it. If you ignore red flags, you will end up in a horrible relationship.” Besides, anyone who is rude to a waitress is definitely not worth your time. Posting too much online Be mindful of what you post on social media. “It can feel wonderful to think you’ve met your soulmate, but remember that if it’s going to be an important relationship, you don’t have to rush things,” says Major. Which means: hold off on the loving romantic tributes, for now. “If you post: ‘I’m in a fabulous relationship, I think this is the one,’ your new partner might see that and if that’s not where their head is at, you’ve kiboshed it before it’s even started. Or if it doesn’t work out, you might feel embarrassed.” Not establishing clear boundaries early on The first three months of a relationship set the tone for the rest of your time together. If you’ve allowed the relationship to be on your partner’s terms, you will find it hard to come back from that. “You need to respect yourself and have clear boundaries when it comes to dating someone,” says Lawson. “Be brave enough to put your boundaries up and say: ‘This is what I need and what I desire.’ A lot of people are scared to express how they want to be treated for fear of being rejected. But it’s better to know now than later. Besides, people are attracted to people who know their own worth, rather than accepting the crumbs and scraps of poor behaviour, because they think it’s all they can get.” Don’t be afraid to challenge your partner or pull them up on their behaviour in those early months – if you let things slide now, you will be letting them slide for ever. Glossing over sexual incompatibility It’s completely natural for sex with a new partner to not be mindblowing initially – you are only just getting to know each other. But if things continue to misfire in the bedroom department, that may be a sign you’re not right for each other. Long-term, you can only have a healthy relationship with someone with whom you are sexually compatible. “If your intimate life isn’t working out, you must not ignore that,” says Major. Try to address things head-on. “Communicate your desires openly and share your kinks. You have to deal with things as soon as possible, otherwise you’re going to have problems.” If things don’t work out, move on. Being too available When you think you have found the one, it can be tempting to cancel all your plans and hole up together. “You stop contacting your friends, and start scheduling your entire life around when you may see them,” says Lawson. “You sideline any hobbies or interests you have.” But if you do this, you may end up isolated from your support systems in an unhealthy relationship. “In my experience, couples who spend all their time together don’t seem to work out,” Lawson says. “It becomes toxic and codependent.” Rather, embrace some healthy distance. “You need to have friendships, hobbies and interests outside your relationship.” Beware the love bubble – it always bursts, whether you like it or not."

          "headline": "How the Ikea Christmas ad brought grime to the masses",
          "bodyText": "Everything you need to know about why Ikea’s Christmas ad is a big deal can be summarised in one word: grime. The Swedish furniture monolith has drawn on the genre that has given us Stormzy at Glastonbury, two Mercury music prize winners, #Alexfromglasto and a 21st-century cultural earthquake that continues to reverberate through the mainstream. The central conceit of the ad is simple: a modern (read: young, mixed-ethnicity, good-looking, inoffensive) family, sitting about in their home being modern, good-looking and generally inoffensive. The mum looks around and realises how shabby her surroundings are. Suddenly, all manner of kitsch and very un-Ikea ornaments come to life and start spitting bars about how clapped-out the flat is, in grime star D Double E’s unmistakable warbling couplets. First up, what kind of Christmas miracle had to have taken place for Ikea to work out that a relatively underground grime legend was the key to Christmas cheer in 2019? We’re talking about the same Ikea that appears to know so little about black culture that it managed to serve up Jamaican rice and peas with green garden peas earlier this year – a gaffe so profound it led to an official apology. Yet now the Swedish meatball giant has somehow managed to enlist one of the most credible grime delegates, all in the service of selling flat‑pack furniture. It shouldn’t work, but it does. And it all hinges on the very simple fact that D Double E – ironically captured in fake, animated ornaments – is very real indeed. That’s because grime is a genre that exudes analogue authenticity in a digital age. Much of grime’s appeal, particularly for anyone born after the birth of the internet, is that it feels tangible and abrasive and credible. We live in an age of on-screen, online influencers sponsored by businesses that desperately need attention. We’ve become so used to celebrity endorsements that we don’t even flinch when millionaire celebs turn up in ad breaks, selling us coffee or shampoo or mortgages or whatever. In this bleak climate, the celebrity with integrity becomes something of a rare find. D Double E, with his beyond-the-mainstream notoriety, offers a credibility that hits like oxygen those of us who have been suffocated by commercialism. In short, D Double E is the grime fan favourite. He’s a renowned MC hailing from grime’s spiritual home of east London: Newham, to be specific. By putting D Double E at the forefront, Ikea has given the grimy underground a dazzling spotlight it’s impossible not to cheer for, inviting everyone to the party. In recent years we’ve seen the Christmas ad become a perennial feature of the season: it’s all about eliciting genuine emotions from consumers at a very superficial time of year. Retailer John Lewis has made an artform of the so-called love note approach, designed to make us warm and fuzzy enough to reach for our wallet/click “add to basket”/blubber uncontrollably. But D Double E beats a cute penguin, generous child, or young Elton John at his first piano hands down. The quirkiness, the witticisms, the reload-baiting one-liners, the slightly abrasive edge – all the things that gave grime enough fizz to bubble out of the streets of east London into the palace (Wiley’s MBE), the ballot box (#Grime4Corbyn), the Glastonbury mainstage (Stormzy), and now, it would seem, the TV screens of middle England. Grime has arrived. The irony here is that for all the warmth of D Double E’s persona and the grimy furnace in which he was forged (not to mention the hearty social media backslaps and fire emojis he’s been getting since the advert debuted), Ikea is kind of, well, cold. It’s a company that sells a lifestyle and a dream and delivers cardboard boxes. In a cynical world, this whole moment is just another win for commercialisation, able to convert nostalgia, idiosyncrasy and everything in between into glittering profit. And in terms of race politics, is it just another chapter in the same old appropriation story? The advert riffs on the timeless appeal of marginalised black culture in the mainstream gaze. Just think of every advert you’ve seen employing an overt hip-hop soundtrack, or some kind of “cool” black stereotype. But no. Watching the ad for the nth time and hearing my kids repeat “budubup-bup”, I feel like I can allow myself a little flutter of joy. For me, it’s not actually about Ikea, or the ad, or even Christmas. D Double E has done the thing that we must truly celebrate – he’s eclipsed the machine and brought grime to the masses. And that might just be the biggest gift of all. • Jeffrey Boakye is the author of Hold Tight: Black Masculinity, Millennials, and the Meaning of Grime"

          "headline": "Leon Smith hints Andy Murray may miss out for Britain in revamped Davis Cup",
          "bodyText": "In the many years that Leon Smith has brought the disparate bits and pieces of British tennis together in a Davis Cup team capable of great things Andy Murray has been the unchallenged centrepiece of the captain’s strategy. That might not be the case here this week. Smith said on Monday as he prepared for the first match in the revamped 18-team World Cup Of Tennis – on Wednesday against the Netherlands, on the smaller Court 3, curiously – the three-slam champion will be in the selection mix alongside Kyle Edmund and Dan Evans. “Between the three of them it’s a conversation,” is Smith’s mildly surprising take on it. “It’s not between two people. It’s between three people who can all go out and do a job. “They’ve all been playing very well in practice. The courts are quite quick at altitude and the ball’s moving quickly through the air. For different reasons it suits our players well. So it’s quite an open book for who is going to play on each different day.” He added: “Any time you can bring Andy into the team is going to make your team better. He’s still working his way back to the level he wants to get to, so people have to keep the expectations of the right level of where he’s at just now. He’s making brilliant strides. “What he did in Antwerp [where he won his first tournament in nearly two and a half years] was much talked about and a brilliant step forwards but you do have to remember this is early days in him coming back. “We’ve got really good options. With Andy, with Evo, with Kyle, guys playing a very similar level – and with Jamie [Murray] and Neal [Skupski] we’ve got strong doubles options. “Equally, the singles guys can play doubles and that’s what you’re going to need with this format, especially since we start on Wednesday and we’ll be playing every day if we’re going to be successful. Making use of the squad could be important. “Andy has been our leading figure for so many years now, and was such a massive part of our team. The bottom line is everyone looks up to him. It doesn’t matter if it’s the players, the support team. He brings a huge amount of energy, experience and quality into the team. Everyone soaks that in. But on the other side he’s just one of the guys. That’s what’s great about it. The bottom line is all of us have been friends for a very, very long time.” There is no questioning the bonhomie around the squad. “We travelled here on Wednesday, did one session that evening and we’ve been going at it since then,” he said. “It’s been really positive.” As for the organisation of the tournament, Smith sees only positives. “They’ve invested a lot of money to make sure the venue, facilities, transport, food, the practice courts, even the bubble courts, everything is very high quality. If you listen to most of the players’ feedback, I’m sure you’re hearing it’s very positive. They’re happy to be here, they’re making the players feel very welcome. The medical facilities are of a high standard as well.” But tennis needs more than a sticking plaster at the moment, with this experiment cobbled together over the past 22 months and the new ATP Cup waiting to be collected in six weeks in Sydney. Smith, as ever, is upbeat. “We are genuinely excited about this new format,” he said. “We’re all desperate for it to be a success – and I think it will be. It’s still going to be different. One of the great things – Andy mentioned it the other day – is seeing everyone in their team tracksuits, being able to practise with one another. We had a whole day against the Belgians, which was fun. We get on well with them after what we went through in the final [in Ghent four years ago]. We’ve played the Chileans, Argentinians, a number of different nations.” If that sounds more like a summer camp in the Catskills for under-employed city kids, there is genuine intent to do well here – and decent prospects. Much, as ever, will be on Murray’s racket, whatever the permutations available."

          "bodyText": "A whoop of exhilaration surges through the audience as a pick-up truck rises on to the stage through a trapdoor, its gleaming streamlined body emerging through swirling clouds of dry ice. There are laser beams and pounding rock music as a pair of robotic arms mime the balletic movements of welding and spraying its bodywork. A blast of air comes from a hidden bank of fans and a dramatic rumble shakes our seats. This, a thunderous voice tells us, is the Ford F-150 pick-up, officially the best-selling vehicle in US history. I am watching this spectacle in the 4D cinema of Ford’s River Rouge factory in Detroit, where the whooping audience taking the tour of the plant is being treated to a story that, unlikely as it sounds, has all the drama of a Hollywood movie. This factory changed not only mechanised production, but the world as we know it. Boasting its own docks, an electricity plant, a steel mill and a whopping 100 miles of railroad track, River Rouge was the biggest factory in the world when it opened in 1928. It even had its own fire stations, a police force and a fully staffed hospital. During the depths of the great depression, it still managed to employ 100,000 people. But today, River Rouge is a shadow of its former self. Half of the 1,200-acre site has been sold off to other companies. The Ford plant now mostly comprises a single shed, its roof is planted with sedum – flimsy eco-camouflage, given all the gas-guzzling trucks trundling off the production line within. Ford has decided to abandon sales of its smaller cars in North America, concentrating instead on SUVs and trucks – at a time when such vehicles have been found to be the second biggest contributor to the rise in CO2 levels. Recent analysis found that if SUV drivers were a nation, they would rank seventh in the world for carbon emissions. This astonishing rise and fall is reflected in the city beyond the gates. Detroit’s population once topped 1.8m, scattered across a freeway-threaded sprawl that could comfortably fit San Francisco, Boston and Manhattan within its boundaries. That same area now accounts for a third of that number, along with scores of abandoned homes. The very invention that made Detroit – and changed everything from urban planning to fashion design and the climate – has also lumbered the city, and the world, with an intractable legacy. “The history of the car is a history of unintended consequences,” says Brendan Cormier, who made several visits to Detroit as research for a show that’s about to open at the V&amp;A in London. Cars: Accelerating the Modern World represents the first time in the institution’s 167-year history that it has tackled the automobile, a surprising omission for what curator Cormier calls “the single most important designed object of the 20th century”. The lapse is partly because cars have always been seen to be more about science, technology and surface styling, making them an uncomfortable fit for the illustrious museum of craft. This exhibition, says Cormier, aims to examine their broader social and historical context, shining a full beam on the astonishing impact cars have had on everything from the formation of labour unions to toasters. (One, called the Toastalator, looks like something Jack Kerouac would have driven.) And Detroit is the best place to see all this first-hand. Driving across town from the plant, past blocks of overgrown lots, we arrive at the Walter P Reuther Library, whose reading room displays an imposing 1930s mural. Two muscular workers, one male and one female, hold hands in front of an industrial scene in which autoworkers confront scowling managers. In one corner, a group of mobster-like heavies can be seen beating a stooped figure on a bridge, while another is pushed down the stairs. This is The Battle of the Overpass, a clash between union leaders and Ford management that took place in 1937. It became one of the most important events in labour history. Among the beaten was Walter P Reuther, leader of the United Automobile Workers union (UAW), who had organised a “Unionism, Not Fordism” campaign, demanding fair wages and a shorter working day. Ford’s henchmen were lead by Harry Bennett, a caricature of a thug who kept lions in his fortified estate. When Bennett unleashed his muscle, newspaper photographers were waiting and their images, splashed across front pages the following day, caused public sentiment to turn against the company. A sit-down strike, also depicted in the mural, had an even greater impact, leading to the full unionisation of the US auto industry. The UAW provided a model for other organisations and became the largest union in North America. “The UAW played a major role in developing the American middle class,” says Cormier, who has negotiated loans from the union’s archive, including graphic posters from the 1950s and 60s. One, depicting a robot pushing workers off a building, has the slogan: “Fight automation fallout.” The same battles continue today, as workers face plant closures across the US as a result of stiff competition from Asia and a global decline in car ownership. At this critical point for the car, the show will reveal how some of our current challenges aren’t as modern as we like to think. At the General Motors Heritage Center, a great hangar full of gleaming vintage specimens on the outskirts of Detroit, we find the Firebird, a 1950s concept car that looks like a missile on wheels, with a bubble-topped cockpit bulging from its curving fuselage. The car – which will appear in the exhibition – wasn’t just an exercise in going faster. It embodied the embryonic idea of driverless driving, boasting an “electronic guide system that can rush it over an automatic highway while the driver relaxes”. It’s not hard to see why it didn’t take off: these futuristic vehicles were to be guided via radio by men in watchtowers a few hundred metres apart, mapping the best route from their bird’s eye view. A little further down an eight-lane highway, we arrive at the GM Tech Center, designed by Eero Saarinen in the 1960s as a modernist corporate campus, complete with an enigmatic silver dome where new designs are still inspected in secret. “Just as Versailles was designed to be seen from a horse-drawn carriage, this place was designed to be viewed from your moving car,” says GM archivist Christo Datini, as we glide around the vast ornamental lake in his gargantuan Chevrolet Suburban. The comparison isn’t so far-fetched: the centre houses treasures that have proved just as influential as a gilded Louis XIV chaise. In the archive are reams of original design drawings from GM’s glory days under Harley Earl. As the first director of the company’s Art and Colour Section, Earl is widely regarded as the godfather of modern car design. In an industry that had only ever been guided by the functional necessities of engineering, Earl introduced the concept of styling bodies and interiors. First he hired dazzle camouflage artists, who had painted ships in the second world war, to make bodies look more sculpted. Then he went on to develop such purely aesthetic features as tail fins and pointed chrome bumpers, both inspired by fighter jets. He also ushered in the strategy of the annual model update, which GM liked to call “dynamic obsolescence”. This was a way of using design to encourage drivers to upgrade their cars more frequently – a tactic that quickly spread to practically every other product in the world. Earl looms large in the section about making the modern consumer. He is pictured with his “Damsels of Design”, another marketing ruse that emphasised the role of his (small) team of female designers, as a way of appealing to women buyers. As he put it in a 1958 press release: “The skilled feminine hands helping to shape our cars of tomorrow are worthy representatives of American women, who today cast the final vote in the purchase of three out of four automobiles.” Less loudly trumpeted was the fact that their role was limited to seats and fabrics. The damsels may have been used as a cynical promotional tool, but elsewhere the exhibition will show how cars have been a means of empowerment, with such racing drivers as Kay Petre and Jill Scott Thomas becoming powerful symbols of the suffrage movement. Subcultures are also explored, in the form of wildly customised lowriders and souped-up muscle cars, while the future of environmentally conscious mobility, and the eventual demise of personal car ownership, will be thrown into sharp relief by attitudes from the 1960s. A shocking advert for the Humble Oil Company from 1962 proudly boasts: “Each day Humble produces enough energy to melt seven million tons of glacier!” Museums, you could almost say, are where cars now belong. • Cars: Accelerating the Modern World is at the V&amp;A, London, from 23 November until 19 April."

          "headline": "John Safran on the occult, obstacles and 'bad faith' criticisms: 'It's a bit rich'",
          "bodyText": "What wonderful symbolism for John Safran’s new mission my choking fit is. We’re sitting in a bar. I’m trying to relay some renewed criticisms made of his work, when my throat seizes up and I can’t get the words out. Is it psychological disturbance or witchcraft? That question is a central theme of Safran’s Audible Original podcast, John Safran vs the Occult, which reignites his fascination for religion and ritual. He travels to Texas to track down former Salvadoran gang members purported to be Satanists (by accusers including President Trump); to the South Pacific to unravel the deaths of two men accused of being witches; and back home to Melbourne where he meets a Muslim woman who believed herself to be possessed after having a baby. Pertaining to the choking fit, either I hit a blockage upon asking Safran an awkward question, or he put a hex on me. You can make up your own mind. As a storyteller, Safran deals in ambiguity, never trundling towards some foregone conclusion. It was Audible that originally pitched him the idea of investigating witchcraft in Vanuatu. Part gumshoe, part one-man flashmob, Safran is the perfect man for the job. He has been nailed to a cross in the Philippines in 2009 and underwent an exorcism in the 2004 ABC series John Safran vs God, but he doesn’t immerse himself as physically in this show – although he does get a nasty staph infection while under the influence of kava. The podcast taps into his longstanding interest in ritual, which makes it far safer territory than his previous forays into race. As Safran observes, even secular people often give the dark arts a free pass (rather like the heathens on Instagram believe the Universe will deliver) because such beliefs serve as a lubricant, to release what’s inside. He himself found value in that when his televised exorcism, shortly after his mother’s death, gave him legitimate reason to wail. The flipside is that accusations of witchcraft and Satanism have long been a preferred method of control by those in positions of power. “People harness these forces to get shit done, for better or worse,” he narrates – but ultimately, he defends the individual’s right to their beliefs. In fact, there’s a scathing sign-off addressed to Richard Dawkins, the curmudgeonly atheist who Safran interviewed live in 2018 – and who then, he says in the first episode, publicly mocked Safran’s exorcism. For the podcast, Safran travelled without security, but he’s sat through a few high-risk-scenario workshops in his time. “I remember us learning how to kill someone with a water bottle,” he says. “In self-defence.” I wonder out loud if he has an underactive amygdala, so uncomfortable and sometimes dangerous are the situations he inserts himself into. “I think it’s a bit like when you go driving you’re not thinking about, is this gonna make me a quadriplegic?” he says. “You just assume this won’t be the one where you get sideswiped by a truck.” What’s it like being John Safran in 2019? Even since his previous project, the 2017 book Depends What You Mean by Extremist (in which he got stoned with the United Patriots Front), there’s been a firmer shift towards not giving airtime to extremists or a voice to killers. Certainly it’s hard to imagine some of the stunts he pulled in his 2009 ABC series Race Relations getting the green light now. So has the noose tightened on his work, or do the changing times add a new dimension? “There’s a layer to it that’s annoying, in that often people – in our smug media bubble but also in the wider community – only know about things like, say, the alt-right, because people went out and spoke to the alt-right and wrote about it … It’s a bit rich to pretend that [alt-right] knowledge somehow just floated into their head from nowhere,” he says tartly. He references a Mother Jones piece about white nationalist Richard Spencer, which opens with a description of him using chopsticks “to deftly pluck slivers of togarashi-crusted ahi from a rectangular plate”. “I noticed the people going, ‘Huh! We don’t need to know that.’ It’s like, ‘No, you idiots. Clearly, the journalist’s intention – and they were successful in it – was to say, ‘Hey, you might think far-right people are on the back of pickup trucks going yee-haw, but they’re not.’” Warming to the theme, he continues: “With my style, I just assume everyone’s going to get what I’m getting at, without me wagging my finger. Clearly, if I’m talking to someone who’s a huge racist and violent, the starting point is, ‘I think that’s awful.’ If people are going to have that much bad faith [in their misinterpretation], I reckon in response I’m allowed to have bad faith in them, and say, how much do you actually think that and how much are you just trying to have an angle for your own think-piece?” He shakes it off. “Anyway.” The criticisms of his methods that had me frantically drinking water largely pertain to Race Relations, produced by Princess Pictures (on whose watch both Safran and Chris Lilley have donned blackface). Told from the perspective of Safran, who is Jewish, the satirical comedy-documentary series was about the limits of interfaith and crosscultural love. In it, Safran encourages a Palestinian film crew member to covertly provide a sample to an Israeli sperm bank in an attempt to bridge the Middle Eastern divide by making a half-Palestinian, half-Jew (a Jewestinian); disguises himself as a black man (in part by painting his skin) and uses the N-word in Chicago, in order to experience life in someone else’s shoes (as he later told Vice); and is transformed into a ladyboy while wondering if his desire for Eurasian women is creepy or not. Back then, a reviewer from the Age condemned it, and the Herald Sun wondered if he’d gone too far. The Australian Family Association spokesman John Morrissey described the show as “filth” and “the lowest point in the history of Australian television”. But many saw value in it too. Alice Pung’s sympathetic Monthly essay on Safran’s Race Relations, cannily titled Border Crossings, reflected: “In Safran’s world, there is no sanctioned way to behave in a social setting … There are no set rules or rituals … no moral compass points, because ‘everything is just so confusing’.” Of the critiques, which were circulating again last week, Safran says, “I don’t assume everyone’s coming from a good place … It’s a case-by-case thing, whether I take on board a criticism. “Often, if there’s a curveball thrown at you, or a criticism, it can be helpful in that it’s the next thing you can address. There’s been so much in my work that has been me responding to an obstacle. I don’t just think, ‘This is bad’.” Perhaps the last word should go to the anonymous woman who speaks at the beginning of each Audible episode. “This program contains disturbing content,” she says. “Listener discretion is advised.” • John Safran vs The Occult is available on Audible on 19 November, and is free for a limited time."

          "bodyText": "1. Save time with a multipurpose spray Zero-waste blogger Rachelle Strauss fills a spray bottle with half vinegar and half water. “If you don’t like the smell of vinegar, you can add essential oils. I like things such as lemon and lime to make it really zesty.” The beauty of the spray, she says, is you can use it for 90% of cleaning jobs. “You can clean your work surfaces, the dining table, the sink, ceramic hobs, bathrooms and mirrors.” Vinegar can also be used to descale the kettle – cover the element with it and boil. 2. Olive oil is not just for drizzling “It is an amazing natural alternative to furniture polish,” says the aptly named Madeleine Olivia, author of the forthcoming book Minimal: How to Simplify Your Life and Live Sustainably. “Any standard olive oil will do. Dab some on a cloth, polish gently over the surface and leave to dry. You can add lemon juice for a fresh scent.” One squeeze of lemon for each quarter of a cup, she suggests. 3. Discover castile soap Olivia swears by this non-toxic and biodegradable type of soap. “You can use it for laundry detergent, dish soap, hand soap, floor cleaner or even shampoo,” she says. “For washing-up liquid, mix four parts of castile soap with one part water in a repurposed container. For sparkling floors, add 1/4 cup of vinegar to your bucket of hot water and a generous squeeze of castile soap.” 4. Bulk buy bicarbonate of soda Bicarb, says Strauss, works in three ways: it deodorises (putting a small bowl in a fridge will absorb foul smells); it fizzes when wet and penetrates grease; and it is gently abrasive - great for cleaning bathrooms. For the latter, it can leave a residue “so finish with some vinegar spray and your taps will shine”, says Strauss. Oven cleaner and drain unblockers come with the most extreme health warnings of all cleaning products. However, says Strauss, you can tackle these jobs with bicarb. “When your oven has cooled down but is still warm sprinkle a thick layer of bicarb over the oven floor, add a little water and leave it for half an hour,” she says. “All the grease will just come away. I’m not pretending that it would look like you have used Mr Muscle, but it’ll be good enough.” And it’s non-toxic. For drains, she says: “Sprinkle some bicarb down, then pour some vinegar and it will start to bubble and dislodge grease.” 5. Fight mould with tea tree oil and vinegar To tackle mould and mildew, Olivia fills a spray bottle with white vinegar and a few drops of tea tree oil. “Leave to do its thing for 30 minutes, then scrub off with a cloth and warm water,” she says."

          "bodyText": "Roquefort pastries “Nothing like a nice festive sherry to fortify the taste buds,” says Auntie Jean, while quietly drinking a pre-prandial Christmas amontillado. This 11-year old, meanwhile, is helping to trim the sprouts by the sink with Dad, who mutters aside that he’ll soon be pouring himself a gin and French once the bread sauce is put to simmer. I always thought that Dad’s drink was absolute filth: half a tumbler of gin, with the remaining volume topped up with Noilly Prat. No ice. No lemon. And then he will probably sneak in a quick top-up while Mum, my brother, Auntie Jean and I are in the sitting room watching the Queen. All that having been said, our Christmas Day feast was always, but always, quite brilliant. Like Auntie Jean, amontillado was Mum’s preferred sherry. As for finding a splendidly mature, dry oloroso, the very idea would have been nothing less than ridiculous. Five decades on, it remains the very nicest accompaniment to these cheese pastries. Serve the oloroso lightly chilled, please. Makes 24 all butter puff pastry 1 x 320g sheet egg 1, beaten For the cheese filling Roquefort cheese 100g Boursin cheese 80g egg yolk 1 plain flour 1 scant tbsp butter 25g cayenne ¼ tsp With the long edge of the pastry facing you, cut the sheet of pastry into 4 equal quarters. Then cut each quarter in half, lengthways, to achieve 8 small rectangles Line a small, shallow tray with greaseproof paper cut to fit (you will need two sheets), then lay upon it 4 pieces of pastry. Cover with the second sheet, then place the remaining four pieces of pastry upon this. Place in the fridge (or more quickly, in the freezer) until firm; this is a good idea if you do not wish the pastry to become unmanageable and too soft (especially if the kitchen is warm) while folding and filling with the cheese mixture. To make the cheese filling, simply mix the ingredients together until smooth; I use a small food processor, but a whisk should do it. Scrape out into a small container and put to firm up in the fridge for about 30 minutes. Pre-heat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. To assemble, dust a surface with flour, take two pieces of pastry at a time from the fridge (or freezer) and, again, long edge facing, roll each one out a little more – by about 2cm. Working quickly, lightly brush each piece with beaten egg, then put 3 teaspoons (don’t over-fill) of the cheese mixture equally placed along it, allowing a small gap between each spoonful. Deftly fold over the front edge of the pastry to the back, and seal. Using the little finger, gently press down between each mound, including the ends, then cut into 3 equal pieces; I find the most efficient way is to use a crinkled pasta wheel, as one would form ravioli. Line a baking sheet with parchment, lay the 6 pieces out in a line, brush with beaten egg and pierce each piece with a fork. Repeat the process with the remaining 6 pastry pieces. Bake in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until golden and well-puffed; if two or three exude a little filling, don’t despair, as these crunchy bits are just delicious. Smoked salmon and cucumber mousse Some may say that this savoury fish mousse does not quite taste enough of fish – and they may be right. But here, the salmon flavour is subtle, quietly carried by cucumber and, chums to both, feathery dill. So many dishes today are mouth-slappingly pushy, whereas this rather dainty and well-behaved fluff – it is very lightly textured – is English cookery to a tee; or as it once used to be … One needs such a thing over what is often a period of relentless riches. Eat it with crisp toast, well buttered, and with fine linen napkins to hand. Serves 4-6 cucumber ½, peeled and grated salt 1 scant tsp smoked salmon 150g soured cream 100g cream cheese 100g cayenne pepper ¼ tsp dill several small sprigs, fronds removed gelatine 2 leaves, soaked in cold water until softened double cream 100ml egg whites 2 lemon juice 1 tsp First, mix the cucumber with the salt, place in a colander and leave to drain for at least 30 minutes, suspended over a bowl (you will need the drippings). Meanwhile, put aside 30g of the smoked salmon, finely chop it, put into a small bowl and set aside. Place the remainder of the salmon, roughly chopped, in a small food processor and puree together with the soured cream and cream cheese until smooth. Add the cayenne and dill, then pulse-process until the dill is finely chopped into the mix. Decant into a medium bowl. Squeeze the excess moisture from the cucumber with your hands, then mix it together well with the chopped salmon. Now, take 2 tablespoons of the salty cucumber water and place in a small saucepan (discard the remaining water). Add to it the soaked gelatine leaves and gently warm through until melted. Leave to cool for a couple of minutes then thoroughly whisk into the creamed salmon. Place the bowl in the fridge until the mixture is beginning to firm up – about 30-40 minutes. To assemble everything, loosely whip the cream until it is only just holding peaks, then whisk the egg whites with the lemon juice until showing soft peaks. Loosen the creamed salmon mixture by whisking it, while also incorporating the chopped salmon and cucumber until evenly distributed. Finally, gently – but thoroughly – fold in the cream, then quickly and deftly followed by the egg whites. Once a pretty pink and green-speckled homogenous mixture has been achieved, decant into a Tupperware container, fix on the lid and put to chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours. To serve, dip a tablespoon into a jug of hot water and scoop out a couple of nice spoonfuls onto chilled, pretty plates. Serve just as is, with hot, buttered toast and, if you like, a few sprightly sprigs of watercress, or mustard and cress. Grilled oysters with pastis and fennel crumbs This a new dish and, I feel, particularly special for Christmas feasting. There is no question that aniseed flavours are good when paired with hot oysters; just think Rockefeller. Here, however, fennel is used to good effect as a fine puree in the base of the shell, the warmed (just stiffened) oyster placed upon it and then a savoury butter/crumb to finish. When baked together in the oven until bubbling and crusted, the emerging scent is just marvellous. Try to find medium to small oysters, as it is a good thing if you can eat the cooked oyster from the shell in one complete spoonful. If you can find some, a little fennel pollen mixed into the crumb is a very good idea. Note: I suggest that you cook the oysters in two batches, simply because having an oven that will accommodate 24 of them at one time may be impractical. Ergo: eat three each, cook more, repeat. Serves 4 rock oysters 24, shucked (scrub the shells clean in hot water and reserve) For the fennel puree fennel bulbs 2 small, about 400g, reserving any green fronds that are attached olive oil 1 tbsp unsalted butter a thick slice garlic 1 clove, crushed pastis 1 tbsp oyster juices lemon juice of ½ For the savoury butter unsalted butter 125g, softened garlic 1 small clove, crushed to a paste tarragon leaves from 2-3 sprigs, finely chopped fennel fronds finely chopped Tabasco 3-4 shakes pastis 1 scant tbsp For the fennel crumbs fresh white breadcrumbs 40g fennel pollen optional olive oil or olive-oil spray Pop the oysters and their juices (strained, to catch any stray bits of shell) into a small pan and warm through over a gentle heat until just stiffened. Lift out with a slotted spoon and put to one side. Reserve the juices. To make the fennel puree, roughly chop the fennel, put into a saucepan and add all the other ingredients. Place over a moderate heat and bring up to a simmer. Pop on the lid and quietly cook until the fennel is very tender indeed. Remove the lid and cook fairly rapidly over a higher heat so that any liquid is reduced to not much more than a smear. Tip into a small food processor and whizz until very smooth (I use a Nutribullet for best results). Put aside. Pre-heat an overhead grill to medium-hot. For the savoury butter, simply whisk all the ingredients together until smooth. Spoon out onto a small piece of foil, roll it into a thick-ish sausage (about 3cm thick) and put in the freezer to firm up. To assemble, place a heaped teaspoon of fennel puree into the bottom of each shell and then top with an oyster. Remove the butter from the freezer and remove the foil. Using a small sharp knife, cut off thin slices and place one atop each oyster. Line an oven tray with slightly crumpled foil and arrange 12 oysters upon it. Evenly sprinkle the breadcrumbs over each oyster and trickle a little olive oil over each one (truly, however, for best results, an olive-oil spray will deliver the most even crust to each oyster, once cooked). Grill for 6-7 minutes, or until the oysters are golden crusted and bubbling around the edges. Leave for 5 minutes before eating, to avoid burnt tongues. Repeat with the remaining 12 oysters. Roast goose stuffed with mashed potato I have never roasted a turkey for Christmas, not once. I have nothing against it and, quite simply, someone else has always been there to do it. The parents did, of course, in childhood and it remains as so memorable a turkey – with two gorgeous stuffings and such a delicious flavour – that, truly, I can savour it now. Was it down to the Aga? Possibly. If I am moved to cook a festive bird, it will be a fine goose. It is now 25 years since Roast Chicken and Other Stories was first published, but also on 10 December of that year, 1994 – and almost to the day – my first cookery column was published in the Independent newspaper. The American journalist Emily Green was my editor and, furthermore, came up with my opening byline: “Mr Hopkinson cooks his goose.” The original recipe for this sumptuous bird was first alerted to me by the late, larger than life bon viveur of the highest (and, occasionally, lowest) order, Peter Langan. I think it was an Irish granny, or aunt, who had furnished him with the idea of mashed potato with which to stuff a goose. At Langan’s Brasserie, in the old days, it appeared on the menu for the entire month of December. I just hope that it still does. Here is how Mr Langan once cooked his goose, most honourably interpreted – and updated – by one of his greatest fans. Serves 6-8 goose 1, dressed weight about 4.5kg or so, with giblets salt plenty of freshly ground black pepper potatoes 1.4kg, peeled, chopped into large chunks and rinsed spring onions 2 bunches, trimmed and sliced sage leaves 1 tbsp, chopped (optional, but I like it) For the gravy streaky bacon 4 rashers, chopped goose fat a small lump from inside the goose’s cavity, chopped goose giblets all coarsely chopped up onion 1, chopped carrot 1, chopped celery 2 sticks, chopped calvados a small glass (or cognac) plain flour 1 tbsp madeira 150ml chicken stock 400ml redcurrant jelly ½ tbsp I think that the Chinese method of pouring boiling water over the surface of a duck or goose is the best way to achieve a crisp skin. The skin of the bird must first be punctured many times with the point of a thin skewer or sharp knife. These little holes then expand on contact with the boiling water, allowing the subcutaneous layer of fat beneath to flow out. The bird should then be allowed to dry. If you have an electric fan, hang up the bird, directing the flow of air directly onto it. Do this by an open window and leave for a few hours, or preferably overnight. The original instruction 25 years ago is the simpler method of placing it on a wire rack by the same open window, turning it over from time to time. The fan method, however, remains the best, so if you have one, use it. The end result of all this palaver should be moist flesh and parchment-like skin without the usual goo. Believe me, it is worth doing. Before giving the goose the treatment as described above, remove the large lumps of fat which are visible just within the cavity. Cut off a small lump, then freeze the rest wrapped in a plastic bag for another occasion when you wish to simply roast the best potatoes. Preheat the oven to 220C/gas mark 7. Rub salt all over the goose and sprinkle some inside the cavity as well, together with plenty of pepper. Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender, drain well and coarsely mash them; use an old fashioned hand-held manual masher for best results. Add the spring onions and sage (if using) then pack this mixture into the cavity of the goose. Lay it in a roomy roasting tin and place in the oven. Roast for 30 minutes and then turn the temperature down to 180C/gas mark 4. Cook for a further one and a half hours, or so. Be sure to occasionally remove the bird from the oven to tip out into a bowl the copious amount of fat that is generated. While the goose is cooking, make the gravy. Fry the bacon with the goose fat in a heavy bottomed saucepan, until both are crisp and browned. Incorporate the chopped giblets and cook until well coloured, followed by the vegetables, similarly treated. Drain off all but the merest modicum of fat, turn down the heat and add the calvados. Allow to bubble away until almost completely evaporated, then add the flour and let it brown a little, stirring constantly for a minute or two. Now pour in the madeira and stock, and add the redcurrant jelly. Bring up to a simmer (removing any scum that generates with a small ladle), stirring, and allow to quietly putter away for a good 40-45 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve into a clean pan, discarding the exhausted debris. Keep hot. To serve, scoop out the potato and pile onto a large, heated platter (some of the potato may have rudely exuded from the cavity while roasting, turning it exquisitely crisp), then carve the goose and lay neat slices upon it. Moisten the meat with a little gravy to give it a shine; decant the remainder into a sauce boat. For me, the only other accompaniment I would like here is a huge bowl of buttered sprouts and some apple sauce. But as for you, dear reader, I couldn’t possibly comment. Happy Christmas! Barley ‘pilaf’ with black trumpet mushrooms The garlic and parsley chopped together in this vegetarian dish is, almost, the key to its absolutely delicious taste. Its traditional French culinary term is persillade. Something unique happens when these two components are bullied together by a hefty chop until almost a vivid green paste; the chopping board will need a good soak in hot soapy water post this agitated activity. Serves 4 pearl barley 250g, soaked overnight, then washed and well drained dried black trumpet mushrooms 40g hot water 600ml, from a recently boiled kettle butter 50g onion 1 large, finely chopped dry vermouth 150mls salt and pepper flat-leaf parsley 50g, picked garlic 3 large cloves, crushed lemon grated zest of ½ lemon juice a squeeze (optional) Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Cover the trumpet mushrooms with the water and leave to soak for about 30 minutes. Drain them through a colander over a bowl, then further squeeze out any extra liquid from them with your hands. Reserve the liquid. Melt the butter in a solid-based cooking pot (which comes with a lid) and in it quietly fry the onions until golden. Chop up the mushrooms if they are large (if not, don’t bother) and add to the onions. Allow to stew together for a few minutes, add the vermouth, bring back to a simmer and tip in the barley. Season well and pour the reserved mushroom soaking liquid into the pan through a fine sieve; this ensures that any sandy particles from the mushrooms are caught. Once more, bring back to a simmer, pop on the lid and cook in the oven for about 30-40 minutes, or until the barley is tender and that it is clear all liquid has been fully absorbed. Chop the parsley and garlic together (see intro), then deftly stir into the barley together with the lemon zest. Spoon directly onto hot plates and, if you like, squeeze a small piece of lemon over each serving. Crisp endive leaves in a punchy mustard vinaigrette would make a fitting accompaniment here. Onions a la monegasque This charming and very tasty recipe is of a kind that will please everyone at the table, and is just the loveliest thing to have around over Christmas; perfect with cold ham and turkey or just on their own, of course. The finest rendering of the dish (its origins may be found among the pages of Elizabeth David) were those cooked by Stephen Markwick at my 50th birthday party. Serves 4 small pickling onions 500g, or shallots red wine vinegar 100ml water 175ml olive oil 100ml tomato puree 1 heaped tbsp bay leaves 2 thyme leaves picked from 2-3 sprigs parsley 1 small bunch and thyme 3 sprigs, tied together with string sugar 40g sultanas 50g salt and pepper extra parsley finely chopped Put the onions (or shallots) into a bowl, pour boiling water over them and leave to soak for 5 minutes. Drain and run them under the cold tap. Peel the onions and cut a shallow cross at each end (this helps to prevent them bursting). Place all the ingredients in a pan that ensures the onions are submerged, bring to the boil, cover the pan, and cook very, very gently for about 1-1½ hours until the onions are tender and bathed in a thick sauce. (This could also be done in a preheated 140C/gas mark 1.) Remove the bay leaves and parsley and thyme, then decant into a shallow dish and leave to cool. Just before serving, sprinkle with plenty of chopped parsley. Marsala custards with amaretti crumbs Yet another delicious new dish. Having recently unearthed a recipe for a custard using sauternes, I thought how good it would be to adapt this to accommodate a more robust alcohol. Sherry has been done, as it were, so it is to the similarly fortified marsala that seemed particularly apt, here. There is little doubt that it is festivity in a glass: deeply aromatic, delicately sweet and with a subtle, raisin-like flavour that whispers Christmas. A perfect way in which to complete this marathon celebration. Serves 4 egg yolks 6 caster sugar 50g vanilla paste 1 scant tsp sea salt a pinch whipping cream 300ml marsala 100ml amaretti liqueur 1 tbsp (optional) amaretti biscuits 8-10, evenly ground to crumbs icing sugar a little Whisk the egg yolks in a bowl together with the sugar, vanilla paste and salt until thick, pale and creamy. Warm the cream with the vanilla then leave to cool a little. Whisk the marsala and amaretti liqueur (if using) into the egg mixture, then incorporate the cream, further whisking together as you go, until well blended. Leave in the bowl until any surface bubbles have dissipated – about 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 150C/gas mark 2. Take 4 ramekins (about 100-120ml each) and divide the mixture equally between them. Place the ramekins in a deep roasting dish and pour tap-hot water around them so it comes up just shy of the surface of the custard mixture. Loosely cover the dish with a sheet of foil – do not clamp its edges to the tin – and carefully slide it into the oven. Bake for around 30-35 minutes, or until just set; give them a little shake and if they wobble nicely they are done. Remove from the oven, lift off the foil and then leave the custards in the water for about 10 more minutes before removing to cool completely. Cover each one with a tight piece of clingfilm and place in the fridge for at least 4 hours. To serve, carefully cover the surface of each custard with an even layer of the amaretti crumbs, then lightly dust with icing sugar, just to pretty them. If you like – and I do – take a blow torch and, with a low flame, very gingerly toast the sugared crumbs for half a minute, or until they smell toasty and the sugar is lightly burnished. Serve at once – and eat with teaspoons, please."

          "headline": "Festive sandwiches, bath bombs and other seasonal traditions",
          "bodyText": "In my hand I hold a bath bomb. It is pink and rough, unglazed, its colour and consistency reminiscent of eczema, its smell that of 15 girls entering a limo. If I drop it into the water, which is running hotly in the room next door, it will dissolve into a million sharp grains, infecting the bath with a misty pinkness, like a nostalgic effect on a VHS camera. This bomb, a Christmas gift from a forgotten family member, has travelled with me at the bottom of a washbag through three house moves, and today is the day I will finally allow it to fulfil its wet destiny. I bathe seasonally, when the weather turns. There are two ways to measure the beginning of winter – one is to look out of the window in the morning and gauge the frost levels on a neighbour’s windscreen, the other is to walk down the high street to monitor festive limited editions. Christmas sandwiches creep in like unwelcome uncles, their sweet innards revealing surprise cherries and macarons and ham. They present often as cold Boxing Day nightmares, breaded. The best are bold in their ambition, the brand’s most radical creatives having been locked in a boardroom since February brainstorming combinations of flavours that will not just say “Christmas”, but leave the taste of it lingering gassily in the customer’s subconscious for the next two months. Like cuckoos at the beginning of spring, winter comes when the high street unveils its sprout sandwiches. This is the 22nd year of Starbucks’ “red cups”, they appear on the pavement like lesions, a warning of a cruel winter rounding the corner. While the sandwiches reach for memories of Christmas dinners, cousins gathered, drunken leftovers, the red cups lean into seasonal consumption – the long tradition of spending cash in a hurry on useless baubles for bitter relatives, but replaced with a gift for oneself, if only a very big coffee. Once, in childhood, winter meant Christmas holidays, and family, and the proto-erotic thrill of a snowball fight – as adults, we attempt to reclaim that excitement by spending £3.99 on something cinnamon-scented. These products have elbowed their way into a small pen of winter traditions, the annual equivalent of flicking an elastic band on your wrist, a calming, a groundedness. The reassurance being, “Time passes, but everything stays the same.” And when winter has announced itself, I run my bath. I live in a house of regular bathers, for whom there is no ritual surrounding its execution or enjoyment. One housemate listens to podcasts while washing his armpits, a gravelly cynic asking old actors about their childhoods, another produces short performances of Frozen while fighting over shampoo. Me, I savour these rare exquisite evenings, when autumn has succumbed to mulch and the crisp winter air is not yet annoying. When we still step outside in the morning delighted at the prospect of snow, and when my only remaining guilty pleasure – a full house of central heating – is realised. I say things like, “We should make more soup,” and “I love you so I’ve bought you fleece slippers,” and so ease myself into these dark evenings with promises of comfort. Which includes the bath. All must be perfect. A clean dressing gown, a well-worn towel so as not to get fluff everywhere, nothing worse, a scalding temperature and locked door. I will permit a twist, such as lavender oil, or this vintage bath bomb, and I will ease myself in as if succumbing to anaesthetic, counting down from five. The bomb fizzes angrily by my thigh, quickly transitioning into a sort of perfumed cob roll, which I prod, disheartened. And it’s at this point, in my annual winter bath, that I remember why I don’t bathe more often. Four minutes of relaxation, of submersion in sweet heat and foaming glory, and the bath is cold. Five minutes and you realise there’s no efficient way of washing your hair. Six, and you’re lying naked in a tepid soup of gravelly soap wondering when your knees got old. The bath bomb refuses to detonate, bouncing morosely instead across the enamel, searching for someone that appreciates its smell, which now fills the room in a steam of lipgloss and plastic. The realisation falls on me like a loaded “Oh.” This is what winter is, not the cosy fireside chats nor crisp walks down snowy paths, but four months of discomfort, disappointment and sentiment failing to catch up with reality. It is chasing warmth down ever-darkening passages, it is frantic online purchases to placate children stuck inside due to rain. It is factory-made smells, designed to recreate weekends once glimpsed on TV, stuffed into candles as if ducks into turkeys. It is this bath, this dimly lit bath barely concealing my goose pimples and shame. So tomorrow I must erase these realisations from my mind, gorging on seasonal sandwiches and a coffee made of cream. Because the lie that winter is something to be welcomed, savoured and ritualised, is the most ingrained tradition we have. Email Eva at e.wiseman@observer.co.uk or follow her on Twitter@EvaWiseman"

          "headline": "The Disney empire strikes back at Netflix – but more rivals are set to enter the fray",
          "bodyText": "Disney’s eagerly anticipated entry into the streaming wars last week proved that the days of Netflix’s virtual global monopoly are well and truly over. Backed by a stellar library of content, from the Marvel and Pixar films to the $100m live-action Star Wars series The Mandalorian, Disney+ attracted 10 million customers on day one. A technical glitch that temporarily crashed the service failed to dissuade fans in its launch markets, the US and the Netherlands, although sign-up numbers were swollen by Disney+ being offered free to customers of Verizon mobile for a year. Investors have been jubilant – Disney’s share price rose more than 7% on news of the launch-day take-up. The sense is that Netflix and, to a lesser extent, Amazon are facing a third superpower. The Disney service, which at $6.99 a month in the US is about half the price of Netflix’s most popular package, is well on the way to its target of between 60 million and 90 million subscribers globally by 2024. Disney+ will arrive in Australia and New Zealand next week and in the UK on 31 March, as part of a western Europe launch. A roll-out in Asia Pacific will also begin next year, with Latin America in 2021. The cracks may finally start to show at Netflix, which has once again upped its annual budget, to $15bn, as the inexorable need for ever-more-expensive content to win subscribers takes its toll. Netflix has more than $30bn in debt and long-term liabilities relating to the making and licensing of programmes. Earlier this year, the need to increase its war chest saw Netflix push through the biggest price rises, up to 18%, in the company’s history. This, in the second quarter, led to its first-ever loss of subscribers in the US. Netflix is forecasting that in 2019 it will not have added as many new subscribers as it did last year, which is the first time it has failed to report year-on-year growth since its streaming service launched in 2007. With the global launch of Apple TV+ on 1 November, priced at just $4.99 a month or free for 12 months to the 200 million people who buy a new Apple iPhone each year, and more new rivals on the way, costs continue to soar. Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s content chief, recently admitted that the cost of winning a bid for the most “elite” of shows has risen by 30% in the past year because of competition from new entrants. Apple was willing to pay an eye-watering $240m for two series of The Morning Show, its flagship drama starring Reece Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston. Netflix has lost both Friends and the US version of The Office in $500m deals to HBO Max and Peacock, the streaming services from US giants WarnerMedia and NBC Universal respectively. These two are set to further crowd the global market when they launch next year. HBO Max also snapped up The Big Bang Theory, the most popular scripted show on US television, though Netflix struck back by securing Seinfeld. Netflix remains the market leader by some distance, with 158 million global subscribers (about 11 million of them in the UK), but the era of peak streaming and consumer “subscription fatigue” seems to be approaching rapidly. In 2007, the year Netflix switched from DVD-by-post rental to embark on its streaming future, the total amount TV companies spent on content globally was $90bn. Spending this year will reach almost $170bn, according to Ampere Analysis. There are estimated to be almost 800 new scripted TV series in production by the main international streaming services, such as Netflix, Disney, Amazon and Apple, most of which will land over the next 12 months. It would take an average viewer four to five years to watch just these new shows, never mind older fare and unscripted content such as reality and talent shows and documentaries. “I don’t know if I would call it a bubble but if the current growth in spending on content is sustained it will rapidly become unmanageable,” says Richard Broughton, analyst at Ampere. “I don’t think there will be enough room in the market for all the big streaming services to survive in their current forms.” One cheer for the EU investment bank’s move out of fossil fuels The long-awaited decision by the European Investment Bank (EIB) to end fossil-fuel financing – and Europe’s multibillion-euro hypocrisy – within the next two years was long overdue. For decades the world’s biggest public bank has been funnelling millions of euros every day into oil, coal and gas projects, while the EU governments that own it claimed to be taking a global lead in tackling the climate crisis. The landmark global climate agreement struck in Paris in 2016 did little to slow the flood of funding to fossil-fuel funds. A little over a year after the Paris agreement, the Luxembourg-based bank made Europe’s biggest-ever loan – for a controversial gas pipeline. It was a cool €1.5bn deal to support the Trans-Adriatic pipeline from the Caspian Sea to western Europe, which would lock countries into decades of dependence on natural gas. Previous loans helped Italian oil major Eni to set up offshore gas rigs, and Polish utility PGE to build new gas-fired power plants. The decision to end fossil fuel financing by 2021 makes the EIB the first major lender to take a step which is as bold as the political rhetoric on carbon emissions. It will help the EU to end its contribution to global heating, and establish the world’s first major “climate bank”, aligned with the green agenda. However, it may still be too soon to claim that Europe’s climate hypocrisy is over. The decision to clean up the €500bn EIB was not universally accepted across the bloc, and the debate has revealed fault lines in Europe’s commitment to the Paris climate goals. Germany and the European commission – the EU’s executive arm – were identified by campaigners as blocks in the negotiations over the EIB’s new lending policy, despite being vocal supporters of the Paris accord. In the battle against a climate crisis, the time for talk has long passed. At least now Europe is finally beginning to put its money where climate action requires it to be. Nationalising broadband will be a tricky call There is a growing appetite for the natural monopolies privatised by Margaret Thatcher and John Major to be taken into public ownership. And quite rightly so. Not because the targets for nationalisation are on the brink of insolvency as they so often were in the 1960s and 1970s. Or that they are starved of investment. They are not. On most financial measures they are ticking along just fine. The appetite stems from the behaviour of the owners of Britain’s water and energy companies and railways. One by one, these industries have been loaded with debt as a means of furnishing shareholders and creditors with lavish payouts. That debt is refinanced on a regular basis to take advantage of increasingly low interest rates – again, not to prevent sewage entering our rivers or allow new electricity connections to solar farms or lower prices on the railways, but to feather investors’ beds. Labour’s plans to bring the UK’s broadband network into the ambit of natural monopolies poses a more difficult problem. The network needs investment in fibre-optic cables and sophisticated software at local exchanges. By Labour’s calculation, this is a £20bn project. There is the potential for the broadband project to become a political football, with unions exercising their newfound muscle to extract higher pay and benefits. Likewise, city mayors promoting their areas could be given unwarranted priority. Most importantly, it is not an area the public sector has ever managed. Why would civil servants make good decisions about broadband networks? If Labour can show it has thought about these issues and others – such as how its new network would build on existing ones and why it should be free to households – there could be much merit in a nationalised broadband network."

          "bodyText": "Bola Adegbulu’s idea came to him by accident – literally. Narrowly avoiding a car crash inspired the Londoner’s idea for smart navigation software that could predict the safest route for drivers and prevent some of the 1.3 million deaths due to road accidents globally each year. With more than 90% of those fatalities taking place in developing nations, including Adegbulu’s native Nigeria, the concept hit home. The 30-year-old spent two years working on the pilot for his company, Predina, with co-founder Meha Nelson, before clinching funding from Impact X Capital Partners: a new black-owned-and-run venture capital firm in London aiming to reverse the lack of funding for startups led by, or serving, women and people of colour. The total amount of funding Predina clinched last month is still under wraps, but the duo – who recently launched an app for consumers, Waymaker – plan to spend the money on extra staff to help develop their product with the aim of selling it to big businesses, including car manufacturers, across the globe. Impact X, which quietly launched last year, is now on a fundraising drive of its own and is tapping wealthy individuals and institutional investors along the way. Its chief executive, Eric Collins, is hoping to attract £100m to invest in companies his team believes will not only deliver financial returns, but have a positive social impact on under-represented communities across Europe. That for-us-and-by-us approach has already attracted high profile investors from across the black community, including the comedian Lenny Henry, the actor Adrian Lester, and Uber board member Ursula Burns – the first black woman to run a Fortune 500 company when she served as the head of Xerox. It has now backed nine companies, ranging from iPhone subscription services to film production companies. Collins, 53, said venture capitalists had been investing in marginalised groups in his native US for decades, but that European talent had been relatively untouched. “Venture capital funds in Europe have not done so much investing in these categories. It allows us to have a fantastic green field of opportunity,” Collins explained. “Less than 1% of venture capital goes to people of colour, less than 4% of venture capital goes to women. And given the numbers that exist in Europe, it’s a great time to be investing in under-represented populations.” But reversing that trend is a big task in a business that, stereotypically, backs the same young white men that venture capital bosses rubbed shoulders with at university and has fuelled a “frat bro” culture often synonymous with Silicon Valley. “We want to put our resources into something which is actually going to benefit under-represented entrepreneurs,” said Collins. “In Silicon Valley, if you look at entrepreneurs and even workforces, there are just so few people of colour, there are so few women. Let’s not replicate that in Europe.” The problem was not that black entrepreneurs were rejected for funding after making a pitch, he said: it was that they struggled to even get in the door. When it is a matter of who you know, the chances of success for marginalised communities decline. Collins’s co-founder, Paula Groves, said: “Venture capitalists like to invest with the people they know, the people they went to college with, the people they rowed on the crew team with, people that they attended weddings with.” The 55-year-old American – originally from New Orleans but now commuting between Colorado and London – has been working in venture capital since the 1990s, when she founded Axxon Capital. The £54m fund, aimed at investing in minority- and female-owned startups, backed firms such as online security company Guardent, which sold for $140m, before Groves left in 2004. Groves said the Impact X team had been drawing on their own networks for up-and-coming talent. They include members of the black communities from their Ivy League university days, who are now spread around the globe, as well as local colleges and tech incubators across Europe and the UK: “We think we can identify gems from under-represented communities just in the way Silicon Valley has identified gems in their communities.” They have scouted out 400 firms in the past year, nine of which have made the cut – Predina among them. They include Pace, which uses AI to help hoteliers determine what price to set for rooms, and Raylo, an iPhone leasing service offering a new handset every two years for a monthly subscription of less than £50, before selling the devices abroad. Impact X plans to vet a similar number of firms each year as new talent crops up in sectors spanning lifestyle, media and entertainment, tech, health and education. The small five-person team is based in London, but while they are constantly on the hunt for new investment opportunities, Collins encourages entrepreneurs who are not approached to get in touch by email. Collins, originally from Alabama, had his first brush with venture capital in the late 1990s. The son of a university professor and a music teacher, he graduated from Princeton University and spent some time in working as a strategy consultant specialising in deals and mergers before founding SpeedSolve, a consumer complaint tracking platform that he took to Groves for funding. That firm was gradually wound down just as the dotcom bubble burst in 2001, but Collins was not deterred. Over the next 20 years, he helped launch and sell a handful of firms – including predictive text firm SwiftKey, which was bought by Microsoft for a reported £250m in 2016 – before joining forces with Groves to start Impact X. Collins said the venture should have been launched decades ago, but the opportunities in Europe were now too vast to ignore. “We want to find the young woman in Bristol, we want to find the man in Edinburgh, who is an under-represented individual who has an idea which is going to change the world and benefit it greatly, and we think we actually can identify those through our backgrounds.”"

          "headline": "Waitrose champagne named best-value bubbly for Christmas",
          "bodyText": "An own-brand champagne from Waitrose has been named the best-value Christmas bubbly after experts said it tasted almost as good as the established brands Piper-Heidsieck and Veuve Clicquot. The supermarket’s fizz, which sells for £20 a bottle, scooped one of the Which? three “Best Buys” this year, after a panel tasted 17 branded and supermarket own-label non-vintage (NV) brut champagnes costing £35 or less to find the best bubbly for the party season. Experts awarded the highest score of 81% and a prestigious Best Buy to Piper Heidsieck Brut NV, declaring it their “most loved” champagne. The “decadent” bubbly, which costs £33, was said to have an “aged, savoury edge and a smorgasbord of citrus fruits”. Also scoring 81% was Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label NV, the most expensive of the champagne Best Buys in the test at £35 a bottle. It was described as “fresh, fruity and slightly malty”, and experts said it would have festive drinkers “going back for more”. This year’s most affordable Best Buy champagne was Waitrose Brut NV, marginally in third place overall with a score of 80%. Judges noted its aroma of “buttery baked goods”. The Guardian wine writer Fiona Beckett said: “I’m not surprised to find an own-label champagne doing so well; they’re generally great quality and no one should feel self-conscious about buying them. They don’t have the same promotional overheads and are bought in huge volume which keeps down the price. These days champagne is often as cheap or cheaper than English sparkling wine.” The cheapest champagne tasted this year was from Lidl. Its Comte de Senneval Brut NV scored 77%, and was singled out for its “beautiful touch of apple strudel”. However, some tasters admitted they found it lacking in flavour. Lidl said its shoppers “never have to compromise” on anything in their baskets, from everyday basics to champagne. Waitrose said it was “thrilled” to be “rubbing shoulders” with famous bubbly brands. The panel also tasted 12 sparkling whites from Italy, Spain, France and England, all priced at £12 or less. The highest scoring overall was Tesco Finest Prosecco Brut, at £8 a bottle, attracting a Best Buy award and a score of 76%. It was declared a “clean, classic prosecco” with “fruity and floral notes”. Italian prosecco remains the best-selling sparkling wine in the UK. British shoppers bought 117m bottles in 2018, compared with fewer than 24m bottles of champagne, according to recent figures from the Wine and Spirit Trade Association. For those keen to serve an English bubbly this year, Aldi’s Angel and Four Masterstroke (£10) scored 70%. Made in Gloucestershire, the English fizz delivers a “distinct aroma of elderflower”, and most of the panel enjoyed its zesty sweetness, though one was deterred by a “sulphuric nose and sour flavours”."

          "headline": "Santa Clarita high school shooting: suspect dies as motive remains unclear",
          "bodyText": "Investigators in southern California are working to figure out why a suspect opened fire outside his high school on his 16th birthday, killing two fellow students and wounding more before turning the gun on himself. The latest deadly school shooting to hit the US started early on Thursday morning at Saugus high school in Santa Clarita, 30 miles north of Los Angeles. The student pulled out a .45-caliber handgun around 7.30am in a large central outdoor area at the school, shooting five classmates and then himself, authorities said. A 16-year-old girl and a 14-year-old boy succumbed to their injuries. They were identified as Gracie Anne Muehlberger and Dominic Blackwell. The suspect was admitted to the Henry Mayo Newhall hospital in critical condition, and died on Friday afternoon. After more than 40 interviews and evaluation of evidence, no motive had been established, said Capt. Kent Wegener, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s homicide unit. He said no manifesto, diary or suicide note had been found. “It still remains a mystery why,” said Alex Villanueva, the LA county sheriff, at a news conference. The teen stood by himself, did not appear to interact with anyone and then walked to the center of the quad, Villanueva said. “As far as we know the actual targets were at random,” the sheriff said. Villanueva said the conclusion that the attack was planned was based on the shooter bringing the weapon, handling it with enough expertise and counting the rounds fired. “It wasn’t a spur-of-the-moment act,” he said. The origin of the gun was being investigated. Doctors said Friday morning that two girls, ages 14 and 15, who were both shot in the torso, were doing well and should be released from the hospital over the weekend. A 14-year-old boy was treated and released from another hospital, authorities said. The names of the injured students were not released. Shauna Orandi, 16, told the Guardian on Thursday she was in her Spanish class when she heard four gunshots that she initially mistook for musical instruments. A student who burst into the room said he had seen the gunman and classmates were stunned into silence, she said. “My worst nightmare actually came true,” she said. “This is it. I’m gonna die,” she recalled thinking. Rosie Rodriguez, a freshman, was walking up the library stairs when she heard noises that she said “sounded like balloons” popping. She realized they were gunshots when she saw other students running. She ran across the street to a home, where a person she didn’t know gave shelter to her and about 10 other students. “I just heard a lot of kids crying. We were scared,” Rodriguez said. People who knew the suspect described him as a quiet, smart kid who they would never have expected would violently snap. A nextdoor neighbor said he kept to himself but was never threatening. “You wouldn’t expect anything like that from him,” said Ryan McCracken. Police continue to search for clues. On Thursday evening, authorities revealed that the bio on an Instagram account believed to have belonged to the suspect, and reviewed after the shooting, read: “Saugus, have fun at school tomorrow.” The bio has since been changed, but it was unclear when or by whom. ‘When will we come together?’ In a Thursday afternoon press conference that felt painfully familiar, local leaders mourned another senseless tragedy amid a continuing scourge of school shootings. They pledged that Santa Clarita would band together to recover. “This is a very tragic day for our community,” the local assembly member Christy Smith told reporters, thanking law enforcement, who responded to the incident within minutes. “We are very close-knit. We will come together and survive but we can’t afford another day like this.” “Across the nation I frequently hear ‘no more, no more’,” added Robert Lewis, the captain of the Santa Clarita Valley sheriff’s station. “When are we as Santa Clarita and other communities going to come together?” At a family reunification center at a park next to the school, some students sat at picnic benches inside a community garden and talked to law enforcement as loud helicopters hovered above. Parents held their children as they walked to their cars. April Dooley, a former choir teacher at Saugus high, said the school had extensively prepared for this kind of tragedy, but she still never imagined it would happen in her own community. “I’m in total shock. It’s unbelievable. Saugus high is such a quiet and sweet community – extremely benevolent,” said Dooley, 60, who retired in December. She heard that one wounded victim ended up in the choir room where she used to teach, and said she felt a lot of pain for the teacher who replaced her, who was in her first year on the job: “She’s still figuring out how to be a teacher, and now she’s figuring out how to deal with an active shooter. How can one do that? It seems impossible for anyone … I’m so proud of her.” Dooley said that, as a teacher, she often thought about what she would do if a shooter threatened her class: “We are their defense. Our job is to keep them safe … We are in a choir room, there are things to defend ourselves, a piano we can hide behind. We were all very prepared.” Dooley said she drove over as soon as she heard the news to offer any support she could: “I’m sad I wasn’t there to take care of my babies.” She added that she wanted to see the government take action on background checks. Scott Wilk, a state senator who lives a mile away from the school, said he was still processing the news. His children previously attended Saugus high, and he learned this morning that a friend’s daughter had been shot but was expected to survive. “It is just indescribable. This has got to stop,” he said, noting that it felt as if the Thousand Oaks mass shooting, which killed 12 in the region last year, had been quickly forgotten: “It seemed like that was a one-day story, and it was gone. We have become so desensitized to this, like it’s the new normal. It can’t be the new normal.” Wilk said he wanted to see stronger investments in mental health resources for youth: “Our most precious resources are our children.” He noted that when he recently visited a fourth-grade class, one of the students talked to him about wanting better security. Condolences poured in from across the country, with many Democratic lawmakers pointing to the tragedy to once again argue US lawmakers should pass stricter gun control legislation. The California senator and presidential candidate Kamala Harris said she was heartbroken and was praying for Santa Clarita. “Our children and communities are being terrorized. We can’t accept this,” she said. “Another sad example of a school shooting &amp; why students across the country live in fear of gun violence,” wrote the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, also a presidential hopeful. “I’m heartsick for the victims of this horrifying shooting and their families,” said the Massachusetts senator and presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren. Back at the reunification center, Kris Hough, a field representative in Wilk’s office who had showed up to help, said she wanted more than “thoughts and prayers”. “I don’t want to say ‘thoughts and prayers’ or any of that, because that’s not what we need,” she said. “We need this to stop. How many more of these do we have to see before it stops?” Hough noted that it was such a small community that many law enforcement officials tasked with responding to the tragedy had loved ones at the school: “We all think every time one of these things happen that it’s not going to happen in my safe little bubble here. It’s scary to know it can happen to you just as easy as anyone else.” She added, “We have all sat in front of our TVs watching in horror as these things happen. Now it’s our turn.” Agencies contributed reporting"

          "headline": "Big plastic polluters accused of cynically backing US recycling day",
          "bodyText": "America’s government-backed national recycling awareness day is being used as cover by large corporations that are churning out enormous volumes of plastic that end up strewn across landscapes, rivers and in the ocean, critics have said. The America Recycles Day event on Friday is being vigorously promoted by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a way to encourage Americans to recycle more. But critics point out that the initiative is the brainchild of Keep America Beautiful, a not-for-profit founded and backed by large companies that produce vast quantities of plastic products that end up as pollution. Current backers include Coca-Cola, Nestlé, Pepsico, and Altria, the tobacco giant formerly known as Phillip Morris. Decades of campaigns by the group have emphasized individual responsibility for plastic recycling, which data reveals to be a largely broken system. “Just like the fossil fuel industry, corporate polluters have been using recycling to justify ever-increasing production of single-use packaging, while taxpayers and cities are left to foot the bill,” said Denise Patel, the US and Canada program director of Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives. “Lower-income communities and communities of color, who are the hardest hit and the least responsible, bear the brunt of a model that has brought us to the brink of the waste and climate crisis.” A huge global expansion in plastic production is under way, threatening to sweep aside any effort to increase the current recycling rate of about 9% of all plastics. A 2017 analysis found that fossil fuel companies such as ExxonMobil and Shell have poured more than $180bn into new facilities that form the raw material for everyday plastics from packaging to bottles, trays and cartons. This boom is set to fuel a 40% rise in plastic production over the next decade, according to experts, exacerbating the plastic pollution crisis that scientists warn already risks “near permanent pollution of the Earth”. The Trump administration is simultaneously supporting that expansion and promoting a flawed recycling system. The EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, this week toured a recycling facility in Virginia and the agency is hosting an “innovation fair,” in addition to the summit on Friday. Wheeler said the agency is “working diligently to identify market-based strategies and innovative ideas to create a more sustainable recycling system in America”. An EPA spokesperson, asked to point to specific policies the agency is developing to bolster recycling, referred to a voluntary pledge that 45 corporations and government associations have signed. The signatories – which include the biggest plastic producers – have been divided into work groups that have each established a “vision statement, as well as challenges, opportunities and potential actions”. The Trump administration is simultaneously supporting plastics growth and promoting a flawed recycling system, without enacting changes to fix it. The problems that poses for consumers is on full display at one Washington DC organic grocery store that runs a program for customers to drop off hard-to-recycle waste. Shaymah Ansari is in charge of environmental restoration efforts at the Mom’s Organic Market just off a busy highway headed out of the city. She spends hours each week sorting the waste people bring in to make sure it isn’t contaminated before sending it to recycling facilities. She sees it all – the Amazon bubble envelopes, the bread bags, the used toothbrushes – all the things local residents can’t recycle at home. She also sees optimistic recycling, or “wishcycling” of things that typically can’t be repurposed into new products. One day she found a Kenmore coffee maker. “I think we’ve taken convenience and just turned it into a monster,” Ansari said. Ansari sees people trying harder to responsibly dispose of their waste, only to find they often can’t. Many of the plastics they drop off – including bags for frozen food, coffee and lunch meat – end up in the trash. Even when difficult-to-recycle plastics are repurposed, they are often downcycled into things like plastic benches and fuel and are rarely used to make the same products they came from. Even if people properly sort and prepare their waste, most plastic never has a chance at getting recycled anyway. About 91% of plastic does not ultimately get recycled. Billions of tons still remain on the planet – from the oceans to the snow in the Arctic and the Alps. Most of the plastic Americans try to recycle is sent overseas, where it is often landfilled or incinerated. And increasingly, plastics are burned in the US, polluting the air in mostly minority communities. Judith Enck, a former Environmental Protection Agency official who has launched the Beyond Plastics project at Bennington College, said that means plastics “fundamentally are not recyclable”. She says companies making plastic are pushing personal responsibility instead of supporting new laws and taking accountability for a worldwide plastic crisis. “Many of us go to the supermarket and try not to buy plastic,” Enck said. “It’s impossible, and it’s not our fault.” Even if the broader global recycling system was functioning well, the US has another problem: Americans are terrible at sorting and recycling their waste. The country’s municipal recycling rate is 35%, according to a recent analysis – far lower than most developed nations. Germany, the most efficient country, attempts to recycle 68% of its waste. Plastics producers in Germany are forced to take back the single-use bottles they make, collecting them in reverse vending machines at grocery stores. And communities are required to have extensive sorting systems. People in the US say they care deeply about the planet, with 74% agreeing “the country should do whatever it takes to protect the environment”, according to a Pew Research Center poll. But only 32% say it bothers them “a lot” when people throw away things that could be recycled. Jessica Nolan, the director of the conservation psychology lab at the University of Scranton, said the US lags behind other countries because it lacks government policies that signal recycling is important. “By putting laws in place that mandate recycling or incentivize recycling, what that tends to do psychologically is it increases peoples’ expectations that other people are going to participate,” Nolan said. “No one wants to be a sucker – nobody wants to be spending all this time and energy doing something if no one else is doing it.” San Francisco, for example, instituted strong recycling policies more than a decade ago and reached an 80% recycling rate, Nolan said. But some localities are scaling back their recycling programs, as China has begun to refuse recycling shipments from the US that are contaminated with food or the wrong kinds of plastics. In New Orleans, Louisiana, for example, the parish government will no longer accept plastic containers labeled 3 through 7, meaning they will go to a landfill. Many activists argue that plastics recycling is so broken that humanity should return to a zero-waste economy, starting with food and beverage packaging. Metal, glass and paper should still be reused and recycled, they say, but single-use plastic should be largely phased out. Even compostable plates and cups have raised alarms, both because some of them don’t actually biodegrade and because some include harmful chemicals. Miriam Gordon, who works with companies to limit their waste at Upstream Solutions, said activists are up against “convenience culture”. Just decades ago, many households didn’t need their trash collected because they didn’t produce trash beyond food scraps, she said. Berkeley, California, is piloting a program for reusable stainless steel cups at cafes, partnering with the company Vessel, which distributes, collects and cleans the cups “If we are going to go back to reusables and refillables, we have to have a culture-changing strategy,” Gordon said. This article was amended on 15 November 2019 to clarify that America Recycles Day has been an annual event for more than two years."

          "bodyText": "The transition from DJ to album artist is a tricky one. While one art is about reading the room, the other is a more isolated and intimate experience. For Bristolian Shanti Celeste, on her debut full-length Tangerine, it’s an opportunity to show subtlety and depths that she doesn’t often have space to explore on the dancefloor. Celeste channels the style of early house and techno pioneers, via the influence of her beloved Bristol scene (she started out working at local record shop Idle Hands, and ran a label called BRSTL). Her previous releases have been lithe, dancefloor-ready EPs, including a collaboration with fellow Bristolian techno producer Hodge, earlier this year. Tangerine is her first artistic statement proper, with instruments she has never used before including her own vocals and a kalimba recorded at her father’s house in Chile. It’s an enveloping listen. At times it sounds like something that wouldn’t be out of place in a yoga or meditation class – particularly on the dazzling Slow Wave, a beatless sigh of ambient, minimalist melodies. But this is an album informed by the club: the panicky percussion and bubble-light synths of Aqua Block, the elastic bassline of Sesame, and the chaotic house thump of Infinitas are all primed for a 2am workout. Yet Tangerine is equally an album you may want to stick on when you get home at the end of the night, full of nuance, space and soft textures to help you float away."

          "bodyText": "Nigel Farage must be furious with Nigel Farage. After all, the Brexit party leader is forever accusing conventional politicians of settling for grubby compromises when they should have been shooting for the moon. He’s always quick to condemn a sellout, to cry treachery and betrayal. So we can only imagine what this Nigel Farage, the man who never surrenders, makes of the Nigel Farage who secretly offered the Tories an electoral pact that would mean his party pulling out of all but a few dozen seats – the one who boasts of having told Boris Johnson that he could “win you the general election now”, only to be rebuffed. But that’s not all. Nigel Farage will not, he informed us, be voting at all in this election because the other Nigel Farage has withdrawn the candidate in his home constituency. Nigel Farage has disenfranchised Nigel Farage. Confused? Imagine how Brexit party voters feel. Their leader has done his best to bluster his way out of all this, accusing the Tories of not being truly committed to securing a pro-leave parliament. But the fact remains that he blinked first. The man who vowed to stand in every seat in the country has already pulled his candidates out of more than 300 Tory-held seats and was secretly prepared to dump over 200 more in return for a free run at fewer than 40 seats. All that stopped him was the Tories’ refusal to openly remove themselves from the ballot paper in his chosen seats, promising only to covertly down tools and make it easy for his candidates. But for that technicality, he would presumably have hopped happily into bed with them. No wonder there are reports of confused Brexit party supporters, unsure of what game their leader is playing. They still complain that Johnson’s offer isn’t real Brexit, but Tory candidates can now retort, “Well, Nigel Farage thinks it is.” After all, if the deal is good enough for the huge swathes of the country he is happy not to contest, why isn’t it good enough for the rest? On paper, it might look as if the impact of Farage retreating from certain seats can be confined to those places, but it’s not necessarily that simple. The surviving Brexit party candidates desperately need voters to keep believing that the Tories can’t be trusted, but now their own leader is cutting the ground from under their feet. (If anyone still wonders why Jo Swinson is being so stubborn about not withdrawing from seats where it seems mad to be fighting a Labour remainer, here’s one answer.) Meanwhile in Labour’s former heartlands, where there may be little love for Jeremy Corbyn but still a visceral dislike for the Tories, expect Labour candidates to redouble their argument that Farage is just a closet Tory at heart. They’ve always said that a vote for him was really a vote for Boris Johnson in disguise; now he’s publicly making that case on their behalf. What makes all this particularly resonant is that hard Brexiters tend to be so-called “low trust voters”, always vigilant for any whiff of betrayal. Their greatest fear is that “the establishment” will find a way of getting around the referendum result. They’re suspicious of conventional politicians, which is why they were drawn to an unconventional one in the first place. The reason Eurosceptic movements tend to regenerate into new forms every few years – from the Referendum party in the 1990s to Ukip under an increasingly eccentric array of leaders and the collective grievance that rapidly crystallised into the Brexit party – is that they’re inherently unstable. If their supporters were happy to swallow their principles for the greater good, or even to be constrained by electoral reality, they wouldn’t have turned their backs on the bigger parties in the first place. The whole attraction of being outside the mainstream is never having to compromise. The political fringes, on both far left and far right, are full of spiky personalities who didn’t get where they are today by giving in to other people – which helps to explain why the higher reaches of Ukip so often resembled ferrets fighting in a sack. None of this has stopped Farage’s various vehicles punching wildly above their weight, but he has succeeded chiefly by influencing larger parties who are capable of winning rather than by winning himself. The minute this movement starts making the painful sacrifices required to take power in its own right, it becomes vulnerable to the charge of being just like all the rest. If anything, glorious defeat is its comfort zone. It would be deeply foolish to believe that any of this means the election is now sewn up for the Tories, or that unhappy Brexit party voters will slink home to mainstream parties with their tails between their legs. Many of them never supported the bigger parties in the first place, and those who were non-voters in the past may copy their leader and not vote this time. Others will want to stick with Farage to the end – or in constituencies where that’s not an option, to seek out the nearest protest vote and wait. Even if the Brexit party’s bubble bursts this time, history suggests that those behind it will regroup once they find a new grievance to feed off. But still, there’s something intensely awkward about Farage going out on the stump with candidates who must now be wondering just how close they got to being unceremoniously ditched. The slogan for his campaign, believe it or not, is “Change Politics For Good”. It will hurt if his supporters conclude that all he ultimately offers is more of the same. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

Leave your contact details if you can as one of our journalists may be in touch to discuss further. Political adverts on social media If you have seen any political content on social media that does not clearly state who has paid for it we want you to let us know. Political adverts on Facebook should state clearly who has paid for them in their posts. However, commercial adverts do not say who who is paying for them, but show only that they are sponsored. Which platform did you see it on? Which political party was it for? If it did not have a disclosure on it what was the reason the platform gave for showing you the advert? Though adverts will be banned from Twitter on 22 November, we would be interested to know if you see any posted after this date. Send your screenshots to us on WhatsApp by clicking here or via our form here. Have you experienced issues with polling stations? Is your primary school having to forgo its nativity play? Has the church had to reschedule its festivities? Or are there other issues you are experiencing? Tell us here what is happening where you are. Where do you get your election news from? We would like to know where key conversations are happening, both within and away from traditional media. Where on the internet do you find your main sources of news? Do you listen to podcasts? Do you use social media such as Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat? If so, are you part of any private groups in which important discussions are happening and what sort of things are being shared? Do such conversations have an impact on your overall attitudes? Do you notice changing habits in your parents or among your children in the last few years? Tell us more about your experiences in our form here. General election leaflets As the main parties ramp up their election campaigns, letterboxes across the country will begin to clog with leaflets vying to attract voters’ attention. We want to hear the most outlandish claims your local candidates from the main political parties or independents have made to try to win your vote. If you’ve received an eyebrow-raising leaflet, letter or other printed material from a political party or candidate let us know here. Have we missed any election news in your area? With a month to go before the general election, the main political parties continue to attack their opponents but we are still yet to see manifestos. During the run-up to December 12, we want to hear what’s happening where you are. Has your area been targeted by a political party, have you been visited on the campaign trail, has anything happened that hasn’t surfaced on the news agenda that you think is important? Send us your news tips by filling in our form here. If you’re a young voter we’d like to hear from you After years of political turmoil in which Brexit has dominated the agenda, some voters will get the first chance to have their say on the future of the country on 12 December. We are interested in hearing from people aged 18-24 about their feelings towards this election.Have you registered to vote? Have you decided who to vote for? Will you be voting tactically? Are you campaigning, and if so, how? Or maybe you’ve decided not to vote at all. Share your thoughts with us here. What will decide your vote? With so much information (and misinformation) about the general election populating our apps, newspapers, television channels and doorsteps during the campaign, we want to know what you think generally about it all. We are also looking for contributors for a video project where we’ll invite people to get out of their political bubble and spend time with others who have a different point of view. You can be based anywhere around the UK and must be comfortable talking about what’s shaped you politically and spending time with people of a different political persuasion. Tell us what you think here. People and power: tell us about the issues affecting you As part of a series of pieces from across the country focused on finding out what matters to the people who live there, we want to hear about the big issues facing you. Belfast East Traditionally a unionist seat, Belfast East is facing deep political uncertainty. It’s held by the DUP which supports Brexit but is not happy with Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal in case it weakens Northern Ireland’s position in the UK. Several pro-remain parties such as Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Greens have stepped aside in the constituency to give Naomi Long, leader of the centrist Alliance party, a chance at winning the seat. So this election will also be a test of whether the Alliance can rally enough voters who have previously voted along unionist or nationalist lines. Let us know what issues will decide your vote here. Canterbury Are you a young voter in Canterbury? The Guardian is reporting on the battle in one of the most interesting constituencies in the country, which showed the unexpected strength of Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party in the 2017 election. Two years later, we’re keen to hear from voters in the city about their views on the election. We’re particularly interested in hearing from young people and students who were crucial in helping Labour win the historically Tory seat in 2017. Are the young people in Canterbury who swung the election last time still motivated or are they split? With the decline of Facebook, how are volunteers and organisers from the main parties getting their message across online? Let us know what you think here. Chingford and Woodford Green The constituency has been represented by Iain Duncan Smith for 27 years, but his majority has fallen sharply and Labour candidate Faiza Shaheen hopes to oust him by focusing on the cuts he helped implement as a Tory minister. Will the contest be driven by the legacy of austerity? Or will Brexit, which divided this area almost 50:50, dominate this election too? We’d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. If you live in the constituency tell us about your views here. Cities of London and Westminster In the constituency of Cities of London and Westminster, which ranges from wealthy neighbourhoods such as Mayfair and Belgravia to more socially mixed areas such as Soho, Paddington and Pimlico, issues range from homelessness, air quality and local development to the role of the Square Mile. If you live in the area, share your thoughts with us here. Darlington If you live in Darlington, how happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Who has an impact on your community that we should meet? Are there issues in your family that create division? Are you thinking of switching your vote? Or perhaps you feel disengaged from national politics altogether. Get in touch with us here. Morecambe and Lunesdale The seat is considered a bellweather and has been Conservative throughout its history, except for during the Tony Blair years, with the Tory incumbent winning by a 1,399 majority in 2017. There is great wealth but also significant poverty. Helen is particularly interested in hearing from people who live or work in Heysham, a large coastal village which has huge strategic importance for the north-west. It is home to two nuclear power stations and a port, a major distribution hub between the UK and Ireland, which will be affected significantly by Brexit. Yet an estimated 58.2% of the constituency voted to leave the EU. Share your thoughts with us here. Peterborough The Guardian will be reporting from Peterborough, where people have seen public spending fall by £262 a year per person since the start of austerity in 2010 – typical of the UK as a whole. If you live in Peterborough, let us know about the issues affecting you here. Southampton Itchen In Southampton Itchen, Conservative MP Royston Smith is defending one of the smallest majorities in the UK, just 31 votes ahead of Labour. It is one of the constituencies where the student vote could make a big difference. If you are a student in Southampton, we’d like to understand the big issues which concern you and which policies matter to you. How do you feel about tuition fees, student debt and the high cost of living in student accommodation? Are you concerned about mental health provision, jobs, getting on the housing ladder and the climate crisis? Get in touch with us here. Stevenage The Guardian’s Gary Younge will be covering the election from Stevenage for two main reasons. First, he grew up there and second, it is a classical bellwether constituency. For almost half a century Stevenage has always voted for whichever party became the government. If you live in Stevenage, can you tell us what will decide your vote? We’d like to understand the big issues facing you and your family and which policies matter to you. How happy are you with the state of housing, work, community relations, policing and health services? Tell us what you think here. Stirling The Scottish Tory MP Stephen Kerr is defending one of the smallest majorities in the UK, of only 148 votes, against the high-profile SNP candidate Alyn Smith.

          "bodyText": "I look out the window to yet another day of smoke haze, dry wind and raised dust across the floodplain I call home. My mood oscillates between profound sadness and rage at the perpetual political obfuscation around the climate science that explains our obviously changing weather. My wife and I crop about 6,000 acres of grain and run a small cattle operation south-west of Goondiwindi. I have just finished harvesting a modest, but profitable winter crop and I am able to agist some of my stubble to a mate desperate for cattle feed. Against the odds, we have managed to harvest grain, hay and straw and feed our small Droughtmaster stud herd for the year on about a quarter of our average annual rainfall. I am acutely aware that luck played as big a role in our fortune this year as our management. There are many better farmers than me who will not achieve the results we managed and some of them will not survive the year, financially or otherwise. I do not believe anyone owes me, or any individual farmer, a living. However, a prosperous agricultural sector is essential to underpin stable society. It is then a social imperative to ensure the agricultural sector is viable. The current drought discussion in Australia is important because it highlights the fundamental lack of economic and emotional resilience in the sector. This exposes the sector profoundly to disruptions in production by weather and disruptions in markets. This is a fundamental structural problem that will continue to weigh down the sector, stifling innovation and investment. If you listen to the rhetoric emanating from the Canberra bubble, it is apparent that the relevant ministers would prefer to glibly talk up the industry potential and hope it will magically fix itself when it finally rains. They consistently ignore the reasons why structural reform is essential and worse still undermine and discredit the evidence that demands it. This delusion is enthusiastically enabled by the National Farmers’ Federation desperately selling their “$100bn by 2030” plan, which is little more than a pipe dream without the aforementioned structural reform. I get it really, change is hard and denial is easy. The reality at the coalface of Australian agriculture is that the NFF plan and the political posturing is out of touch with reality and a dangerous distraction. The NFF and government’s drought strategy is akin to shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic. Australian agriculture is now defined by indicators of rising farm debt, flatlining productivity, declining terms of trade and dwindling farmer numbers, suggesting it is not as rosy as the politicians and their sycophantic mates suggest, particularly if it is debt-funded. Overlay this scenario with what we know about the likely impacts of climate change, which is clearly exacerbating the impacts of the current drought, and the picture looks bleak indeed. While our politicians and industry leaders ignore the elephant in the room, it is encouraging and simultaneously worrying that our financiers are taking the issue seriously. The image below is taken from the 2019 Commonwealth Bank annual report. When leftwing nut jobs like the major banks start factoring in the impacts of failing to apply climate mitigation, then it is getting pretty serious. The message is clear for all who care to take note, if we do not start to develop and implement climate adaptation solutions that are backed by research and development, the agricultural sector in Australia will be unbankable. There are strategies and scenarios where Australian agriculture can prosper and provide leadership, opportunity and hope in the face of a changing climate. The travesty is that the institutions that should be pushing hardest for the necessary structural reform are too busy playing in the shallow end of the pool. On the current trajectory, the future for Australian agriculture will make the problems of this current drought look mild. Without courageous and honest leadership we will not achieve the outcomes that are needed. The NFF is promulgating policies that are fundamentally flawed because they are grounded in ideology before evidence, particularly in relation to climate. The proof of this is borne out when the NFF sees climate protesters as a greater threat to agriculture than climate change. Australian agriculture needs something like a National Farmers’ Federation, but the one we have is failing farming communities profoundly. There are some great people working in agricultural advocacy in this country, but conservative institutions are constraining the opportunity for a better future. While we wait for meaningful structural reform, we are forced to erode social, natural and financial capital and further undermine resilience in rural landscapes in the face of unmanageable weather events. • Pete Mailler is a grain and cattle farmer from northern New South Wales.

          "bodyText": "When you ask publishing insiders to paint a picture of the impact of Brexit, they tend to produce something that looks like Munch’s The Scream. Andrew Franklin, the managing director of Profile, sums it up thus: “The only upside I can see is that broccoli is apparently going to be in shorter supply.” He cites the rising cost of paper and printing, concerns over intellectual property rights, difficulties with exports and the potentially devastating economic effect on the high street bookshops that are so crucial to the trade. But while publishing is far from the only industry that fears the economic impact of Brexit, it faces an additional, very particular challenge: its products are responsible for helping the British public make sense of the deeply divided country in which we find ourselves. How can an industry so fervently remainer in spirit engage with the arguments in favour of leave? How can it reach the people who voted for Brexit – and to what extent does it want to? It is a dilemma I became uncomfortably aware of as literary programmer for the Brighton festival in 2018, as I considered how to reach out beyond the cosy pro-remain bubble. I remember watching Ali Smith deliver a talk on her highly regarded “Brexit novel” Autumn. It was clear from the audience response that the vast majority – if not all – were remain voters. When I invited a pro-leave speaker to take part in a political debate, he had to contend with a room filled with people who regarded him as something close to the antichrist. With a divisive election looming and rising rates of hate crime, the question of how best to engage with opposing views is, says David Shelley of the publishing giant Hachette, hotly debated in acquisitions meetings. “It’s important to uphold free speech, but social justice is also a big part of our mission,” he says. He is proud that Hachette publishes authors from across the political spectrum, from Labour’s Jess Phillips to the controversial rightwing commentator Rod Liddle. “But we wouldn’t want to publish any book that played a part in oppressing minorities, or went against our inclusive ethos.” Other publishers, however, take a strong anti-leave line. Franklin, for example, told me in no uncertain terms that leavers are not the sector’s target market. “What would we be publishing? Fantasy histories of a Britain in which servants doff their caps?” This kind of attitude should be understood as a reaction against the UK’s largely rightwing press, much of which has so powerfully campaigned for leave. But nevertheless it is fuel for the fire of those pro-Brexit writers whose claim to represent the marginalised is often based on their feeling that they are looked down on by lefty metropolitan types who are the arbiters of culture. The Bookseller recently reported that some independent bookshops have been refusing to stock David Cameron’s memoir. Iain Dale, a conservative commentator and former director of Biteback, tells me that he often found bookshops would take the position that “anything to the right of Tony Blair wasn’t for them”. Biteback published the US lefty Bernie Sanders as well as the commentator Katie Hopkins (Dale says that Hopkins has subsequently lurched into bigotry, and he would not publish her now). He laments the lack of books explaining the arguments in favour of Brexit: “There is a real thirst for knowledge and understanding about what is happening to this country. And that is not being well served by British publishing at the moment. Both sides lose, because if you don’t understand the other argument, you are never going to be able to persuade people.” For Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh international book festival, the greatest challenge facing publishing is how to bridge this cultural divide. “People talk about the economic impact, but the cultural issues are much more important.” In a charged political climate, publishing needs to focus on enabling people to listen to one another, and to respect each other’s opinions – and that means inviting leavers to the party. “Some people on the remain side have not afforded dignity to those who voted leave.” He questions whether the industry’s drive towards greater diversity has been wide-ranging enough: “If we are to be truly inclusive, we need to include people whose views we don’t find palatable.” This point is echoed by the agent Toby Mundy, who has represented authors across the political spectrum from Oliver Letwin to Richard Reeves. He argues that the industry’s “definition of pluralism can often be narrow and metropolitan” – while publishers have largely recognised the need to increase racial diversity in the industry, attitudes towards political diversity are more complicated. “There are certain kinds of narratives that most of the industry is reluctant to publish and promote.” Mundy says he has noticed a difference between two visions of liberalism within publishing: “There’s an older generation of commissioning editors who are more inclined to take the view that any argument can be valuable, as long as it is interesting, well expressed and adheres to basic values of tolerance and decency. Many younger editors are more passionate about contemporary political struggles and take a narrower view about what they and their colleagues should publish.” Sharmaine Lovegrove, the publisher at Dialogue, has been a powerful voice calling for greater diversity in the books world. For her, the arguments in favour of leave are anathema, as they are “rooted in negative perceptions around immigration – although there is a lot of denial about that”. She also takes issue with the idea that the problem is that the industry is too metropolitan. “It doesn’t represent London – this city is 46.2% BME [black and minority ethnic], and I’m the only black person running a list in corporate publishing.” But she agrees that since Brexit the industry is asking itself more complicated questions about identity. “I’m really aware that many people vilify working-class white men, assuming that they are racist. As a black woman, I know how it feels to have people make assumptions about you before you have opened your mouth. So I’m certainly open to those narratives, too.” Meanwhile, as these debates rage around them, writers have been setting about the hard work of reimagining what it might mean to be British. Although many editors say that it’s too early to judge how Brexit is going to play out in fiction, you could argue that British authors have been engaging with deep issues around place and identity for many years. A strong canon of work has emerged that subtly illuminates our national identity crisis. As well as the more overtly political “Brexlit” novels of Ali Smith and Jonathan Coe, there are many other works that engage with Britain’s changing social landscape less directly. In Ghost Wall, Sarah Moss looks back into the ancient past to ask questions about oppression and masculinity. Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Buried Giant, a mythical tale of a Britain in which warring tribes have been afflicted by amnesia, was greeted with some bafflement on publication pre-referendum in 2015. But it has emerged as a prescient exploration of what the Economist has called “the violence that underpins national identity”. Nature writers including Robert Macfarlane, and novelists such as Melissa Harrison and Benjamin Myers, have helped to reinvigorate our emotional connection to the land and our environment. In the turbulent times ahead, their work will only become more relevant. • Alice O’Keeffe’s novel, On the Up, is published by Coronet on 14 November."

          "bodyText": "Veteran journalists working in the pre-digital era were often required to phone in their stories to copy-takers who, after a couple of paragraphs, would often ask: “Is there much more of this?” The public could be forgiven for thinking and saying much the same after just a week of electioneering. Broadcast news and current affairs programmes are full of it. Newspaper front pages are devoted to it. Social media is humming with it. And there are still 31 days to go. How could it be otherwise? What is so fascinating this time around, quite apart from the obvious fact that so much hangs on the election’s outcome, is the momentous and simultaneous change in both the political and the media landscapes. All the old certainties on both sides of the divide are over. Two-party parliamentary politics is long gone. National newsprint domination of the debate, if not entirely extinct, is on the endangered list. Although television still holds the central ground, viewing figures suggest it is gradually losing its audience appeal, especially among young voters. They prefer Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram. This double fragmentation, with multiparty politics trying to get messages across to the electorate through multiplatform media, is a particular challenge for mainstream journalists. Their response has been less than overwhelming. They appear to have learned nothing from detractors who complain about arrogance and partisan spin. Thousands of social media postings point to the supposed faults of the mainstream media, while people seem to revel in writing hostile below-the-line comments on newspaper websites. Do editors and reporters simply ignore them? Day after day, coverage in tabloids has been predictable and repetitive – self-serving, shrill and sometimes silly. A Sun headline on a story about a Labour frontbencher’s exaggeration of the number of cancelled NHS operations, apart from being inexplicable, brought back memories of postwar Soviet paranoia: “Reds in op ed howler”. The Daily Telegraph, the paper shaped like a broadsheet but with a tabloid agenda, has been risibly propagandist on behalf of its columnist Boris Johnson. Readers’ letters would suggest it retains their support despite its hysterical coverage. Then again, it is losing readers at a faster rate than its rivals. Papers and news broadcasters were soon engaged in that most favoured of election campaign games known as “gaffe-hunting”. Trust Jacob Rees-Mogg to be first out of the starting gate with a crassly insensitive remark about Grenfell. A wealthy Old Etonian, who dresses and talks as if he has time-travelled from the 18th century, is a gift both to journalists and to Labour. Several other instances of supposed blunders followed. By far the most interesting, for several reasons, was the “doctoring” of a video of a Piers Morgan interview with Labour’s Keir Starmer. Shared on social media, it suggested that Starmer was lost for words when asked about his party’s Brexit policy. Despite a claim by the Conservative party chairman, James Cleverly, that it was not a deliberate attempt to mislead people, it was roundly denounced by a senior colleague, the defence minister Johnny Mercer. Whether true or not, it indicated the Tories are putting great store by social media content. The incident also revealed concerns about the effectiveness of Facebook’s policing of false content. Its UK head of public policy, Rebecca Stimson, maintained that the network would have allowed the Starmer video to have been used as a paid-for advert on the specious grounds that it had stimulated a “ferocious political debate”. That view was not shared by the editor of the Yorkshire Post, James Mitchinson, who was outraged by the posting of the edited clip, contending that it was a “dangerous” stunt. He argued that politicians could not demand respect while deceiving the public. He added: “It’s damaging to your trust levels and demeaning to the electorate.” And where did Mitchinson make his comments? On Twitter, of course. It has become the go-to communications platform for journalists, including most national newspaper and broadcasting political editors. After lobby briefings and discreet conversations with their sources, they race to be first to tweet the news. It has become a new form of scoop journalism and is just as worthless. Great sport for journalists and those inside the Westminster bubble but, really, what’s the point in the wider world? It is surely time for editors to curb their journalists’ Twitter enthusiasm. They are simply seeking bragging rights: look what I know that you don’t. This showing off is embarrassing and surely counter-productive because it undermines their status. Nowhere is this more obvious than at the BBC. Its political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, is wearing out her fingers with incessant tweeting. All too often, the result of her tweets, along with those of her rivals, such as ITV’s Robert Peston and Sky News’s Beth Rigby, is to generate stories tangential to the central news agenda. In their haste to tweet they also fall into the trap of repeating briefings before they’ve had the chance to feed them through their own journalistic filter. They overlook that famous journalistic dictum when dealing with politicians (and their special advisers): “Why is this lying bastard lying to me?” Sometimes, they move into areas that call into question their commitment to impartiality. Last week, Rigby tweeted: “In a party where just one in five MPs are female, the roll call of talented women who’ve just quit the Tories is alarming.” She did preface her comment with the word “Views”, but she could face accusations of bias. She appears to have gone out on a limb that her competitors have wisely refused to follow. All, however, can be accused media narcissism. While impressing each other with their tweets, they do little to provide worthwhile information to the public. Finally, if you want to track a form of partisanship that becomes more and more evident by the day, count the number of times – on TV, on radio and in newspapers – the prime minister is referred to as Boris and his Labour rival as Jeremy. It’s a no-contest victory for Johnson. Single name recognition gives a political leader a huge advantage."

          "bodyText": "And that’s where we’ll leave Sportwatch for this Sunday. A sad way to end a heroic year for Ash Barty, and for the veteran Sam Stosur and the passionate team captain Alice Molik it’s a disappointing end to a fine Fed Cup campaign. France too good over the five rubbers. Kristina Mladenovic - the three-times doubles Grand Slam winner getting the decisive win, in the singles, against the reigning World No 1 singles player. Hard to get more deserving than that - as she backed up her brilliance against Barty to close out the doubles rubber with Caroline Garcia. Elsewhere there were wins in the WBBL for the Adelaide Strikers and the Melbourne Renegades, while in T20 internationals England beat New Zealand in another Super Over. A win in the A-League for Adelaide United, with Melbourne Victory and Wellington Phoenix sharing the points, while Cate Campbell also starred in the pool in Doha to net a huge payday. And that’s Sportswatch! A tough ceremony for a dejected Team Australia. Shy acknowledgements to the crowd from Sam Stosur and Ash Barty, the latter in streams of tears, hiding under a cap during the presentation. She said 2019 had been a year of ups and downs last week after winning the WTA finals, and finishing the year as World No 1. It was hard to think of too many downs - but you know the proud Aussie will see this as a huge low point. In contrast it’s tears of joy for Kristina Mladenovic and the French team. Garcia beaming alongside her - and they hold their trophies aloft. Congratulations, France. Don’t forget, Fed Cup is not just one weekend - this has been a tournament that’s been happening since February. It was Ash Barty, Daria Gavrilova and Priscilla Hon who stunned a Madison Keys-led USA in the quarter finals, before Barty and Stosur got home over five rubbers against Belarussian duo Victoria Azarenka and Aryna Sabalenka in Brisbane in April. Did Stosur suffer from not playing any tennis this final weekend? Could the Australian team have thrown her in against Mladenovic in the singles even just to study her game a little and blow out some cobwebs? As the only one of the four not in action, she did appear to be at a disadvantage in a fast start to the doubles final rubber. Still, hard to argue that on balance it wasn’t a deserved win for France. A third ever victory, and their first in 16 years. What a rollercoaster. This French duo fell in the final three years ago - but they’ve been unbelievable today when they needed to. Imagine the nerves for Caroline Garcia - she was taken apart yesterday by Ash Barty in the reverse singles, 6-0, 6-0. To pick herself up, believe in herself, and play some of the tennis she did today, is quite remarkable. Not much more you can say about Kristina Mladenovic. She was imperious today. She dismantled Alja Tomljanovic in the first rubber 6-1, 6-1, then beat the World No 1 singles player, Ash Barty, coming off that huge WTA finals win, and an incredible 2019, 2-6, 6-4, 7-6. And when France needed her most, she played near faultless doubles tennis. Composure at the net - the pace and heat on her forehand returns were something else. Worthy winners - they came with a game plan to tackle Barty’s strengths and out-thought and out-hit the Australian duo. It’s a cool first serve first up, but Mladenovic tightens a little and a wild second serve invites the pressure from the Australia duo. 15-30 and on a second serve, but she produces a huge second serve that Barty can’t fire back. Stosur misses the next return before Garcia produces one of the volleys of the match! That came at her with heat, and she swatted it with venom. Unbelievable point, unbelievable match. France are the 2019 Fed Cup champions! Take a bow Kristina Mladenovic and Caroline Garcia and the whole French team. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 3-5 Stosur to serve to stay in the match. Ooph - the pace on that return from Mladenovic. That was rocketing. Garcia then misses the forehand for 15-15. Another inch perfect return from Mladenovic and Garcia thumps a terrific volley, before Barty shows unbelievable hands at the net! Mladenovic draws Stosur into a baseline duel, and brings up a first Fed Cup point. Stosur saves it with a strong serve, before Barty again pounces with the volley. Garcia does brillianty on return, and we’re back at deuce. A second Fed Cup point as Mladenovic produces a sublime return, but her improvised volley floats long. Stosur pins her with the serve before Barty fires a sharp volley at the French star. A huge game - Australia make Mladenovic serve for it. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 2-5 Stosur with a key first win, but she blinks first in a net battle with Mladenovic and the Frenchwoman keeps her nerve to volley brilliantly. Garcia holds a settler, before Barty forces Mladenovic with a sharp return for 30-30. Huge return down the line from Stosur - she picked the wide one and thumps it down the line! 30-40 and a break point for Australia. But then she misses the volley! Brilliant defensive play from Garcia - she was up against it there. Mladenovic too good at the net once again, and Stosur yells with frustration. Barty clips the tape, and the French duo celebrate. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 2-4 Oh my. Don’t get me wrong - these two are excellent players - but at 15-0 up it’s a framed return that just drops over the head of Stosur! They’ve had some fortune today on massive points, but Barty and Stosur put their heads down and dig deep once again. A huge serve just clips the tee from Barty, and they eventually hold. It’s new balls which should help Caroline Garcia - but you get the feeling - if it’s to happen for Australia it has to come on this service game. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 1-4 She’s firing scud missiles, “Kiki” Mladenovic, but Barty pounces on a second serve for 15-15. Stosur wins a baseline duel for 15-30 before Barty misses the second serve, which jams her well. Mladenovic finishes the game strongly, and suddenly its approaching last-chance saloon for the Aussie duo. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 1-3 A strong first serve from Stosur, and Barty slams a volley at Garcia. Then it’s the former US Open winner with a fierce crosscourt forehand winner. Stosur then fires a super forehand - it’s called out, but it catches the line. Ach - they replay, but Mladenovic is good enough on second asking. Then a terrific point from both Stosur and Barty, and they hold, and are on the board in the second set. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 0-3 Big point from Stosur, as Australia put Garcia’s serve under pressure. The veteran then shows sharp hands and for once Mladenovic misses her volley to bring up two break points. Garcia then hits a sublime shot down the line - she had almost no room to work with, but she hit it! What a pressure play. And then fires an even better one cross court past Stosur! Oh my. The replay shows it’s a mishit - the luck of the French - on two of the biggest points on the match so far! Australia bring up another break point, but Mladenovic leaps onto the volley to save it. And after a huge rally, they eventually hold. Big game. Could that prove decisive? Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-6, 0-2 How good is Mladenovic at the net. She’s not ranked best in the world for nothing - she pounces like a big cat on that volley as the French duo race to four straight games. It’s a hold to love to start the second set from Mladenovic, before they pick off the Stosur serve once again. And suddenly, you wouldn’t think it’s a home fixture, as the cries of Allez, allez ring out around the Perth stadium. It finishes 1-0, McGree’s third goal in three games enough to secure the three points for the home side, as the Gertjan Verbeek revolution continues. Adelaide skip up to fifth on the ladder, while the Roar join Wellington and Newcastle in the “our win will come” band. Pressure on Barty on the serve. She powers a strong first effort, before Garcia pins Stosur at the net. Barty forces the winner and it just drags long to make 15-30 before Mladenovic clips the tape with a volley that drops over! Oh my, possibly the most crucial point of the game, and lady luck favours the French! They win the next point to a huge roar from the visiting fans. They’re going to have to do it the hard way, Australia. What a test of character for the veteran champ and the World No 1 singles star. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-5 Huge hands from Mladenovic at the net, as she monsters a volley that flies past Stosur and just clips the line. Garcia drags one long to bring up 40-15, but the French duo hold with a thumping ace to the pocket. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) tie Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 4-4 Australia open with a sharp double volley from Barty before Stosur fires a great first serve in at Garcia. Barty pulls of a reverse overhead with balletic poise before Stosur fires a fierce forehand down the line. Four big first serves, and that’s a much more confident service game - Stosur holds to love. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 3-4 A wild double fault undermines early good work from Mladenovic, and Australia pull back to 30-30. A huge first serve digs the World No 1 ranked doubles star out of danger, and she eventually holds again. A-League - Goal! Adelaide 1-0 Brisbane (McGree) It’s the home-town boys that combine, as James Troisi cuts to the byline before picking out the “brawler from Gawler” Riley McGree , and finally the Reds have broken the deadlock. Game on. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) tie Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 3-3 A better hold from Australia. Barty volleys well down the line before Mladenovic scrambles on the return of serve. They hold to love, and the crowd rise in appreciation. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) trail Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 2-3 A tighter service game once again, as Barty goes down the tram lines with a clever return of serve to lock up at 30-30. Garcia pins the body of Stosur before a sharp volley from Mladenovic clinches the game, and Garcia holds on serve. She’s a former World No 1 ranked doubles player, the veteran Stosur. She’ll need to call on all her experience and guile here. Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) tie Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 2-2 And that’s a much more composed service game from the French, as Mladenovic holds her serve to love. And they come after Stosur’s serve early on, passing Barty at the net with a fine winner down the tram tracks. Barty with a series of tight volleys but it’s a missed forehand from deep from Sam and they’ve broken back, the French! Fed Cup final (final rubber): Barty &amp; Stosur (Aus) lead Garcia &amp; Mladenovic 2-0 And we’re underway in Perth, and it’s a terrific start for the home duo - as Barty and Stosur fly out of the blocks and win an early break point on Garcia’s serve! Four straight points to secure the game, before Ash Barty holds her first service game. Better from the French, who trade points, but a fine overhead from Stosur helps the Aussie duo hold. Great start. NBL: Sydney Kings sink defending champions Perth A few results from the NBL to update on. Quite the showdown in Sydney by all accounts, here’s the Australian Associated Press’ report: A three-point barrage from import Didi Louzada has inspired NBL leaders Sydney to a 104-85 victory over defending champions Perth in their top-of-the-table clash. Louzada hit seven of his 11 long-range attempts on Sunday at Qudos Bank Arena, including three in a row in a stunning third-quarter burst. The No 35 pick in this year’s NBA draft finished the game with a career-high 28 points to help the Kings to maintain top spot on the ladder. Sydney’s evening was soured, however, when Louzada limped off the court with cramps midway through the final quarter. He finished with six rebounds, two assists and two steals. The 20-year-old swingman was outpointed by Wildcats star Bryce Cotton, who single-handedly kept his team in the contest with 36 points. But the former league MVP was left to fight the battle alone with big man Nick Kay the only other Perth player to reach double figures. For Sydney, star guard Casper Ware chimed in with 25 points, while Brad Newley and Jae’Sean Tate added 23 and 13 respectively. Earlier, Melbourne United also won well against the Adelaide 36ers 109-90, with Melo Trimble raining threes. 32 points from the American point guard, as United go four straight themselves. So - a huge fifth winner-takes-all rubber to come: it’s doubles and it’s the veteran Sam Stosur who will join Ash Barty to try and win a first Fed Cup for Australia since 1974. Standing in their way is Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic. Two one-time World top-ten players, so we know their pedigree. While Mladenovic has been in imperious form this week already. 6-1, 6-1 against Tomaljanovic in the reverse singles, before stunning Ash Barty 2-6, 6-4, 7-6 in a two-and-a-half hour thriller. Can the veteran and the World No 1 be the first to lift the trophy since Evonne Goolagong? Find out shortly. A-League - half-time: Adelaide United 0-0 Brisbane Roar An arm-wrestle in Adelaide, who did think they’d taken the lead, only for Michael Maria’s effort to be scratched off for offside. It’s a more defensively resolute Brisbane this season (after they leaked 71 goals in 27 games last year), but the front third isn’t quite clicking yet. Roy O’Donovan with little to get excited about - but this one may yet open up second half. It’s a crucial first point win for Tomljanovic before the Frenchwoman Parmentier shows all her experience to level at 15-15. A big winner and suddenly the crowd reaches fever pitch. The 26-year-old brings up two match points, but she only needs one. Parmentier drags her backhand wide, and what an epic win! Australia are right back in it, what a tense hold - and we’re set for a huge fifth rubber doubles showdown! What a match. Tomljanovic’s first ever Fed Cup rubber for Australia! Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 6-5 A tight one, but a huge down the line winner gets a fist punch from the Australian team captain on the sideline, Alicia Molik. Tomljanovic wins it 40-15, but the crowd gets going after that big winner. Can she carry this momentum to break ahead of a potential tie-break? Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 5-5 A great rally to open the game, Parmentier comes to the net to close it, but is almost caught with the ball over the top. She lands the smash and goes on a mini-run. A big hold to love. Is the veteran finishing this set with better momentum/morale? A close up of Ash Barty looking on - she doesn’t give much away, the World No 1, but there’s a look of tension across her face. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 5-4 One of the better service games from Parmentier. She may only be ranked 121 in the world, but its been an Indian summer for the French veteran who won two WTA titles in 2018, ten years after her first. She pushes Tomljanovic right to the wire on her own serve - bringing up back-to-back break points, before a huge ace gets the Aussie out of a hole. A big backhand winner to clinch it: just one game needed to clinch the rubber! And a heads up, we do have a second match of A-League action, where we’re away to Adelaide where its the Reds playing host to Robbie Fowler’s Brisbane Roar. A first home start for Adelaide boy, James Troisi - but there’s no goals early on. About 20 min played so far. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 4-3 Parmentier breaks back! Ooph. It’s all happening now. Up 30-0 it was looking okay, but Tomljanovic really tightened up from there - a wild forehand missing by some distance and she invited Parmentier right back into it. The Frenchwoman then landed a big smash to force deuce, before the Australian’s second serve finally failed her. A first double fault of the game to seal it- and now it’s match back on. Tense stuff. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 4-2 And Tomljanovic breaks! How crucial was that missed smash? The momentum has swung sharply this second set - just as Parmentier looked to have a foothold back in the match she lets herself down. Tomljanovic with some sharp winners, even a trip to the net to secure the break. A big service game here - if she wins this you might start to imagine she’s home and we could be set for a winner-takes-all crunch fifth rubber decider! Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 3-2 Ooph. Big point. Parmentier holds her first service game to love, and comes out after Tomljanovic as the French supporters inside the arena come to life. She grabs the first point, and then in an epic rally has Tomljanovic scrambling, before missing the overhead smash! A big let off, 0-30 would have made things interesting. A big ace down the tee lifts the home crowd, before the Zagreb-born Aussie holds. A nervy game - this is the most tense this match has got; yet. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 6-4, 2-1 A real inquisition on Parmentier’s first service game - as she was again pushed to deuce, but the Frenchwoman held strong eventually. Ominously for Australian supporters she then also made a much better fist of things on Tomljanovic’s serve, but the home favourite held comfortably enough in the end. A first hint of some nerves? Some poor shot selections - this could be an interesting little patch. It became a hard-earned point in the end, with the visitors perhaps the happier, despite giving up their early lead. Both coaches will be disappointed ultimately, given their struggles to accumulate points thus far, but it’s a first point for Ufuk Talay’s Phoenix, and just a fifth point for the Victory. VAR with a few decisive interventions, while Lawrence Thomas produced a stunning double save late on to deny Alex Rufer a first ever A-League goal. Ola Toivonen the X-factor at both ends for Victory - he conceded the early penalty, but more than made amends with a brilliant solo effort in a much-improved second half. What a game that was! Again it was the Parmentier serve under pressure, but she made Tomljanovic work for it with terrific athleticism. A special final point rally - one of the points of the game as the Australian looked to pounce on a second serve. She forced the Frenchwoman wide, but she was good enough to run it down, a drop shot looked to have invited Parmentier back into the point, but as she scrambled she forced her final passing shot wide. A big win - and the home crowd - a packed 26,000+ in attendance here in Perth - are right in this. Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 5-4 First real test of the Parmentier serve in the eighth game, as she is forced to 30-40 before recovering via second deuce. Two big aces at crucial times to dig herself out, but good signs for Tomljanovic. Remarkably, having won her last three service games to nil, she’s only getting around a third of first serves in. Thankfully she’s 100% on her second serve, and winning near 90% of those. Which bodes well if she can get the first going, no? A-League - Goal! Melbourne Victory 1-1 Wellington (Toivonen) - 67’ And who else! They’re short so much firepower with Robbie Kruse and Andrew Nabbout still sidelined, but when they need something, the Big Swede delivers. It was a fortuitous ball that arrived at the feed of Ola Toivonen courtesy a deflected clearance, but the sharpness of feet, the coolness of mind to jink past two defenders and beat Stefan Marinovic was sublime. 1-1, and we’re game on! Fed Cup final (4th rubber): Ajla Tomljanovic (Aus) leads Pauline Parmentier 3-2 We’re on serve so far, although it was a wobbly first service game from the Australian who was down 15-40 before fighting back to two deuces and holding. Two service games to love after that to the delight of the home fans. It’s nicely poised, this. Now - we’ve still got a stack of action going on round the grounds, but let’s try and get back to the Fed Cup Tennis final, third rubber which has just got underway in Perth. It’s Alja Tomljanovic with the weight of a nation on her shoulders, as she must win this match against Pauline Parmentier to send this to a fifth and final rubber. A reminder - Australia haven’t won the cup since 1974. Will the drought continue? And you can’t script this stuff. Would you believe, in a rain-soaked finish to a much anticipated World Cup final rematch, England have claimed the honours against New Zealand.. in a Super Over. It’s probably a cursed concept across the ditch after Ben Stokes’ trophy-winning heroics in July. Won’t have helped the mood after England bundled the All Blacks out at the Rugby World Cup, ending the storied careers of Steve Hansen and Kieran Read on a bum note. This time it was Chris Jordan with the heroics, firstly with the bat to earn the tie after a rain-reduced 11 overs, and then with the ball to deny first Seifert, then Grandhomme and Guptill. Tanya Aldred had all the action there - feel free to relive that. (If you’re English, presumably). It was New Zealand v South Africa in the womens’ T2o today, but it’s Sophie Devine who emerges with the last laugh. An unbeaten 85* off 56 from the Kiwi opener put the Strikers in the box seat as they fired 4-164 (20) with Suzie Bates also chiming in with a handy 36 off 30. After Elyse Villani fell cheaply, it was down to the South African duo Lizelle Lee and Mignon du Preez to run it down. They put on an impressive 113-run stand before Bates and Amanda Wellington struck with the ball. 17 runs the margin in the end after a big batting collapse, and the Stars stay bottom. A-League - Melbourne Victory 0-1 Wellington - half-time: They’re winless, pointless and currently propping up the league ladder, but they’ve been awfully unfortunate in recent weeks, the Phoenix, with Marco Kurz admitting pre-game he thought they were the better side during their loss against the high flying Sydney FC, and several contentious VAR calls going against them - the silver lining being that the outrageous call on Louis Fenton last week gave rise to a vintage David Squires column. VAR has come to their rescue today though, Wellington, who lead through an early Ulises Davila penalty after Ola Toivonen was adjudged to have handled in the box. The big Swede didn’t think it was, but it was given nevertheless. Morning Rich, morning all. (That’s my best Bill Lawry voice). Cheers Scott, very kind - and another sterling turn from your good self. A fair bit going on, I’ll try and ease gently into my floating water chair and get the sixteen screens firing. But first a look at the A-League where there’s a little bit of a result threatening to bubble down in Melbourne. And that is me for today. I’m off for a bex and a lie-down after that Fed Cup rubber. I hand you over to the safest gloves in the business, Richard Parkin. Over to you, great man... Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Ashleigh Barty (Aus) loses to Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) 6-2, 4-6, 6-7 Incredible comeback from Mladenovic to peg back Barty and finish all over the top of the world No 1. The Frenchwoman was unstoppable in the tie-breaker, barely giving Barty a sniff. France now hold a 2-1 lead in the Fed Cup final. Up next is Tomljanovic against Garcia. If Tomljanovic can’t win that one for Australia, the Fed Cup will belong to France. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set tie-break: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 6-6 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty finds the net to hand Mladenovic a 2-1 lead in the tie-break Mladenovic cracks a cross-court winner to make it 3-1 to the Frenchwoman Now it’s 4-1 to Mladenovic after a mini-break of Barty’s serve Barty’s return of serve crashes into the net, making it 5-1 to Mladenovic 5 match points to Mladenovic GAME OVER - Barty finds the net to go down in three sets. France take a 2-1 lead. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 6-6 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Mladenovic holds with ridiculous ease and we are off to a tie-break... Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 6-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty stares down three break points to hold her serve and move to within one game of victory. If Mladenovic is broken next game, there’s no way back. Upon winning the final point, Barty punches the air with the mightiest backswing you’ve ever seen. Super stuff. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 5-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty breaks back! Top-class tennis, coupled with bucketsful of mental fortitude, from Barty to break the Frenchwoman to love and restore parity to the third-set scoreline. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 4-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty is broken! And to love, no less. You never want to drop a service game, but least of all when the score is 4-4. Now Mladenovic will serve for the match and a 2-1 Fed Cup final lead for France. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 4-4 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty holds, and then Mladenovic follows suit after the Australian sprays her shot down the line. Down to the wire we go. A-League: 5 mins: Goal! Melbourne Victory 0-1 Wellington Phoenix Didn’t take long for VAR to have its say at AAMI Park, with a handball ruled to have taken place in the Victory box leading to a penalty. Up steps Davila, the first Mexican to play in the A-League, to slot home the spot kick. Controversial! Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 3-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty breaks back! The Australian cruises to a 0-40 lead but Mladenovic has shown today she has courage in spades, winning the next two points before fluffing a cross-court shot to hand Barty the break. We’re all tied up. And now I’m onto my toenails. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 2-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Mladenovic, playing with renewed vigour and verve, grabs a break point and looks all over Barty, but somehow the world No.1 fights back to hold serve. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 1-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty has her chance, but she squanders a break point and it’s again the Frenchwoman who displays better composure in the clinches. The Australian needs to dig deep and find something. The question is, after the year she’s had, what is left? Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 1-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty has been broken! Okay, it’s officially game on. Mladenovic has found another gear, now running Barty around the court and forcing errors from the world No.1. Show us what you’ve got, Ash. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Third set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6, 1-1 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Games go to serve in the opening exchanges of the deciding set but, after holding a 40-0 lead, Mladenovic is brought back to a deuce game and has to pull out all stops to hold. Still on tennis, and things didn’t pan out as planned for Alex de Minaur in Milan, reports AAP. Alex de Minaur has only lost two of his 10 matches in two editions of the Next Gen ATP Finals but unfortunately for the Australian No.1 they were both finals. On Saturday, the top seed was unable to capitalise on a stack of break-point chances as Italian teenager Jannik Sinner stormed to victory to secure his maiden ATP title. Tournament wildcard Sinner thumped winners with incredible regularity off both wings and overpowered world No.18 de Minaur 4-2, 4-1, 4-2 in one hour and four minutes, to the delight of the crowd in Milan. For the second consecutive year de Minaur rolled into the decider with a perfect 4-0 record at the season-ending tournament for top under-21 players. But again, the 20-year-old will have to be content with a runner-up finish - and $295,000 ($A430,000) in prize money - after losing to Stefanos Tsitsipas 12 months ago. De Minaur said the match against Sinner was one of missed opportunities. “It’s a pretty simple match to evaluate,” he said. “I had nine break points and I wasn’t able to convert any of them.” Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-6 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty races to a 15-30 lead but that’s as close as she gets to Mladenovic, who holds her nerve to win the set and take the match to a decider. Whatever you’ve got on for the next hour or so, cancel it. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-5 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty has been broken! After letting six break points in the match go begging, Mladenovic makes the seventh one count to take a 5-4 lead ... meaning she will be serving for the set. Oh, how this wonderful sport can spin on a dime. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-4 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The crunch game, the one Mladenovic didn’t want to drop. And, after an interminably long game featuring more deuces than my Nutribullet, drop it she doesn’t. Meaning Barty, whose unforced error hands Mladenovic the game, won’t be serving for the match just yet. Yep, Ivymantled, stranger things have happened. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 4-3 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Mladenovic has a chance to arrive at another break point on Barty’s serve, but she commits another unforced error and the gate slams shut. A little like looking a gift horse in the mouth, you don’t ask Ashleigh Barty for two bites of the cherry. I’ll be honest with you, I have no idea what either of those things mean. I mean, would the horse mind and why do you have to neck the cherry whole? If you’re thirsty, drinks are on Cate Campbell tonight. Or, if you’re an internet scammer, please help yourself to her personal email address: iwouldnthaveacluewhatitis@nfi.com Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 3-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty again holds to love, meaning that after saving five break points in the opening game of the second set she has won eight straight points off her serve. Kind of like me on the golf course last week. I birdied the 8th but then found the drink (twice) and the bunker (twice) before carding a 15 on the 9th. It’s kind of like that, isn’t it? Isn’t it? Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 2-1 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The difficulties that have been besetting her service game (strange to say that seeing as she hasn’t been broken today) look to be ironed out as Barty hold to love, games going to serve thus far in the second set. Nine-winners-to-five so far in Barty’s favour. Terribly sad news about the death of boxer Dwight Ritchie. Goes without saying that he was taken way too soon at the tender age of 27. Our hearts and condolences go out to his family, friends and associates in the Australian boxing fraternity. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): Second set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2, 1-0 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) What was that about pressure? Mladenovic had Barty squarely and fairly on the ropes in this opening game of the second set, but Barty holds serve after the Frenchwoman squandered five break points. Sacré bleu! Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 6-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The Frenchwoman serves for the game but a backhand error takes it to deuce, and well, that was as good as game over for Mladenovic. The pressure, or perceived pressure, that Barty places on her opponents must be enormous, and the world No.1 promptly closes out the set in Australia’s favour. Would you Adam’n’Eve it, they’re actually playing in rain-soaked Auckland? They must love their cricket over there. Click below to see what’s going on in this 11-overs-a-side slog-fest. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 5-2 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Again, not the most convincing of service games from Barty but she holds nonetheless, meaning games have gone to serve since the world No.1 broke Mladenovic in the second game of the set. Most stats (apart from the score) say this is a fairly close encounter. This from our wonderfully accommodating partners at Australian Associated Press: Socceroos legend Harry Kewell has been linked with the vacant manager’s position at Scottish Premiership club Hibernian. Kewell was spotted in the crowd as Hibs accoutned for St Johnstone 4-1 t McDiarmid Park on Saturday. The 41-year-old refused to deny he was interested in the Hibernian role outside the ground. “I think it’s a fantastic club,” Kewell told Sky Sports Scotland. “There’s a lot of clubs up for new managers and all that and obviously being out of work you’re always speculated and all that. I’m just here to enjoy the game.” Kewell has been out of work since he was axed by English club Notts County in November last year but has repeatedly stated he wants to pursue a coaching career. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 4-1 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) The Frenchwoman does much better in Barty’s third service game, taking the world No.1 to deuce, but the Australian closes out the game easily to take a commanding lead in the opening set. Ripper of a piece here from Clare Watson about a topic that is still something of a taboo in elite women’s sport - breast injury. Fed Cup final (3rd rubber): First set: Ashleigh Barty (Aus) 2-0 Kristina Mladenovic (Fra) Barty holds her serve without much fuss in the opening game before breaking Mladenovic at the first opportunity. With the final scores tied at 1-1, this is the ideal beginning for Australia ... and entirely what one has come to expect of the world No.1. The giant-slaying Perth Scorchers have made it two wins from as many WBBL games in their weekend double-header after upsetting Sydney Thunder by seven runs. After surviving a last-ball thriller against the second-placed Adelaide Strikers on Saturday, the Scorchers held their nerve to down the top-placed Thunder on Sunday at Karen Rolton Oval. All-rounder Heather Graham was the star with bat and ball. After thumping two sixes in her undefeated 33 off 20 balls to lift the Scorchers to 5-151, player-of-the-match Graham snared 3-22 off four overs, her batting and bowling in the clutch crucial in each innings. * * Thanks, AAP Good afternoon, sports fans. How’s your Sunday treating you? I spent my morning sleeping in until 8am (with kids, that is a lie-in), walking the dog and catching the train to Guardian Towers. Now that I’m safely ensconced at my workstation, I’m looking forward to what should be, and already is, a tasty afternoon of sport. The WBBL is already under way, the sooner the Fed Cup final resumes the better (go Ashleigh!), the final T20 between New Zealand and England in rainy Auckland is trying to get off the ground, plus there will no doubt be more VAR drama in today’s two A-League games. Let’s get the (Barty) party started, shall we?"

          "bodyText": "Spoiler alert: this recap is for people watching Spiral on the BBC. Do not read on unless you have watched season seven, episodes nine and 10. Network issues “This case really is extraordinary,” says François and he’s not wrong. When called before Roban, Lebrion produces an email Herville wrote to the prefect (who you’ll recall stressed the need for sensitive policing of the Chinese garment district), complaining about Wang’s life being put in danger. Against the prefect’s orders, Herville got in touch with Wang to warn him, and likely signed his own death warrant. Surely now the arrests will come. The problem is that the network is currently dormant, and Roban is effectively neutered by his injudicious actions last week. What you would really need is a pair of high-energy, low-inhibition, renegade cops to do whatever it takes to close a case. Step up Laure and Gilou, the Burke and Hare of witness intimidation. In no time at all, they catch up with Solignac, go upside his head and brutally kink shame him for his weakness for trans sex workers. A chastened Solignac meekly does their bidding, publicly denying meeting Roban and putting in a €500,000 order with Oury Mazouz to get the network chugging along again. Like so many over-compensating men before him, though, Solignac has a fierce pit bull in tow. Joséphine sends him into the restaurant meeting wearing a wire and while the ruse is quickly uncovered, Laure and Gilou make off with the €500,000 which has the feel of one of those life-changing errors we’ve been seeing so much of recently. After that, Gilou works his magic on Soizic, persuading her to put the block on the bank transfer to smoke out the network’s Mr Big. When the mysterious Mr Chen surfaces soon after, it seems like the magnificent plan has come together. Ripping off a large criminal conspiracy has its downsides, though. Joséphine calls in internal affairs and who better than Tintin to run point? He takes the unusual step of including Laure and Gilou in the investigation into them. It’s a move that treads the thin line between genius and dumbass as gingerly as anything I can remember, but the early signs are promising. They level with him over leaning on Solignac and there seems to be a tentative agreement to work together for the greater good. All such covenants are fragile though, particularly with Joséphine snapping at internal affairs’ heels and an annoying little thing called due process that lesser law enforcement agents insist upon. Oury Mazouz’s abduction only heightens the stakes. After a failed attempt to extract Oury, we finish on Laure and Gilou’s arrest for extortion and GBH. I suppose it’s about time some bad guys were taken off the streets. Laure Laure’s taken a hammering this year but when she lost her way, her mind and her child, Gilou was the constant throughout, even when she did everything to push him away. They become lovers again in a tender scene round at her place which reaffirms the redemptive power of love and fortified wine. Gilou As for Escoffier, there’s a strong sense of déjà vu this week. He chats with his old pal Tintin about the cases they’re working, hooks up with Laure again and gets arrested for serious crimes. It’s starting to feel like the old days. All of this means that he will have to permanently friendzone the beautiful Soizic. It’s harsh, but people outside the CID bubble generally don’t fare well long-term. It’s best she learns now. Joséphine The bond between Joséphine and Lola grows stronger this week as they learn of their shared trauma as rape survivors. Testimony of the attack by her mother’s boyfriend may play well in court, but Lola refuses to play ball. Even when faced with the dead teacher’s wife she’s all “je ne regrette rien” - no explanation, no apology. Joséphine knows the rape revelation could take years off her sentence, and journeys to Lola’s mother to try and get her to testify on her daughter’s behalf. It’s a Hail Mary pass but this one is personal for Joséphine and we all know how persuasive she can be when that’s the case. Thoughts and observations If Oury Mazouz’s kidnap is down to the block on the bank transfer, that could be another body we can chalk down to Laure and Gilou. How many is that now? “I’m finding it hard to understand Solignac’s change of heart”. Roban knows that Laure and Gilou helped him out with the Solignac affair and is terribly grateful. A night out with those two boozehounds leaves him three sheets to the wind but significantly happier. “If you can get back on the right track, I think it will be one of my greatest satisfactions”. With Rayan resuming formal education after some brutal life lessons recently dished out, it would indeed be something to see him avoid what looked like an inevitable grisly fate. With Oury’s sister Lydia revealed as David Cann’s wife, we’re seeing a bit more of the network’s connections. After Chen, Cann seems the likeliest Mr Big but with the state now involved, that title may be moot. What was it Lebrion said to Beckriche? “You don’t know what you’re getting into. This goes way beyond us.” As next week’s finale steadily approaches, how will it all end? Have your say below."

          "bodyText": "When did you start working at the Guardian? It was October 1988 – just over 31 years ago! I was hired to cover business, with a special responsibility for property. Canary Wharf was being built and the UK was in the middle of a house price boom. I remember my first day clearly. I reported on British Gas, with a deadline of about 5pm. Back then it was only a newspaper, so there was no huge rush to file copy like there is today. Have you always been interested in this area? A few years previously, I had graduated with a degree from Cambridge in history, having originally been accepted to study economics and switched courses because there was too much maths for my liking. I was deeply interested in the economy, but mostly from a historical perspective. After graduating, I worked at the Press Association as their economics correspondent and enjoyed some time as a cub reporter before my big break at the Guardian. What are your biggest professional highlights so far? It feels slightly ghoulish to say so, but the most memorable moments have often been in the middle of times of despair. The stock market crash of 1987, Black Wednesday in 1992, and the Financial Crisis of 2007-09 particularly stick in my mind. For an economics reporter, these are frenetic, exciting and often highly satisfying periods. There’s a lot to discuss and our readers often appreciate having complicated things made more explicable and less jargon-y – though many are specialists themselves, or at least highly interested and self-taught amateurs. What are the biggest challenges of the role? When the economy is doing well, it can be very challenging. The period from the 90s to the early 00s was dubbed the “nice decade” by Mervyn King, the then governor of the Bank of England. There was falling unemployment, interest rates were low, the economy was downgraded as a news story, New Labour had come to power. There was some debate over the euro, but otherwise it was fairly steady and not much to write about. Looking at the period between the financial crisis and the Brexit referendum, what have been the most significant moments? I think the moment when we knew the banks were going to be bailed out was hugely significant. It signified that those responsible were getting away with it. I knew that this was a financial crisis that had been caused by the financial sector, and I believe it contributed to the 2016 referendum result because the eurozone almost broke apart following crises in Greece, Ireland and Portugal brought about by the crash. Europe felt flawed and in need of fundamental change. Since 2016, we haven’t recognised the importance of that period on the result – the impact of austerity on those parts of Britain that feel left-behind – and we’ve had three wasted years when no one has really got to grips with the reasons we voted as we did. Politics dominates economics, and it can be quite depressing when you see the same mistakes being repeated time and time again by the financially powerful. You can often pre-empt what’s going to happen because things happen in waves. People forget what’s come before, and then the same mistakes are made again, sometimes by the same people. It’s happening as we speak, because all the signs point to another financial bubble out there that will leave policymakers scrabbling around for a response when – not if – it pops. You’ve previously spoken about how in 2007 you came up with the concept of the Green New Deal. Can you tell us more about that? I am very proud of the Green New Deal. It had modest beginnings in a bar in London. I was with Colin Hines of Greenpeace. We met during the financial crisis and were reflecting on what had happened in the deep recession that followed the Wall Street Crash in 1929, wondering what was to come. We needed a response from a progressive left, and felt that this was a chance to seize the agenda. The plan was to increase public spending, drive recovery, tax finance more heavily, get people back to work, retrofit homes with better insulation and introduce low carbon energy. There has been much more recognition of the green agenda, and climate is now a much bigger part of it. But nothing really happened back then. Everyone is talking about the green agenda again now, and people such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are focusing attention, but it feels like there have been 10 wasted years. In terms of tackling the climate crisis, what could we learn from the financial crisis? Sometimes it takes more than one crisis for fundamental change to happen. That was certainly the case in the 1970s when it was the second energy shock that led to the decisive shift to the right. This time could be the same. The financial crisis hasn’t yet blown over and we could be on the cusp of another after year after year of virtually zero interest rates. And in terms of energy, climate and the financial crunch, we are worse off than a decade ago. When we first formulated the Green New Deal, the plan was to introduce jobs in every constituency, to reskill and retrain, invest in local communities. We wanted to use universities as centres of excellence for green technology. All of this is still yet to happen because of lack of buy-in from those in charge. How does this view differ between the UK and the US at the moment? Both countries are encountering similar issues around the economy, in particular the sense among many people that globalisation works for the better off but not for them. Periods of stability and peace don’t last forever. There is nearly always something bad waiting around the corner. For the last 40 years, the western economy has been run on a free-market, trickle-down basis – there is surely enough evidence to see that that doesn’t work. We should have learned lessons from the financial crash, but we didn’t. In 2016 we had our second opportunity, and we missed that too. Now, the climate emergency means we’re playing with fire. Power structures have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, making change difficult. Global heating makes it vital that we work towards progressive change – even more vital than in the 1930s, in fact. You anticipated the crisis in the EU. Do you still feel there’s hope for a healthy and prosperous future for the UK and Europe? I think the worst thing that can happen is that the current state of purgatory continues. It’s difficult to address the problems. I think that if and when we leave, it won’t be as bad as people think. I believe we will find a way of surviving and indeed thriving. The British state works best amid a crisis, and a crisis is how change and progress happens. You have written a lot about why you voted Leave and why it’s important to be open about this view at the Guardian. Can you tell us more about that? I don’t regret how I voted because I believe we need to see radical change to the fundamentals of British economy. I think my views are valued by readers, or at least some of them! To me, 2016 was an expression of profound dissatisfaction with the status quo, of which the EU is part. I’ve always thought Tony Benn got it right about the EU. He thought of it as pro big business, pro multinationals, anti working people, undemocratic and the embodiment of neoliberal economic ideas. I agree with that. I’m not sure, though, that the economic arguments matter all that much in the current Brexit debate. It is more about how people feel about themselves, how they identify themselves. For those on the Remain side, opposing Brexit suggests that they are liberal, internationalist, supporters of modernity and multiculturalism. I see no contradiction in being pro-Brexit and being an internationalist. I have never seen anything especially leftwing about the EU. Fortunately, our editor in chief, Katharine Viner, welcomes a plurality of views in the paper. Scott Trust values matter in these circumstances and help to ensure views don’t go unchallenged. I don’t think I could have survived as economics editor of a different paper, for this reason. What makes the Guardian unique? News and comment are completely separate at the Guardian, which is useful in introducing multiple voices and making us a truly broad church. I’ve always wanted to work at the Guardian and never been tempted to go elsewhere – other places just seemed second best. I have complete freedom here: not once has an editor tapped me on my shoulder and told me to toe the party line. Being a journalist is such a privilege – you never know what’s going to happen on any given day, and that makes it endlessly exciting. The Guardian isn’t perfect, of course, but we do our best to be truthful and honest."

          "bodyText": "Alex Lawther and Jessica Barden bound towards each other in a basement boardroom in Channel 4’s London offices and hug like long-lost siblings. “I’m wearing my End of the F***ing World necklace,” Barden tells Lawther proudly, pointing to one of those heart pendants you break apart and share with a friend. Lawther shakes his head. “Ah, I didn’t put mine on today,” he says, sounding as if he’s committed a mortal sin, “but I’ll definitely wear it to the launch”. It is a far cry from their first meeting in the darkly comic Channel 4/Netflix hit, where Lawther’s character, James – a luckless teen with psychopathic traits – plots to murder Barden’s Alyssa. Slowly, the pair become more like Thelma and Louise, escaping retro-hued suburbia for increasingly high-stakes scrapes, from a carjacking to a run-in with a serial rapist. If this sounds heavy-going on paper, in reality it is a show that tackles difficult themes with a sardonic edginess and an often frantic pace that is in keeping with its comic-book origins. Although neither Barden or Lawther are as nihilistic as their alter egos, there are some parallels: she is infinitely charming, a little spiky and restless, mockingly describing herself as “a degenerate”, while he has a more reflective, English-student vibe, an Extinction Rebellion badge pinned to the lapel of his coat. Really, though, they are a riot. They erupt into fits of giggles as they recount the story of how James’s house was knocked down in real life two days after the first season wrapped, with the character relocating to his car this season as a result of its demolition. “It’s such a James thing,” says Barden. “Charlie [Covell, the show’s writer] didn’t actually put that in the script because even she was like, that’s too much.” “My house has disappeared!” Lawther adds, fake-crying. Ordinarily, the leads of a successful TV show would not be banished to the basement, especially not a show that – according to Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos – has been an “astounding” success for the streaming service, and which also broke records on All 4. But there is good reason for it: at the end of the first season, James was seemingly killed in a police chase. While fans will by now know about Lawther’s return – the second season dropped in one go on Monday – it was kept under wraps until the show’s transmission (promo posters featured Alyssa in a wedding dress, alongside an urn that many presumed contained James’s ashes). Although the idea of killing James off proved largely unpopular with fans, a lot of theories swirled online prior to the show airing. “Some of them are amazing,” says Lawther, wide-eyed. “Alyssa being haunted by the ghost of James is an amazing idea. Another one was that it was Alyssa [who] was shot [by the police], and then season two becomes about them trying to break her out of jail.” Barden has been offering further curveballs in interviews. “People have been like: ‘Is James dead,’ and my answer is: ‘Am I dead?!’” Adapted by actor Covell from Charles Forsman’s graphic novel and boosted by a Netflix deal that saw the series broadcast internationally, TEOTFW is not your usual teen show. As indebted to Tarantino as it is to Twin Peaks, its first season lunges from murderers to middle-aged perverts, attempted sexual assault to the awkward chemistry between two female police detectives, all punctuated by dark gags and an obscure, fittingly morose soundtrack curated by Blur’s Graham Coxon. The setting is a disorienting mix of British small-town-ness and Americana, via roadside diners and sprawling, overgrown forests. Although unconventional in many ways, it presents a classic conundrum: a tale of a will-they-won’t-they couple who are as good for each other as they are bad. It is a mix that has proved hugely successful. As well as overshooting the broadcasters’ expectations, The End of the F***ing World has become one of those shows as likely to be dissected by teens on the internet as by heavyweight critics. It bridges the gap between Tumblr fandom and awards shows, having been nominated for both a Bafta and an Emmy. While the pair admit that it is difficult to comprehend how big a phenomenon something is when you are actually in it, they know that hanging out in a shiny hotel bar would have given the game away. Barden has been spotted in places as obscure as a branch of Target in Ohio, while Lawther is often accosted in the street, although sometimes people get a bit confused. “I get people coming up to me and saying: ‘Ah, Asa Butterfield, I loved you in [Netflix series] Sex Education,’” he admits. Lawther is not your average matinee idol: he looks far younger than his 24 years, is faultlessly polite and often uses interviews to get deep into subjects such as politics and why private schools should be abolished (he attended one himself, during a childhood in Hampshire which he previously described as a “middle-class bubble”). He is known for his outsider roles, including a teenage paedophile in Black Mirror’s Shut Up and Dance and a young, enigmatic Alan Turing in 2014 film The Imitation Game. Complex characters appeal to him – with James being a particularly knotty role to untangle. “Initially, I thought [the show] was about a young man being violent towards a young woman, and I thought: ‘I’m not really that interested because there’s enough of that around.’ But I realised that James becomes something else. It’s not about his violence towards Alyssa, it’s about him understanding how he feels and working out that actually he’s not a psychopath, he’s just very, very, very sad.” Barden, meanwhile, was born in North Yorkshire and landed a breakout role in Coronation Street at the age of 14, leading to parts in dramas and odd offbeat films such as Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster. Alyssa wasn’t the kind of role she was used to playing but, says the 27-year-old, reclining on an office chair with more than a bit of her character’s forthrightness about her, it was a welcome challenge. “At first it was just another part that I wanted to do, then it was: ‘Oh this is quite funny.’ As I got closer to when we actually filmed it, it turned into: ‘Nobody else [is] giving me an opportunity to do anything like this,’” she says. “At the time when we finally made it, I was continuously being told I would never be a lead in anything. I don’t fit the mould: I’m not trained, I have a working-class background and I didn’t want to do a grooming storyline or play a maid every time. I wanted to lead an interesting TV show. So in the end [this] was a complete breath of fresh air.” She and Lawther met for the first time during the casting process in LA, on a trip that was equal amounts of work and play. “Our relationship started by being dry-iced in a nightclub and then suddenly feeling completely, instinctively safe with you when we couldn’t see anything for two minutes,” Barden explains. “You make people feel very safe on- and off-camera, and I think that’s how Alyssa and James make each other feel as well.” It is clearly something of an intense relationship, both on- and off-screen. What do its stars think of the idea, posited by critics and fans alike, that James and Alyssa’s might not be a healthy bond? “It’s an adolescent relationship where they’re exploring trauma and insecurity so it’s not really healthy, but it is a relationship that is present,” says Barden. “I think something only needs to be present to be healthy.” Lawther nods in agreement. “They fuck up a lot and do the wrong thing but it’s always with the intention of trying to help the other person or do the most loving thing,” he says. “Often they get it really wrong, but I don’t think it’s unhealthy to get it wrong.” Besides, adds Barden, “they might have been even more lost without each other.” Up to this point, the show has been primarily about Alyssa and James, with the odd tangent to take in: characters such as police officers Eunice and Teri and their sexual tension, or would-be rebel Frodo – a fan favourite played by Nick Cave’s son Earl, who helped the pair to hold up the service station where he worked, before realising there was only room for two on their getaway mission. This time, though, their story is neatly interwoven with that of Bonnie, another outsider with a bone-dry sense of humour, who – in a trademark curveball – is the subject of the entire first episode. Bonnie is played by Naomi Ackie, a future household name who has a role in the upcoming Star Wars film The Rise of Skywalker. Rather than interfere with the double-act chemistry, Ackie proved an ideal addition to proceedings; seeing her on set with Barden “really solidified what we were making”, says Lawther. The pair also bonded with Tim Key – who plays another new character, unnerving motel owner Gus – even if Barden visibly cringes when recalling their first day together on set. “Obviously somewhere in my brain, I was like, this guy is in Alan Partridge, but it didn’t connect, so I was going around shouting ‘A-ha’. When I realised, I was like: ‘I look like such an idiot!’” As well as Bonnie and Gus’s stories, we also get a James-free look at what Alyssa’s life has been like in the time since that fateful police chase, including the reason behind what Lawther jokingly describes as “that fuck-off big dress”. Did they ever imagine a world where the show might have abandoned James altogether? Barden claims she always knew they’d be back together. “It just wouldn’t work,” she says firmly. “The show is Alyssa and James together, you know – that’s what it is.” Besides, she adds with a mischievous glance at Lawther, “people would have been so annoyed with us.”"

          "headline": "I had a fling on a work trip and it has shaken my world",
          "bodyText": "I am a 38-year-old woman, married with two young children. Recently, I went on a business trip and had an affair with a man 30 years my senior and something of a mentor figure. The following day he avoided me; when he did finally talk to me, he was distant and patronising. When I emailed him about work, it took him a week to respond. Several days later, I sent him another email telling him how I felt, but also included work-related things; I wanted to indicate that I was happy to leave it at that. He responded to every banal detail in the email, but avoided any mention of what had happened between us. I miss him terribly. I’m also sad that I perhaps misjudged him, and wonder if he isn’t such a lovely person. I know he has two adult children and problems with his wife. The other issue is my relationship with my husband. Why did this affair happen when I had never been unfaithful before? We do quarrel, but have sex once or twice a week. However, I’m not particularly attracted to him and go through the motions. (Although the affair has unexpectedly boosted our intimacy.) We were in love when we married, but after the children were born I felt I could have lived without sex. Where do I go from here? Leaving my husband fills me with dread. I feel I love him most of the time, but is that enough? I would love to contact this other man the next time I’m in his town, strictly in a professional capacity, but I’m scared he might say no. I wouldn’t be against repeating the night, as well, but that is not my primary aim. Be honest with yourself and stop pretending you want to see this other man for work reasons. I think your primary aim is to repeat that night, and I can understand why. An experience like that can be exciting and heady; but it’s not sustainable in the real world. Plus, you are married and he has made it obvious that he doesn’t want to see you. You need to listen to the silence from him. You ask why this affair happened. I talked to psychotherapist Cate Campbell (bacp.co.uk), who specialises in relationships and has written two books about sex. She told me about a study by Rosemary Basson, a professor of sexual medicine, that found that 10 years was the maximum length of time “active desire” could stretch in a relationship for many people. After that, “regardless of your age or how much in love you are, desire is responsive and follows arousal, rather than occurring spontaneously”. Often, Campbell continued, “People think their lack of desire is the fault of the relationship they are in and blame that.” Yet it is often simply in a rut. Your husband probably feels the same. You are comparing your fling with the domesticity of your marriage – and that is not fair. “We put pressure on ourselves to feel desired [and desire], but actually desire doesn’t go with the humdrum aspects of marriage and having small children,” Campbell explained. “It’s hard to drum desire up in those circumstances and easy to beat yourself up about it. Don’t throw your life away for this fantasy.” It was impossible to tell if your marriage is in trouble, because your letter is so clouded by the headiness of your night with this man; however, it did sound as if there is a lot to commend it. Until you can see clearly, I wouldn’t make any rash decisions. You ask, why now? I imagine it was a convergence of the right time, a person you found attractive and being away from home. It doesn’t mean that you are going to be serially unfaithful. However, when clarity returns, if you are still unhappy you will need to address the issues in your marriage. Affairs are often a distress flare sent up by one person when there is a problem for both partners. You and your husband need to communicate, and Campbell strongly recommended that you and he make time for each other “not to have sex but to chat and reinvigorate your life together”. It is so easy to stop doing this once children become the focus. Can you remember how you communicated best in the early days? Do you have nonsexual needs that are not being met? People can feel they lose themselves after having children. Maybe, for you, this fling was a way to get back in touch with who you were, or what you feel you are missing out on now. • Every week Annalisa Barbieri addresses a family-related problem sent in by a reader.

          "headline": "‘New entry at 84’: why are One Direction's solo careers stalling?",
          "bodyText": "In recent weeks, all five members of boyband behemoth One Direction – now nearly four years into their “hiatus” – have released solo singles. Out of those five, only one has so far reached the UK Top 30, with Harry Styles’s Zayn-esque Lights Up entering at a not-too-disrespectful No 3. For everyone else, it looks like a rapid fall from grace: lovely Niall Horan’s Nice to Meet Ya entered at No 51; Liam Payne’s awkward trap-pop bop Stack It Up started at No 84; while Louis Tomlinson’s Kill My Mind failed to chart. As for Zayn, whose 27-track second album Icarus Falls flew in at No 77 last December, he is now relying on collaborations to keep his Spotify plays ticking over. So why has the post-1D bubble burst? In many ways, the band represented the last true cross-generational, all-consuming pop culture moment. They were also a global phenomenon, who arrived when less quantifiable stats – such as huge YouTube viewing figures and Twitter followers the size of Peru (Niall Horan is currently the band’s most followed with 39.4 million followers) – started to infiltrate music. However, the old-school idea of millions of latent followers resulting in a Top 10 hit is over. Even Katy Perry’s last single, Harleys in Hawaii, peaked at No 45 in this country and she is the second most-followed person on Twitter. This is especially brutal when a group splits. As chart obsessive James Masterton, who runs the Chart Watch UK blog, says: “The One Direction fandom [was] so notoriously noisy and in so many ways scarily obsessive that people assumed it would automatically carry over to the solo careers.” But once a band implodes the fanbase fractures, meaning, Masterton adds, “You’re only good for automatic Top 30 hits rather than automatic top fives”. Beyond the industry shifts, perhaps a failure to launch also boils down to each of the boys’ solo identities. Niall has conformed to his role in One Direction: the cute-as-a-button, thick-knit jumper wearer. Cosy initially, but now wearing thin. The most successful member Harry – AKA the enigmatic “rock star” – has done the same, but made it edgier for a new audience (ie his sweat-ridden Lights Up video). Meanwhile, Louis and Liam have confused their narratives, making it hard for fans to keep up. Louis’s releases have been all over the shop, veering from threadbare EDM (Back to You) to Avril Lavigne-esque punk-pop (Miss You); while Liam, very much the Gary Barlow of 1D, has now restyled himself as an R&amp;B lothario as reimagined by the Lonely Island. As for Zayn, his unwillingness to play the promo game outside of style magazine covers has stunted any real breakthrough. A post-boyband identity crisis is to be expected, but pop is rarely patient. Perhaps the inevitable reunion is on its way. You can hear the hysteria already."

          "bodyText": "One of the subtle ironies of Soviet life was that its founding moment was habitually celebrated in the wrong month. The “great October” marking the events of 1917 used to be commemorated every year on 7 November, thanks to a quirk of chronology dating back centuries. This was not lost on the locals, with their well developed sense of irony: even the calendar was against them. Of course, 1917 was not the only November revolution that upended the region. Another uprising 30 years ago this weekend upstaged the Bolshevik festivities and steered a swathe of eastern Europe on to a new course. But for better or worse? Much has been made of the disillusionment gripping the region, but as our central and eastern European correspondent, Shaun Walker, found out, in countries such as Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania, people have never had it so good. The fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 was perhaps the most Upsidey revolution in history. If you’re not convinced, perhaps these before and after images from Berlin will change your mind.

We are a small NGO that works on sharing science-based information about the wolf as a social and family-oriented animal in order to influence attitudes and reduce unnecessary fear and hatred towards wolves. We are writing to you to propose that the Guardian’s The Upside could write about the topic of wolf hate in Finland. In this otherwise peaceful, uncorrupted and well-educated country, poaching is the biggest cause of wolf mortality. Even though wolves are strictly protected by European law and Finland promotes itself as a destination for lovers of nature and the great outdoors, wolves are being legally hunted down. In fact, Finland was recently taken to the European court of justice over the way its authorities seem to easily hand out wolf-killing permits without sufficiently justifying their decisions. The present situation for the wolves in Finland is so severe that if public opinion doesn’t change, Finland could be left with no wolves at all. Where was the Upside?

          "bodyText": "Polly Toynbee is spot-on in her analysis of the democratic deficit Britain is faced with (Journal, 5 November). Leading Brexiters are very keen to talk about democracy, and the will of the people, but are strangely silent on the large proportion of the electorate whose votes are wasted under the current system. First past the post has benefited successive rightwing governments, allowing them to rule the majority on a minority of votes. In the year of the 200th anniversary of the Peterloo massacre, it is Labour who must take the lead on democracy. Millions of potential Labour supporters are stuck in safe Tory seats, or know they must tactically vote Lib Dem rather than for Labour’s radical proposals. This is why I joined the Labour Campaign for Electoral Reform, who want the party to adopt proportional representation in its manifesto. Remember the words of the late Robin Cook: “Democracy is not just a means to an end. Democracy is a value in itself. And if we treasure that value, we need to provide a more democratic system for the centrepiece of our own political structure.” Theo Morgan London • As trade unionists and progressives, we urge Labour to give a clear manifesto commitment to building a politics for the many, including overhauling the undemocratic House of Lords. Two hundred years since people died for the right to vote at Peterloo, it is an ongoing scandal that so many of our parliamentarians remain unelected. Few could deny that Westminster is broken. Just 4% of people feel fully able to influence decisions in parliament, according to a BMG poll. It’s no wonder: politics remains undemocratic and hugely centralised, hoarding power for the few when we need to be sharing it. Labour’s slogan “for the many, not the few” can only be realised by committing to replacing the unelected House of Lords with a PR-elected scrutiny chamber, representing all the nations and regions of the UK. With a general election mandate from the public, this can be done in the first five years after winning power. Polling for the Electoral Reform Society shows what a vote-winner overhauling this private members’ club could be. With overwhelming cross-party support for change, this is a powerful coalition which Labour must lead. Committing to real reform would show that Labour stands for all voters, not just a privileged elite. Pauline Bryan Labour peer, Lynn Henderson PCS national officer, former TUC Scotland president, Shavanah Taj vice president of Wales TUC, Sam Tarry TSSA national political officer and PPC for Ilford South, Alexandra Runswick director of Unlock Democracy, Holly Rigby journalist • Your editorial (Labour’s plans are radical and needed to fix the economy and democracy, 5 November) and Polly Toynbee’s plea for electoral reform are both right, but missing the key radical initiative which this moment demands – reform of both Houses of Parliament, linked to moving parliament to a new site away from London. It’s not a new idea, but its time has surely come. Reform of the Commons and the Lords is essential. We need parliament to make a radical break from its roots in the old, crumbling buildings. Just think how much we need reconstruction after the devastating, destructive sight of parliamentary “debates” and the gridlock of Brexit and two-party politics, watched in disbelief by disenfranchised voters. “Westminster” is now a dirty word, a synonym for a bubble remote from real life and rational thinking. Move parliament to the Midlands or the north, as a great symbolic gesture of renewal and rebuilding of national cohesion; build modern debating chambers to encourage a new era of intelligent non-sectarian representation; provide up-to-date facilities for MPs with the finest sustainable modern architecture as a symbol of what Britain can do. By all means preserve the current buildings to represent the glorious and not so glorious past of the “mother of parliaments”. But please let’s move on. The party that puts this in its manifesto gets my vote!

          "headline": "Air bubble barrier traps plastic waste in Amsterdam's canals",
          "bodyText": "The world’s first rubbish barrier made entirely from bubbles has been unveiled in Amsterdam in an attempt to catch waste in the city’s canals before it reaches the North Sea. A Dutch start-up, the Amsterdam municipality and the regional water board launched the Great Bubble Barrier, a simple device that channels rubbish – especially small pieces of plastic – to the side of the Westerdok canal where it can be retrieved. Tests have shown it can divert more than 80% of flotsam. “More than two-thirds of plastics in the ocean comes out of rivers and canals – so if you have to intercept it, why not do it in the rivers?” says Philip Ehrhorn, co-inventor of the technology. “You can’t put a physical barrier in a canal: it has to be open for wildlife and recreation.” The hope is that the innovation will help to address the mounting crisis of plastic waste in the ocean. Estimates suggest as much as 8m tonnes of plastic ends up in the world’s seas each year – the equivalent of one truckload of old bottles, trays and containers every minute. The bubble barrier is a long, perforated tube running diagonally for 60 metres across the bottom of the canal. Compressed air is pumped through the tube and rises upwards, and then the natural water current helps to push waste to one side. It is trapped in a small rubbish platform on the side of the Westerdokskade at the tip of Amsterdam’s historic canal belt. Ehrhorn, a German naval architect and ocean engineer, got the inspiration from a water treatment plant he saw while studying in Australia in 2015. “At one stage they aerate the water, and on a big surface put air bubbles like a big jacuzzi,” he said. “The small plastic pieces that people throw in the toilet all collected in one corner and that was the kind of spark for me. If you can guide plastic to the side, can’t you do it in a more directed way and on purpose in a river?” At the same time, three keen Dutch amateur sailors and friends, Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet and Saskia Studer, were discussing the problem over a beer in Amsterdam one evening and came up with the idea of a curtain of bubbles that sifts out waste but lets fish and boats through over a beer one evening in Amsterdam. The two teams came together to work on the idea, with the help of a €500,000 Postcode Lotteries Green Challenge award and other prizes. The first operational barrier in Amsterdam – due to run 24 hours a day for three years – aims to supplement dredging operations, which currently collect 42,000 kg of larger plastics from the Dutch capital’s waterways each year. Bubble barrier waste will be separately collected, then analysed by plastics action group Schone Rivieren (Clean rivers). Marieke van Doorninck, head of sustainability for Amsterdam council, hopes it will be a successful example. “Amsterdam’s canals have enormous appeal,” she said. “But when you think of them, you don’t think about plastic bottles and bags in the water. The bubble barrier will mean fewer plastics reach the ocean, and is a step towards better regulation of our ecosystem, to the benefit of man, beast and environment.” In the small, waterlogged country, this kind of innovation is welcome. Bianca Nijhof, managing director of the Netherlands Water Partnership, who organises the Amsterdam International Water Week conference, running this week, added: “The Dutch live with the water and don’t fight against it: 50% of the country is below sea level, more than half is prone to flooding and in 2018 we had severe drought,” she said. “This special relationship with water combined with an entrepreneurial mindset mean that innovation is at our core. The bubble barrier is one solution for clean water for all.”"

          "bodyText": "Whenever I have my weekly FaceTime catch up with mum, there’s always a guarantee food will be discussed. She’s Lebanese after all and, like millions of other Arab families – especially in the diaspora – our food is an integral part of our cultural identity. But when I moved to London three-and-a-half years ago, I was hopelessly inept at cooking. I quickly realised I couldn’t just live off basic meals like pasta or steak, alongside the odd takeaway or supermarket ready meal. With each passing month, I felt more disconnected from my culture, and ultimately from my family. I underestimated how much my mum’s cooking gave me a sense of home. Realising this, I had my older sister send me a recipe for djaj ou riz – chicken served with rice cooked in minced lamb and ground spices – from one of her Lebanese cookbooks. When I tried to cook it the first time, I had mum on FaceTime providing me tips in real time, to make it more like her version. Mum would also ask me to switch the camera so she could see where I was up to, and watched with a huge, proud grin as I browned the mince with the spices just before adding the rice. Prior to moving to London, the only traditional dish I knew was mjuddarrah – an easy meal of rice cooked with lentils. Cooking djaj ou riz ignited a fire within me to learn more family recipes. Recipes that belonged to my grandmothers before being passed on to my mum. Recipes I probably should’ve learned while still living in Sydney. Truth is, I was living at home for most of my 20s (paying most of the bills as my form of rent, mind you). I was spoilt whenever I came home from uni or work to find a delectable home-cooked meal waiting for me. So when mum came to visit me around the time of my one-year anniversary in London, I took advantage of it – and she was more than happy to give me cooking lessons. On the nights we were not eating out, I added the family recipes of fasoulia, musakhan, mansaf, knafeh, kibbeh fil souniyeh and of course hummos and baba ghanouj to my repertoire. She spent a whole unforgettable day showing me how to make what is arguably the king of all Levantine Arab dishes: waraq einab – lemony, stuffed vine leaves, slow-cooked with lamb chops and stuffed zucchini. As we stuffed and rolled vine leaves together she shared stories I already knew about her childhood in Lebanon, and reminisced about dad – who died in 2009. Our cooking lessons gave me a newfound appreciation for the labour and love mum puts into the kitchen. More than anything they deepened the bond between her and me. When I was in Sydney last year for a few months to sort out my UK visa, I learned even more recipes: maqloubeh, moukhiyeh, baklawa, kifta and kifta fil souniyeh. My confidence has grown to the point of cockiness. Sometimes I send photos to the family WhatsApp group or post on Instagram Stories just to show off – and shamelessly so. The pride in my cooking goes beyond the performative factor. It has helped me feel connected with my culture again, and to build a bridge between me and my grandmothers. While I have vague memories of my maternal grandma, my dad’s mother died two years before I was born. The former left Tripoli with my grandfather in the early stages of the Lebanese civil war to be with their children already in Sydney; while the latter was a widow who fled Jaffa during Orthodox Easter of 1948, the war that led to the creation of the state of Israel, turning them into refugees. When I cook, I keenly feel the sacrifices they made for our family. Their resilience has helped to ensure food would remain a huge part of our cultural identity, and I owe it to them to honour that legacy. I also use food to connect those around me to my Palestinian and Lebanese heritage, especially my English husband. When we host friends at our place, it brings me joy to be able to cook for them. I’m reminded of the generous and infectious hospitality both my mum and late dad bestowed on their guests. I’m keenly aware, yet secretly proud, of the cultural idiosyncrasies I’ve inherited: cooking way too much for a small dinner party and still not believing it’s enough, while also encouraging guests to have more than one serving. Cooking has helped me on an emotional level. I turned to my mother’s recipes whenever my mind went into overdrive from the sheer stress and uncertainty of my UK visa. While my visa situation is now under control, I still turn to cooking as a form of meditation whenever I feel anxious. My fledgling repertoire of family recipes eases the ache of homesickness whenever it washes over me. When I cook, I feel like mum is with me – even when I don’t have her on FaceTime. Her warmth from the other side of the world is always felt in my kitchen, the beating heart of my home away from home. Mjuddarah Serves 2-3 Mjuddarah is a delicious vegan meal that is easy to make. My mum often describes it as a springboard recipe of sorts. Perfect this, then you can perfect other Middle Eastern dishes. Some other recipe books may include spices in mjuddarah – often cumin. My mum’s recipe does not, allowing the green lentils to truly shine. If you want to increase the servings, just remember the rice/lentils ratio. That is, for every portion of rice, use 2/3 the volume of green lentils. 1 cup long grain rice, washed and drained 2/3 cup of green lentils, washed and drained 1 onion, chopped and diced 3 tablespoons of olive oil 1 teaspoon salt Place medium-size pot on high and add olive oil. Once it heats up a little, add the diced onions. Fry the onions off, until they start go brown. Add the lentils, briefly stirring them in with the onions. Add two-and-a-half cups of boiling hot water, then cover the pot with a lid. Once it starts to boil, bring the heat down to medium. Let the lentils cook for 8-10 minutes in the water. Afterwards, give it a taste for texture – the lentils need to be bitey and firm – not hard and not soft and mushy. The water should also be brown from the cooked lentils and browned onions. Once the lentils are ready, add the rice, and then the salt. Stir a couple of times to even it all out. If too much water has evaporated, and the rice is not fully submerged, add a little bit more water. Keep the pot on medium. Once the water starts to bubble, bring the stove down to low heat and give the rice and lentils one more stir to make sure nothing is starting to stick at the bottom. Once the water looks all absorbed, turn the stove off but leave the pot on the burner. Let it sit for at least 15-20 minutes. After this, the mjuddarah should be fluffy and ready to serve. Optional: Before browning the diced onions, use 2/3 cup of oil and an extra onion that has been halved and chopped sideways into slithers. Place the oil in the pot and add the onions – this may be done in two separate batches – to shallow fry. Once the onion slithers fry and go brown, remove them to drain on a paper towel. Use the same pot, with the leftover oil, to make the rest of the mjuaddah. Once the rice and lentils are ready to serve, add the fried onions on top to serve. Recommended sides: A garden salad of lettuce, cucumber, tomato and spring onion with a seasoned olive oil and fresh lemon juice dressing; or a diced cucumber and yoghurt, mint and crushed garlic salad (like a chunky tzatziki). • Elias Jahshan is an editor and freelance writer based in London.

          "headline": "Nasa's Voyager 2 sends back its first message from interstellar space",
          "bodyText": "Twelve billion miles from Earth, there is an elusive boundary that marks the edge of the sun’s realm and the start of interstellar space. When Voyager 2, the longest-running space mission, crossed that frontier more than 40 years after its launch it sent a faint signal from the other side that scientists have now decoded. The Nasa craft is the second ever to travel beyond the heliosphere, the bubble of supersonic charged particles streaming outwards from the sun. Despite setting off a month ahead of its twin, Voyager 1, it crossed the threshold into interstellar space more than six years behind, after taking the scenic route across the solar system and providing what remain the only close-up images of Uranus and Neptune. Now Voyager 2 has sent back the most detailed look yet at the edge of our solar system – despite Nasa scientists having no idea at the outset that it would survive to see this landmark. “We didn’t know how large the bubble was and we certainly didn’t know that the spacecraft could live long enough to reach the edge of the bubble and enter interstellar space,” said Prof Ed Stone, of the California Institute of Technology, who has been working on the mission since before its launch in 1977. The heliosphere can be thought of as a cosmic weather front: a distinct boundary where charged particles rushing outwards from the sun at supersonic speed meet a cooler, interstellar wind blowing in from supernovae that exploded millions of years ago. It was once thought that the solar wind faded away gradually with distance, but Voyager 1 confirmed there was a boundary, defined by a sudden drop in temperature and an increase in the density of charged particles, known as plasma. The second set of measurements, by Voyager 2, give new insights into the nature of the heliosphere’s limits because on Voyager 1 a crucial instrument designed to directly measure the properties of plasma had broken in 1980. Measurements published in five separate papers in Nature Astronomy reveal that Voyager 2 encountered a much sharper, thinner heliosphere boundary than Voyager 1. This could be due to Voyager 1 crossing during a solar maximum (activity is currently at a low) or the craft itself might have crossed through on a less perpendicular trajectory that meant it ended up spending longer at the edge. The second data point also gives some insight into the shape of the heliosphere, tracing out a leading edge something like a blunt bullet. “It implies that the heliosphere is symmetric, at least at the two points where the Voyager spacecraft crossed,” said Bill Kurth, a University of Iowa research scientist and a co-author on one of the studies. “That says that these two points on the surface are almost at the same distance.” Voyager 2 also gives additional clues to the thickness of the heliosheath, the outer region of the heliosphere and the point where the solar wind piles up against the approaching wind in interstellar space, like the bow wave sent out ahead of a ship in the ocean. The data also feeds into a debate about the overall shape of the heliosphere, which some models predict ought to be spherical and others more like a wind sock, with a long tail floating out behind as the solar system moves through the galaxy at high speed. The shape depends, in a complex way, on the relative strengths of the magnetic fields inside and outside of the heliosphere, and the latest measurements are suggestive of a more spherical form. There are limits to how much can be gleaned from two data points, however. “It’s kind of like looking at an elephant with a microscope,” Kurth said. “Two people go up to an elephant with a microscope, and they come up with two different measurements. You have no idea what’s going on in between.” From beyond the heliosphere, the signal from Voyager 2 is still beaming back, taking more than 16 hours to reach Earth. Its 22.4-watt transmitter has a power equivalent to a fridge light, which is more than a billion billion times dimmer by the time it reaches Earth and is picked up by Nasa’s largest antenna, a 70-metre dish. The two Voyager probes, powered by steadily decaying plutonium, are projected to drop below critical energy levels in the mid-2020s. But they will continue on their trajectories long after they fall silent. “The two Voyagers will outlast Earth,” said Kurth. “They’re in their own orbits around the galaxy for 5bn years or longer. And the probability of them running into anything is almost zero.”"

But the thousands of women who gathered in the waters of Delhi’s Yamuna River on the city’s most polluted day in three years, to mark the ancient Hindu festival of Chhath Puja, instead had to immerse themselves in the thick toxic waste, while inhaling air so thick with smog that it went off the pollution charts. Sunita Devi, 42, was among those who offered prayers as she stood in the toxic foam of the Yamuna, so thick and frothy from industrial and domestic pollution it made the water resemble a putrid bubble bath. The irony that this was a ritual meant to give thanks to the sun god for sustaining life on earth was not lost on her. “I stood for an hour in the water to offer prayers but it was very oily, dirty and had a bad smell,” said Devi. “According to the ritual we are supposed to bathe in the water but I could not bring myself to do it fully, though my friends took a full dip even with the smell. My legs were itching after a while and I had to go home and take a bath.” Living in the world’s most polluted city has taken a toll on almost every one of its 20 million citizens, especially since the Hindu festival of Diwali, which prompted a severe deterioration in air quality. As the air pollution levels reached catastrophic levels – almost 10 times above the healthy limit on the weekend – a public health emergency was declared and has remained in place for the past five days. The streets have emptied, schools remained closed and many did not go into work on Monday morning as the air quality index remained stubbornly in the category of “severe”. Monday also saw the temporary introduction of a scheme, which ran previously in 2016, where cars with odd and even number plates can only drive on alternate days, which authorities say will take 1.2m cars off Delhi’s roads each day. However, most in the city were highly sceptical about the plan, which will only be in place for two weeks. “They did this scheme twice before and it is pointless,” said Amit, a driver. “I am not supposed to be taking my car out today but I am just taking the back roads and short cuts to avoid the traffic officers. All the other drivers I know are doing the same. Yes pollution is a terrible problem, I have had an awful chest infection for the past two days because of it, but this temporary scheme is not going to change anything. We need real action from the government.” The sentiment was exemplified by politician Vijay Goel, senior leader of the ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), who chose to defy the rules and took his car with an odd number plate out for a drive. In a city such as Delhi, where poverty and homelessness is rife and millions make their living on the sides of the roads, not all had the option of taking shelter in homes or driving cars equipped with air purifiers. At his stall selling chickpeas on the roadside of Kamla Nagar, north Delhi, Dinesh Raj said both his health and his business was suffering. “I generally earn around 400 to 500 rupees per day but after the bad pollution I have only sold three plates and it’s already lunchtime,” Raj said, rubbing his eyes which he complained were burning. “People are not coming out of their houses anymore, only those like me who cannot afford to stay indoors are here. And even though I cover it up, people are afraid to eat my food because they think the bad air is affecting it. If the government doesn’t do something to clean up the air, I am going to have to go back to my village in Bihar.” The lacklustre and uncoordinated response to the crisis from both the federal government and state governments of Delhi, and neighbouring Punjab and Haryana where the burning of the crop stubble has been a key contributor to Delhi’s thick toxic smog, has been a source of infuriation and anger for the city’s residents. Navdha Malhotra, campaigns director for Purpose, a social impact agency who run a mobilisation campaign called Help Delhi Breathe, spoke of her anger that the state governments were “all passing the buck and blaming each other while we have to live in this disgusting layer of smog.” “As a citizen of Delhi who has lived here all my life, this is absolutely disgraceful,” she said. “The Delhi government is very progressive in terms of policies on paper but there is zero implementation and no political will on this issue. People are angry and mobilising, particularly parents who now feel like they can’t let their children go outside, but overall civic action here is also pretty disgraceful. I have seen citizens in Delhi bursting firecrackers while wearing masks.” As Delhi residents woke on the weekend to smog so brown and thick that it was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead, India’s health minister Harsh Vardhan tweeted that a good solution to offsetting its harmful impact was to eat carrots. Sunil Bharala, minister for the state of Utter Pradesh, meanwhile, defended the practice of crop burning by farmers, declaring it a “natural system”. While Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been publicly candid about the problem, calling the current pollution crisis unbearable, he has also been criticised for passing the blame for the problem on to adjacent states. While firecrackers were banned and construction has been halted in Delhi since the state of emergency was declared on Friday, in reality these rules have barely been enforced. On Monday, the supreme court judges slammed all responsible authorities for failing to tackle pollution in the capital, saying that people had been “left to die”. “No one is safe even inside homes. It is atrocious,” the judges added. Malhotra condemned the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) for allowing a match against Bangladesh to go ahead in Delhi when the pollution levels were off the charts. “We should not be normalising these conditions by doing things like hosting a cricket match,” she said. “It is deathly, and when pollution gets that bad, the whole city should be shutting down. Only then will politicians take this seriously.” An indication of both the increasing obvious severity of the pollution, but also increased public awareness about its harmful impact on health, has been masks, which are now visible on the faces of people all over the streets of Delhi. In a mark of the growing public anger in some quarters, a citizens protest is also planned at Indian Gate on Tuesday evening to decry the lack of action by authorities. But for many there has been no hiding from the thick poisonous smog. Kushal Malik, a Delhi traffic police officer, had spent the past 12 hours on duty on one of city’s busiest and most polluted roads, with no choice but to inhale the fumes. “I have constant throat irritation, headache and a burning sensation in my eyes,” he said. “The government has provided us with masks but they are not effective for pollution levels this bad. It is not good enough.” Additional reporting by Kakoli Bhattacharya"

          "headline": "Italy's plastic tax plan under threat after industry outcry",
          "bodyText": "The Italian government could be forced to change its plans for a tax on plastic packaging after coming under pressure from producers. The measure, which is intended to combat plastic pollution while raising more than €1bn (£860m) in revenues, has divided the fragile coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the Democratic party (PD). The tax, included in the draft budget for 2020, would require companies to pay a €1 levy on each kilogram of plastic produced, including bottles, polyethylene bags and trays, detergent containers, bubble wrap, packaging for household appliances and product labels. The measure would also provide incentives to firms that produce biodegradable materials. As the budget begins its passage through parliament, however, the proposal has irked one of Italy’s most dynamic industries. It also faces opposition from Italia Viva, the centrist party recently established by the former prime minister Matteo Renzi, who described the tax as “a blow to the middle-class”. Renzi left the PD to form Italia Viva, but the party is still part of the ruling coalition. Confindustria, the confederation of Italian industry, argues that the levy risks harming a sector that brings in a turnover of around €40bn a year and employs 150,000 people. “The measure penalises products, not behaviour, and only represents a way to recover resources, while placing huge costs on consumers, workers and businesses,” Confindustria said in a statement, adding that companies already contributed €450m a year toward the collection and recycling of plastic packaging. Paolo Lamberti, the president of Federchimica, the association that represents the chemicals industry, said the tax did not consider “the disastrous impact on all firms” while several consumer organisations argue it would add about 10% to product prices. Roberto Gualtieri, the finance minister, moved to appease the critics on Sunday, saying the measure could be modified to reduce the impact on the plastics industry. “But we must reduce the use of single-use plastic,” he said. “We can’t applaud the children who campaign for a better environment and then not take action. A measure against single-use plastic is correct and must be reshaped well.” Luigi Di Maio, whose M5S party has long prioritised the environment in its campaigning, said the debate over the tax was “surreal”. “After so many years of talking about the impact that plastic has on our seas, Italy has decided to move quickly toward changing its production system,” he said. “But today the debate is about whether to begin doing that, or not to lose votes. I say that politicians look towards the next elections while statesmen look towards the next generation.” A report published in October by the Italian Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (Ispra) revealed that more than 500,000 tonnes of plastic waste end up in the Mediterranean each year. The next electoral challenge, especially for the Democratic party, comes in January in Emilia-Romagna, a leftwing stronghold that hosts the biggest concentration of plastics manufacturers. The party’s leader, Nicola Zingaretti, has not commented on the issue but Stefano Bonaccini, the PD’s regional president who will compete for a second mandate against an increasingly popular centre-right coalition, said: “An ecological turnaround is absolutely necessary, but it must not affect businesses and work.”"

          "bodyText": "Our skin tends to get drier in the winter, not only because of the cooler air, but also because of central heating, which can cause conditions such as eczema to flare up. Consider turning the thermostat to a lower temperature: 16C-18C is best. If you can, invest in a humidifier, which puts moisture back into the air. Moisturiser is especially important in winter, so use a richer product than in other seasons – and don’t forget your hands. Your lips will benefit from balm. It is also important to minimise exposure to agents that strip the skin of its natural oils. Water – especially hot water – dries the skin, so make sure you’re using warm or lukewarm water for baths and showers, as well as washing your hands and doing the dishes. Sweating also dries and irritates the skin, so after strenuous exercise change into something clean and dry as soon as you can. Steer clear of alcohol-based skincare products such as cleansers and toners. Try also to avoid bubble bath and opt instead for bath oils. Dr Anton Alexandroff of the British Association of Dermatologists was speaking to Lucy Campbell"

          "bodyText": "My grandmother used to fry eggs for me as a boy when she was on visits from southern Italy during winter months – always with a piece of cheese and some chilli that she brought in her suitcase. I have taken her lead here using them on a golden cabbage pancake that I know she’d enjoy. Although I am sure that she would add some spicy sausage that would be also lurking around the bottom of her case. In the cold, I need comforting and these dishes will do this with warming ginger and a touch of acidity. When I asked my chef colleagues what they were looking forward to this autumn, the answer came back: “Eating all sorts of orange food while wearing a jumper.” The vongole surrounded by pumpkin pillars with fregola soaking everything up fits the bill. And if by the end of this you’re not feeling suitably cosy there is apple pie. Savoy pancakes All of the joy I associate with bubble and squeak, but with a dustily Italian accent. Serves 4 potatoes 150g, peeled savoy cabbage 200g plain flour 90g polenta flour 60g bicarbonate of soda a pinch eggs 2 buttermilk 300g salt and pepper olive oil eggs 4 cheese strong and hard dried chilli 1, crushed Boil and roughly mash the potatoes. Shred the cabbage and then boil it for 5 minutes. Drain it thoroughly. Mix the flours and baking soda together. Beat the buttermilk and eggs together with 1 tbsp of olive oil. Into this, mix the flour, 2 good pinches of salt, a grind of pepper and finally the vegetables. Set aside to rest a moment. When you are ready to eat, fry a ladle of batter in a heavy-bottomed pan in 1 tbsp of olive oil over a medium heat. Do this one ladleful at a time. Then, fry eggs in more olive oil over a medium heat, seasoned and topped with two shards of strong cheese and a pinch of chilli. Serve the pancakes, warmed in the oven if necessary, with the eggs on the top. Pumpkin, fregola, vongole and ginger Baking everything together gives this dish unity. One to serve on the table directly from the pan. Serves 4 clams 200g pumpkin 1, medium olive oil fregola 360g garlic 1 clove parsley a few sprigs ginger 1 piece dried chilli flakes pinch butter a knob white wine two capfuls pecorino 2 tbsp, grated Heat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Bring a large pot of salted water to the boil Clean the clams. Peel the pumpkin and cut it into pieces, roughly 3cm cubed. Heat a large pan or skillet that can go in the oven. Coat the pumpkin cubes with a little olive oil and salt and roast in the oven for 10 minutes. During this time boil the fregola. Chop the garlic. Chop the parsley. Peel and grate the ginger. Then drain the fregola. Remove the pumpkin from the oven, turn the cubes over. Add the garlic, parsley, ginger, chilli, clams and fregola, and stir thoroughly. Place the butter in the middle, pour over the wine and scatter the cheese. Return to the oven for 15 minutes, or until all the clams open. Serve at once. Marinated steamed aubergines Steaming aubergines until they are almost translucent changes their texture. Dress when warm, but eat once they have cooled to be most delicious. Serves 4 aubergines 1 or 2 (about 750g total) ginger 2in, peeled (about 25g) garlic ½ a clove sea salt dried chilli 1, crushed oregano leaves 1 tbsp, dried or fresh vinegar 3 tbsp tomato 1, finely chopped (about 150g) mint ½ bunch olive oil Bring a deep pan of water to the boil, choose one that will accommodate a steamer on top. Cut the aubergine in half then into 2cm slices. Sit them in the steamer above the water for 15 minutes, while you make the marinade. Grate the peeled ginger and the garlic into a bowl. Season with salt, chilli, oregano, vinegar. Add the tomato. Set the aubergines into this while still warm, dressing with chopped mint and some olive oil, and allow to cool together. Eat within a few days. Apple pie This indulgent pastry is super light and prefers a light touch to an electric mixer. Eat it with the ice cream recipe that follows. Serves 4 00 flour 200g baking powder 1 tsp golden caster sugar 85g salt pinch butter 200g, softened mascarpone 200g apples 4 lemon juice of ½ demerara sugar 2 tbsp To make the pastry, first mix the flour, baking powder, caster sugar and salt together. In a large bowl with a fork or wooden spoon, mix the mascarpone and butter together until absolutely amalgamated, but not whipped. Mix in the flour and continue to combine with a spoon and eventually your hands. Do not overwork the dough, but wrap it in baking paper as soon as it is a homogenous thing. Allow it to rest for at least half an hour in the fridge. Peel the apples and roughly cut them into small pieces. Squeeze over the lemon juice and sprinkle with 1 tbsp of demerara sugar. Heat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3. Squeeze the dough between your fingertips, then press two thirds of it directly into a 15cm tart case. Take care to join the pieces together so there are no gaps. Fill with the apple and top with the rest of the dough, pressed slightly thinner. Gaps are more than acceptable. Sprinkle with the last spoon of sugar and bake for 45 minutes. Coconut ice cream Inspired by a trip to a Dorset ice cream parlour, neither the coconut nor the lime dominate, but act as brothers-in-arms. Serves 6 coconut chips 50g double cream 300ml coconut milk 400ml limes 2, unwaxed egg yolks 5 golden caster sugar 130g Toast the coconut chips in a pot for a few minutes over a medium heat until fragrant and browned around the edges. Add this to the cream, coconut milk and the zest from the limes. Bring gently to a simmer. Whisk the yolks with the sugar. Pour two ladles of the hot milk mix over the eggs, whisking to loosen, and then whisk this into the rest of the milk. Continue to cook, stirring all the time, until the custard is thickened. About 4 minutes. Transfer to a bowl, still stirring, and once cool, into the fridge, preferably overnight. Sieve and add the juice of one of the limes before churning according to the instructions of your ice cream machine if you have one. If not, freeze in a metal bowl, removing after 40 minutes then beat with a fork. Return to the freezer and repeat 40 minutes later, twice more. Joe Trivelli is co-head chef at the River Café"

          "headline": "Parents take legal action over pupils labelled as truants",
          "bodyText": "Families with children who are labelled “school refusers” are planning to take legal action against the government to challenge rules on truancy that allow them to be fined and prosecuted. A group of parents, working with lawyers, wants a judicial review of the school attendance regulations that label their children as “truants”. The families say the severe anxiety that their children suffer from should be treated as a mental health issue, not an attendance one. In many cases, the pupils have underlying conditions, such as autism or attention disorders, which are not being properly supported because of cuts to special educational needs and disability (Send) budgets in schools and councils. A damning report published last week by the cross-party education select committee concluded that the government’s Send reforms were failing children and “setting local authorities up to fail”. The problem is compounded by the crisis in mental health provision. Pupils with “school phobia” cannot obtain the medical evidence they need to be classed on registers as an authorised absence rather than a truant. Using money raised through crowdfunding platform CrowdJustice, and with legal aid, the families are looking to mount a legal challenge against the Department for Education’s absence codes and guidance, which they claim discriminate against those with school attendance difficulties. Nationally 783,425 pupils were classed as persistent absentees in 2017-18, with 325,685 of all pupil absences recorded as “more than 25 days”. Local authorities issued 260,000 penalty notices to parents for unauthorised absences in 2017-18, an increase of 110,000 on the previous year. Not Fine In School (NFIS), an organisation that supports families with school attendance difficulties, has 8,200 members on its closed Facebook group, with an average of 24 new members joining daily since September. Beth Bodycote, founder of NFIS, said: “We have nearly 5,000 members posting on a daily basis. Their distressing stories repeatedly illustrate the lack of appropriate understanding and support for attendance difficulties.” Colette Reid, 48, a social worker from near Manchester whose 14-year-old son James developed anxiety about going to school, said she has been though a nightmare over the issue. The teenager has an autism and ADHD diagnosis but started mainstream secondary school with no education, health and care (EHC) plan, a document that outlines the provision that must be in place to help a pupil, meaning he had no extra support in class or at break times. As James’s school phobia developed, his absences were recorded as truancy and, according to his mother, teachers blamed her for his failure to attend. Despite trying to get support in place and explaining her son’s anxiety to teachers and council staff, his mother was fined £60 and then prosecuted . But after representing herself in court, she was given an absolute discharge by magistrates who said they “appreciated how difficult it must be raising a child like James”. “When I came out of court, I burst in to tears because it was the first time anyone official seemed to understand. James is high functioning and didn’t cause any trouble in class so the school couldn’t see a problem,” said Reid. “But he said he felt like he was ‘in a bubble’ in class and his distress manifested itself at home in extreme episodes where he was out of control. He just could not cope with the big classes, noise and confusion of mainstream school.” James is now being home schooled but attends a part-time college foundation learning course. He is in a class of 10, with a teacher and two assistants. “He’ll go because it is totally different to school,” said Reid. “I was constantly told I wasn’t doing my job as a parent but unless those people live with a child with school refusal, they’ll never understand how tough it is.” Fran Morgan, founder of Square Peg, one of the organisations involved in bringing the legal action, said: “The term ‘school refuser’ is controversial as these are children who want to attend school but are unable to do so for reasons outside their control. “School special needs budgets have been slashed and cuts mean support staff are no longer there, waiting lists for access to the child and adolescent mental health service are unacceptably long, and the thresholds to qualify for any kind of help are unacceptably high. At the same time, academic pressure is being piled on pupils. It is a perfect storm and a lot of children can’t cope.” Polly Sweeney, a partner at Irwin Mitchell solicitors which is acting for the parents, said the issue affected thousands of children and their families across the country. “We are disappointed that the Department for Education has not responded to the organisations’ request to meet and discuss their concerns,” she said: “As a result of the lack of progress, we have now been instructed by a number of families of vulnerable children with school attendance difficulties, to advise them on a judicial review of the current system as they now consider that legal action is the only solution to addressing the issues they are facing.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “No child should be taken out of school without good reason. “The advice to schools is clear; they should authorise absences due to illness related to both physical and mental health.”"

          "bodyText": "The way to make a horror film scary is to keep the monster hidden, and this is how I’ve started to feel about my brain. Since I was a teenager my migraines have begun in the same way, with a white mark on my vision, as if I’ve looked too long at the sun. The mark grows until I can barely see, and then the headache comes, and then, well. In June, I woke with the familiar blind spot, but that afternoon it hadn’t changed, nor had it disappeared a week later, or a month. Eventually I had an MRI. Before I sailed into the space tube, I chose the Beach Boys to play through the headphones; as I closed my eyes to avoid the claustrophobia, the opening notes of In My Room, the sound of an ancient broadband connection just behind it. The next day I got a call from the neurologist. Rather than a migraine, he said, with unfamiliar graveness, I’d had a series of mini-strokes. It’s odd to be shown evidence that something’s wrong with you when everything feels alright. The feeling reminded me of a similar unlikeliness five years ago – when all evidence said I was pregnant, but until the child actually arrived in blood and drama, the diagnosis remained to me a kindly theory. This time the oddness is a different shape to that growing bump – ghostly, unclear. I’m writing this with one eye shut, as the blind spot remains, revealed now to be where the blood vessel to the eye has been permanently damaged. I am seeing the scar of a stroke, its stain. If I concentrate I can make out its shape, a weary dribbling moose. In that first phone call I asked the doctor, if I hadn’t realised I’d had these strokes, how would I know if I was having another? Well, he said, you might feel… and then he calmly reeled off a list of symptoms – lightheadedness, headaches, dizziness, confusion – which all described the details of my daily life and many of the traits that keep me adorable. So my day to day has become a BBC drama, where every episode is weighted with the possibility of murder, but there is no body. And though the soaring shots of cliffs and sea appear ominous, it’s just landscape and weather – if you turn the colour up it could be a postcard from the past, and if you hadn’t read the preview in the paper, you wouldn’t know there was any death at all. My cliffhangers are the weekly hospital tests to discover why something like this is happening to someone like me, in order to prevent another stroke that might be less mini, and each one comes with its own kindly doctor and a new understanding of a part of my body I’d taken for granted. My heart, for example, which I’ve mainly relied upon for beating and love, has gathered sinister new significance. In a dark room a cardiologist spoons me and, together in a kind of romance, we watch his screen to see if the organ contains holes. My brain, until now a benign and useful friend, a mate, feels like a slinking presence. It delivered the blind spot like a ransom note in the post, a threat and a reminder of the power it wields. What could it turn off next? My ability to smell urine from a hundred paces? My preference for a dark chocolate biscuit? A pain that will change me? It’s difficult to work out how to process this news, both for me and my friends. It’s bad, isn’t it, but not BAD bad. It’s like I’ve been shot, but somewhere silly, like in the earlobe or little toe. It would be easier for them if there was an obvious wound, a cast they could sign. It would be easier if it was something that was happening today, present tense, rather than something that has happened, past, only choosing to reveal itself now. It would be easier if I… felt something. I have headaches, but I always have headaches. I am tired, but I’m always tired. Yet suddenly I am being treated the way I was born to be treated – my boyfriend delivers a dressing gown to me on the stroke of seven, putting a cool hand on my head. At a recent hospital appointment he lifted me on to the bed when I fainted, and later at my request did an impression of the way my face went just before. As I approach the end of my 30s, I find my final vice is extreme sympathy. My questions about what happens next are less technical more existential, as I consider a future of never quite knowing. Like a parent that moves their family out of the city after bingeing on stories of stabbings, am I destined for a bubble-like life, where every headache sends me spiralling into the internet? As someone who has always been careful to recognise, for fear of falling into those ancient holes of diets and regret, that we should live peacefully inside our changing bodies, I am now struck daily by the disconnect. Between what my brain tells me and what it really means. Between what I see and what I can’t, and between the way I feel and the way I am.

          "bodyText": "“Don’t be evil” was the mantra of the co-founders of Google, Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the graduate students who, in the late 1990s, had invented a groundbreaking way of searching the web. At the time, one of the things the duo believed to be evil was advertising. There’s no reason to doubt their initial sincerity on this matter, but when the slogan was included in the prospectus for their company’s flotation in 2004 one began to wonder what they were smoking. Were they really naive enough to believe that one could run a public company on a policy of ethical purity? The problem was that purity requires a business model to support it and in 2000 the venture capitalists who had invested in Google pointed out to the boys that they didn’t have one. So they invented a model that involved harvesting users’ data to enable targeted advertising. And in the four years between that capitulation to reality and the flotation, Google’s revenues increased by nearly 3,590%. That kind of money talks. Rana Foroohar has adopted the Google mantra as the title for her masterful critique of the tech giants that now dominate our world. It’s an apt choice because it captures one of the leitmotifs in the story of how these corporations came into being and grew to their current monstrous proportions, a journey that takes them from naive (and sometimes libertarian) beginnings to ruthless monopolistic dominance. The great thing about her book is that it breaks the mesmerising spell that the tech giants seem to have cast upon governments, mass media and users everywhere. The beginning of wisdom in this matter is to realise that Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Microsoft, Uber et al are just very large corporations that do what corporations have done from time immemorial – exploit resources in order to generate profit. The only differences between them and the corporate giants of old are the nature of the resources they have appropriated and the grotesque profit margins that they obtain. Foroohar is well qualified to tackle them. Her day job is that of the Financial Times’s global business correspondent, so she occupies an influential perch. But she has also, in her time, worked on the fringes of the tech industry during the first internet bubble, the one that burst in 2000. So she’s seen the dynamics of tech exuberance from the inside. Basically, though, she comes across as a level-headed, informed and well-connected journalist: most people in the industry return her calls, even if they make sure to have a PR adviser listening in. Which is prudent, since Foroohar combines a polite manner with a high-powered crap-detector. She even emerged sane after spending several days in the company of Travis Kalanick, the founder of Uber and a character whom James Joyce would have described as “a caution to rattlesnakes”. The overarching theme of Don’t Be Evil is “how big tech betrayed its founding principles”. This is a variation on a popular theme: how the people who founded these powerful corporations were basically high-IQ innocents who had their innocence and idealism knocked out of them by the exigencies of running capitalist organisations. The “don’t be evil” mantra is one example. Another is Mark Zuckerberg’s tropes about “connecting the world” and creating “communities”. Another is Steve Jobsʼs metaphor of the personal computer as “a bicycle for the mind”. And of course there’s the pervasive mysticism about using technology “to change the world”. At no point in these vapourings does one ever find crude intentions of becoming insanely rich. There is another way of reading this story, though. It is about the essential sociopathy of corporations, even those run by well-intentioned human beings. The reason some of the tech companies got such an easy ride in the public imagination is that their founders were not middle-aged bastards in homburg hats – think John D Rockefeller and JP Morgan – but young geeks in hoodies. Yet these same geeks supervised the growth of corporations that are as ruthless and socially irresponsible as Standard Oil was. Which means that we now find ourselves faced with the same problem as faced the United States in the early 1900s: how to bring these behemoths under democratic control. And one of the most useful things about this book is that it does not fall into the trap of regarding all the tech giants as being the same. They’re not and discriminating between them will be the key to regulating them. The business model of Facebook and Google, for example, is radically different from those of Apple or Microsoft. And Amazon is a case apart. The most startling thought that emerges from Don’t Be Evil, though, is that big tech may have already become “too big to fail” because the companies have become systemically critical to our economies – for reasons that have little to do with technology. The risk comes from the colossal “cash” reserves that they have parked abroad in best tax-avoidance manner. Foroohar says that more than half of those stashes are denominated not in dollars, but in corporate bonds. And if anything should happen to the value of those, then it might be 2008 all over again, but without a safety net. So much for not being evil. • Don't Be Evil by Rana Foroohar is published by Allen Lane (£20). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.

          "bodyText": "“They push me against the wall, hands on my head. They frisk me, recriminating me in a language I don’t understand. Something’s happening, but I don’t know what. Before I know it, it’s happening. I respond to their threats by shouting: ‘Please, help, please!’” So begins Togo, a book in which fear is a recurring theme. Written by Óscar de Marcos, it tells the story of the journeys that shaped him, the chapters alternating between his arrival in Africa and at Athletic Club Bilbao. In the book De Marcos says his parents wanted him to be happy, seeing football as a means of education. But players, he writes, become vain and fall fast, pressure bringing a realisation that you are alone. He explains how Togo “tore away that bubble, that nonsense, that fame, in one go”. The opening scene is just a moment but also a metaphor. “When I read the [first draft of the] book back, I thought ‘it’s too much’,” he admits. “I wasn’t planning to open up like that.” He was not planning to write a book at all. But, having first said no, De Marcos gave in. There is nothing unusual about a footballer writing a book but this is a little different. There is no contract and no money made. “They’re friends, they’ve been working with us 10 years; it’s hard to say no,” De Marcos says. “They” means José Mari Isasi, from Athletic’s communications department, and Galder Reguera, cultural director at the club’s foundation, which this week published two books: Togo by De Marcos and the Basque-language Bizitzu Eskukadaka by Ainhoa Tirpau, goalkeeper and captain of the women’s team. Thirteen thousand copies will be distributed to schools and local clubs as well as being available, for free, in the club store and bookshops. Athletic have commissioned and published 10 books before – from authors including David Trueba and David Safier, who read his from the centre spot at San Mamés – but this is the first time players have written them. They have read them, though. De Marcos and Tirpau’s books have been published as part of Athletic’s annual Fútbol y Letras (football and letters) literature festival. Run by Reguera, author of a wonderful book about how father-son relationships are forged through football, the festival is now in its 10th year, championing the link between culture and sport. It has drawn authors such as Jorge Valdano, Philip Kerr and Eduardo Galeano. As part of that programme Athletic set up the Athletic Reading Club, where supporters recommend books from which a selection is made. In the first year the president, manager and captain volunteered to read and report back on chosen texts. Every year since, players have taken part, reading books, discussing them and making recommendations of their own. Ernesto Valverde, the Barcelona manager, put forward Ronnie Reng’s A Life Too Short, about the suicide in 2009 of the Hannover goalkeeper Robert Enke, and Edward Bunker’s memoirs, Education of a Felon. Xabi Etxeita, whose dad died when he was young, read Hector Facionlince’s Oblivion, about his father’s murder by Colombian paramilitaries. The former Liverpool defender Mikel San José read Andre Agassi’s Open, a book that is full of lessons about the dangers of élite sport, with parents of the club’s youth-teamers. Then there is the film festival, Thinking Football. Almost 100 films have been screened over seven years, often with a marked social or political dimension, although De Marcos describes projects like these, like his, as “human”. Perhaps the most “local” club there is also includes an international aspect. British films have been successful – the Dalglish film Kenny won last year, like Next Goal Wins and The Pass before – with recent screenings including 89, about Arsenal’s title win, Kaiser! and I Believe in Miracles, about Brian Clough at Nottingham Forest, with directors, actors and protagonists invited and players: Ossie Ardíles, Ledley King, Lee Dixon. It is a shame no one recorded John Robertson’s catalogue of jokes when he came. For the past six years Athletic have also worked with Real Sociedad, staging a bertso derbia before each derby – a kind of competitive, improvised traditional Basque street poetry between “teams” representing the clubs. Then, come kick-off, the identity remains. Seventeen of the 22 starters this season were Basque. The Basque Country makes up 1.4% of Spain’s territory, 4.9% of its population and 20% of its top-flight football teams: Alavés, Eibar, Real Sociedad and Athletic. Include Osasuna (the name is Basque) and Navarre (some consider it one of seven historic Basque provinces) and it has a quarter of first division teams. All five have Basque managers. Athletic famously have only Basque players – and have never been relegated. Here talk of values does not sound empty. They call San Mamés the Cathedral; go and you may understand why. No, they are not the only club who have a foundation or who run social projects or champion literacy crusades. But events such as this reinforce that personality, reflected in the way they choose to express their identity. In part that is because trophies cannot – a growing predicament in the super-club era. There must be something other than success, some other measurement of it. “They think about more than winning games,” says the American coach Bob Bradley, who introduced American Pharaoh at the festival. There must be something, full stop. So there is: themselves. Yet it goes beyond that, to something more universal, to ideals celebrated in others too. Athletic set up the One Club Man/Woman award, designed to celebrate loyalty, which has been awarded to Billy McNeil and Malin Mostrom (2019), Carles Puyol (2018), Sepp Maier (2017) and Paolo Maldini (2016). T-shirts echo a line from the first winner, Matt Le Tissier: It’s a challenge to play for a big club, but it’s a bigger challenge to play against them and beat them. Most of the time, you will not beat them but there are other ways to win. There is something beyond the ball, expressed through culture and belonging. Sport is something to be shared, communicated: on film, in books, verbally. “The relationship between club and culture is unique,” said David Stewart, the director of 89. “It’s an important lesson for clubs around the world. If you were designing a football club, this would be a fantastic model.” As Óscar de Marcos says: “Athletic wouldn’t be Athletic without this.” In Togo he describes discovering who he is one day in Africa. In it he connects this moment’s realisation to the club where he had just begun and where he still plays a decade on, for whom he has now written a book. “It’s like Athletic,” he writes, “which without identity is nothing.”"

          "bodyText": "Brexit supporters expect “the elite”, “the establishment”, “the Westminster bubble” to “rig the system” to stop them “taking our country back”. The enemy imposed metric measurements, drink-driving laws, immigrants and smoking bans and now it wants to stop Brexit. They take us for fools. They think we are stupid. And yet their actions show that cynics who doubt everything trust Nigel Farage, even though he takes them for absolute idiots. It was an education to watch him make his offer of a Leave alliance to Boris Johnson on Friday. Farage’s warm-up acts played all the old tunes. Richard Tice, a property investor who has the well-cut suits and fading good looks of the type of charmer who cons widows out of their savings, said the Tories lived in the “stinking rotten borough of Westminster”. Claire Fox, who, satisfyingly, looks as malicious in the flesh as you would expect a member of the Revolutionary Communist party who ended up on the hard right via a spell denying the massacre of Bosnia’s Muslims to look, followed up. The Tories were among the elitists, scoffing behind their manicured hands and calling Brexiters “xenophobes, ignorant and far right”. Ann Widdecombe came next. I won’t pretend to understand all, or most, of what she said. But her drift was that the Tories were a pack of liars who would betray Brexit and all who believed in it. Farage then strode to the stage like a televangelist to the pulpit. He posed as the last honest politician in England. Unless Johnson agreed to ditch his deal with the EU, he would run Brexit party candidates against the Conservatives in every seat. Liberals were ecstatic. As Johnson cannot agree to destroy his own settlement, Remainers were relieved. The pro-Remain campaign group Best for Britain estimates that an unspoken agreement between the Brexit and Conservative parties could deliver Johnson a comfortable majority. Now Agent Farage, the Remainer mole, was sabotaging the Tories’ chances and with them the chances of Brexit. Yet for a supposedly iron man, Farage sounded remarkably flexible. He praised Johnson’s energy and sympathised with his difficulties. He emphasised that he had until mid-November to decide where to run candidates and would almost certainly not run them against the Tory right. “This is a ferret searching for a hole to reverse down,” I thought. The election campaign has achieved what many thought impossible and lowered the standards of public debate. Johnson does not have a “deal” with the EU, merely a withdrawal agreement. Every circle of hell remains available for Britain if his Brexit passes, including a few the devil himself has yet to discover. Farage could spin a quiet rapprochement with Johnson a dozen different ways. We remain in the single market and customs union until December 2020. Johnson hopes to negotiate a trade agreement by then. But trade deals take years to complete. Farage and the Tory right could tell their followers we could crash out in December or in June, when we would have to ask for an extension to the transition period to keep the negotiations going. Farage could say he would stand down candidates to stop Corbyn. He could say that he had discovered a “Canada-style trade deal” is possible and rely on the fact that the majority of people do not know what a Canada deal is or why the EU would demand harsher terms from Britain than it demands of a country thousands of miles away. Compromise would betray Brexit purists. But Farage and Johnson are already betraying them. Both say they expect to win in south Wales, the north of England and Midlands, the very areas whose manufacturing industries would be hardest hit by pulling us out of the single market. Then there is the revealing game Farage has played with Brexit party members, which shows how little he thinks of them. He persuaded at least 3,000 to apply to become parliamentary candidates and charged them £100 apiece for the privilege. Yet when the candidates were announced, there were many of the same faces from Farage’s Ukip days or Fox’s Revolutionary Communist turned Reactionary Chauvinist party. Otto English of the Byline Times, who covered the story, received private emails from working-class hopefuls who said they were told to campaign in byelections to “increase your chances of being selected”. When they got there, no one took their names. Straight afterwards, they received a “you have not been selected” mass email. Individuals have walked away from Farage. But his core stayed loyal, as the core of populist movements always does. For if there is any meaning in the vapid word, “populism” can be defined as the willingness of voters to be lied to. The louder they scream “all politicians are liars”, the harder they fall for the big lie from their chosen demagogue. Political scientists define devoted supporters of Farage, Trump and Corbyn as “low-trust” voters, who believe nothing they hear on the news. And yet they turn as trusting as children when their great leaders lead them on. In the case of Brexit, they are easy to lead and to fool. The divide in Brexit Britain is not based on class but on age and education: 70% of voters whose educational attainment was only GCSE or lower and 64% of over-65s voted to leave. I am not saying that having a degree ensures you are wise or even clever or that every pensioner is suffering from mental decline. But there are good reasons why pyramid sellers and faith healers prey on the uneducated and conmen target widows. If you want people to fleece, these are your best prospects. “Some ideas are so stupid that only intellectuals can believe them,” runs the old line. But the converse also applies. Some ideas are so stupid that only the uneducated can believe them – and Farage is proving that Brexit is top of the list. * Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"

          "bodyText": "Fathers are happier, less stressed and less tired than mothers, finds a study from the American Time Use Survey. Not unrelated, surely, is the regular report that mothers do more housework and childcare than fathers, even when both parents work full time. When the primary breadwinner is the mother versus the father, she also shoulders the mental load of family management, being three times more likely to handle and schedule their activities, appointments, holidays and gatherings, organise the family finances and take care of home maintenance, according to Slate, the US website. (Men, incidentally, are twice as likely as women to think household chores are divided equally.) In spite of their outsized contributions, full-time working mothers also feel more guilt than full-time working fathers about the negative impact on their children of working. One argument that is often used to explain the anxiety that working mothers experience is that it – and many other social ills – is the result of men and women not living “as nature intended”. This school of thought suggests that men are naturally the dominant ones, whereas women are naturally homemakers. But the patriarchy is not the “natural” human state. It is, though, very real, often a question of life or death. At least 126 million women and girls around the world are “missing” due to sex-selective abortions, infanticide or neglect, according to United Nations Population Fund figures. Women in some countries have so little power they are essentially infantilised, unable to travel, drive, even show their faces, without male permission. In Britain, with its equality legislation, two women are killed each week by a male partner, and the violence begins in girlhood: it was reported last month that one in 16 US girls was forced into their first experience of sex. The best-paid jobs are mainly held by men; the unpaid labour mainly falls to women. Globally, 82% of ministerial positions are held by men. Whole fields of expertise are predominantly male, such as physical sciences (and women garner less recognition for their contributions – they have received just 2.77% of the Nobel prizes for sciences). According to a variety of high-profile figures (mainly male, mainly psychologists), bolstered by professorships and no shortage of disciples, there are important biological reasons for why men and women have different roles and status in our society. Steven Pinker, for instance, has argued that men prefer to work with “things”, whereas women prefer to work with “people”. This, he said, explains why more women work in the (low-paid) charity and healthcare sector, rather than getting PhDs in science. According to Pinker, “The occupation that fits best with the ‘people’ end of the continuum is director of a community services organisation. The occupations that fit best with the ‘things’ end are physicist, chemist, mathematician, computer programmer, and biologist.” Others deny societal sexism even exists, insisting that the gender roles we see are based on cognitive differences – spoiler: men are more intelligent. “The people who hold that our culture is an oppressive patriarchy, they don’t want to admit that the current hierarchy might be predicated on competence,” Jordan Peterson has said, for instance. His reasoning suggests that women would be happier not railing against it but instead observing their traditional gender roles. Such theories have been demolished by a range of scholars, including neuroscientist Gina Rippon and psychologist Cordelia Fine. There are certainly biological differences between men and women, from their sexual anatomy to hormones. Yet even this isn’t as clear cut as it seems. For instance, around one in 50 people may be “intersex” with some sort of atypical chromosomal or hormonal feature – that’s about the same as the proportion of redheads. Men’s brains are on the whole slightly larger than women’s, and scans reveal some differences in the size and connectedness of specific brain regions, such as the hippocampus, in large samples of men and women. And yet, only a tiny percent (between 0 and 8%) of individual men and women turn out to have a typically “male” or “female” brain. Most people are somewhere in the middle, and whether someone has skills for maths, spatial awareness, leadership or any other gendered attribute can not be predicted from knowing their sex, as multiple studies have shown. Anatomically and cognitively, there are more differences within the two sexes than between them. There is no evidence that women are any less capable of the jobs and social positions that men predominantly hold. When women are given the opportunity to hold “male” roles, they show themselves to be equally proficient. Researchers recently calculated that it was bias against women, not under-representation, that accounts for the gender distribution seen in the Nobel prizes, for instance. Women are not less intelligent, less logical or less able than men. The roots of patriarchy, in other words, cannot be found in our biology. ¶ Male supremacy, for all its ubiquity, is surprisingly recent. There’s compelling evidence that patriarchal societies date back less than 10,000 years. Humans probably evolved as an egalitarian species and remained that way for hundreds of thousands of years. One clue is in the similar size of human males and females, which show the least disparity of all the apes, indicating that male dominance is not the driving force in our species. In fact, equality between the sexes in our early ancestry would have been evolutionarily beneficial. Parents who were invested in both girls and boys (and the grandchildren from both) gave our ancestors a survival advantage, because this fostered the critical wider-ranging social networks they depended on to exchange resources, genes and cultural knowledge. Today, hunter-gatherer societies remain remarkable for their gender equality, which is not to say women and men necessarily have the same roles, but there is not the gender-based power imbalance that is almost universal in other societies. In contemporary hunter-gatherer groups, such as the Hadza people of Tanzania, men and women contribute a similar number of calories, and both care for children. They also tend to have equal influence on where their group lives and who they live with. Matriarchal societies may also have been more common in our ancestral communities. Strong female relationships would have helped to glue a larger community together, and being able to rely on friends to babysit would have given our ancestors the time and energy to support the group through food provision and other activities. Indeed, there are several societies where matriarchy is the norm – I’ve visited some of them, including the cocoa farming Bribri people of Costa Rica, and the rice farming Minangkabau of Sumatra, Indonesia. These are communities in which women are the landowners and decision makers. In other words, humans are not genetically programmed for male dominance. It is no more “natural” for us to live in a patriarchy than in a matriarchy or, indeed an egalitarian society. In the same way, it is just as natural for humans to eat a “paleo” diet as it is to eat bubblegum-flavoured candyfloss; to have sex as a man and a woman or as three men; to live in a straw hut or in a glass bubble beneath the ocean. This is because, unlike other animals, we are cultural beings – for our species, culture is our nature, and key to understanding our behaviours and motivations. Social, technological and behavioural invention are part of our nature – part of what it means to be human. We are driven by culture more than instinct. And our culture influences our environment and our genes. Our extraordinarily flexible, cumulative culture allows us to make ourselves even as we attribute our successes and failings to our genes. That’s not to say that just because a cultural trait has emerged it is necessarily “good”. Patriarchal norms, for instance, are damaging to our health and our societies, increasing death and suffering, and limiting humanity’s creative potential. We are, though, neither slaves to our biology nor our social norms – even if it can feel that way. Human cultural conditioning begins at birth, indeed, social norms even have an impact before birth: one study found that when pregnant women were informed of the sex of the baby they were carrying, they described its movements differently. Women who learned they were carrying a girl typically described the movements as “quiet”, “very gentle, more rolling than kicking”; whereas those who knew they were carrying a boy described “very vigorous movements”, “kicks and punches”, “a saga of earthquakes”. Many of the ideas we consider universally held are simply the social norms in our own culture. Liberté, égalité, fraternité may be values worth dying for in France, for instance, but personal freedom is not considered important or desirable for other societies, which prioritise values such as purity instead. Consider the idea of responsibility. In my culture, if you deliberately hurt a person or their property this is considered a much worse crime than if you did it by accident, but in other cultures, children and adults are punished according to the outcome of their actions – intentionality is considered impossible to grasp and therefore largely irrelevant. The biological differences between males and females, or indeed between ethnic groups, tell us nothing about how intelligent, empathetic or successful a person is. Modern humans are 99.9% genetically identical. Although we have expanded far beyond our tropical evolutionary niche over tens of thousands of years, we have not speciated – we have not even diversified into different subspecies. Our ancestors have not needed to make dramatic biological adaptations to the very different environments we live in, because, instead, we culturally evolved and diversified into a complexity of differently adapted cultures, each with their own social norms. It is our cultural developing bath, not our genes, that profoundly changes the way we think, behave and perceive the world. Studies comparing the neural processing of populations of westerners and East Asians, for example, show that culture shapes how people look at faces (westerners triangulate their gaze over eyes and mouth, whereas East Asians centralise their focus). Language reveals our norms and shapes the way we think. Children who speak Hebrew, a strongly gendered language, know their own gender a year earlier than speakers of non-gendered Finnish. English speakers are better than Japanese speakers at remembering who or what caused an accident, such as breaking a vase. That’s because in English we say “Jimmy broke the vase”, whereas in Japanese, the agent of causality is rarely used; they will say: “The vase broke.” The structures that exist in our language profoundly shape how we construct reality – and it turns out that reality, and our human nature, differ dramatically depending on the language we speak. Our brains change and our cognition is rewired according to the cultural input we receive and respond to. Many of our social norms evolved because they improve survival, through group cohesion, for instance. But social norms can also be harmful. There is no scientific basis for the belief that a person’s skin colour or sex has any bearing on their character or intelligence. However, social norms can affect a person’s behaviour and their biology. Social norms that classify particular groups to the bottom of a social hierarchy encourage society to collude with that positioning and those people do worse in outcomes from wealth to health, strengthening the norm. A major study, by researchers at Berkeley, of 30,000 American shift workers found that black, Hispanic and other minority workers – particularly women – are much more likely to be assigned irregular schedules, and the harmful repercussions of this were felt not just by them but also by their children, who fared worse. The danger of ascribing genetic and biological bases for our actions is that individuals and groups are not given equal opportunities in life, and they suffer. It is, after all, very convenient to believe that the poor are feckless and undeserving, morally weak or stupid, rather than casualties of a deeply unfair systemic bias. Equally, it’s much more appealing to think of one’s own successes as down to some sort of innate personal brilliance rather than luck and social position. If we persist in the idea that there is a natural – a best – way to be a human, then we blind ourselves to the great diversity of potential ways of being, thinking and feeling, and impose social limitations on those whose life choices are no less legitimate than ours. It’s worth noting, though, that many norms that were once believed to be set in biological stone or ordained by gods have been changed by societies – sometimes remarkably quickly. If we invented it, we can alter it. An accepted “natural” state that has existed for millennia can be changed in mere months. • Transcendence: How Humans Evolved Through Fire, Language, Beauty, and Time by Gaia Vince is published by Allen Lane.

          "headline": "Labour MP Gloria De Piero urges women to change parliament",
          "bodyText": "Gloria De Piero, who is stepping down after nine years as a Labour MP, is urging women to “come into parliament and change it,” despite the proliferation of threats and abuse faced by many female MPs. One of 58 MPs who have announced that they will not be standing in the 12 December general election, De Piero, who represents Ashfield in Nottinghamshire, said she hoped women would not be deterred from entering frontline politics. “I would still say to anybody who wants to change the country - it does have strains and stresses, but I wouldn’t have not done this for the bloody world.” She added: “It’s not great at the moment: but come into parliament and change it. All that progress that we’ve made in getting women there: we can’t go back on that.” Several of the women who are stepping down from parliament, including the former Conservative Heidi Allen, have cited the toxic political debate in explaining their reasons for quitting Westminster. And the independent MP Anna Soubry has detailed a string of threats, most recently including a card posted through the door of her partner. De Piero said that she had taken security precautions, on the advice of the police and parliamentary authorities. “My mailbox is bombproof: there was a letterbox in my door, and it’s probably sensible that I don’t have that any more. I have an external mailbox, that’s bombproof. And I have good locks on my door, fitted by the parliamentary authorities. “I’ve got a panic button as well, in my house – but I’m OK,” she adds. She also doesn’t publicise in advance where she is going to be, in accordance with police advice – and admits she does feel nervous before going out door-knocking. “Before every one of my canvass sessions, because I’ve seen it on social media I think, ‘Oh God, am I going to be OK?’. Because I canvass a lot. But touch wood, it’s always been OK on the doorstep.” “I haven’t spoken to all these women, I’m sure there will be different reasons why they’re standing down,” she says. “It’s worth exploring that to find out. But at this stage, I still want to say to women out there – do this, you will never regret it.” And she points to the “great solidarity” among women MPs. “My female friends, Vicky Foxcroft, Stephanie Peacock, Louise Haigh - you will make friends in there that will support you through the tough times. Your women colleagues, you put your arms round each other, and you’re there for each other.” De Piero cites harrying the government into implementing equal pay audits as Ed Miliband’s shadow women’s minister – under legislation passed by Labour but set aside by the coalition – as an example of the difference even opposition MPs can make. “You can change the law,” she adds, pointing to the case of a woman constituent who had been a victim of domestic violence. “A woman came to see me about a year ago. She had some scars, she said ‘my husband is serving time for attempting to kill me, he is in prison, he is now entitled, as part of the divorce, to half the house’”. “I didn’t know that – and I went to see the minister, and nobody seemed to know it. So I’ve been working on amendments to the domestic violence bill to remove the automatic presumption of joint assets.” “I just hope my colleagues will continue that work when they come back. But it’s things like that: you can’t learn that from any book.” As a former broadcast journalist who grew up in a working-class family, De Piero says encounters like this have changed her political perspective dramatically. “You leave Bradford, you go to university, and you’re not conscious of this along the way, but you’re getting a bit more liberal. Then you go into the London media: and before you know it, you are pushing some very, very predictable lines. Which you think are original, but actually everybody in your bubble thinks those things. “And I just felt, when I came to do this job and I started knocking on doors in 2010 I was like, ‘shit, this conversation is totally different’. I thought the world had changed, on my little journey from Bradford to London, and it hadn’t: I had changed.” She warns there are still too few MPs from backgrounds like hers who make it to Westminster – or even consider it. “Speaking from the working class is as important as speaking for the working class. That’s why I have talked about my background: not because it is a badge of honour, obviously it is miserable to grow up in child poverty. I just think the more people know that there are people in there who weren’t born with a silver spoon in their mouth, the better.” She was one of the 19 Labour MPs who took the controversial decision to vote for Boris Johnson’s Brexit deal at its first parliamentary stage last month – hoping, she said at the time, to amend it: a process that was brought to a halt when the general election was called. That decision came from the feeling that voters in constituencies like hers should have their voices heard, she says – but she has been taken aback by the toxic tone of the debate, in Westminster, on social media, and in her inbox. “We get emails - saying that you’re a traitor. Because of course the weird thing is – and this is what illustrates the gulf over Brexit more than anything – is that up here they think I’m trying to stop Brexit. Down there, I go down and they think that I’m bloody Nigel Farage, some of my colleagues, to put it bluntly.” De Piero had always intended to step down after 10 years, she says – or as it has turned out, nine, all of them on the backbenches, and the last three dominated by Brexit. As she prepares to leave the House of Commons for the last time, she now wonders whether she did the right thing in not backing Theresa May’s deal. “What do I ever regret? Not voting for Theresa May’s deal? I think about it a lot.” May’s deal, unlike Johnson’s, would have underpinned EU standards on workers’ rights in law – and while it didn’t include a customs union, it needn’t have precluded a future government from negotiating one. “I’ll never know whether I did the right thing there, but I know I ask myself a lot,” she says."

          "headline": "'I'd get in my car and cry': the difficulty of breaking an opioid addiction",
          "bodyText": "“Last Christmas was my first not taking painkillers since I was 16,” said Katie Bedford, who has been a patient at the Bridge Project in Bradford for more than a year. “It was also the first I remembered.” For more than a decade, Bedford, 27, experienced memory loss as a result of an addiction to opioids that began when she was given morphine after surgery for suspected appendicitis in 2008. She is just one of hundreds of patients who have been seen by the cognitive behavioural therapist Michael Ritchie since the alcohol and drug charity began offering its services to people experiencing issues with the drugs five years ago. The medication’s ability to block both physical and mental pain means that in many instances, patients who develop addictions have “underlying emotional issues”, said Ritchie, and need tailored counselling as well as medical advice to withdraw. “They’re prescribed opioids for legitimate pain but it makes them feel better than they have in years,” he said. “They need more to get the same effect, so they start using more and more until their life revolves around their medication.” Sessions are weekly and one-on-one. After an initial meeting, if Ritchie thinks mental health issues are fuelling a patient’s addiction, he will provide counselling as well as advice to their doctor about how to safely taper them off the drugs. The service, which is mostly funded by Bradford council, is running at capacity – treating about 70 patients – although there is an “enormous demand”. The charity’s chief executive, Jon Royle, said providing treatment across five GP surgeries rather than at their city centre clinic was key to the Bridge Project’s popularity, because people “won’t come to addiction treatment centres”. “They have got this problem in primary care. They don’t want to be stigmatised as drug addicts,” he said. Proof of the method’s success is Bedford, who had become hooked on the co-codamol – a mixture of codeine and paracetamol – she was sent home with from hospital. The first hit made her feel like “the walls had turned pink and I was laid on bubble wrap”. She added: “After that, I wanted to constantly be in that place.” As a result of her addiction, she became a recluse, skipping sixth form and losing jobs throughout her formative years, while ongoing surgeries meant it was easy for her to acquire more painkillers through her GP’s online repeat prescription service. By last October, she had increased her daily intake to 24 tablets – three times the recommended limit. It was only the threat of crashing her car while driving loved ones that prompted Bedford to visit the West Yorkshire service for help. But it is not just sedative side-effects that can endanger the lives of opioid painkiller addicts. Sarah*, another service user, became addicted to co-codamol after experiencing a “euphoric” side-effect after wrist surgery and began taking above the recommended limit. When doctors wised up to her excuses for requiring an early prescription, she topped up with ibuprofen and paracetamol from a pharmacy, but was taken to hospital for an overdose after taking 128 tablets in one day. Through counselling with Ritchie, both women discovered the link between their addictions and unearthed trauma – such as Sarah’s emotionally abusive relationship and the death of Bedford’s dad from pancreatic cancer. “Some days I left the sessions and I was so drained and exhausted by these feelings and I’d get in my car and cry. But I’d go home with a smile on my face,” said Bedford, who by late November was opioid-free. Both women have been clean for months and continue to see Ritchie occasionally. They are offering to help run a support group so that the charity can help more people suffering with opioid painkiller addiction. In January, Bedford will be operated on for endometriosis. She is concerned about having to take opioid painkillers again, but remains optimistic that support from the Bridge Project will see her through. Although he is proud of the work Bridge has achieved, Ritchie stressed that local authority cuts to drug and alcohol treatment meant their workforce had halved while their caseload had doubled in two years. Royle added: “We’re sort of pioneers in many ways, because we’ve started something. But we’ve just scratched the tip of the iceberg. We’re in a small corner of the country; what about the rest of the country where they’re not getting help?” * Name changed"

          "headline": "Rugby league is a rebel sport – its northern strongholds will never turn Conservative",
          "bodyText": "Will the decisive battles of the 2019 general election be fought on the playing fields of the north of England? Maybe so, now that the Conservative thinktank Onward has identified so-called Workington Man and his “strong rugby league traditions” as a key target for Boris Johnson’s election campaign. The idea that “rugby league traditions” have anything in common with the Old Etonians in charge of Britain is laughable. Rugby league was actually born out of a radical revolt against the stranglehold of the privately educated over rugby. When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the 1880s, the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport. “Why should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others?” asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 1897. But men working in mines, docks and factories had to take unpaid leave from work to play rugby. Amateurism meant they could not be compensated for the wages lost playing the game, so the northern rugby clubs proposed that players be given “broken time” payments. Rugby’s leaders refused. Threatened with expulsion, the top northern clubs broke away in 1895 to form the Northern Union, which would become known as rugby league. In response, RFU banned for life anyone connected with rugby league. Players were ostracised for even talking to rugby league officials. In no other sport was Britain’s class divide so starkly illustrated. Rugby league became a sport outside the establishment, with its own traditions of equality and democracy. Eddie Waring, the legendary commentator, hailed the sport as “the most democratic in the world”. Trade union leaders such as the miners’ Joe Gormley and TUC general secretary John Monks were regulars on the terraces of Wigan and Swinton. Rugby league also has a history of racial integration unique in British sport. In 1935 George Bennett became the first black international rugby league player, over 40 years before the first black English football international. In 1972 Clive Sullivan became the first black Briton to captain a national side, and led Great Britain to a world cup triumph. The sense that the game reflected wider social divisions was highlighted during the 1984-85 miners’ strike, which was fought out in many towns and villages in the north where rugby league was the dominant sport. Rugby league clubs became organising centres for feeding and supporting striking miners and their families. When Rupert Murdoch’s BSkyB tried to force clubs to merge after it bought the game’s TV rights in 1995, many of those who had been on the picket lines in 1984 once again turned out to protest. “They’ve taken our jobs, now they want to take away our leisure,” was how one demonstrator expressed their anger. Rugby league communities have been devastated by deindustrialisation, austerity and government policies over the past 30 years. Half of the English teams in the Super League come from areas that are in the most deprived 10% in Britain. Workington itself has lost its coal and steel industries, and is a long way from the prosperous town that launched its professional rugby league club in 1945. The attitudes that gave birth to rugby league remain strong. Hostility to the establishment and suspicion of the ruling elite, whether in Westminster or in business, has not diminished. Indeed, the strong Brexit vote in rugby league-playing regions can be seen as a protest vote against a two-party parliamentary system that has continually let down the “post-industrial” north. Unlike Essex Man or Worcester Woman, Workington Man (Johnson’s consultants appear to be ignorant of the fact that women are also rugby league fans and players) has none of the advantages of living in the economic bubble of the south of England. While dissatisfaction with Labour also runs deep, it is unlikely that traditional rugby league areas in the north of England will fall to the Tories. Although the Brexit party has picked up votes in these areas, Nigel Farage’s Dulwich College accent and golf club-bore demeanour is too great a barrier for him to make any significant breakthrough in areas where stubborn resistance to self-appointed authority is deeply ingrained. As one contemporary writer remarked about the 1895 split, northern rugby and its communities had rejected the “thraldom of the southern gentry”. There’s no reason to suspect that things will change in 2019. As Onward’s misunderstanding of rugby league traditions demonstrates, Britain remains two nations separated by huge class and cultural divisions. And few things illustrate that chasm better than rugby. • Tony Collins is emeritus professor of history at De Montfort University."

          "headline": "House votes to formalize impeachment process against Trump – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Live political reporting continues on Friday’s blog: Here’s a recap of today: Congress voted to set rules for the public phase of the impeachment inquiry and formalize procedures. NSC official Tim Morrison testified before congress, affirming that Trump sought a quid pro quo, while insisting that there was nothing illegal about it. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers said they were vindicated by his testimony. A majority of Americans — 61% — say Trump violates democratic institutions and forms. Representative Katie Hill condemned the “double standard” that had forced her to resign while men who have been accused of sexual misconduct (including Trump) remain in power. Trump changed his primary residence to Florida Donald Trump has registered as a resident of Florida, the New York Times reports. In late September, Mr. Trump changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Fla., according to documents filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Melania Trump, the first lady, also changed her residence to Palm Beach in an identical document. Each of the Trumps filed a “declaration of domicile” saying that the Mar-a-Lago Club, Mr. Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, will be their permanent residence. “If I maintain another place or places of abode in some other state or states, I hereby declare that my above-described residence and abode in the State of Florida constitutes my predominant and principal home, and I intend to continue it permanently as such,” reads the document that Mr. Trump filed. It’s unclear why the Trumps made this change. It could be for tax purposes, or because the president’s relationship with his hometown of New York has been deeply strained. 2020 Candidates divided on key issue: Candy corn The 2020 Democratic presidential challengers agree on quite a lot. Broadly, they all want to improve Americans’ access to healthcare, develop policies to combat climate change and strengthen gun control laws. But are they pro- or anti-candy corn, the most controversial of Halloween treats? According to a New York Times poll, the candidates – much like the Guardian’s West Coast bureau – are deeply divided. Amongst the candy corn haters are Kamala Harris, Andrew Yang and Michael Bennet. (Also, me). I’m also counting Beto O’Rourke, who said the worse Halloween candy is “anything without chocolate”. Everyone knows that candy corn is made of sugar and existential dread. Amongst the candy corn lovers — John Delaney. Republican candidates Joe Walsh and Tom Steyer are also reportedly candy corn lovers. Front runners Pete Buttigieg, Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden stayed out of the fray, with Biden’s campaign refusing to even name a worst candy. Bernie Sanders didn’t respond to the Times. Democrats conducting the impeachment inquiry against Donald Trump are emphasizing that NSC official Tim Morrison’s testimony today confirmed that Trump sought a quid pro quo from the Ukranian president. Republican defenders of Trump are focusing instead on Morrison’s view that there was nothing illegal about the quid pro quo. As The Guardian’s Tom McCarthy reported: Morrison, a former senior congressional aide, seemed to seek to exculpate Trump by suggesting the quid pro quo was all Sondland’s idea. “I hoped that Ambassador Sondland’s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security,” Morrison said. A lawyer for Sondland did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Lawyers for Sondland have said that he never mentioned the Bidens to the Ukrainians and suggested he was unaware of the Burisma-Biden tie. Trump is rewarding senators who’re showing him support as he faces impeachment — with fundraising money. The president’s reelection campaign sent an appeal urging donors to contribute to three senators who support an anti-impeachment resolution. According to a Politico report: Trump is tapping his vast fundraising network for a handful of loyal senators facing tough reelection bids in 2020. Each of them has signed onto a Republican-backed resolution condemning the inquiry as “unprecedented and undemocratic.” Conspicuously absent from the group is Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a politically vulnerable Republican who’s refused to support the resolution and avoided taking a stance on impeachment. With his new push, Trump is exerting leverage over a group he badly needs in his corner with an impeachment trial likely coming soon to the Senate — but that also needs him. Republican senators on the ballot next year are lagging in fundraising, stoking uncertainty about the GOP’s hold on the chamber, and could use the fundraising might of the president. Trump’s political operation has raked in over $300 million this year. On Wednesday, the Trump reelection campaign sent a fundraising appeal to its massive email list urging donors to provide a contribution that would be divided between the president and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. Each of the senators are supporting the anti-impeachment resolution despite being endangered in 2020. Trump nominated Stephen Beigun, the US special envoy to North Korea, to the second-in-command position at the State Department. Beigun would take over from John Sullivan at the State Department, who has been nominated to serve as the next ambassador to Russia. The nomination comes amidst speculation over the future of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and turmoil at the State Department, which is entangled in the impeachment case against Trump. The Trump administration is considering adding more countries to the travel ban list, according to CNN, which cites unnamed officials. An inter-agency discussion about imposing travel restrictions on countries that are not compliant with electronic documents and information sharing -- a key focus of the administration -- is underway, according to a senior administration official. Fewer than five countries are under consideration, the official said. The goal, the official said, is to “bring governments into compliance by using the power of access to the United States.” The travel restrictions would be tailored to the countries, if they’re added, and not impose a ban on them altogether, the official noted. The Guardian has not independently verified this reporting. An AP-NORC poll found that 61% of Americans think Donald Trump doesn’t respect democratic institutions and norms. This includes 26% of Republicans. But the majority of Republicans — 85% — approve of Trump’s performance as president. Only 7% of Democrats agree. His approval overall stands at about 42%, according to the poll of 1,075 adults conducted Oct. 24-28. A district court judge will hear oral arguments on December 10 on whether or not Charles Kupperman, the former deputy national security adviser who defied a congressional subpoena and did not turn up at this scheduled deposition this week, will be forced to testify. Kupperman, who served as deputy national security adviser until last month, was listening in the infamous July phone call between Donald Trump and the Ukrainian president. The White House blocked him from testifying in the impeachment inquiry, claiming executive privilege. Another judge is ruling on whether former White House counsel Don McGahn must appear before Congress. That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: The House passed its impeachment resolution, clearing the way for public hearings and the release of transcripts from closed-door depositions. However, senior House Democrats did not provide a concrete timeline on when they would take those steps. House Republicans pointed to the nearly party-line vote on the resolution — all but two Democrats supported it, while every Republican opposed it — as evidence that the investigation is allegedly too partisan. Tim Morrison, Trump’s top official on Russia, testified in the impeachment inquiry. The national security council official, who intends to soon leave the administration, affirmed Bill Taylor’s account of a quid pro quo while claiming that he saw nothing illegal about Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president. A federal judge appeared skeptical of the White House’s argument that executive privilege exempted former administration officials from having to comply with congressional subpoenas in a case that could have major implications for the impeachment inquiry. Representative Katie Hill delivered her final floor speech, in which she apologized to her supporters and condemned the “double standard” that had forced her to resign while men who have been accused of sexual misconduct (including Trump) remain in positions of power. (Hill announced her resignation Sunday following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she had a relationship with one of her staffers.) Maanvi will have plenty more on the news of the day, so stay tuned. House Republicans appeared pleased with what Tim Morrison told impeachment investigators in his closed-door deposition, saying they look forward to the transcript of the interview being made public. According to Morrison’s opening statement, the national security council official affirmed Bill Taylor’s account of a quid pro quo but said he did not think there was anything illegal about Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president. The president’s allies celebrated Morrison’s testimony as a victory for Trump, an assessment that the Democratic chairman of the House foreign affairs committee called “absurd.” Tim Morrison has concluded his testimony in the impeachment inquiry after spending about eight hours talking to House investigators. According to his opening statement, the national security council official affirmed Bill Taylor’s account of a quid pro quo while insisting he did not see anything illegal about Trump’s call with the Ukrainian president. Morrison, who is soon leaving his NSC post, claimed he flagged the call for White House lawyers simply because he was worried about a “polarized” political reaction to Trump’s comments. A federal judge in Washington appeared skeptical today of arguments from the White House that executive privilege exempts former Trump administration officials from having to comply with congressional subpoenas. “We don’t live in a world where your status as a former executive branch official somehow shields you or prevents you from giving information,” judge Ketanji Brown Jackson said. The specific case Jackson is ruling on concerns whether Trump’s former White House counsel, Don McGahn, must appear before House members for an interview. But the case could have sweeping implications on the impeachment inquiry, given that the White House has used similar arguments to block administration officials from speaking to House investigators. Earlier today we flagged reporting indicating that Tim Morrison, the national security council official testifying currently before the impeachment committees, would back up ambassador Bill Taylor’s account of ambassador Gordon Sondland trying to strike a deal with Ukraine exchanging military aid for an announcement of investigations into Joe Biden and 2016 election tampering. Morrison did explicitly corroborate Taylor’s account, according to Morrison’s opening statement, posted online by CBS News: “I can confirm that the substance of his statement, as it relates to conversations he and I had, is accurate,” Morrison testified. But Morrison does not emerge as a particularly threatening witness for Trump; instead, his testimony threads multiple needles that seem designed to defend Trump in the Ukrainian affair. Morrison suggests that military aid to Ukraine was withheld owing in part to Trump’s concern about corruption in Ukraine and about Europe not contributing enough. And Morrison suggests that the possibility of a quid pro quo involving military aid with Ukraine was diminished by his perception that Ukraine did not know military aid had been suspended until late August. Morrison’s perception in this regard does not seem accurate. The New York Times has reported that the Ukrainians were aware of the suspension of aid in early August. In any case, Sondland was explicitly dangling aid to try to extract investigations in early September, in a bilateral meeting in Warsaw, according to Morrison’s own testimony. Then Morrison floats quite a contention to exculpate the president – that maybe this was all Sondland’s idea? The official said: “I hoped that Ambassador Sondland’s strategy was exclusively his own and would not be considered by leaders in the Administration and Congress, who understood the strategic importance of Ukraine to our national security.” Sondland has said through a lawyer that he never mentioned “Biden” in conversations with Ukrainian officials, but instead spoke of Burisma, the gas company that formerly employed Hunter Biden. He has not responded to the notion that the quid pro quo strategy was “exclusively his own.” Morrison also testified that public summaries of a 25 July call between Trump and the Ukrainian president, which Morrison listened in on, were accurate. He says he went to NSC lawyers after the call, but he says he was not concerned that what Trump said was illegal: instead, Morrison says, he was worried about a “polarized” political reaction, possible confusion in Congress and “how it would affect the Ukrainian perceptions of the U.S.-Ukraine relationship”. (Morrison was worried that reporting about a call that Ukrainians were on would affect their perceptions of the US-Ukraine relationship? Weren’t those perceptions rather shaped by... being on the call?) Anyway, Morrison concludes, “I want to be clear, I was not concerned that anything illegal was discussed.” A publicity stunt by the National Republican Congressional Committee went terribly wrong when Capitol Police mistook boxes from the group as suspicious packages. House Republicans’ campaign arm sent “moving boxes” to vulnerable Democrats who voted for the impeachment resolution, creating some very understandable confusion and brief alarm on Capitol Hill. Luckily, the situation appears to have been quickly cleared up. While speaking to conservative British commentator Nigel Farage earlier today, Trump offered some disparaging comments about three of the frontrunners in the Democratic presidential primary. Trump dismissed the notion that he would pressure Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden — even though the evidence is mounting that he did — because he claimed he does not view the former vice president as a threat. Trump said: “Also, would I use Ukraine to beat sleepy Joe Biden? Sleepy Joe, I call him one percent Joe too. One percent, the guy never came out of these things with one percent and he’s heading down rapidly now. I mean, I don’t view him as a very difficult, difficult guy to beat.” Asked for his prediction on who would win the Democratic nomination, Trump said: “It would look like Elizabeth Warren is picking up steam. She’s picking up a little steam. I thought she was gonzo. ... So, it could be her, it could be Bernie Sanders, I guess. Maybe, I dunno. Bernie looks like he’s shot, but it could be one of them.” Federal prosecutors in New York are reportedly hesitant about the possibility of charging Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal lawyer, for violating foreign lobbying laws. CNN reports: New York federal prosecutors examining Rudy Giuliani’s Ukranian business dealings are mindful of both the approaching 2020 presidential election and of the difficulty of prosecuting foreign lobbying violations as they move forward in their investigation, according to people familiar with the matter. These people say charges against President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer aren’t certain or imminent, but that Giuliani has come into prosecutors’ crosshairs as a central focus during the months-long inquiry. In recent days, Giuliani has been in advanced discussions to hire Daniel L. Stein, a white-collar criminal defense attorney who is a veteran of the Manhattan US Attorney’s office, to represent him in the investigation, sources say. Giuliani is also on the cover of this week’s Time magazine. Speaking to reporters about his relationship with Trump, the former New York mayor expressed confidence that the president would stand by him. Giuliani said: “He’s 100% in my corner and loyal to me as I am to him.” Joe Biden has issued a statement on the House’s passage of the impeachment resolution, expressing support for lawmakers performing their “constitutional duty.” The statement accuses Trump of having “weaponized the institutions of our government for political purposes, subverting our national security for his own political gain.” Biden’s statement continues: “Donald Trump is testing the institutions of our democracy every day. But they are holding. Today, the House did its constitutional duty to proceed with a solemn investigation of unprecedented wrongdoing. “Members of Congress take an oath of loyalty to the Constitution when they are sworn in, not an oath to their party or to the president. Congress must do its duty to ensure that Donald Trump’s assault on the Constitution does not seep beyond his presidency, with a lasting and devastating impact on our democracy.” Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the national security council official who told impeachment investigators about his concerns after hearing Trump’s Ukraine call, is reportedly willing to testify publicly. ABC News reports: Vindman, the first current White House official to cooperate with House impeachment investigators and appear on Capitol Hill for a closed-door deposition, is willing to testify publicly in the next phase of the inquiry, according to a source familiar with his thinking. ... Vindman, the first witness to appear on Capitol Hill with firsthand knowledge of the call, has not yet been formally contacted by House impeachment investigators about testifying in public, the source said. Bill Taylor has reportedly also expressed openness to testifying publicly. With today’s passage of the impeachment resolution clearing the way toward public hearings, Americans may soon get to hear directly from Trump administration officials about the alleged quid pro quo the president has repeatedly denied. Speaking to conservative British commentator Nigel Farage, Trump slammed the vote approving the impeachment resolution as a “desperate” move by House Democrats. In her final floor speech as a congresswoman, Katie Hill accused Trump of abusing his power — including his power over women. The freshman representative, who is resigning following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she had a relationship with one of her staffers, vowed that women would not be scared into silence. Hill said: “We will not stand down. We will not be broken. We will not be silenced. We will rise, and we will make tomorrow better than today.” In her final floor speech as a congresswoman, Katie Hill said that the publication of nude photos of her had made her go to “the darkest places that a mind can go.” The California Democrat lambasted the “dirtiest gutter politics that I’ve ever seen,” which had forced her to step down. Hill has acknowledged she had a relationship with a campaign staffer, but she condemned the “double standard” that had pressured her to leave Congress even as “we have men who have been credibly accused of intentional acts of sexual violence and remain in boardrooms, on the Supreme Court, in this very body, and worst of all, in the Oval Office.” The freshman representative detailed the dozens of sexual assault allegations against Trump and expressed pride that her final vote as a congresswoman was in support of the impeachment inquiry. Hill concluded: “Thank you, and I will yield the balance of my time — for now but not forever.” Representative Katie Hill is now delivering her final floor speech as a congresswoman. The California Democrat announced her resignation on Sunday following the publication of nude photos of her and allegations that she engaged in a relationship with one of her staffers. The freshman congresswoman said she was still grappling with her decision to leave sooner than expected. “I thought I could make a difference here,” Hill said. The California Democrat repeatedly apologized to her supporters, her volunteers and her colleagues. “I am so, so sorry,” Hill said. “And to every little girl who looked up to me, I hope that one day you can forgive me.” Trump has just wrapped up an interview with Nigel Farage, a conservative radio host and vocal supporter of Brexit. In it, the US president warned that Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn would be “so bad” for the UK and said the country has “tremendous potential.” Trump’s comments come just two days after MPs voted to hold a general election on Dec. 12, allowing the British public to once again weigh in on the UK’s separation from the EU. The blog is going to briefly interrupt impeachment coverage to share the story of how Rudy Giuliani locked himself out of his iPhone shortly after being named Trump’s cybersecurity adviser. NBC News reports: Less than a month after he was named President Donald Trump’s cybersecurity adviser in 2017, Rudy Giuliani walked into an Apple store in downtown San Francisco. He wasn’t looking for a new gadget. Giuliani was looking for help. He was locked out of his iPhone because he had forgotten the passcode and entered the wrong one at least 10 times, according to two people familiar with the matter and a photo of an internal Apple store memo obtained by NBC News. ‘Very sloppy,’ said one of the people, a former Apple store employee who was there on the day that Giuliani stopped by in February 2017. ‘Trump had just named him as an informal adviser on cybersecurity and here, he couldn’t even master the fundamentals of securing your own device.’ This report follows another from NBC News last week that Giuliani repeatedly butt-dialed a reporter in recent weeks and was overheard trashing Joe Biden and discussing his need for cash. In their press conference after the passage of the impeachment resolution, senior House Democrats provided little clarity on when they might release transcripts from their closed-door depositions or move to public hearings in the investigation. Here’s where the day stands so far: The House passed its impeachment resolution outlining next steps in the inquiry as Democratic leaders advance toward public hearings. The nearly party-line vote on the resolution — all but two House Democrats voted for it, while every House Republican opposed it — sparked complaints from the White House and Trump’s allies that the investigation was allegedly too partisan. Tim Morrison, the national security council official who is stepping down from his post, is testifying to impeachment investigators and reportedly verified much of Bill Taylor’s account of a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned. Representative Lee Zeldin, one of Trump’s congressional allies, is calling on the House intelligence committee to release the transcripts from closed-door depositions in the impeachment inquiry so that lawmakers can debate the “substance” of the allegations against the president. However, Republicans have so far been fairly hesitant to discuss the substance of the accusations as more witnesses come forward with damning testimony pointing to a quid pro quo in the delaying of military aid to Ukraine. House Republicans and Democrats are holding separate press conferences now in the wake of the impeachment resolution’s passage. Republican leadership unsurprisingly pointed to the nearly party-line vote as evidence that the investigtion is allegedly highly partisan and unfair to Trump. However, it’s worth noting that seemingly none of the Republican messaging against impeachment actually touches on the serious allegations facing the president. As the inquiry moves to public hearings, Republicans may be increasingly asked to weigh in on the accusations, and they’ll need to come up with an answer. The nearly party-line vote on the impeachment resolution marks a departure from how Bill Clinton’s impeachment was handled in the House, per an NBC News correspondent. House Republicans will likely cite the final vote count as evidence that the inquiry is highly partisan and unfair to Trump. However, the vote still marks a momentous development in Trump’s presidency and US history, as a PBS NewsHour reporter pointed out. One of the two House Democrats who voted against the impeachment resolution, Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, said in a statement that he feared the nearly party-line decision would “further divide the country.” However, the freshman congressman left open the possibility of eventually backing Trump’s impeachment depending on where the evidence led investigators. Democratic presidential candidates voiced support for House Democrats after they passed a resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and senior adviser, weighed in on the impeachment vote by quoting Thomas Jefferson’s dour reflections on Washington. Nancy Pelosi made the rather unusual decision to cast a vote on the impeachment resolution, marking a departure from House speakers’ general tendency to refrain from weighing in. Four House members⁠ — three Republicans and one Democrat ⁠— were unable to vote on the impeachment resolution due to absences. Trump’s press secretary has now issued a statement slamming Democrats’ “unhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding” in the wake of the resolution’s passage. Stephanie Grisham said in the statement: “The President has done nothing wrong, and the Democrats know it. Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats’ unhinged obsession with this illegitimate impeachment proceeding does not hurt President Trump; it hurts the American people. ... “With today’s vote, Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have done nothing more than enshrine unacceptable violations of due process into House rules. ... The Democrats want to render a verdict without giving the Administration a chance to mount a defense. That is unfair, unconstitutional, and fundamentally un-American.” Speaking at her press briefing this morning, Pelosi said that the rules outlined in the resolution were “fairer than anything that have gone before in terms of an impeachment proceeding.” A bit of chaos has broken out on the House floor following the passage of the impeachment resolution, with Republicans shouting “objection” and Democrats calling for order. The vote has concluded on the impeachment resolution, and it has officially passed the House with a vote of 232-196. Two Democrats, Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, voted against the resolution, while every House Republican opposed the measure. One independent lawmaker, former Republican Justin Amash, joined the vast majority of Democrats in supporting the resolution. The impeachment resolution has reached a majority level of support, receiving at least least 228 “yea” votes, and it will clear the way for public hearings. Collin Peterson, a Democratic congressman from an overwhelmingly Trump district in Minnesota, voted with Republicans on the procedural vote for the impeachment resolution. There were widespread suspicions that Peterson would not join his Democratic colleagues in backing the resolution, given the political breakdown of his district. Representative Jeff Van Drew also voted against the procedural motion, but the Democratic congressman had previously signaled his opposition. Justin Amash, the Michigan congressman who left the Republican Party over opposition to Trump, has confirmed that he intends to vote for the impeachment resolution. In a morning tweet, Amash encouraged his Republican colleagues to “step outside your media and social bubble” and consider the historic ramifications of their decision to stand by Trump. House members are currently taking a procedural vote on the impeachment resolution. The vote on the resolution itself will likely begin in about 15 minutes and conclude around 11.30am ET. The House has concluded debate on the impeachment resolution and is moving on to the vote series that will determine whether members approve it. House Republicans are now denouncing the impeachment resolution on the floor, with minority leader Kevin McCarthy accusing Democrats of ignoring other legislative priorities to focus on impeachment. House minority whip Steve Scalise used a poster to repeat his claim that Democrats are pursuing “Soviet-style” tactics with their investigation. However, a New Yorker writer and former Moscow bureau chief for the Washington Post contradicted that assessment of the inquiry. During her press conference, Nancy Pelosi also touched on the subject of Katie Hill, the Democratic congresswoman who announced her resignation Sunday following the release of nude photos of her and allegations of a relationship with one of her staffers. Pelosi praised her fellow California Democrat as an “absolutely outstanding young public servant” who was “respected by her colleagues.” The House speaker noted that Hill made her own determination about whether and when to resign. “She made her decision and her timing, and I respect that,” Pelosi said. The speaker also noted that she has warned her grandchildren that “appearances” on social media can be taken out of context and “come back to haunt you.” Hill is expected to deliver her final floor speech this afternoon, after the vote on the impeachment resolution. “This resolution sets the stage for the next phase of our investigation, one in which the American people have the opportunity to hear from the witnesses first-hand,” House intelligence chairman Adam Schiff said in a floor speech ahead of the vote. “We will continue to conduct this inquiry with the seriousness of purpose that our task deserves because it is our duty and because no one is above the law.” Nancy Pelosi opened her remarks on the House floor by reading the “most beautiful lines in our country’s history” – the introduction to the US constitution. The House speaker urged support for the resolution by citing a quote attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who, when asked if the Founders had created a republic or a monarchy, is believed to have responded: “A republic if you can keep it.” Nancy Pelosi is now talking to reporters in her weekly press conference, saying that it is a “sad day” when lawmakers have to vote on an impeachment measure. The House speaker added that no decision had yet been made on whether members of her caucus would eventually support Trump’s impeachent. However, it seems highly likely that the Democratic-controlled House will soon vote to impeach the president. Nancy Pelosi framed the impeachment resolution, and the inquiry more broadly, as a measure to defend the principles of the US constitution. The House speaker said: “What is at stake in all of this is nothing less than our democracy.” Nancy Pelosi is now speaking on the House floor about the impeachment resolution, arguing the measure will enable lawmakers to find the truth about the allegations against Trump. Standing beside an American flag poster, the House speaker said: “This is a solemn occasion. ... I doubt anybody in this place or anybody that you know ... comes to Congress to impeach the president of the United States unless his actions are jeopardizing honoring our oath of office.” House Democrats have scheduled four depositions on Monday as they look to wrap up the closed-door interviews in the impeachment inquiry and advance to public hearings. It remains unknown whether the officials will comply with the interview requests, given that the White House still refuses to cooperate with the investigation. However, if the depositions were to occur, John Eisenberg’s testimony could prove particularly damaging for Trump. The White House lawyer was reportedly the person who proposed the unusual move of placing the transcript of the Ukraine call in a secure server. The Washington Post reported yesterday: Moments after President Trump ended his phone call with Ukraine’s president on July 25, an unsettled national security aide rushed to the office of White House lawyer John Eisenberg. Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the top Ukraine adviser at the White House, had been listening to the call and was disturbed by the pressure Trump had applied to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate his political rivals, according to people familiar with Vindman’s testimony to lawmakers this week. Vindman told Eisenberg, the White House’s legal adviser on national security issues, that what the president did was wrong, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. Scribbling notes on a yellow legal pad, Eisenberg proposed a step that other officials have said is at odds with long-standing White House protocol: moving a transcript of the call to a highly classified server and restricting access to it, according to two people familiar with Vindman’s account. House Democrats appear largely unified in support of the resolution outlining next steps in the impeachment inquiry. Only two members of the House Democratic caucus – Colin Peterson of Minnesota and Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey – were expected to vote against the resolution. However, House Republicans were also expected to be unified in opposition to the resolution, so they will likely cite the vote’s outcome to bolster their argument that the investigation is highly partisan. Nancy Pelosi rather unusually presided over the House herself this morning as members began to debate the impeachment resolution. The resolution, which outlines the procedures the House will follow as the inquiry advances to public hearings, will likely get a vote between 10.30am and 11.30am ET. Pelosi is also expected to speak to reporters about the resolution at the House speaker’s press briefing in about 30 minutes. Tim Morrison, the national security council official currently testifying behind closed doors in the impeachment inquiry, reportedly intends to confirm Bill Taylor’s account that the White House held up Ukraine’s military assistance to push for public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. The Washington Post reports: Morrison is expected to tell impeachment investigators on Thursday that the account offered by Ambassador William B. Taylor Jr., is accurate, particularly that Morrison alerted him to the president’s and his deputies’ push to withhold security aid and a meeting with the Ukrainian president until Ukraine announced an investigation of the Bidens and 2016 election interference, the person said on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions. Morrison will also say that he did not necessarily view the president’s demands as improper or illegal, but rather problematic for U.S. policy in supporting an ally in the region, the person said. House Democrats are hoping that Tim Morrison can provide the key link between Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the EU who has denied any quid pro quo in the delaying of military assistance to Ukraine, and Bill Taylor, who outlined such a scheme in his testimony to impeachment investigators. However, despite Morrison’s imminent departure from the national security council, the official may not be looking to reveal everything he knows to the House committees this morning. The Washington Post’s Josh Rogin writes: Democrats might not want to pin their impeachment hopes on his testimony Thursday, because there are three things Morrison is not: a whistleblower, a Never Trumper or a potential member of the Resistance. ... [Morrison] likely won’t give the Democrats the thing they want most, a full-throated endorsement of their characterization of the Ukraine scheme as a quid pro quo. Morrison will likely try to stick to the facts, be honest and not burn his bosses or the president in the process. That won’t be easy. Good morning, live blog readers! Today’s impeachment proceedings are underway, with Tim Morrison having already arrived for his closed-door testimony with the committees leading the inquiry. Morrison’s appearance was already highly anticipated, given Bill Taylor’s reported testimony last week that the national security council official told him about Gordon Sondland allegedly informing Ukrainian officials their US military aid was contingent on public announcements of investigations into Joe Biden and the 2016 election. However, Morrison’s testimony is even more dramatic following last night’s reports that the official is stepping down from his post at the White House. It’s still unclear whether Morrison resigned voluntarily or was asked to leave, but the development puts even more weight on what he may tell impeachment investigators today. Here’s what else the bog is keeping an eye on: Trump has no events on his public schedule today, so some impeachment-themed tweets seem likely. The House vote on the impeachment resolution will likely happen between 10.30am and 11.30am ET. Nancy Pelosi will brief reporters at 10.15am ET. The blog will have plenty more coming up, so stay tuned."

          "headline": "'This isn’t about me,' Corbyn insisted, reluctantly basking in the adulation",
          "bodyText": "The entrance was surprisingly restrained. A mere three-minute standing ovation. First the shadow cabinet trooped on stage at the Battersea Arts Centre in south-west London and joined in the applause. Some faces familiar, others less so. A few known not even to their families. Last to appear was Jeremy Corbyn. “This isn’t about me,” he was to say several times. You could have fooled me. Here was the Labour leader in his element as he launched his party’s election campaign. In the Commons he often seems awkward, stumbling over his words as he fails to make basic arguments. But give him an enthusiastic home-team audience and he comes alive. The sentences flow with the conviction and passion of a revivalist preacher. A man with the power to convince his supporters he had won the last election even when he had lost. This was a once in a generation election to transform British politics, he insisted. Generations seem to come round awfully quickly these days, as I can distinctly remember him saying exactly the same thing during the last election in 2017. Still, no one was quibbling over these sorts of details. Having quickly dispensed with Brexit – he would negotiate a new deal within six months, which he might or might not support at a second referendum – it was all a piece of piss, really. He couldn’t imagine how Theresa May and Boris Johnson had cocked things up so badly. Corbyn moved on to his social justice agenda. He wouldn’t be selling off the NHS to the USA. This prompted massive cheers and is going to be a hard line for the Tories to counter. Because the more they say they aren’t going to flog parts of the health service to Donald Trump, the more people will suspect that is the plan, as not even Conservative voters expect Boris to tell the truth these days. After all, this was the very day, 31 October, on which the prime minister had promised to die in a ditch and he was still very much alive. Corbyn asked for a moment’s silence in solidarity with all those who had been out digging extra ditches in anticipation. Patients would be cured of cancer even before they had been diagnosed with it. There would be nurseries and schools on every street corner. The old would all have their own dedicated team of carers. Sheep would dream of electric androids. It sounded very much like the sort of world to which anyone could aspire. He didn’t say how much any of this would cost, but then he didn’t have to. In the Boris Johnson post-truth world there are no economic constraints. If the Tories can spend money they don’t have as if there is no tomorrow, why shouldn’t Labour? Having whizzed through his catchy opening verses, Corbyn moved into his middle eight chorus. This wasn’t an election of the people versus an anti-Brexit establishment elite. It was an election of the people against a Tory establishment elite. The tax-dodgers. The dodgy landlords. Those with a vested interest in preserving inequality. “Whose side are we on?” he asked. “Yours,” came the near instantaneous response. Corbyn looked mildly perplexed at this. In his script, the right answer had been for the crowd to shout out: “The people.” “Whose side are we on?” he tried again. “Yours,” everyone yelled back. The Labour leader shrugged. He could live with the adulation. But he was going to have to work a lot harder to sell the message that it wasn’t all about him. He raced to a close with a promise to continue fighting until the rivers froze over. Or the Red Sea parted. It wasn’t clear if this was a reference to climate change or his quasi-mystical powers. The audience assumed the latter. “Oh Je-re-my Cor-byn,” they chanted. Things became slightly edgier when questions were invited from the press. Laura Kuenssberg was heckled merely for asking why he expected Labour to win on much the same agenda as it had lost last time. Not that it had lost last time. That was all a media conspiracy. Much like the poll ratings that put Labour at its lowest levels since the 1980s. Inside the Corbyn bubble we were in the year of magical thinking. One or two members of the shadow cabinet went a little pale and their applause more hesitant when Corbyn declined to guarantee them their jobs after an election. Then the only person whose job the Labour leader could guarantee was his own. His supporters demanded nothing less. Because even if he lost, he would have won again. And even if he were to die, his spirit would be immortal. Fame! I’m gonna live forever. I’m gonna learn how to fly."

          "headline": "I work in politics. I refuse to let a nude video stop me from running for office",
          "bodyText": "When Representative Katie Hill’s nude photos were leaked online, I watched with a sick feeling in the pit of my stomach. I saw them posted across every social media platform. I saw her naked body, saw it commented upon and reviewed, criticized. I was sitting on my couch and wrote a quick tweet: “Almost every woman I know has taken nudes at sometime in her life. As more women under 40 run for office, we are going to have to figure out how to stand together and say it’s the leaking of them, not the taking of them, that is shameful.” The tweet got 1,000 likes quickly. The next day it had 34,000. I watched people in the comments tell the stories about how nude photos had been used against them. I watched many people, mostly men, repeatedly blame women for sharing nudes, instead of blaming the people who leaked them. By the time I woke up on Wednesday morning, the tweet had almost 100,000 likes. I felt something in me burst like a bubble. I drafted a post on Facebook to share something I had only ever told my closest friends – I cared so deeply about this issue because it was my story, too. I was only 19, and desperate for a roommate when I met the man who would go on to get me very drunk, film me without consent and release the evidence. I am 32 now and I can still feel the sensation of how it felt to have my world crumble around me. My boyfriend left me. I was forced out of the online community where I’d found a home. I was utterly, hopelessly alone. I even contemplated killing myself, especially as this man threatened to show my parents the video. He made DVDs and sent me a copy. When I saw it, I threw up. I’ve built a life for myself in politics. I’ve moved on. I have a partner I love and an adorable house. Two cats and a dog. A great job. I’ve run dozens of people for office. But I never let myself consider running for a seat of my own. All I could imagine was the humiliation I would feel if this man used that opportunity to finally release my secret to the world. As the jobs I’ve gotten have become higher profile, I had near-constant anxiety that today, tomorrow, next Tuesday might be the day I lost everything again. The day I wrote my Facebook post, texts, DMs and calls kept coming in with wave after wave of support. It felt good to hear some things: this was assault. I didn’t deserve the shame I was carrying. He was in the wrong. But what felt even better, almost magical, to hear, was comment after comment that said something familiar: me too. Woman after woman who were holding themselves back, who were not running for office, not going to school, not starting a business because someone – in some dark corner of the internet, or an abusive ex, or a high school fling – had taken away their choice. Released their nude photos. Put videos on revenge porn sites. This really isn’t about Katie Hill. It’s about the long fight women have had to have agency over our own bodies. It’s about how we are asked to be both the virgin and the whore. It’s about how women still aren’t allowed to own our sexuality. And it’s really, really about the fact that nudes are an expected part of 21st century romance. In the dark teenage drama Euphoria on HBO, the main character explains this beautifully. Exchanging naked photos and snaps is just how many young people build intimacy in a digital world that increasingly lacks it. It is not enough to tell women in their 20s and 30s that they just shouldn’t send nudes. A great number of us already have. We shouldn’t have to feel shame that we trusted someone, that we wanted to feel closer to them. Or that we weren’t given a choice. Sharing someone’s private photos without their consent is a violation of their privacy and their trust. It’s wrong, and the people who do it should be held accountable for their actions. The United States should follow in the footsteps of the many countries that have made the sharing of revenge porn a federal crime. But in the nation of Brock Turner and Brett Kavanaugh, substantial reform doesn’t seem likely soon. What we can do now is tell our stories. Of how we’ve been hurt, our trust violated. We can keep talking about it. We can leak our own nudes. We can sue. We can fight. We can’t be afraid. I know I’m not, anymore.

          "bodyText": "1991, Twickenham: Australia 12-6 England Simon Halliday It always goes down as the game we should have won, if we hadn’t changed our tactics. But when we played Australia we knew they’d put 40 points on us in Sydney a few months earlier. We’d played some very good rugby against them and where they had done really well was out wide. We’d missed a number of tackles on David Campese and he’d scored three tries, but without those tries the scoreline would have been a lot closer. So we thought we needed to play a more fluid game against them. It wasn’t something we were talked into – we spent the whole week working out how we were going to win the game. The consensus afterwards was we’d played all the rugby but we didn’t nail the key moments. Back in the dressing rooms, Australia were almost too exhausted to celebrate. They had literally spent the entire second half defending. We were still trying to come to terms with the defeat, and how we should feel after losing such a match at our own ground, when we left Twickenham, but there were hundreds of people singing Jerusalem as we walked to the coach. I felt it was a real acknowledgement we’d been part of something really special. We had no doubt we could win. There was no lack of belief, and we came into it riding some good momentum. On the day, we left it all out there. We gave it everything. We had been on a five-and-a-half-week tour of Australia and Fiji, then we went home for a few days, before having seven weeks for the World Cup. We weren’t able to see our wives and girlfriends during the competition, so we’d been away from our homes and our jobs for months. I was a banker at UBS at the time and I turned up at the office on the Monday. There were 750 people on my trading floor and when I walked in they all stood up and applauded. We hadn’t won but that showed me that we hadn’t failed. My boss took me to one side and suggested I go away with the family for a few weeks, but I hadn’t worked for months. I politely declined his offer. Obviously rugby is a profession now but when you think about the values of the game and the human elements of it, that hasn’t changed. Or if it has, it hasn’t necessarily been for the better. I had a sympathetic employer and a job to go back to, whereas now if you get forced out of the game through injury you’ve got nothing. We need to look after our people and we’ve got work to do on that. But the sport has been absolutely fantastic. It was wonderful to see Japan play the sort of rugby that needs to be played; teams who have not embraced that – Ireland perhaps – have come unstuck. England, though, have set the standard. The way they played that semi-final against New Zealand was game-changing. It’s been a huge success and a lot of these teams will get better. I’m chairman now of European Professional Club Rugby and, watching the tournament, I think it’s been a wonderful shot in the arm for the game worldwide. 2003, Sydney: Australia 17-20 England (aet) Phil Vickery Preparation-wise, you’re not really going to get any fitter in that final week and you’re probably not going to be going through any great tactical changes, it’s just about managing all the micro-details and arriving in the best possible physical and mental state. You can drain so much energy out of yourself just thinking about the occasion. None of us had ever been to a final before and I remember the conversations I had that week with family members and with all the guys. I always liked positive distractions – I liked having family and friends around, talking about something different, going into spaces and worlds where you relax. And of course by that time we’d been through so many ups and downs together as a team, as all teams do. You get all these emotions rolling up. But everyone’s different and you’ve got to learn how to get the best out of yourself. I remember Jonny Wilkinson, his preparation was very calm. He’s got to be thinking about the pinpoint dot on a rugby ball. I’m thinking there’s a loosehead prop forward who wants to tear my head off. I used to love playing away from home. You found out more about yourself and your teammates, somehow. Not that it’s easy at home, but when you’re away you find out what you’re made of. I always think that’s the greatest test of yourself as a human being. The 2003 final was the perfect example: you’re in Australia, in their national stadium, in Sydney, playing the host nation in a World Cup final. Bloody hell, come on. Everyone has this perception about how well we were playing in 2003 but the reality is we didn’t play that well – we just won. We were losing at half-time against Wales in the quarter-final, and in the semi‑final Jonny kicked every point. In the final we went to extra time and won it with a right-footed drop-goal by a left-footed kicker. We weren’t dominant, we just did what needed to be done. You have all this buildup – the waiting, the waiting, the waiting – and then suddenly you walk out of the tunnel. You feel you’re in a surreal bubble, and then the whistle goes and before you know it it’s over. It goes so, so quickly. This England team have guys who have played in big matches, in big tournaments but the World Cup seems to amplify all those things. They’ve got to be the side who handles the occasion better. This year’s team set a new standard in the semi-finals but they will be thinking they can still be a bit better, be a bit smarter, maybe improve their kicking game. The driver on Saturday is they want to be world champions. The All Blacks game hasn’t changed that: the goal, the purpose, the motivation is exactly the same as it was when they arrived in Japan. It’s just about nailing those micro-details, one last time. 2007, Paris: England 6-15 South Africa Nick Easter I’d made my debut in the Six Nations earlier that year, aged 28. It was a dream come true, especially so late in my life. I had a couple of Six Nations games, toured South Africa, then we got to the World Cup and in our second game we were absolutely hosed by South Africa. We lost 36-0 and were staring down the barrel of being completely embarrassed. That was a Friday night. Brian Ashton told us to spend Saturday with our families and that we’d come together on the Sunday. We were expecting a crisis meeting but instead it was off to the pub for a bit of bonding – table football, pool, darts, the rugby on TV. It was: “Right lads, enjoy yourselves, this is on the RFU. Tomorrow we get to work.” On Monday we had the meeting. Some home truths were told. It’s well documented that a number of senior players took control and said: “This is how we’re going to play.” The previous three months had been good from a fitness point of view but from a rugby point of view it was wasted time. We had some experienced players there and you can adapt very quickly when you need to. We got through a couple of tough pool games against Samoa and Tonga. From the outside we still weren’t rated but as a group we were much happier. We bonded well and a siege mentality formed regarding what was written about us. We were completely written off before our quarter-final against Australia. It only ended 12-10, but we battered them. That was a turning point and our belief got even stronger. We were probably underdogs for a semi-final against the hosts but confidence and team spirit were high and we got through it. Suddenly we’re in the World Cup final, against the opposition who embarrassed us in the group stages. Here was an opportunity to right those wrongs. You go into the final, and you know it’s your one shot at creating memories for the rest of your life. Ultimately it was a step too far but it was close. But for a disallowed try and a couple of silly penalties, we could have done it. The loss will never go away – it still hurts now – but when I look back, that World Cup was my most enjoyable time in international rugby. Over a World Cup you build this rapport, this trust on the field with world-class players either side of you, but then you lose the final and suddenly you’re back home, and you have to wait two months to do it again. They’ll find it strange when they get back but you can’t overestimate how much this England side has improved because of having this time together. Now they’ve got one more experience to go through. From the outside, and talking to a few people close to the group, they’re getting everything right. England have always had big players in the pack but we’ve been found wanting in the breakdown, especially against the southern hemisphere teams. In the last two weeks, teams who usually school us in that area have been schooled themselves. Plus most of these guys have experience, they’ve got that hurt from the last World Cup, and you can’t put a price on how much that will drive true, competitive animals. You could see their focus at the end of the semi-final. When we beat France we were doing a lap of honour, hugging each other. These guys thanked the fans and then it was: “Job done, now let’s bring that trophy home.”"

          "headline": "Can the US government stem the tide of ‘fake news’ in a postmodern world?",
          "bodyText": "Three years into Donald Trump’s presidency, the moral panic over “fake news” and “post-truth” has not abated. If anything, it has now blossomed into a full-blown culture war. Conservatives insist that their views are suppressed by Facebook and Twitter; progressives accuse the same platforms of not doing enough to crack down on hate speech and foreign manipulation of elections. Mark Zuckerberg’s recent testimony in US Congress – where politicians competed to deal him the lethal rhetorical blow – doesn’t bode well for Silicon Valley. The Valley’s only savior, at this point, is the Communist Party of China. Only indefinite trade war with China will prevent US lawmakers from regulating the “strategic” tech sector; to break up the industry would weaken Washington’s global standing. The Trump administration is not blind to these risks. Invoking the Chinese threat has bought the tech companies some time but it won’t work forever. The impending tech bubble is only going to increase everyone’s hatred of Silicon Valley; the calls for action will grow louder. The public humiliations of WeWork and Uber, the former darlings of tech investors, are signs that public tolerance of highfalutin technology platforms (and their leaders) is already running short. More government regulation is, indeed, likely to follow – and stemming the tide of “fake news” would be one of the highest priorities. But just how strong is that tide? What remains unexamined – in the public debate but also in many academic discussions of “post-truth” – is the background assumption that ours is the time of postmodernism on steroids: a time where no firm truths hold and no single narrative can survive the assault of radically different worldviews grounded in diverse material, cultural, and racial experiences. To deny that something like this is happening – facilitated by the business models of digital platforms, their algorithmic nudges, and the filter bubbles that result thereof – would be disingenuous. But the fragmentation of truth is only one – and perhaps not the most important part – of the story. One unappreciated paradox of today’s “digital condition” is that it celebrates post-truth and hyper-truth simultaneously. As narratives get fragmented, allowing competing truths to proliferate, there’s also a concurrent effort to deploy bots, ledgers, and algorithms to produce a singular, objective, and eternal truth. The first stage of this “objectification” began with Wikipedia. Although the platform could be used to provide multiple readings and interpretations of any subject or phenomenon, a decision was taken that a “community” of editors and writers, armed with trustworthy and reliable sources, would converge upon a single interpretation of history. While the critics of Wikipedia zeroed in on the fact that it was, in a truly radical manner, democratizing the production of knowledge – everyone could contribute! – they missed a more fundamental, conservative side of the project: while many controversial topics featured lengthy and often bitter discussions among the editors, the front-end presentation often gave no explicit sign of internal disagreement. The controversy and disagreement were, thus, hidden from the average viewer. Instead, the proliferation of editorial and citational guidelines and regulations on Wikipedia ensured that those rules were presumed to have more say in determining the content of a page than the information supplied by the very subject of the entry. Hence the many curious cases of people complaining that Wikipedia has wrong information about them but they cannot change it as they are not presumed to be “authoritative” sources about themselves. This adherence to rationality and rules is the true modernist part of Wikipedia that has, so far, befuddled many of its observers. The second stage of the “objectification” of narrative began with the rapid explosion of the blockchain technology. It created the illusion that everything can be embedded in digits and eventually presented, in an unalterable manner, on the “ledger”: the final truth, set in stone, not to be altered by anyone. Applied to the narrow world of commercial transactions or computer events, this assumption appears harmless. Applied, however, to the more substantial issues – politics, arts, journalism – this “epistemology of the blockchain” creates the rather perverse expectation that, unless and until something has been packaged in a blockchain-friendly way, it must be corrupted by subjectivity, venality, or bias. Subjectivity is the enemy; opacity is sinful. In other words, we’re starting to see an irony of the “post-truth” world: the democratization of knowledge has been matched by the intensification of the bureaucratic model. This time, however, the human side of bureaucracy is presented as archaic and uncool, to be replaced by “objective” algorithms and ledgers. The one true utopia of this mode of thinking – already glimpsed in places like Singapore or Estonia – is a fully-automated bureaucratic system enforcing the rules with Prussian efficiency. The digital culture that ensues makes for a very odd beast. Not surprisingly, it’s conducive to the kind of cognitive dissonance feeding the alt-right. On the one hand, in a populist manner reminiscent of Wikipedia, it dispenses with expertise, as everyone is assumed to be equal to everyone else, much like the nodes on the blockchain network (another myth). On the other hand, it intensifies the modernist faith in rules and regulations – and the possibility of finding, by some quantitative means, the single truth, which can then be made available to all, without any intermediation by forces other than technology. If one had to come up with a label for this ideology, “populist modernism” would be quite appropriate. The contradictions of such a bizarre ideological mix are quite apparent: in dispensing with the experts, it replaces them with faith in “technology” and “progress”. But since such accounts usually lack any meaningful discussion of the political economy of technology (let alone that of progress), they have nowhere to fall back upon to explain historical change. What, after all, drives and shapes all that technology around us? In such accounts, “technology” is usually just a euphemism for a class of uber-human technologists and scientists, who, in their spare time, are ostensibly saving the world, mostly by inventing new apps and products. The experts, thus, are brought in through the back door, but without any formal acknowledgement (or possibility of democratic contestation). These experts – whether Wikipedia editors or blockchain engineers - are presented as mere appendages to the sheer force of technology and progress, when in reality they’re often its drivers. This is hardly the sort of secure, reliable foundation on which democratic culture can flourish. It’s one thing, in a typical postmodernist move, to celebrate “situated knowledges” and “multiple epistemes”, refuting any appeals to the one and only truth; a visit to a grad school seminar in humanities will confirm that this kind of language is still very much alive in academia. It’s quite another to do it while also building a system to algorithmically enforce the truth through the zealous application of bureaucratic rules and regulations that would make Otto von Bismarck look like a carefree bricoleur. Facebook, which is built on the populist assumption that horizontal communication among users trumps vertical preaching by experts, exemplifies this dilemma: for all its populism, it now faces the enviable task of using its algorithms to fight “fake news.” This, however, cannot be done without accepting the virtues of expertise and grounding one’s approach in a singular, coherent worldview. The problem with Facebook is that it doesn’t even know that it has this problem: it will, thus, most likely continue its schizophrenic efforts of groping in the dark, erecting the sort of expert-led bureaucracy that it was supposed to demolish. Nothing good will come out of such efforts, but they do highlight a fundamental truth that we seem to have forgotten: both fake news and its opposite, the excessive quest for hyper-rationalization, are the consequences – not causes! – of our problems. Postmodernism did not begin in Mark Zuckerberg’s dorm room. Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist"

          "headline": "Google Pixel 4 review: a good phone ruined by poor battery life",
          "bodyText": "Google is one of only a handful of smartphone manufacturers still making flagship phones that aren’t ginormous beasts, with the new Pixel 4 the cheapest in a while that significantly undercuts the competition. Priced at £669, the Pixel 4 is £70 cheaper than last year’s Pixel 3 and £60 cheaper than Apple’s iPhone 11. It’s also cheaper than its bigger sibling the £829 Pixel 4 XL. The concern is: which corners have been cut and do they matter? The 5.7in FHD+ OLED display has the same 90Hz refresh rate as the larger 6.3in version on the Pixel 4 XL. It looks very similar too, with good viewing angles, inky blacks and bold colours and smooth experience thanks to that high refresh rate. But it’s not the brightest screen available, which makes it fine for most things but not quite as bright as I would like in direct sunlight. There’s the same large forehead containing the sensors for Google’s new Face Unlock and Motion Sense systems. The sides are aluminium, but with a black textured coating, while the glass back is frosted with a texture similar to super-smooth skin. Buy the white or orange version and the contrasting colours make the Pixel 4 stand out. Combined with its slender proportions of just 68.8mm wide and 162g, the Pixel 4 is one of the smallest, lightest and easiest of top-end smartphones to hold and use. It’s a joy to be able to easily use a smartphone one-handed again. For comparison, Apple’s £1,049 iPhone 11 Pro is currently the best smaller phone available, but it’s 71.4mm wide and 188g, while the £799 Samsung Galaxy S10 is 70.4mm wide and 157g. Specifications Screen: 5.7in FHD+ OLED (90Hz, 444ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB of RAM Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Android 10 Camera: Dual rear cameras (12.2+16MP) with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 5, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5, GPS, 3D face recognition Dimensions: 68.8 x 147.1 x 8.2mm Weight: 162g Awful battery life The Pixel 4 has the same 6GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 as the Pixel 4 XL and performs identically – fast and fluid, but not quite as speedy as the OnePlus 7T. Battery life was really poor. The Pixel 4 only lasts just over 14 hours between charges. Remove it from the charger at 7am and it will be dead by 9pm. Turning off the bells and whistles such as the ambient display only added about 40 minutes to the battery life. Anything under 24 hours simply is not good enough, particularly given I didn’t play any games or do anything particularly battery-draining. That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, two hours of browsing in Chrome, four hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 40 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and three photos. For comparison, similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro lasts 32 hours and the Pixel 4 XL lasts 26 hours under similar conditions, while the majority of smartphones in 2019 can last at least 24 hours with heavy usage. The Pixel 4 fast charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, of which one is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took 105 minutes hitting 70% in 45 minutes. Android 10 The Pixel 4 is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, complete with system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation. At least three years of software updates from the phone’s release are included and it will get Android version updates before most other devices. The Pixel 4 also has the same new on-device natural language processing that was so impressive on the larger Pixel 4 XL. Google Assistant is much faster and works without an internet connection for many tasks. Google’s voice transcription app is equally excellent, as is the Live Caption feature. The new Assistant still doesn’t work with Google’s own commercial G Suite accounts though, which is a bit of a blunder. Google says it’s still working on a fix. Motion Sense Motion Sense uses radar to track motions around the phone. It lights up the ambient screen when you’re within 60cm, will silence calls or snooze alarms when you reach for the phone, and skip music tracks when you swipe in mid-air above it. The technology is more impressive than the functionality currently. Face Unlock Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new Face Unlock using 3D face recognition technology similar to Apple’s Face ID. It’s seriously fast and worked through polarised sunglasses just fine. Look at the phone and it’ll unlock, skipping the lockscreen and taking you straight back into the last thing you were doing. Although technically you don’t need to actually look at it, as it’ll unlock with your eyes closed, which might be a problem for some. Google says it’ll add the option to require attention at a later date. The biggest issue is that most third-party apps do not recognise Face Unlock, meaning without a fingerprint scanner they just assume the Pixel 4 doesn’t have a biometric input forcing you back to entering pins or passwords, which is tedious. To use Face Unlock developers need to update their apps to support the new unified biometric system built into Android, with only a small handful having done so currently. For those that have done, such as LastPass, using Face Unlock is a seamless experience – just as Face ID is on an iPhone. Given Monzo is saying it will take a while to implement, you can probably forget your traditional banking apps working soon. Camera Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the new dual-camera system on the back of the Pixel 4 is no different. It’s the same camera as that fitted to the Pixel 4 XL and performs the same. That is to say it has fantastic still image quality, even in very difficult lighting conditions. Google is still the market leader with its Night Sight ultra-low light mode, but others have caught up considerably. New for this year is the ability to independently adjust the brightness of the background and foreground, which works very well. Portrait mode is improved, as is the up to 8x zoom thanks to the extra camera on the back. The selfie camera is relatively wide angle and pretty good, too. Not so good is video capture, which caps out at 4K at 30 frames per second, not the 60fps rivals manage. Observations If you have your phone by your bed at night the ambient screen never shuts off because you’re typically within the Motion Sense bubble all the time There’s a new Pokemon live wallpaper where you can wave at or pet Pikachu and others using Motion Sense You only get free “high quality” image and video backup in Google Photos, not the full, original size backup that was included for three years with previous Pixel phones Price The Google Pixel 4 costs £669 ($799) with 64GB or £769 ($899) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the smaller Google Pixel 4 XL costs £829 ($899), the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the Samsung Galaxy S10 costs £799, the iPhone 11 costs £729 and the iPhone 11 Pro costs £1,049. Verdict The Google Pixel 4 is a potentially great phone hampered by really poor battery life. It doesn’t really matter how good you make a phone if it dies before the day is out. And that’s a real shame as there aren’t that many manufacturers making fully-featured flagship smartphones in smaller sizes. The screen is good and big enough. The camera is amazing. Motion Sense is novel and Face Unlock is seriously fast. The on-device natural language understanding is next level and Google’s software magic is thoroughly impressive. But the Pixel 4 suffers from the same issues with G Suite, limited scenarios in which the screen works at 90Hz, lack of third-party app support for Face Unlock and no gaze-requirement for unlocking the phone as the Pixel 4 XL. Even a comparatively lower cost of £669 isn’t enough to save the Pixel 4. If only Google had given it a bigger battery the Pixel 4 could have been one of the best smartphones on the market. Instead this feels like Google’s iPhone 7 moment – a great phone ruined by terrible battery life. Pros: amazing on-device natural language processing, next-generation Google Assistant, brilliant camera, Face unlock, Google Recorder app, Android 10 + fast updates, 90Hz screen Cons: terrible battery life, poor third-party app support for Face unlock, Face unlock needs eyes-open fix, Google Assistant needs G Suite fix Other reviews Best smartphone 2019: iPhone, OnePlus, Samsung and Huawei compared and ranked Pixel 3a review: the people’s Google phone?

          "bodyText": "Just like fashion, football seasons are primed around newness. As well as players, rivalries and bids for the title, three new kits arrive for each Premier League club every year. But the rise of the vintage football shirt market means this could be changing. Increasingly, fans are moving through the turnstiles on match day in old shirts. They may have got lucky, by finding one in a local charity shop, but most of these are sought-after; some particularly hallowed shirts are worth thousands of pounds and hyped up as sacred objects. Online, the world of vintage football shirts sees many young men (it is mostly young men) debate the intricacies of different seasons, graphics and even the sponsors that appear across the shirts. Cult kits include the 1993-95 Manchester City kit (worn by Liam Gallagher), Coventry’s brown kit from 1978, Manchester United’s treble-winning kit from 1999 and Arsenal’s bruised banana away kit from 1990. This last one has such a mighty reputation that Arsenal’s away kit for 2019/20 revived the pattern – the club even rolled it out with a campaign featuring Ian Wright, who played in the original kit. Gary Bierton, the general manager of the website Classic Football Shirts, says it is not just about aesthetics – the nostalgia is inspired by what happened on the pitch. “Generally speaking, if it was involved in an iconic moment or triumph, then it will have a solid reputation,” he says. “So, the Liverpool 1989/90 kit, the Holland ’88 kit, Arsenal ’05, worn in the last season at Highbury.” One of those Liverpool shirts is on the site for £349.99. As well as feeling nostalgia for a particular season, fans also get emotional about their club in a certain era – and also their lives when they might have first worn the kit. Michael Maxwell founded the Football Shirt Collective with a few friends in 2014, since when it has grown to become a community where people can wax lyrical about old kits. “We realised it was a really emotive thing,” he says. “We wanted a place for the shirts and the stories behind the shirts.” Of course, it is not all about the touchy-feely. The Football Shirt Collective has a marketplace section on its site where shirts can be bought and sold. Maxwell compares the growing market to the Hypebeast scene for collectible trainers, as seen on sites such as Grailed and StockX (think a specialised eBay, with nicer graphic design). “I initially thought the vintage football shirt market was a bubble, but if it’s following the trainer cycle it’s only going to grow,” says Maxwell. Andrew Groves, the curator of Invisible Men, an exhibition about British menswear that features vintage football shirts, says it fits into the collecting culture that we have seen with trainers, but is more specialised. “To hunt down that really rare football shirts takes a lot of work,” he says. Indeed. The likes of Kendall Jenner and Drake have worn football merchandise, presumably for aesthetic reasons, with Juventus particularly favoured. The stylist Steph Stevens – an Arsenal fan – has brought a 1971 Gunners shirt to her shoots. But, by and large, the vintage football shirt world has an “if you know, you know” mentality at its heart. This is a concept that makes a lot of sense in modern football culture, where the fanbase (in the Premier League anyway) is increasingly housed in a corporate climate characterised by huge stadiums, endless sponsorship deals and tickets hovering at the £50 mark. Groves says the most popular shirts hark back to the late 80s and early 90s, when “football as a sport was less dictated by huge amounts of money. It feels less cynical than how football shirts are marketed now.” Wearing a vintage shirt to a game shows you are not just there for a day out – it signals that you know your stuff. Wearing one “shows you’re not a plastic tourist fan,” says Maxwell. Eighteen86, a website that describes its offering as “100% unofficial Arsenal merchandise”, was set up by the fans Ed Fenwick and Max Giles in 2016. In addition to T-shirts bearing images of Thierry Henry and Patrick Vieira in their youth, and stickers that are a familiar sight around the Emirates stadium, they have gone beyond the shirt market to sell vintage Arsenal merch – training gear, fan T-shirts and more. The specificity of these pieces is what makes them popular. “It’s the era of merch that we and most of our followers grew up with,” says Fenwick. “The only rule we have is we don’t sell anything with the new crest on it – because we hate it and so do most of our followers – or the actual kits themselves.”"

          "headline": "'We're cosseting our kids' – the war against today's dangerously dull playgrounds",
          "bodyText": "In the decades after the second world war, the celebrated architect Aldo van Eyck designed more than 700 playgrounds in Amsterdam, filling bomb sites with dazzling constellations of tumbling bars, leapfrog posts and climbing domes. His idea was that by providing children with a range of elemental forms and open-ended structures – rather than swings, roundabouts and other playground staples – their creativity would be stimulated and they would invent new games. These “tools for the imagination”, as he called his kit of sandpits, frames and posts, became a familiar part of Amsterdam’s streetscape, a connected galaxy of playtime fragments that spread across the city, from public spaces and even to roadside verges, never fenced off. It was a vision of play without walls, the protected domain of the child thrown open and spilling over into the rest of the city. Van Eyck’s pioneering work is one of the highlights of Play Well, a new exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London. This fun, candy-coloured romp through the transformative power of play is nothing if not wide-ranging: it explores the work of Friedrich Fröbel, inventor the kindergarten; the role of ad-hoc “play labs” set up by humanitarian organisations in refugee camps; and the rarefied realm of adult larping, or live-action role-playing, for those who wish it was Halloween every day – from battle re-enactors to bonnet-wearing Jane Austen superfans. For Van Eyck, the playground was the place where the child could be “lord of the city”. As well as extending children’s sense of urban ownership, his fence-free compounds encouraged a more relaxed attitude to risk. Some were even located on the central reservations of roads – forcing children and cars to be more aware of each other, making the city feel like a more equal, accessible place. Van Eyck’s work was lauded by architects and psychologists, but the idea of kids freed from fences set alarm bells ringing among the health and safety lobby in more conservative parts of the world, and his ideas were rarely repeated elsewhere. This sense of owning the streets is also captured in the postwar photography of Bert Hardy, Nigel Henderson and Shirley Baker, displayed alongside Van Eyck’s designs. Their striking black-and-white images depict a bygone era of kids playing outside, using whatever scraps they could find, very much lords of the city with their catapults and toy guns at the ready. There’s an air of anarchy, one that children’s rights activist Lady Marjory Allen encouraged in her promotion of junk playgrounds around the same time. These were later rebranded as adventure playgrounds to make the idea more palatable to nervous parents and local authorities. “Children are needlessly overprotected by adults,” she says in a film from the 1970s. “They’re never given any freedom to explore and experiment and find out what the world is all about.” The camera then cuts to kids rampaging around one of her wild playgrounds, full of scavenged junk and firepits. “Here, they can play with very dangerous tools,” she says proudly, in a cut-glass accent. “They can create their own houses, their own climbing frames. They can take really dangerous risks and overcome them. And above all, it’s a place where they can meet their friends, where they can make new friends, in a very free and permissive atmosphere.” Allen had been inspired by a trip to Denmark in 1945, where she saw the work of architect Carl Theodor Sørensen. His skrammellegepladsen, or junk playgrounds, were visions of creative chaos, made mostly by children themselves. She helped set up 17 trial junk playgrounds in the UK, equipped with makeshift treehouses, walkways, nets, ropes and rubber tyres. The very first, at Lollard Street in London’s Kennington, is still going strong. “Ideas about play haven’t changed much since then,” says Nicola Butler, chair of Play England, who co-authored the charity’s Design for Play guidance in 2008 – and then discovered that Allen had written a pamphlet of the same name in 1962, outlining almost identical principles. “The more objects that children can actually manipulate themselves, the more enjoyment they will get out of a playground.” Butler was concerned that playgrounds had become increasingly risk-averse, as a result of the claims culture of the 1990s and 2000s. “Climbing frames were getting smaller, roundabouts and swings were going more slowly and being designed with more restrictive movement. When playgrounds become really safe and boring, kids climb on top of bus shelters instead because it’s more fun.” This pro-risk view is shared by landscape architect Jennette Emery-Wallis, designer of the award-winning Diana Memorial Playground in Kensington Gardens and the equally acclaimed Tumbling Bay in Olympic Park, designed with Erect Architecture. The former is a piratical Peter Pan fantasy, featuring a great galleon marooned in a sandy sea, with rigging to climb, a crow’s nest to look out from, and a hold to explore, surrounded by a magical landscape dotted with teepees, Wendy houses and dammable water channels. “Until recently, many playgrounds were just the result of going to a supplier and asking for a KFC,” says Emery-Wallis, referring not to a finger-lickin’ bucket of fried chicken, but a “kit, fence and carpet”, the go-to trinity for the lazy playground procurer. “With the Diana project, we tried to break the mould, designing a place full of character and texture that kids would want to explore, giving them autonomy to make it their own.” Rather than a playground dotted with equipment, it is conceived as an entire landscaped world, with specific zones, each with their own characters and themes from the Peter Pan story. Like Butler, she says the key is allowing children to manipulate their environment, the two crucial ingredients being sand and water. At Tumbling Bay, visitors are drawn through a hazel copse and birch woodland, encouraging them to make their own dens, next to an elaborate sand and water area where they can become mini-engineers. There’s also a more adventurous woodland with treetop pods and rope bridges. The lack of health and safety paraphernalia is refreshing, with sheer drops, rope swings and four-metre-high fireman’s poles. It’s all designed, says Emery-Wallis, “for proper risk-taking and getting dirt under your fingernails”. It might look more expensive than your average council KFC, but 80% of the materials were scavenged from Olympic leftovers. As for the increased dangers, she says Play England has a rigorous assessment system that measures the risk against benefit. “You’ve got to have a sense of risk and excitement,” she says, “otherwise we’re cosseting our kids in a bubble-wrapped world.” In Berlin, the adventurous spirit has been taken to the extreme in the form of Kolle 37, a mini-metropolis of tree forts, walkways and dens, built entirely by children, with a little grownup supervision. Along with plentiful supplies of hammers, saws, nails and wood, it has pottery kilns, a blacksmith’s forge and a bike rental shop where older kids can work – making it not only the city’s most fun playground, but its most industrious. As attitudes to risk relax, some of Van Eyck’s ideas are gaining ground once again. Emery-Wallis’s practice, Land Use Consultants (LUC), is working with developers and councils to integrate fence-free play areas into their housing schemes, attempting to expand play out into the city, in accordance with the Dutchman’s vision. “I hope we end up full circle,” she says, “with even wilder, riskier play opportunities everywhere – and not just for children aged two to 10. We should be thinking about multigenerational play, tackling loneliness, getting everyone more active outdoors.” It could be the gateway to a more equitable city, one that works for everyone. As Van Eyck put it: “If we create a playground well, we create a world in which man rediscovers what is essential – and the city rediscovers the child.” • Play Well is at the Wellcome Collection, London, until 8 March."

          "bodyText": "Residents of Penzance, Cornwall, the UK’s first “plastic-free” town, were understandably piqued this week to find that 150 Christmas trees had been put up – every single one made of plastic. Local business chiefs behind the move defended their decision to opt for fake trees for the community and insisted they were more sustainable than the fresh alternative – which would later have to be burned – and could be dusted off and reused for many years. Artificial trees used to be a manky wire frame with a bit of tinsel attached, typically left forgotten in the loft along with their tangled Christmas lights. But modern-day tree technology has leapt forward and uses injection moulding to create realistic sprigs. Even close up, the pricier artificial ones can fool most consumers into thinking they are real. But looks are not everything. With major retailers such as John Lewis reporting that “faux” or artificial trees typically made from plastic are now outselling traditional fresh trees, are the ersatz ones an environmental nightmare? According to the Carbon Trust, it is the manufacture of the plastic, from oil, that creates most – around two-thirds – of their carbon emissions. A further quarter is created by the industrial emissions produced when the tree itself is made. Their carbon footprint is boosted by the trees typically being shipped by container from China before arriving in the shops. Friends of the Earth is advising consumers who have fake trees to keep using them for as long as possible (and today’s versions will last for years) but to look into more environmentally friendly options when it comes to a replacement. Its tree campaigner Emi Murphy says: “Buying a potted tree with roots lets you grow it outside and use it again year after year, reducing its environmental impact and costing you less. A living tree will carry on absorbing carbon from the atmosphere for years to come. The other option to check out is the tree-rental service offered by many garden centres and plant nurseries.” Alternatively, string some fairy lights over a houseplant you already have. Meanwhile, Penzance could take inspiration from London’s fashion district Carnaby Street, which is promising a “world-first” sustainable ocean-style Christmas installation to be unveiled next week. Every element will use recycled and reusable materials. These include repurposed fishing netting to look like green kelp, more than 500m of post-use bubble wrap standing in for coral and more than 1,500 recycled plastic bottles for fish and bubbles. The finishing touches have been added in with over 100 litres of water-based eco-friendly, vegan paint. Eat your heart out, David Attenborough."

          "bodyText": "In politics, feelings are powerful. We are used to the idea that politicians can harness our anger, or our fear, to get us to believe certain things and behave in certain ways. But more and more, it is not our anger or fear that politicians appeal to, but our exhaustion. Exhaustion has become a rhetorical weapon for both sides of the Brexit divide: from some Brexiteers embracing the slogan “Bored of Brexit, Pass The Deal”, to the remainers claiming that only revoking article 50 will avoid years of wrangling over our new relationship with the EU. Equally, it is a political cudgel against MPs (remain or leave) who refuse to take an “easy” way out of Brexit, demanding more time for scrutiny of the deal, or a more careful, deliberative process for the public to have their say. This works because Westminster seems to believe it. For political journalists, “Brenda from Bristol” remains a symbol of the public mood – “I can’t stand this – there’s too much politics going on at the moment,” she said when Theresa May called a snap general election in 2017. Knocking on Brenda’s door has become a strange new ritual for political journalists whenever new elections are rumoured. But with yet another general election six weeks away, exhaustion does not capture how we really feel about politics. In fact, the era of “too much politics” – which began after the 2015 general election – has seen a heightened level of interest in politics, reversing a sharp decline in the early 2010s. According to the Hansard Society, Brexit and the recent wave of elections have acted as “electric shock therapy” for political engagement. Recent months have also revealed the public’s willingness to consume politics: viewing figures for BBC Parliament have spiked, especially during key moments in the Brexit process. The public, on balance, actually welcomes the snap election. Across a swath of polling data, the most direct questions indicate that opposition to an election is running at just 20-30%, while support is in the 40s. There are nuances to this: in other polls, people narrowly back a referendum over an election, while remainers tend to be most favourable to having any electoral event (an election or referendum) take place. However, none of the data supports the idea that we are a nation of Brendas. Indeed, even in 2017 Brenda was an outlier: after Theresa May called the election, voters said it was the right thing to do by a 3:1 margin. Why, then, is Westminster so willing to believe that Brenda speaks for Britain? The first reason is that in recent years politicians and journalists have treated “apathy” as a key challenge to the political system in Britain. That began with the 2001 election and its very low turnout, and continued in 2015 with Russell Brand’s call for mass abstention. This way of thinking has dominated most political journalists’ careers, and has likely informed their view of how the average Briton feels about politics. The second is Westminster’s growing anxieties about its isolation from a “real Britain” outside London. Because national politics is so centred on the capital, political journalists fear that Westminster seems alien to the large majority who live beyond the M25. Giving prominence to the Brendas among us, then, is intended to show that political obsessives can understand how people feel outside the bubble. But in doing so it overcorrects, exaggerating public disengagement. Of course, rising public interest in politics doesn’t guarantee that turnout will increase or even hold up. Indeed, there are valid concerns about what a bleak midwinter election could do to turnout. Britain so rarely has general elections in winter that it is hard to judge. Research has shown that at council by-elections, which do take place throughout the year, turnout is between three to nine percentage points lower in December than in any other month. Yet with the heightened stakes of a general election, voters might feel it is worth the effort to brave the cold and the dark. The public, then, is still engaged with politics, and ready for whatever an election may bring. If anything keeps people away from the polls this winter, it’s more likely to be snow than “Brexhaustion”. Of course, we may eventually reach a point where political exhaustion does set in – but it may be that passions and fears over Brexit prevent that moment from ever arriving. At a time when the Brexit outcome has become so important to our political identities, can there ever really be “too much politics”? • Lawrence McKay is a PhD candidate in politics at the University of Manchester"

          "headline": "Google Pixel 4 XL review: not quite ready for primetime",
          "bodyText": "Google’s latest Pixel 4 XL smartphone is its bravest yet, throwing out the conventions of old, integrating cutting-edge technology and attempting to round it all out with a special mix of software direct from the Android-maker. By now you probably know the drill. The Pixel 4 XL is a metal and glass sandwich like practically every other phone. Unlike most though the aluminium sides have a black textured coating, which aids grip, while the back feels almost like super-smooth skin or silk rather than glass. It also has bold, contrasting colours, if you choose the white or orange variant, that make it stand out well against the competition. The 6.3in QHD+ OLED screen is big but not massive by today’s 6.5in-plus standards. It has a 90Hz refresh rate, but just in certain lighting conditions for now, which Google says it’s working on a fix to increase. Generally it makes the experience of using it smoother and more fluid. It’s crisp, colourful and has good viewing angles but can’t reach the same super-bright heights as rivals – the 90Hz display on the OnePlus 7T Pro has far more wow factor. A chunky top bezel hides a new Face Unlock system and Google’s new party trick: the Soli radar system. The Pixel 4 XL is a large phone that doesn’t feel too big in the hand. The textured sides and frosted glass back help with grip. I never felt I would drop it. At 8.2mm thick and 75.1mm wide it compares favourably to Apple’s iPhone 11 Pro Max and the OnePlus 7T Pro, while undercutting both by as much as 29g. It feels like a phone you’re meant to use without a case, rather than something that needs protecting – although dropping it runs the risk of it smashing, like any other phone, so whether people will use it without a case is another matter. The bottom has a USB-C port, the back supports wireless charging, there’s an accent colour on the power button and you can still squeeze the sides on the bottom half of the phone to activate Google Assistant. Specifications Screen: 6.3in QHD+ OLED (90Hz, 537ppi) Processor: octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 RAM: 6GB Storage: 64 or 128GB Operating system: Android 10 Camera: Dual rear cameras (12.2+16MP) with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera Connectivity: LTE, wifi 5, NFC, eSIM, Bluetooth 5, GPS, 3D face recognition Dimensions: 75.1 x 160.4 x 8.2mm Weight: 193g Speed, but not for long The Pixel 4 XL has 6GB of RAM, at least 64GB of storage and one of Qualcomm’s top processors, the Snapdragon 855, which was only recently replaced by the slightly faster 855+ as used in the OnePlus 7T and 7T Pro. In day-to-day tasks the Pixel 4 XL felt fast and fluid – significantly faster than a Samsung Galaxy S10, but not quite as super-slick as the OnePlus 7T. Most will be very happy and the Pixel 4 XL is likely to continue feeling fast and responsive a couple of years down the line if the previous generation Pixels are anything to go by. What’s not so great is battery life. The Pixel 4 XL only lasts just over 26 hours between charges with medium usage, which means 7am on day one until 9am on day two in the working week. That’s not really long enough to guarantee the Pixel 4 XL will be alive and kicking at the end of a night out to see you home. That was while using it as my primary device, with 200 or so emails, messages and push notifications, a couple of hours of browsing in Chrome, five hours of Spotify via Bluetooth headphones, 50 minutes of Into the Badlands from Amazon Prime Video, and taking about 15 photos. For comparison, the OnePlus 7T lasts 34 hours or the similarly sized iPhone 11 Pro Max lasts just shy of 48 hours under similar conditions. Turning off the ambient display feature added about two hours to the battery life. The Pixel 4 XL fast-charges at up to 18W via any USB-C Power Delivery charger, one of which is included in the box, and wirelessly charges at up to 11W. A full charge via cable took just under two hours, hitting 70% in 50 minutes. Android 10 The Pixel 4 XL is one of the first smartphones to ship with the latest version of Android 10, here with a level of polish only OnePlus rivals, and a bunch of Pixel-exclusive features, some of which will make it to third-party smartphones at some point. Android 10 introduced a system-wide dark mode, full theming support for changing colours, icon shapes, typefaces and more, and vastly improved gesture navigation, which makes using large-screen smartphones a lot easier. You’re going to get at least three years of software updates from the release of the phone, and major Android version updates before anyone else. The big new Pixel 4 XL software advance is on-device natural language processing. Normally when you speak to your phone for Assistant, search or similar, it sends what you say across the internet to be understood on Google’s server farm. Now Google has managed to make that technology run on the phone itself, with some very impressive results. It’s considerably faster, recognising what you say instantly, doesn’t require an internet connection, and is better for privacy because your voice doesn’t leave the device. A new version of Assistant uses it to great effect. You can rattle off commands at breakneck speeds and it will understand the lot. If you want to open the camera, shoot a photo and share it to a friend you can now do it faster with your voice than you probably can with taps. The Google Recorder app is equally impressive, transcribing voice recordings on-device in real time and tying text and audio together so you can search through them. Lastly Google’s new Live Captions can put subtitles on any video, even if it’s muted – perfect for those who can’t turn the sound up but want to know what’s happening in a video. These thoroughly impressive software features are what Google does best. Unfortunately the new Assistant only works in US English for now. Worse, you can’t use it if you have a G Suite account (Google’s commercial services including email) logged into your phone. Google says it’s working on a fix. Motion Sense One of the products of Google’s advanced projects research division is Soli, which is a miniaturised radar system enabling the new Motion Sense feature. It detects when you’re within 60cm and shows the ambient display. Reaching for the phone lights up the screen fully and gets it ready to recognise your face, but it can also snooze alarms and silence calls. A swipe through the air above the phone can skip tracks in music apps or from the lockscreen, and more gestures are promised. It worked well when on a desk, but was harder to trigger when handheld. The technology is certainly novel and works surprisingly well, but these sorts of gestures aren’t a new thing and I’m not sure Google has hit on the killer feature for Soli yet. Face Unlock Google has dumped the fingerprint scanner for its new 3D face recognition technology. Face Unlock works essentially the same way as Apple’s Face ID, except faster. A little too fast in some instances, unlocking the phone when I didn’t actually intend to. A simple glance at the phone is all that’s required, although you don’t actually need to have your eyes open for it to recognise you – which might be a problem for those with prying partners. Google says it’s working on a fix (can you spot the trend here?). It works through polarised sunglasses and not once did it fail to recognise me. By default it skips the lockscreen and opens the phone straight up to whatever you were doing, which I wish Apple’s Face ID did. But most third-party apps don’t support Face Unlock now. That’s because to do so they have to implement a new unified biometric system which allows the phone to decide whether to use a fingerprint, a face or something else. Most don’t, which means they don’t even see the Face Unlock system. Used to just using my fingerprint for everything, I’d forgotten what a pain entering strong pins or 55-digit passwords into apps can be. Once apps are updated, using Face Unlock with apps such as LastPass is a fantastic, seamless experience; the kind of experience you’ve had on a top iPhone for the last three years. Fewer than 10 apps currently do so, though. And even leaders in fintech such as Monzo are saying it will take a while to implement, so you can forget your traditional banking apps. At least this one isn’t up to Google to fix. Camera Google has made a name for itself with some of the best smartphone cameras on the market, and the Pixel 4 XL is no different, now with a dual-camera system on the back. It is arguably the best point-and-shoot camera available. Still photos are full of drama and with an amazing amount of detail, even in very difficult lighting conditions. New for the Pixel 4 XL is the ability to manually alter the foreground and background brightness independently. Portrait mode for people, pets or objects is also improved particularly around things such as wisps of hair. A 2x telephoto camera has significantly improved the zoom, using the firm’s Super Res Zoom technology to reach to 8x while still preserving a lot of fine detail. It compares favourably with the iPhone 11 Pro, but can’t hold a candle to the 5x optical and up to 50x digital zoom of the Huawei P30 Pro. Google’s Night Sight mode continues to lead the market in capability and flexibility, and can now shoot three-minute exposures of stars with astrological mode – not that I could test that given the British weather over the last two weeks. The single selfie camera is also good, with a wider angle than most front-facing cameras. Video capture is generally solid, but caps out at 4K at 30fps and is by no means market-leading. If video is your medium of choice there are better cameras than the Pixel 4 XL. The lack of the fun ultrawide-angle camera popular with other manufacturers is also disappointing, as is Google dumping free full-resolution Photos backup, which has been a Pixel value-add for years. Observations If you have your phone by your bed at night the ambient screen never shuts off because you’re typically within the Motion Sense bubble all the time – there really needs to be a scheduler or for the display to turn off when you activate do-not-disturb mode. There’s a new Pokemon live wallpaper where you can wave at or pet Pikachu and others using Motion Sense. Price The Google Pixel 4 XL costs £829 ($899) with 64GB or £929 ($999) with 128GB of storage. For comparison, the smaller Google Pixel 4 costs £669 ($799), the OnePlus 7T costs £549, the OnePlus 7T Pro costs £699, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ costs £899, the Samsung Galaxy Note 10+ costs £999, the iPhone 11 costs £729 and the iPhone 11 Pro Max costs £1,149. Verdict There will be a time when the Google Pixel 4 XL might be a great phone, but that time isn’t now. I love the design, the feel, the 90Hz screen and incredible camera. The new on-device natural language understanding is a marvel. The next-generation Google Assistant feels like we’re finally putting the kind of AI we’re used to seeing in films in our phones, not on some server somewhere providing the illusion of being in our devices. This is the smartest phone I’ve ever used and I genuinely enjoyed Google’s moments of magic. But for every feature that’s good, there’s a problem that needs fixing. The screen’s great, but not always at 90Hz and not always bright enough, and the battery life just isn’t long enough for a top-end phone in 2019. The fact that the new Assistant doesn’t work when you have a G Suite account on your phone – a product made and sold to companies by Google – is frankly embarrassing. As is the oversight that some may want to make sure they’re actually looking at their phone with their eyes before it unlocks – Apple knew this and has had it in Face ID for three years. The biggest issue for me, however, is that the Android app ecosystem just isn’t ready for a phone that has dumped the fingerprint sensor. Face Unlock is genuinely great. A transformational leap just as Face ID was three years ago on the iPhone X, but only when it works. And it doesn’t work in my banking apps, my security apps or Evernote. Only one app I routinely use a fingerprint with supports Face Unlock. That situation will change once all the apps have been updated, but I’m not holding my breath for the very slow-moving banks to support Face Unlock any time soon, and that’s a real problem. The Pixel 4 XL is therefore a very hard phone to grade. Once Google fixes the problems and apps have been updated, the only thing really holding the phone back is below-average battery life. If that’s something you can live with, and you trust Google to fix things, then by all means buy the Pixel 4 XL. But at £829, or really £929 if you want a reasonable 128GB of storage space, there are better, problem-free experiences to be had out there from the likes of OnePlus, and for less money too. Pros: amazing on-device natural language processing, next-generation Google Assistant, brilliant camera, Face Unlock, Google Recorder app, Android 10 + fast updates, 90Hz screen. Cons: poor third-party app support for Face Unlock, Face Unlock needs eyes-open fix, Google Assistant needs G Suite fix, below-average battery life, no fingerprint scanner option.

          "headline": "John Lewis trials sustainability schemes at Oxford store",
          "bodyText": "John Lewis has stopped selling 5p single-use plastic carrier bags at its Oxford store as part of a major trial to test and change shoppers’ behaviour. The sustainability initiatives, which were unveiled on Monday, are aimed at encouraging a “reduce, reuse and return” culture among customers and could provide a model for its other shops. The pilot will test eight ways in which both the retailer and its customers can lessen their impact on the planet, including reducing plastic and excess packaging in order to prevent it from going to landfill. John Lewis’s Oxford store has removed 5p plastic carrier bags from all till areas and instead encourages customers to bring a bag, or buy a reusable one. Over a year it is estimated that this could save 5 tonnes of plastic. The shop will also become the first in the retailing chain in the UK to trial a reusable “click and collect” bag made from 100% recycled materials. One in four orders will be delivered to the shop in these reusable bags, meaning customers will be handed their orders without any additional packaging. Stephen Cawley, the head of sustainability at John Lewis said: “Our customers have told us they want us to help them reduce their impact on the planet and that reducing and recycling packaging is key for them. Our message that we want customers to take away just the product that they love and reduce and reuse the packaging that they don’t, will be clearly communicated throughout the shop.” Cawley said sales of plastic carrier bags across John Lewis had fallen by 30% since the introduction of the 5p charge in England in October 2015. But the chain still sold 11.5 million bags last year. “That is an unacceptable amount of plastic” he said. As concern grows about the effect of single-use plastic on the environment, manufacturers and retailers have begun to tackle their substantial carbon footprints. Last month Sainsbury’s said selling milk and fizzy drinks in returnable glass bottles was an option, while Tesco will ban brands that use excessive packaging from its stores from next year. In other measures introduced at John Lewis’s Oxford store, recyclable eco-wrap is being substituted for bubble wrap for china and glass products. Customers can also bring back hangers – from any retailer or brand – to be reused or recycled. The shop will also reward My John Lewis membership cardholders who return empty beauty product packaging and used clothing with gift vouchers. The so-called BeautyCycle scheme, which was tested earlier this year, is being permanently introduced this week to 36 John Lewis shops with a beauty department. Customers booking home delivery for larger items will be offered the chance to help reduce carbon emissions by selecting an “eco-delivery” slot when a van would be close to their home. The trial will continue into next year and the retailer will evaluate customer feedback before deciding whether to roll it out. It has 50 shops across the UK (36 department stores, 12 John Lewis at home and shops at St Pancras station in London and Heathrow’s Terminal 2) as well as online shop johnlewis.com. The chain has taken a leaf out of the book of its sister retailer Waitrose – also part of the John Lewis Partnership – in choosing Oxford as a testbed. In June Waitrose launched a trial of its Unpacked system at the local Botley Road store to gauge shoppers’ reactions to packaging-free food and drink options including the use of refills, a concept that is being scrutinised by its competitors."

          "headline": "The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of modern finance",
          "bodyText": "It happens every few years – not quite with the regularity of the seasons but with the inevitability of a natural disaster. A new company is founded on the basis of a new and seemingly ingenious concept, and then rocket-fuelled by growth-boosting investor capital. It briefly burns bright and then implodes, collapsing under the weight of its own balance sheet. The latest tech financial calamity is WeWork, an office space and “workplace solutions” operator that is now shrinking rapidly, after a planned initial public offering (IPO) was scrapped when potential investors rejected its absurd $20bn (£15.5bn) valuation. WeWork’s collapse is a business-school study in the excesses of private capital in an unregulated market that fetishises the wealth-creating genius of the lone pioneer. WeWork’s strategy wasn’t simply to fulfil a practical need: its aim was market domination, to be achieved by undercutting its competitors in a race to the bottom, using investor capital as oxygen to sustain losses while other serviced office-space providers ran out of breath and expired. The idea was then to leverage its reach to name its terms and prices. But despite investors’ indulgence of loss-making ventures that promise enormous future profits, WeWork tested that tolerance with a loss of $219,000 (£171,000) every hour while failing to reach ubiquity fast enough. What WeWork was offering – workspaces and hot desks for the urban freelance – was not, to use the jargon of such companies’ own marketing, sufficiently “game changing”. Adam Neumann, WeWork’s now ejected founder, is making off with a $1.7bn reward for failing to achieve his vision and appearing to lose investors eye-watering sums of money. As with most tales of financial hubris and reckless over-expansion, the architect absconds with the spoils while the company’s employees pay the price. About 4,000 WeWorkers are expected to be fired. Their new chairman told them they were “taking one for the team” – one of the lesser-known features of the market’s invisible hand. Neumann was a unicorn founder out of central casting. He is a long-haired messianic hyper-connected bro, whose rather basic business idea was propped up by a talent for raising money and the networks needed to do so. (His wife, Rebekah, is Gwyneth Paltrow’s cousin.) But the crisis at WeWork isn’t just one more bursting-bubble tale fronted by another Steve Jobs wannabe: it exemplifies the increasing volatility of the economic model that inflated the unicorns of the past. And it involves three trends that underpin the growth of enterprises looking to make money by catering to the modern workforce: the expansion of the gig economy, the relatively low cost of commercial real estate, and the increase in financial flows from sovereign investors in search of political capital. What sets WeWork apart is that it is a company built on the rubble of the financial crisis. Its customers are largely drawn from the precariat – workers who no longer expect to find permanent jobs and so instead become full-time gig-economy labourers. The financial crash, combined with the sophistication of remote working solutions, meant that employers were able to create two tiers of labour: full time with full benefits for their most profitable workers; and task-specific gig contracts, without pension or paid leave, for everyone else. Even the cost of the physical space, the ground rent required to house employees, can now be passed on to workers, who pay to rent their own desks in co-working spaces. This is where WeWork comes into the picture: providing offices to house these satellite employees, and giving them a sense of belonging in their satellite workplace. WeWork buildings have canteens, free coffee stations, an engineered sense of camaraderie and community. Like the Japanese rent-a-family industry, WeWork will sell you the love and warmth of an employer when your real employer is absent, or short of affection. The aftermath of the financial crisis also made it easy for WeWork to buy and lease cheap commercial property as a result of a real-estate market crash followed by low interest rates – enabling it to become the largest private-sector tenant in New York and London. Its unravelling is already rattling property markets in the US, the UK and Ireland. Investments that pumped up WeWork embodied another post-crisis trend – financial adventurism as a geopolitical tool. WeWork’s largest backer, Softbank’s Vision Fund, is largely funded by money from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. This is what analysts call dumb money: huge investments in high-profile tech companies such as Uber, Slack and DoorDash, with the aim of multiplying political clout rather than financial returns, at a time when economic power is shifting from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. Saudi investments buy more than allies in Washington: lavishing money on Silicon Valley helps crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to land soft interviews in the western press and cosy chats with the titans of tech. The WeWork debacle should be an indictment of the character of contemporary finance capitalism – but it is almost certain to become another unremarkable instalment in the folklore of modern business, another natural disaster that wrecked thousands of lives and careers before the market moved on to its next unicorn. Nothing will change, and there will be no introspection. And it will happen again soon, because late capitalism is sustained by the myth that spectacular implosions like this one are acts of God – when they are entirely man-made. • Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi gives Trump lifeline amid political battle",
          "bodyText": "The killing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi has given Donald Trump a lifeline in the midst of a battle for his own political survival and he has grabbed it with both hands. Trump’s 50-minute television appearance on Sunday to announce the successful mission began with a sombre announcement before drifting into something more rambling and vainglorious, foreshadowing how he will use it for political ends, and as a club to swing at his political enemies pushing for his impeachment. He stressed that congressional Democratic leaders had been kept out of the loop, as they could not be relied on to keep it secret. Within minutes, his supporters were framing the impeachment hearings as an unpatriotic attack on a leader keeping America safe. Trump celebrated the death of Baghdadi, noting he had “died after running into a dead end tunnel whimpering and crying and screaming”. The Isis leader was a “dog”, a “gutless animal”, and the Isis militants who died alongside him were “losers” and “frightened puppies”. It sounded like the dialogue of a triumphant chieftain in a made-for-TV warrior epic, and at one point Trump confirmed he had witnessed it almost as a piece of cinema, “as though you were watching a movie. The technology alone is really great.” While the prepared statement focused on the special forces who had carried out the raid, the president’s impromptu remarks in answer to reporters’ questions, reverted to the Trumpian norm, presenting it as a personal achievement. “I kept saying where’s Al-Baghdadi,” he said. “I have been looking for him for three years.” Days earlier, Trump had denigrated his former defence secretary, James Mattis, for being “overrated” and “not tough enough”, and boasted: “I captured Isis. Mattis said it would take two years. I captured them in one month.” The personality cult that Trump is seeking to construct had already taken on an alarming tone. Over the weekend, his press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, had denounced another former aide turned critic, John Kelly, as “totally unequipped to handle the genius of our great president”. It was clear within minutes of announcing Baghdadi’s death, that the delusional bubble around the president would now be even harder to puncture. In one particularly bizarre claim for someone known not to use a computer, the president said that Isis “use the internet better than almost anyone in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump”. Trump’s obsession with his predecessor was also very much at the fore. He left little doubt that Barack Obama’s success in tracking down and killing Osama bin Laden was on his mind. Baghdadi was the greater scalp, he argued. “Osama bin Laden was very big but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center,” Trump declared. “This is a man who built a whole … country, a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.” Trump also repeated a claim that he had somehow had a hand in Bin Laden’s downfall by calling for him to be targeted before the 9/11 attacks, before he was generally perceived as a threat. It is a false claim. Trump mentions Bin Laden in passing in one of his books, does not call for him to be tracked down, and the al-Qaida leader was already widely seen as a substantial threat following several attacks on the US. Within minutes a photograph was put online of Trump in the situation room, that recalled the famous picture of Obama and his top aides witnessing the final moments in the hunt for Bin Laden. The Trump version was more formal, more staged, and with the president much more clearly the central, focal point. When Bin Laden was killed in 2011, one of Obama’s first calls was to George W Bush, who had launched the hunt for the al-Qaida leader. By contrast, Trump is seeking to erase the Obama legacy. The secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, repeatedly makes the false claim that it was the current administration that amassed a coalition to defeat Isis. That coalition was almost totally put together and made operational under Obama. In anticipating how Trump is likely to spend this treasure trove of political capital, the order in which other parties were given credit is instructive. Russia was named first and repeatedly. Moscow had no part in the operation but after being informed through deconfliction channels that an operation in the Idlib area was imminent they did not try to shoot the US gunships down. Turkey was thanked several times too, and even the Syrian regime, for no more than being the sovereign power in the territory where the raid took place. The commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Mazloum Kobani, tweeted on Sunday morning that the hunt for Baghdadi had been a five-month US-SDF joint intelligence operation, but in Trump’s remarks, the Kurds were mentioned last and somewhat grudgingly. Trump has abandoned the SDF and the Kurds in a deal with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, that has allowed Turkey, Russia and the Syrian regime to take over control of north-east Syria, and at the expense of the Kurds. If Mazloum’s claim of the SDF role in the Baghdadi hunt is accurate, the scale of Trump’s betrayal is all the greater. In his remarks on Sunday, Trump said Turkey “has taken tremendous deaths … they’ve lost thousands and thousands of people from that safe zone” referring to the border area that was under SDF control. The claim is untrue, but it echoes Ankara’s talking points, equating the SDF with the PKK Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey, and arguing the invasion was an urgent necessity for Turkish security. If there was any doubt before this week, Trump made even clearer that his sole preoccupation in Syria was with the oil reserves in the east. “The oil is so valuable,” he said. US forces, who have already begun streaming back into Syria heading for the oil fields around Deir Ezzor, would help to keep them out of the hands of Isis. Secondly, oil revenues would help the Kurds. “And number three, it can help us because we should be able to take some also,” Trump said. “And what I intend to do perhaps is make a deal with an ExxonMobil or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly.” Baghdadi’s killing will help underline the simple foreign policy message that Trump is crafting for his re-election campaign. He alone inflicted a decisive defeat on Isis. Having achieved that, US troops will be withdrawn except when it is direct US economic interests to stay. Trump’s cooperation with Russian and Turkish leaders had brought about this great success. And lastly, and most importantly, the Democrats, like the intelligence committee chair, Adam Schiff, are seeking to undermine these achievements with their politically motivated pursuit of impeachment. One of the president’s Fox News surrogates, Jeanine Pirro, gave an early taste of White House messaging. “Judge Jeanine” tweeted: “So proud of @realDonaldTrump taking out abu bakr al bagdadi. Maybe the intelligence committee under @Adam schiff should start focusing on America’s enemies and not their selfish political agenda.” A lot can still go wrong for Trump. A desire for revenge could trigger an Isis resurgence, aided by the chaos caused by the Turkish offensive. Escaped Isis detainees could be involved in attacks. Conflicts with Iran and North Korea could sour the Trump pitch of having saved America from global conflicts. But there is no doubt that a damaged, embattled Trump, who was losing the confidence of even staunch politically allies, is now greatly strengthened."

          "headline": "Sajid Javid's budget delay only adds to the turmoil over Brexit",
          "bodyText": "It was supposed to be the event to end austerity. A budget to turn the page; to enact the “people’s priorities”, with everything to like and nothing to hate. But what should have been a pivotal moment for a country tired of austerity, Brexit and political chaos became another moment of shambles for Sajid Javid instead. In yet another example of Brexit derailing the usual functioning of government, the chancellor confirmed he would scrap his set-piece tax and spending event on 6 November. The launch of a hypothetical election trumped a hypothetical budget, to denude the country of vital clarity, spending detail and the commitments required to steady a rapidly weakening economy. The speculation was that the decision was not Javid’s own and that Boris Johnson’s most senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, had once again sidelined the chancellor. Labour accused Cummings of forcing Javid’s hand. Javid denied this, saying he and Johnson together had made the call to cancel the 6 November statement. An election was more important, and the rest of cabinet agreed on Thursday morning. The chancellor’s claim was questionable given his reassurances less than 24 hours earlier that his budget plan was still on track. Although strongly denied, Cummings has a track record. And the suggestion that Javid has yet again been overruled can only add to a developing political reputation as “chancellor in name only”. All this could be dismissed as a row inside the Westminster bubble if it didn’t have such grave consequences at a dangerous moment for the country. Postponing the budget will mean no update on the economy and the public finances from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the government’s tax and spending watchdog. The suspicion is that the OBR report would have embarrassed Johnson before an election by confirming what is widely known: the economy is slowing and public borrowing spiralling as the Brexit uncertainty holds the country back. At a time when strong and stable leadership from the Treasury should be prized, the economy is being allowed to crumble. As one senior Westminster figure put it to me: “To have a chancellor that looks like a doormat really isn’t helpful for the country.” There have always been conflicts between No 10 and No 11 Downing Street, famously so between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. But it is hard to imagine that many former holders of the most senior cabinet post after the prime minister would stand for being labelled as only chancellor in name. Brown was infamous for his rages – for hurling pens, staplers and mobile phones – a chancellor not to be trifled with. The idea he would let anyone scrap his budget speech would be for the birds. Denis Healey, as chancellor under Harold Wilson in the 1970s, was a political giant with a bruising reputation, summed up by his quip: “It has never been my nature, I regret to admit to the house, to turn the other cheek.” Javid follows a line of Conservative chancellors who were titans. Geoffrey Howe effectively ended the career of Margaret Thatcher with a devastating resignation speech upon leaving cabinet in 1990. George Osborne, as the architect of austerity, held massive sway over the shaping of the country under David Cameron. For the sound management of the economy amid the Brexit turmoil, there is growing concern power is becoming increasingly centralised around No 10 at the expense of the chancellor and other high offices of state that would normally play a key role in running the country. Earlier this month, the former head of the civil service Andrew Turnbull launched a stinging attack on unelected advisers such as Cummings, warning the power shift had damaged sound policymaking and needed reversing immediately. The fears could easily be dismissed. The bogeyman special adviser has become a fixture of modern British punch-and-judy debate and is nothing new: Alastair Campbell and Damian McBride were notable precursors of the Cummings approach. But to have a chancellor so clearly enfeebled in office at a pivotal moment is of increasing concern. William Gladstone, who developed the Treasury into a powerhouse under his four terms as chancellor, said 1858 that the finance ministry was “the stomach of the country, from which all the other organs take their tone”. In today’s terms, it would suggest the nation has a cataclysmic bellyache; writhing with cramp from the weakness at No 11. The lack of leadership is astounding at a time when the economy is struggling with the uncertainty over Brexit. The Bank of England too, in charge of the monetary policy levers, has faced criticism for playing a minimal role. But with little ammunition left to stimulate growth – interest rates at historic lows – No 11 must do even more than in the past to rev up the engine of growth. On the face of things, the day-to-day economy may not look too bad. Unemployment is at the lowest since the mid-1970s and inflation is under control. But this assessment belies deep structural problems. Britain has extreme levels of inequality that led to the Brexit vote. Productivity has failed to return to its pre-financial crisis levels, damaging the prosperity of the country, while real wages are below where they were a decade ago. These deep structural problems need addressing with proper planning, but the government is at war and distracted over Brexit. A bunch of quick fixes were used after the financial crisis to stop the last recession turning into a depression. But the recovery since has been one of the weakest in history and the sticking plasters still remain. The budget would have presented an opportunity to tackle these issues. Delaying it has instead contributed to the current mess. The chaotic Brexit process of the government’s own making has stripped it of its ability to run the country. Whether the call to scrap the budget was or was not his own, the chancellor in name only has missed a vital opportunity to turn the page."

Neal Maupay scored from a controversial penalty before a flustered Lucas Digne gave Brighton all three points by sliding a Leandro Trossard cross into his own net in stoppage time. And so, yet again, Everton lost on their travels. Fifteen minutes earlier, they had been celebrating, as Dominic Calvert-Lewin made the score 2-1 two minutes after being cast on from the bench. Pascal Gross had fired Brighton in front in the first half before Adam Webster scored the game’s first own goal, put under pressure by Richarlison into heading into his own net. The turning point was undoubtedly the penalty awarded in the 80th minute. If the foul by Michael Keane on Aaron Connolly was clear and obvious to the video official, it was not detected by most people in the stadium, so there was widespread astonishment when the referee pointed to the spot after VAR concluded that Keane had stepped on the striker’s toe as the pair ran for the ball. That must have been why Connolly clutched his shin as he went down. “The decision and why that happened is very difficult to understand,” said Silva. “We were in control at that moment and it completely changed the game.” Graham Potter was sympathetic. “Maybe we got a bit lucky,” he said. “Apparently on VAR there’s a contact but I haven’t seen it. Unfortunately, you’re going to get harsh decisions because ultimately that’s what it is, still somebody’s decision.” The result means that Everton have taken a single point on their league travels this season and find themselves embarrassingly close to the bottom three. They made a tentative start here but so did Brighton. Gross went very much against the grain when, after André Gomes brought down Connolly at the edge of the visitors’ area, he arrowed a wonderful free-kick through a gap in the wall and into the net from 20 yards. It was a beautifully struck shot but Jordan Pickford’s attempt to stop it was not impressive. It would be an exaggeration to claim that Gross’s goal shocked Everton into life, but the visitors drew level within five minutes all the same. The equaliser came from a corner won by Bernard after Dale Stephens allowed a long clearance by Jordan Pickford to bounce in the box. Digne sent over a typically fine outswinging delivery and Richarlison nodded it against the head of Webster and in. Everton briefly fizzed with Richarlison tormenting the home defence. In the 23rd minute he banged a low pass from the left across the face of goal. Mat Ryan rushed off his line to smother the shot by Theo Walcott. In the 37th minute Richarlison did even better, showing skill and speed down the right before teeing up Walcott again. Lewis Dunk hurled himself in front of the winger’s shot. Brighton had bouts of good possession but struggled to get at Everton’s rearguard, leaving Connolly and Neal Maupay bereft of service. However, just before the break Maupay got behind the visitors’ defence down the left and sent over a low cross. Steven Alzate ran on to it only for Digne to thwart him with a strong block. At half-time both managers had reason to believe victory was there for the taking. Brighton were the first to grasp for it, Alzate going close with a curled shot from the corner of the box just after the resumption. By now, though, the hosts had to be content with counterattacking as Everton had begun overpowering them in midfield and reversing the possession statistics. Ryan did well to hold a ferocious drive by Iwobi after a corner was only half-cleared by the hosts in the 54th minute. The keeper had to foil the same player again moments later as Everton cranked up the pressure. When Everton’s dominance receded, Silva made changes. The introduction of Calvert-Lewin soon paid off, as the striker accepted an elegantly crafted invitation from Mason Holgate, who strode forward and slid a pass into the path of the striker. Calvert-Lewin fired emphatically past the onrushing Ryan. Everton celebrated like a curse had been lifted but VAR soon burst their bubble and their frustration was compounded when Digne turned Trossard’s cross into the net."

          "bodyText": "My interest in human behaviour and psychology started in primary school. In my attempts to socialise with other children, I had a constant, nagging feeling that everybody else had received a manual entitled How to Interact with Others. I was socially awkward, to put it mildly, and this meant I was picked on a lot, which in turn meant I started to ask myself some questions: how did my behaviour differ from others? Why did my antagonists act as they did? And so began my lifelong exploration into why we do the things we do – to others and to ourselves. Psychological theory was interesting, but more urgently I needed practical social-survival skills. So I began to investigate every thinkable area of human behaviour. I took acting lessons. I worked in marketing. I studied philosophy. I looked into how the media shapes us. I developed a deep interest in magic (which is really about controlling the expectations of others). I took an interest in the structure of language. And, naturally, I did a lot of digging into social and cognitive psychology. The first important lesson is that there are many hidden factors that influence our actions. I realised my former bullies were not evil kids. Their actions were just functions of the group dynamic. As such, my negative feelings were erased. The second, and for me more important lesson, was the extent to which our emotions and actions are influenced by our surroundings: for instance, if you get a warm feeling about a stranger, the reason may be that they are wearing the same sweater as your school sweetheart and, unconsciously, your mind makes the connection. After studying human behaviour for several years, I started to gain a better understanding of our psyche and behaviour. I also took a degree in philosophy. It was only when I decided to combine my interest in human behaviour with learning the techniques of magic, in 2004, that other people became interested in what I had learned. I took everything I knew, from how we are unconsciously affected by colours to the use of body language along with sleight of hand, to create the illusion of being able to read minds. To my surprise, my audience was as interested as I was in how they could apply all of these techniques to their own lives. Of course I don’t claim that we can actually read minds or that doing so would be desirable or necessary. What we can do is to become aware of non-verbal communication (NVC). This includes body language, tone of voice, speed of movements, so-called emblematic gestures, small changes in facial expressions and so on. All those signals let us “get a feeling” about someone else. But we seldom stop to think about why or if our interpretation is correct. And we think even less about how our own signalling might be understood. For instance, if you are one of those people who close their eyes when thinking, are you aware that others might think you are uninterested? Or, have you noticed how people who start touching their neck and arms seems more stressed out? The reason is because touch is a cortisol-dampening activity. In real life, “mind reading” is simply people reading and putting the information gained from it to good use. Crucially, we could all benefit from checking our own non-verbal signalling. In the past, NVC – including gestures, facial expressions, tone of voice, eye contact and posture – couldn’t be measured. But with the advent of neuropsychology and new methods of data collection, we need no longer rely on observational claims. Now, we have the technology to provide quantifiable data, which has allowed researchers to conclude that NVC really does influence human behaviour on a profound level, and we can’t afford to ignore it. For example, researchers at MIT were able to collect data from a wearable electronic device that measures face-to-face interactions of complex situations, such as asking for a raise or applying for a new job. These unconscious cues will always play a role when we meet someone, whether we want it to or not. We will be transmitting and receiving non-verbal signals that reveal what we actually feel and – to an extent – think, and this will affect our meeting in a way that will either strengthen or weaken our entire relationship with the other person. On its most basic level, the more we “speak the same language” non-verbally, eg share approximately the same voice tempo and timbre and use the same type of hand and body movements, the closer to each other we will feel. When someone says they want what is best for us, we trust and like them if their non-verbal message is congruent with their verbal one. But when we get a nagging feeling that we are being lied to, even though the spoken words are reassuring, it might well be because the non-verbal message tells a different story. Throughout human history, this level of communication has been our favoured tool for forming lasting social bonds and societies. Yet we’re still not aware of its impact – on ourselves and those around us – which means it is easy to misinterpret signals. We can accidentally generate negative feelings in people who we are trying to make happy. We talk to someone and look upwards to think or reflect, not knowing that this small action can make the other person feel inferior. Or we see a furrowed brow but miss the relaxed jaw, so we think that someone is angry with us when they’re just concentrating. It doesn’t take much more than this to weaken a relationship that we really want to strengthen. And so on. It seems we aren’t communicating as well as we ought to be able to. This is important, because if you’re aware of your NVC, you can finally make yourself heard at work, regain the respect of your teenage offspring, and create more trusting and productive relationships. But the benefits go beyond this: research shows that there is only one variable completely necessary for long-term happiness – to be engaged in a few genuinely close and intimate relationships. Without such relationships, we can never hope to thrive. And our NVC plays a huge role in forming them – just as it did before we had speech. By using little things such as touch, small facial changes (to convey emotional reactions) and adapting our body language (to show similarity in the way we move through life), we let others unconsciously know they are safe with us. By learning how to recognise and control some of our non-verbal habits, we can form the relationships we need to live productive, creative, happy, and meaningful lives. It isn’t rocket science. We simply need to realise how and why it works, so that we can put it to better use. Say it without words: body language tips • Watch your feet When we think about our body language, we seldom think about our legs and feet. This means they’re a good indicator as to where someone’s interest lies. If the feet point towards you, the other person is focused on you. But if they start to point away, try to finish the conversation in a polite way. • Cuddle in sync Non-verbal relationship building is a lot about adapting to someone’s preferred way of communication. You can experience the power of being “in sync” with this very hands-on exercise. Embrace someone you know well. Notice the vast difference in breathing in sync and out of sync with them. One way creates a feeling of togetherness, the other of awkwardness. • Always look for more Don’t assume that someone is angry just because they cross their arms. It is a common mistake to derive meaning from just one observation. If you spot a certain signal in someone’s body language, look for more clues that point in the same direction, before you decide what it means. After all, crossed arms might just mean the room is a bit cold. • Drop one word This is a verbal tip. Avoid using the word “not”. It’s a lot easier to tell someone what you do want. You’ll find you will become more expressive and positive by dropping this one word. • Check your rapport So you’ve improved your NVC, but how can you check if it’s well received? This is easily done by making a slight change in your own body language; take a step back or turn your body a bit. Notice whether the other person follows your movement. If they do, you have created an intimate bond. The Art of Reading Minds by Henrik Fexeus is published by Yellow Kite, £14.99"

          "bodyText": "People who were there remember Alan Pardew’s disbelief quickly turning into ecstasy. It was August 2006, almost four months after Pardew’s young West Ham side had come within a whisker of beating Liverpool in the FA Cup final, and the final day of the transfer window was about to take a turn for the surreal in east London. At first it seemed like a prank, the idea that two of the hottest talents in South America were about to join West Ham, and Pardew’s response was predictable when the idea was put to him. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he said. “It’s never going to happen.” Only, it was. One of the most controversial transfers in the history of English football progressed at dizzying speed and by the end of the day Carlos Tevez and Javier Mascherano had left the São Paulo club Corinthians for West Ham. “I remember watching it on Sky Sports News,” Matthew Etherington, who played for West Ham between 2003 and 2009, says. “None of us expected it. We thought: ‘Maybe this is the way the club’s going.’ We didn’t know how the deal was structured at the time.” Sheffield United, who visit the London Stadium on Saturday afternoon, have not forgotten. They have faced West Ham once since the bitter row over the Mascherano and Tevez deal, winning a League Cup tie at Upton Park in August 2014, and have not forgotten an independent Premier League commission handing the east London club a record £5.5m fine instead of a points deduction for breaking third-party ownership rules when they signed the Argentinian duo. An FA tribunal would later find in United’s favour, arguing that Tevez’s role was crucial in West Ham staying up, and the Hammers ended up paying the Blades £20m in compensation following an out-of-court settlement. However, while the coverage down the years has largely focused on United being cheated out of a Premier League place, something lost in the conversation is how West Ham’s dream turned into a nightmare. Far from helping them challenge the elite, signing Tevez and Mascherano almost got them relegated, caused long-term financial problems and disturbed dressing-room harmony. Mascherano played seven forgettable games before joining Liverpool during the January window and it took Tevez 1,142 minutes to score a goal. It was one of the strangest seasons in West Ham’s history. Pardew had won the Championship play-offs in 2005 and for a while he was the perfect leader for a youthful, boisterous group. If Bobby Zamora arrived early to nick the manager’s parking space at the training ground, it was seen as part of the fun. After a while, however, off-field issues began to affect the squad’s discipline. West Ham enjoyed their first season back in the Premier League, finishing ninth and reaching the FA Cup final. Their hearts would be broken by Steven Gerrard’s last-minute equaliser for Liverpool, who won it on penalties. “It took a lot out of everybody,” Etherington says. Nothing was the same after Gerrard’s thunderbolt. Dean Ashton, the team’s best striker, broke an ankle shortly before the season started and some players had grown cocky. There were doubts over Nigel Reo-Coker’s attitude after stories linking the midfielder with Arsenal and Manchester United. He was pally with Anton Ferdinand, Hayden Mullins, Marlon Harewood and Zamora, all of whom had been central to the side’s rise. When Tevez and Mascherano arrived, the latter tookMullins’s place in midfield. “Hayden definitely didn’t react in a negative way but it did upset the apple cart at the time,” Etherington says. “It was a good, young team with a sprinkling of experience and quality. Were two high-profile signings like that needed?” The so-called economic rights of Tevez and Mascherano were owned by four companies represented by Kia Joorabchian, who was expected to buy West Ham. A belief grew that Tevez and Mascherano were anticipating a change of manager. Pardew had been fatally undermined and the team knew it. Teddy Sheringham, one of West Ham’s few experienced players, privately remarked that they were in trouble. Results nosedived. West Ham went out of the Uefa Cup in the first round and were knocked out of the League Cup by Chesterfield. As for the Argentinians, Tevez was unfit and out of his comfort zone in a new country, while Mascherano was struggling with the pace of the Premier League. “Mascherano was brilliant in training,” Etherington says. “Tevez took some time to adjust to life in London. In training he didn’t seem that dedicated. Mascherano adjusted really well. He was doing English lessons from day one. Tevez just had an interpreter with him all the time. He had no interest at the time to bed into the culture.” Tevez was actually doing extra drills with Zamora after training but the situation showed no sign of improving. Chances went begging and he became so frustrated that he stormed out of Upton Park after being substituted during a win over Sheffield United. Pardew let the rest of the squad decide Tevez’s punishment: they made him train in a Brazil shirt. An £85m takeover had been completed by then – but not by Joorabchian. Terry Brown had sold up to Bjorgolfur Gudmundsson, an Icelandic billionaire who installed Eggert Magnusson as chairman. On 3 December Mascherano made his final appearance for West Ham, coming on in the 84th minute of a 2-0 defeat at Everton. He was at fault for the second goal, summing up his time at the club. Three days later West Ham were beaten at home by Wigan Athletic, after which Pardew was called into Magnusson’s office and told that the board were fully behind him. Yet Pardew’s charm had worn off and he was sacked within a week, a 4-0 loss at Bolton proving the final straw. “I texted Pardew and said I felt the players had let him down,” Etherington says. “We lost our way and I felt the players had a lot to do with that, not so much the manager. People believed their own hype. We took our eye off the ball, me included.” Gudmundsson was rarely seen at Upton Park but Magnusson was panicking. He appointed Alan Curbishley, an experienced pragmatist. The former Charlton manager had an unforgettable first game, beating the eventual champions, Manchester United, at Upton Park, but it was a temporary high. West Ham followed the win with three draws and nine defeats. Curbishley, who was reluctant to use Tevez at first, was aghast at his squad’s attitude. There was talk of a gambling culture within the club. “We were probably enjoying ourselves a bit too much,” one former player admits. Curbishley ripped into his players after a 6-0 defeat at Reading on New Year’s Day, criticising their flash lifestyles and fast cars, which led to them being dubbed the Baby Bentley brigade. “He was very forthright, which sometimes isn’t the best thing to do,” Etherington adds. “He called players out. It was a bold move. Was it right? I’d say no but eventually we got our act together.” Curbishley spent in January, signing Luis Boa Morte, Calum Davenport, Lucas Neill, Nigel Quashie and Matthew Upson. Kepa Blanco also joined on loan from Sevilla. Upson had dropped everything to join West Ham from Birmingham on deadline day. The centre-back did not even have his boots with him. His agent had to buy a pair from a shop near Upton Park. No wonder Upson limped off on his debut, a 1-0 defeat by Aston Villa. Injuries meant he only played another 11 minutes before the season was over. Everything was going wrong and West Ham looked relegated after a 4-3 home defeat by Tottenham. They were 10 points off 17th with eight games left. A teenage Mark Noble, finally given a chance in midfield, wept after the final whistle. Yet something changed that afternoon: Tevez scored his first goal, bending in a free-kick from 25 yards. West Ham ended their winless run two weeks later, coming from behind to win at Blackburn. Tevez won and scored a penalty and Zamora scored a winner that would not have made it past VAR. The striker’s shot failed to cross the line because it hit Tevez, who was offside. West Ham built on their moment of fortune and the argument that they were a one-man team, utterly reliant on Tevez, overlooked vital contributions from other players. Ferdinand struck up a good partnership with James Collins in central defence. Yossi Benayoun found his creative spark. Noble excelled. Robert Green had the game of his life when another Zamora goal saw West Ham win at Arsenal in April, making save after save. Neill’s leadership was also invaluable. “Lucas had a big say in our revival, more than the manager I’d say,” Etherington says. “Carlos got the headlines but there were other factors that led to us staying up. That’s what people forget.” That is lost on Neil Warnock’s Sheffield United, who moved 10 points clear of West Ham after beating them 3-0 at home on 14 April. Yet United froze and West Ham rallied. A Zamora stunner brought them a 1-0 win over Everton. Boa Morte, Benayoun and Harewood scored in a 3-0 win at Wigan. Momentum had swung their way and they were out of the bottom three after winning their penultimate game, a double from Tevez defeating Bolton. West Ham only needed to draw at Old Trafford to shift the focus to Bramall Lane, where Sheffield United and Wigan were both in danger of going down. One of them needed a favour from Manchester United. Yet Manchester United had already won the league and the FA Cup final against Chelsea was less than a week away. Alex Ferguson’s team still included Wayne Rooney, though, and he introduced Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo and Paul Scholes in the second half. West Ham spent most of the game defending. The champions battered Curbishley’s side, who stole a win when Tevez clipped home on the stroke of half-time. At Bramall Lane, meanwhile, Warnock’s team stumbled against Wigan, who stayed up thanks to a penalty from David Unsworth. The Blades were down and Tevez was off to join Manchester United. “By the end he spoke a little English,” Etherington says. “The interpreter was still with him, standing by the training pitch and helping with the manager’s instructions.” Tevez had done his talking on the pitch."

          "bodyText": "Ceci n’est pas une pipe. This is not a sketch. Just as Magritte played with traditional conventions of words, images and meaning, so modern politics works in reverse. The surreal has become fully integrated back into the real. So much so, it’s almost impossible to distinguish between the two. If a train were to emerge from one of the fireplaces inside Westminster palace, no one would bat an eyelid. Other than to express surprise that it was on time. Chris Grayling’s legacy lives on. The sketch has become more or less straightforward reporting. There was a time when prime ministers took their responsibilities seriously. When an appearance before the liaison committee – the supergroup of chairs of all select committees – was an ordeal set in stone. No prime minister enjoyed being asked difficult questions to which they often had to evade the answer, but the session was understood to be part of the job. Boris Johnson sees things rather differently. He knows he can’t survive 15 minutes of forensic questioning, let alone a full two hours, so with barely 12 hours’ notice he cancelled his Thursday morning date with the liaison committee. For the third time. Rather than a formal apology or explanation, he merely scribbled a quick note to Sarah Wollaston, the committee chair, on a crumpled sheet of paper. “Soz I can’t be there,” he wrote. “It’s been a busy week and I could do without the hassle. I rather fancy taking Dilyn for a walk instead. Maybe I’ll come and see you in five or six months if I can be arsed. And either of us are a still in a job. Ring my people to fix a date that I can later miss. Yours, whateva.” Classic Dom high-fived him – what was the point of regaining UK sovereignty only to waste it on democratic processes? – before pissing in the waste paper basket. Toilets were for wimps. The clear-up process took up most of the day. First, Stephen Barclay had to answer an urgent question on customs declarations between Northern Ireland and the rest of Great Britain, after the prime minister had insisted there wouldn’t be any. “Um, er,” said the Brexit secretary. Well there would be some forms, he mumbled, and there would be extra expense and delay. But if everyone just worked a bit harder, reduced their prices by £55 and dispatched the goods across the border 30 minutes earlier, no one would notice the difference. Try not to think of it as border checks so much as an opportunity to get to know the people working at HMRC a little better. Barclay’s know-nothing shtick isn’t an affectation. He genuinely does know nothing. It’s been the secret to his political survival. Next up was Jacob Rees-Mogg, the idiot’s idea of a thinking man, to provide details of the Commons’ business for the coming week. “The government is committed to leaving the EU on October 31st,” he smirked. And how was it planning to do this? By debating the environmentally friendly way to give a cockapoo a haircut and introducing legislation to force the French to drive on the left-hand side of the road. That way there might be fewer delays at Calais post Brexit. Of the withdrawal agreement bill there was no sign. “They seek it here, they seek it there,” Rees-Mogg laughed, working himself up into a state of visible arousal at his own Divine Comedy. For a man who used to pride himself on his sincerity and probity, lying and S&amp;M cosplay have become second nature. He must have a very accommodating arrangement with the priest at confession. Finally, we arrived at the tail end of the Queen’s speech debate. Normally an occasion of high drama but now, thanks to the government’s total dysfunctionality, a mere sideshow. John McDonnell used his speech to lament the lack of any economic impact assessments of the new Brexit deal – other than the independent ones that showed the country being 8% worse off. Sajid Javid was outraged. The deal was so self-evidently good that no impact assessments were required. Besides, he had had an email from a Nigerian prince saying the country would be £350bn better off per week. All the government had to do was send details of the Treasury’s bank account. Come the final vote, there was almost no one in the Commons. It was all meaningless, whether it passed or failed. None of it would happen anyway. Everything was just a chimera. An election was coming. Sure enough, later that day Johnson gave TV interviews in which he claimed that parliament had both backed his deal and blocked it – mutual incompatibility is no deterrent to a pathological liar – and demanded a general election under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act on 12 December. Any dead cat to distract from the fact he had rather lost enthusiasm for dying in a ditch. The Sulk didn’t bother coming to the Commons to make the announcement himself, as he was lost in his alternate realities. So it was left to Rees-Mogg to break the news that had already broken. In reply, Valerie Vaz said Labour would make up its mind about what to do once no deal was off the table and an extension had formally been granted. And when the battle raging inside the party over whether a pre-Christmas election was a suicide mission had been resolved. Many MPs on both sides of the house looked horrified at the prospect of an election – the Tories could take a hammering in London, Scotland and the south-west – but Rees-Mogg just wallowed in the moment. Being in equal parts condescending and patronising to all concerned. Lost in his solipsistic bubble. Nanny would be giving him a ticking off later. Who knows, Rees-Mogg might just turn out to be Labour’s strongest electoral asset. But for the moment we were back where we started. No one really knew anything. Just another day in paradise."

I went with a friend who, horrified at being asked to prance around pretending to be an animal, spent the evening in the lavatory. I plunged in, loved it and the next week went back alone, continuing at least once a week until I was 16. Stage Centre was on a long residential hill that snaked down to Woolwich Arsenal. The church building, its altar serving as a stage and its original stained-glass windows, wooden beams and high ceilings intact, consisted of a large vestry, two spacious workshop areas, an upstairs costume room and several anterooms used for various purposes. It was a 10-minute walk from home and, this being suburbia in the 1970s, I made the journey alone, often returning home in the dark without a care in the world. There was only one incident in all those years – a flasher who dropped his pants when I passed by on the other side of the road. The youth theatre soon became the focus of my social life. I made friends quickly and looked forward to entering its creatively stimulating environment, where I took not only drama workshops but also dabbled in photography and design. It was affordable to attend, costing literally pennies. Middle-class kids from Blackheath and Greenwich mixed with the working-class kids from Plumstead and Woolwich, such as myself, without any snobbery or divisions. Outside the arty bubble of the building, it wasn’t like that at all, and I was self-conscious at being a black child in a majority white society and all that entails. At the youth theatre, we learned to think independently and imaginatively while participating collaboratively in drama activities that developed our confidence and honed our performance skills. We put on plays, had major crushes on our workshop leader Rob Tiplady, and later on John Baraldi, who arrived as a blast of energy in 1974 with his exotic Canadian accent. He took us on a magical trip to Norway in the sweltering summer of 1976. For a girl from Woolwich whose only other trip abroad was a day boat trip to France at 13, it was incredibly exciting to be performing a play in castle ruins at sunset surrounded by Scandinavian fjords. I came to love acting so much I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Rather like the writer I eventually became, I relished inhabiting characters who were not myself, expanding my own character, personality and emotions beyond the limits of my teenage identity. I found the process fascinating, absorbing and deeply rewarding. I also liked the attention, possibly because I was a middle child in a family of eight children. I learned that the arts world cherished difference, unlike my predominantly white girls’ school where everyone wore the same haircut, which I could never achieve anyway. At school, my passion for acting continued, and my friend Hilary Smith and I became the leading light of the drama group, and once appeared in a professional production of a play with pop star Sandie Shaw who played a barefoot Saint Joan, but that’s another story. After the Friday workshops, from age 13 onwards a group of us who were tall and looked older would head off to the pub and enjoy half a pint of lager and lime or a small bottle of Babycham, while sharing a single cigarette. Those were the days. After school, I studied community theatre arts at college. I learned to stand for something larger than myself, to be the change I wanted to see in the world. I co-founded Theatre of Black Women with Patricia St Hilaire and Paulette Randall when we graduated in 1982, Britain’s first such company. There was little work for us out there. It was the logical thing to do. This year I am the inaugural Woolwich laureate, reconnecting to the home town I left when I was 18, and writing about it. I recently taught a series of writing workshops at my old youth theatre, now called Tramshed and based in the tram shed that opened as an arts venue when I was a teenager. It’s still going strong as an amazing, crucially, affordable resource offering all kinds of performance activities for young people. The converted church that was Stage Centre was long ago converted into flats. It was the incubator of my early creativity, a safe space to spend my childhood. I would never have won the Booker prize last week, alongside Margaret Atwood, if the youth theatre had not nurtured what would become a lifelong career in the arts. • Bernardine Evaristo won the 2019 Booker prize for her novel Girl, Woman, Other"

          "bodyText": "The statistics on Halloween food waste are suitably frightening. More than 8m pumpkins are expected to be binned uneaten this year, acccording to research by stock cube makers Knorr and the food-waste charity Hubbub. That’s more than 18,000 tonnes of edible flesh. Most of us do not even consider pumpkins food. That misunderstanding has been compounded by carving pumpkins occasionally being labelled “for ornamental use only”. But that is changing: Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Waitrose, for example, do not use such labelling; all of their carving pumpkins are edible. It can be hard work to hollow out these thin-walled but robust monsters, discard the toughest fibrous bits, separate the seeds and create something tasty from the watery flesh. But you can make delicious food from even the most unpromising pumpkin. Here are some ideas from chefs, bakers and cookery writers. Pumpkin and sage picnic pie The wet flesh in bigger pumpkins lends itself to pie fillings. Roast chunks with lots of garlic until caramelised and toss it in a blitzed dressing of sage, lemon zest and oil. Line a bread tin with shortcrust pastry (at home, I use all-butter Jus-Rol) and pack the mix in. After cooking – 45 minutes at 210C (190C fan)/410F/gas mark 7 – the filling will still be juicy and the pastry perfect – and you get that mosaic effect of the dressing and its flavours running around the chunks and right through the pie. Calum Franklin, executive chef, Holborn Dining Rooms, London Pumpkin tortelli Halloween pumpkins can be watery, so once you’ve cooked the flesh, hang it in a colander overnight to get rid of as much liquid as possible. You want intense flavour. These tortelli come from Lombardy and they are basically pumpkin mixed with mostarda (mustard oil and fruit preserve) and parmesan, stuffed into pasta and served with sage butter. It isn’t measured exactly; it’s down to taste. Puree the mixture if you like, too. I would recommend people make fresh pasta for this. Roll it out thinly in one long strip, dot your pumpkin mix on, fold it over, seal it, cut it – I use a square shape – and you have lovely tortelli. Angela Hartnett, chef-owner, Murano, London Pumpkin sourdough When you add roasted, liquidised pumpkin to sourdough (200g to 1kg of flour; reduce the water slightly), you get a gorgeous loaf. It imparts a natural earthy flavour, as well as making the crumb noticeably softer. And you get a crisper crust. After removing any fibrous material around the seeds, gently dry them in a low oven and roast them with salt and olive oil – you can put them in the bread, too. The key thing to know when adding seeds is that they suck moisture from bread. Immediately after roasting them, pour a little water over the seeds and they will absorb it. You will get all the toasted flavour, but no dry seeds. Aidan Monks, owner-baker, Lovingly Artisan, Cumbria Pumpkin jam Technically, because it contains seeds, pumpkin is a fruit – so why not treat it as one? Finely chop the flesh, add a little water and a handful of brown sugar and let it bubble until pulpy. Blitz with a hand blender, put it back on the stove and cook it until it is thick and spitting. Let it cool and thicken and there you go: pumpkin jam. It’s sweet, so stick it on dark rye sourdough. It needs that bitterness. Andrew Dargue, chef-owner, Vanilla Black, London Broad bean and pumpkin stew Locro de zapallo is a classic Peruvian, originally Andean, dish, usually served with white rice. The quick, easy version is: sauté sliced onions, garlic and red chilli in olive oil, add pumpkin (250g per person, roughly cubed) and vegetable stock, and cook until the pumpkin breaks down but still retains some chunks. To finish, add cooked broad beans, tons of chopped parsley and a dash of cumin. It should be a vibrantly orange, garlicky, thick, sloppy stew, fresh with parsley. This is vegan but, if you want, add cream and crumbled feta. Martin Morales, chef-owner, Ceviche restaurants, London Arnadí de calabaza Ideally, choose a smaller, sweeter pumpkin for this tasty, simple Valencian dessert. Cover the pumpkin with foil and bake for about an hour at 190C (170C fan)/gas mark 5. In a sieve, press out as much water as possible and then mash it until smooth. To make four portions, mix 400g of pumpkin with 50g ground almonds, 60g sugar, one egg yolk, half a teaspoon of cinnamon and lemon zest. Spoon it into individual ramekins, top with blanched almonds and honey and bake until golden. We serve it with homemade turrón ice cream. Joe Wright, chef-owner, Porta, Chester Sweetcorn and pumpkin chowder A light, vegan hug-in-a-bowl for autumn. Sauté onion, minced garlic and charred sweetcorn with four tablespoons of olive oil. Add a tablespoon of plain or gluten-free flour, followed by cubes of pumpkin – you can use any, from fibrous Halloween types to our favourite acorn squash. Then, adding veg stock slowly, cook until it is just soft. Finish with seasoning, chopped flat-leaf parsley and roasted pumpkin seeds. Samantha Evans, chef-owner, Hang Fire Southern Kitchen, Barry, Wales Chana chaat Dry-fried pumpkin seeds – keep them moving in the pan so they don’t burn – are great in adventurous salads. They work especially well as a nutty complement to sweet-sour pops of fresh fruit. One of my favourites is our take on chana chaat. This sees toasted pumpkin seeds, couscous, chickpeas, raisins, a little fresh tomato and pomegranate seeds tossed together, seasoned and drizzled with coriander-mint dressing, made by blitzing fresh coriander, toasted coriander seeds, mint, sugar, pickled chillies, sunflower seeds, turmeric and lime juice. Naved Nasir, executive chef, Dishoom Red pipian sauce This pre-Hispanic Mexican recipe uses pumpkin seeds, with the red coming from charred tomatoes and dried guajillo chilli. Roast 800g of tomatoes, 500g of onions and peeled garlic, turning occasionally. Toast 25g of chillies for about 30 seconds, then soften them in boiling water. In a blender, process all the ingredients and 380g of toasted pumpkin seeds until smooth. Pass the salsa through a strainer, season and serve with the roasted chicken or pumpkin. It’s a kiss of spiciness – but not overpowering. Martha Ortiz, chef-patron, Ella Canta, London Spiced pumpkin panna cotta This is my take on a pumpkin spiced latte. To make six, put half a tablespoon of coffee granules in 300ml of milk – granules work best to get that proper coffee taste – and heat until infused. Then add 360ml of cooked pumpkin puree, 420ml of double cream, 120ml of caster sugar and a teaspoon of cinnamon, mix it together and bring it almost to the boil. Off the heat, add three sheets of pre-soaked bronze leaf gelatine. Whisk thoroughly and sieve it. Pour into moulds and allow six hours to set. Roberta Hall, chef-owner, The Little Chartroom, Edinburgh Pumpkin and lentil wellington A warm, hearty core to a vegan roast. Seeds and excess innards extracted, dice a pumpkin’s edible core into 2cm cubes and bake at 210C (190 fan)/410F/gas mark 7 with oil and garlic for 35 minutes. Meanwhile, simmer the lentils in water with diced onion, bay leaves and thyme. Using Jus-Rol puff pastry, roll out a long rectangle. Leaving space at one edge to roll it over, add the pumpkin, drained lentils and onions mixture lengthways, minus the bay leaves and thyme. Brush the seal with soya milk, roll it over, brush the exterior, sprinkle with salt and bake on greaseproof paper until golden, about 30 minutes. Slice, serve. Nathan Wattam, head chef, Common, Manchester Fermented pumpkin Remove the rubber seal from a Kilner jar (some air needs to escape) and add your pumpkin flesh, leaving a one-third space at the top because it will expand. Add small amounts of sympathetic spices – nutmeg, cinnamon, smoky black cardamom – plus enough water to completely cover the pumpkin, and 2% salt (eg 20g salt to 1kg pumpkin). Leave that in a warm kitchen for four days; the lactobacillus fermentation will start and it will turn sour and pickle-like. Refrigerated, it lasts for ages. We use it pureed with game or as a base for savoury tarts. Matthew Pennington, chef-owner, the Ethicurean, near Bristol"

          "headline": "Cybersecurity speakers cancelled for 'idea' of panel with Edward Snowden",
          "bodyText": "The Australian government’s peak cybersecurity agency claimed two speakers were cancelled from the country’s premiere cybersecurity conference because it was suggested they would host a panel with the NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden, but the Guardian has been told the idea was never formally proposed. The Guardian reported earlier this month that the former US National Security Agency executive-turned-whistleblower Thomas Drake, along with the Melbourne university academic Dr Suelette Dreyfus, were kicked off the conference agenda in what Drake described as an “Orwellian” move by conference partner the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). The pair were told their speeches were “incongruent” with the conference, and they said at the time they believed it was because their speeches were related to whistleblowing. A third speaker also claimed he was pressured to edit his speech because it was “biased” against the government’s anti-encryption laws. ACSC declined to comment at the time, but in Senate estimates on Thursday, the head of the centre, Rachel Noble, said she made the decision to cancel the speakers. “The advice I made the decision on was a proposal for Dr Dreyfus and Mr Drake to [via video conference] have a panel with Edward Snowden. That was the first proposal,” she said. “At that point my judgement was based on, I guess, the reputation of all of those speakers – that they are known public advocates for unauthorised disclosures or the leaking of classified information outside of legitimate or lawful whistleblowing schemes.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Snowden leaked documents related to the NSA’s spying program to the Guardian in 2013, and has been based in Russia ever since. Noble said that the presentations “weren’t consistent” with a cybersecurity conference, and that there was a risk those speakers would “express views that are inconsistent with Australian government laws, and our processes and our values.” Dreyfus said the suggested talk was merely a thought bubble in the initial stages of conference planning. “The idea of Edward Snowden on a panel was floated in a phone call due to the newsworthiness of his new book being published,” she said. “The ACSC didn’t object to the idea when raised. The idea didn’t go anywhere, as the ACSC well knows, since they saw the exact content of my talk abstract and Thomas Drake’s slides.” The speeches were cancelled at the last minute, long after abstracts of the speeches were provided to the conference organisers. Dreyfus’s talk was about how technology could enable whistleblowing, while Drake’s was on the golden age of government and corporate surveillance. Dreyfus said cybersecurity wasn’t improved by shutting down speech. “You don’t build the country’s cybersecurity strength by shutting down experts because you fear they might criticise laws or processes – Australia has serious problems with its cybersecurity, as evidenced by a slew of high profile attacks. ACSC is tasked with addressing this,” she said. “But sweeping debate under the carpet doesn’t fix those problems. The silencing of ideas and knowledge is not a recipe for success in solving our cybersecurity risks as a nation.” The conference program specifically stated that all of the speeches at the conference were not endorsed by the Australian government. Snowden’s book, Permanent Record, was published in September."

          "bodyText": "Taking off the steamer lid and tearing into these soft and fluffy buns is a joyful moment. To simplify these, don’t add the panda faces, and don’t fill the buns. You can also change the filling, although it’s best not to use anything too watery. Try chocolate or a thick creme pat. Makes: 12-14 Ingredients: 300g plain flour 3g fast-action instant yeast 60g caster sugar 90g tepid whole milk (will work with plant-based milk, too, to make it vegan) 80g tepid water 1 tbsp vegetable oil Plus: Black gel food dye 100g red bean paste Extra water and plain flour Put the flour, yeast and sugar in a large bowl (or stand mixer, if using). Stir together. Add the milk, water and vegetable oil. If using a stand mixer, knead the bread with the dough hook attachment until smooth and elastic. If working by hand, use a spoon to stir the dough into a rough mass, then turn out on to a floured surface and knead by hand until smooth and elastic. Tear off a small piece of dough (about 30-40g) and knead in black gel food dye, until the colour is well distributed. Place the doughs into separate oiled bowls, and cover with cling film. Leave for about an hour, or until about 50% increased in size. Divide the plain dough into 12 38-40g pieces. To shape the bao, use your fingers to press a piece of dough into a small circle (thinner at the edges than the centre). Then spoon a teaspoon of red bean paste into the centre. Gather the edges upwards and press together to seal in the filling. Turn the bao smooth side up. Try to make sure the surface is as smooth as possible. It helps to rotate the bao while pressing the palms of your hands together, to ensure it is nice and tall to start with (as it will spread sideways when steamed). Brush the bao with a little water, then attach small pieces of black dough to create the panda’s face. Ensure the ears are stuck on well by squeezing firmly to attach them to the white dough. Place the finished bao on a small square of baking paper, and place in a bamboo steamer. Cover lightly with cling film or the steamer lid. Repeat, but don’t overcrowd the buns in the steamer, as they need space to rise. Leave the bao to rise for about 30 mins (it may be much quicker or longer, depending on the room temperature), until about 50% bigger than their original size. Heat a pan of water until just starting to bubble, then turn down to the lowest heat setting and place your bamboo steamer on top of the pan (ideally, the steamer will fit on top without a gap). Wrap the lid in a tea towel, then fit over the base (this soaks up any steam, preventing it dripping on to the bao). Don’t open the lid while steaming. Steam for 10 minutes, then turn off the heat and leave in the steamer for five minutes. Remove the lid and eat the bao straight away."

          "bodyText": "The taxi driver appraises me with suspicion when I tell him my destination. “But you’ve not got a yoga mat,” he says. Having never been on a meditation retreat before, I was self-conscious of criss-crossing busy train stations with a yoga mat strapped to my back, so I’d concealed it inside a Sainsbury’s bag for life. I point it out now to the driver, and he offers a wry smile as he takes me to the place where, for the next four days, I’m to be immersed in an intensive period of “me time”. I’ve never done this before, so have no idea what to expect. Long-term health conditions can be interesting in all sorts of unexpected ways. You learn about your levels of resilience, and the efforts you are prepared to take to get better. I’ve been struggling with low physical energy for almost a decade, my mitochondrial cells malfunctioning after successive flu viruses never quite left my body. Doctors didn’t know what to recommend – these cells aren’t easily “fixed” – and so suggested what they suggest to anyone who presents mysteriously: eat better, sleep well. Do yoga, learn to meditate. I’ve spent the last five years dipping in and out of meditation – apps, YouTube, Ruby Wax’s focus on mindfulness through books and interviews – but it was vedic meditation (a close cousin of transcendental, which uses a silent mantra or sound repeated over and over) I kept returning to. I liked it but always let it slip. I knew that to establish a habit I would need to immerse myself, under in-person instruction. And so here I am, near Arundel in West Sussex, at a large, rambling country house with lush gardens, on a weekend vedic retreat run by Beeja. Its strapline suggests: Meditation for Everyone and its founder, Will Williams, has been teaching vedic meditation for more than five years. After a stint in the music business, and falling ill, he recovered through meditation – and began to teach what he had learned. He runs introductory courses in London. Will is a convincing communicator: bearded and smiley, dressed not in robes but in jeans, conspicuously one of us. There are 15 in attendance, eight women, seven men, ranging from 24 to 70. We’re a cosmopolitan bunch: there’s a Saudi, a Lebanese, one from Guadalupe, another from South Korea. Two from Essex. Some, like me, have medical issues, others are struggling with anxiety, depression and such pronounced social media addiction that handing over phones upon arrival proves problematic. I’m to share a dorm for four but – mercifully – there’s just two of us this weekend. After an introductory dinner of nut loaf, Will’s co-instructor, Niamh Keane, reminds us of the house rules: up at 6.45am, in bed by 10.30pm; respect one another’s confidentiality. No sex and no “solo sex”, as Niamh puts it, just unbroken serenity and purity of mind. We’re detoxing, so can have neither caffeine nor alcohol. No breakfast either, a fact that horrifies us all initially but becomes curiously unimportant by day two. On a meditation retreat I find you meditate, and do precious little else. Beeja’s version comprises a succession of “rounding” exercises: 15 minutes of yoga, five minutes of alternate nostril breathing, 20 of meditation, and 10 of the flat-on-your-back yoga pose, shavasana. We’re all given an individual secret mantra to repeat silently (though who’s to say we don’t have the same one?!). For three days. At first, most of us choose to do our exercises communally, in the living room, but increasingly we drift off in pursuit of solitude. I thought I’d struggle, because meditating at home is difficult, but here, with no distractions, I slide into it as if it were a hot bath. Hours pass, then hours more. Respite comes in the evenings, after simple vegetarian food (rice and dhal, Thai soup), when Will sits, Buddha-like, with us at his feet while he shares his vedic-derived wisdom. He’s a practitioner of many years and is so convinced of his discipline’s ability to heal the world that he can tend towards the over-prescriptive. He condemns most diets in favour of an ayurvedic-approved one, and proffers opinion on antidepressants, climate change, and Trump voters. He tells us that the introduction of 5G will kill off the insect world, that we should never cross our legs, and how we must avoid eating onions because the skin contains properties that promote selfishness. Much of what he says is fascinating, plenty else sails far above our heads. He asks how our sessions are going and when I tell him that during one of mine my hands began to levitate and my fingers grew like intertwining tree branches, as if I were morphing into a Hans Christian Andersen fairytale, he beams with pleasure and says: “You’ve shifted some serious energy there, fella.” The more we meditate, the more our protective bubble expands. When we come to leave, Niamh implores we take care upon re-entering the world outside, as we will be newly hypersensitive to light, noise, other people. “Be gentle with yourselves,” she advises. The trip back home is complicated by the usual travel chaos – delays, overcrowding – but we endure it without any obvious adverse effect on our hitherto delicate dispositions. But then meditation affects different people differently and any long-term benefits may only announce themselves over time. What I know right now is that I’ve never had a weekend quite like it, never been so still, or rested, never spent so much time with myself, or by myself. It wasn’t quite bliss, but I did attain something conspicuously rare in a life otherwise filled with such perpetual distraction: peace. • Four-day, three-night weekend retreats cost from £594 for a twin room, £534 for a dorm room, and include food, drink and instruction; six-monthly payment options available, beejameditation.com Nick Duerden’s memoir, Get Well Soon: Adventures in Alternative Healthcare, is out now (Bloomsbury, £12.99).

          "headline": "NSW moves to stop mine projects being blocked because of their overseas emissions",
          "bodyText": "The New South Wales government has announced it will introduce legislation to try to stop planning authorities from blocking mine developments based on emissions from coal once it is burned. The push is a response to the historic Rocky Hill verdict delivered by the NSW Land and Environment court earlier this year and comes just days after the government launched a review of the state’s Independent Planning Commission (IPC). Environment groups and the legal firm that represented Groundswell Gloucester have described it as a capitulation to the mining industry, which has waged a campaign over recent planning decisions that either rejected mining projects outright or imposed conditions on them related to their impact on the climate. “The government is effectively banning planning bodies from considering the biggest environmental challenge of our age,” the Nature Conservation Council chief executive, Chris Gambian, said. The NSW deputy premier and resources minister, John Barilaro, said the government would introduce legislation to parliament in the next week to prevent “the regulation of overseas, or scope-three, greenhouse gas emissions” in mining approvals. For a coalmine, scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions are largely from the burning of the coal after it is sold into the market, including overseas. “The government has a very clear policy when it comes to the consideration of scope-three emissions and this will now be enshrined in legislation and through changes to the Mining SEPP (state environmental planning policy),” Barilaro said on Tuesday. The changes the government is proposing include amending the State Environmental Planning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive Industries) to remove the requirement to consider downstream emissions (emissions after coal or gas is sold and burned). It also plans to amend the Environmental Planning &amp; Assessment Act so that planning authorities are prohibited from imposing conditions on developers related to downstream emissions. “These changes will help restore NSW law and policy to the situation that existed prior to the Rocky Hill decision and will provide the mining sector with greater certainty,” Barilaro said. The proposal is not unexpected and was foreshadowed by the government earlier this month following a campaign by the NSW Minerals Council, which has attacked a number of recent decisions by planning authorities in NSW. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning In February, the land and environment court rejected the Rocky Hill coalmine near Gloucester, citing the impact it would have on climate change, including through the burning of coal in other countries. In August, the NSW IPC approved the expanded United Wambo coal project near Singleton but as a condition said the coal could only be exported to countries that have ratified the Paris agreement. In September, the commission rejected the development of a greenfield coalmine in NSW’s Bylong Valley, citing the impact the mine would have on groundwater, agricultural land and on climate change. David Morris, from the Environmental Defenders Office NSW, which represented Groundswell Gloucester in the Rocky Hill case, said the government’s response was “a rushed announcement, a thought bubble, rather than a serious attempt at law reform” and it was unclear how the proposal would actually work. “It’s not clear how the deputy premier sees this working in practice. We’ll have further comment once we’ve seen the substance of the bill,” he said. “The most significant climate judgment in this nation’s history was based on scientific evidence. The government’s decision today is based on a kneejerk capitulation to the mining industry without regard for future generations.” The Lock the Gate coordinator George Woods said the government had gone “completely over the top” in trying to deal with what was essentially a trade issue for NSW and “blown it out of proportion to try to wash their hands of the issue keeping Australians up at night”. “It’s over the top and out of touch with the community and the greatest strategic, economic and environmental issue we’re all facing,” she said. “(The planning minister) Rob Stokes is going to be remembered for taking NSW backwards on the most important issue of our century.” NSW Labor’s environment spokeswoman, Kate Washington, said Labor had sought a briefing from the government."

          "bodyText": "As strange as it may sound, above a Dorothy House charity shop in the shabbier end of central Bath, a handful of people are quietly trying to push the world – or at least a small part of it – away from the polarisation that currently defines politics, and towards something a bit more open and empathic. To compound the unlikeliness of it all, they are led by a man called Jim Morrison: not the reincarnated singer of the Doors, but the 40-year-old founder of a new online platform called OneSub, whose strapline is “Break the echo chamber”. I have come to OneSub’s HQ as part of a week-long quest to push my reading habits and general soaking-up of information out of my usual left-inclined social media bubble, get some much-needed perspective, and try to use the internet as it was originally intended – not to confirm my prejudices, but to reintroduce me to the confounding, complicated, surprising realities of the world as it actually is. By presenting people with the chance to read news that goes against their political prejudices, OneSub claims to “help you manage your bias”. As I discover by using it, what this means in practice is winningly straightforward. Investigating the mess around the Brexit negotiations brings up a piece from Sky News headlined: “Jacob Rees-Mogg hints at Brexit compromises”, which fits my belief that the reckless Tories trying to take us out of the EU are colliding with reality – but which is followed by an article from the Daily Telegraph titled: “Fury as EU demands more Brexit concessions.” Similarly, a piece that tells me what a reckless idiot Donald Trump is tends to be followed by something that attempts to be more neutral, and another item written from a supportive perspective – after which I get a message that says: “You have read three different viewpoints of the same story and have a balanced perspective!” OneSub is short for “one subscription”, which encapsulates the eventual aim of charging users for a service that will include news hidden behind some outlets’ paywalls. On the first floor of the company’s HQ, six or so employees are crammed into a compact office, compiling the pieces that are accessible on a website and an app, and overseeing the machine-learning systems that incessantly comb about 15 English-language news outlets and grade articles’ levels of political bias. Upstairs, Morrison sits in an even smaller meeting room, takes delivery of a cup of tea and explains what everyone here is trying to do. Morrison is an internet specialist rather than a political anorak, which partly explains why, to a political journalist such as myself, his take on current affairs seems so unorthodox. He says one of his central fears about modern Britain is that “they’ve managed to privatise the health service and education system without even discussing it”, but he voted Tory at the last election, partly because he thinks Jeremy Corbyn is “quite an extreme leftwinger”. If the election system was fairer, he says he would favour the Lib Dems, but he also voted leave in the 2016 referendum. When I probe him about what he and his colleagues are trying to do, he often meets a question with another question, or leads the conversation towards qualifications and contradictions. By way of a simple illustration of what OneSub is all about, he draws a bell curve – the stereotypical line indicating that when it comes to politics, most people are still somewhere in the middle. “But if you take any topic, the way that newspapers and politicians speak is that everyone is distributed that way” – he points at the far right and left – “so everyone is either leave or remain, or Labour or Conservative, or Republican or Democrat. And I call bullshit on that, I suppose. I don’t think it’s the case.” His alternative, he explains, is about encouraging “moderate conversations”, and alerting people to basic facts. “Most issues are not binary, simplistic things,” he insists. They may not be, but why does he think a small setup such as his can push back against the might of Facebook, Twitter and all the rest, and subvert the logic of polarisation that seems to have gripped billions of people across the planet? “Facebook is addictive – it’s a dopamine addiction, the same as gambling and porn and everything else, right?” he says. “But, you know, oxytocin is a pretty rewarding chemical. That’s the chemical that you get when you do something you’re proud of. And so we’re trying to focus on that. We send you an email at the end of every week that says: ‘Here is what you’ve read. And this week, you read all this stuff that you wouldn’t normally read.’ That’s a reward mechanism too.” Morrison and his team are not the only people trying to offer a viable alternative to online polarisation. In Berlin, a small team has been working for two years on a news aggregator called Nuzzera – taglined “Burst your bubble” – whose German-language model was released on Apple and Google’s app stores this month (an English version is in the pipeline). One of its co-founders is Janine Perkuhn, who tells me Nuzzera was sparked into being not just by Brexit and Donald Trump, but also the rise in Germany of the far-right party Alternative für Deutschland (AfD), whose online hyperactivity is jaw-dropping. One recent study found that 85% of all shared posts originating from German political parties came from the AfD. Perkuhn says Nuzzera’s aim is simply to “allow people to be better informed”, and that there are signs of hope that, however popular the big platforms might be, this is what at least some people want. “What we see, and what a lot of studies show, is that a lot of people mistrust social media,” she says. “They often think it’s not even the right place to read news. But a lot of people are used to it, and it’s hard to break patterns. That’s one of the biggest challenges we have.” In the US, among a handful of initiatives with roughly the same aims, there is AllSides, a news site that – like OneSub – presents different versions of stories rated for bias, and takes its users to such wildly diverse outlets as the New York Times, the far-right website Breitbart and the left-leaning Mother Jones. Founded in 2012, its dedication to flagging up the biases that sit behind the news extends even to its own staff – who, like the articles AllSides aggregates, have ratings for their political leanings: two Ls and two Rs that represent left, “lean left”, right and “lean right”, and a single C that puts them in the political middle. Its founder and chief executive is John Gable, who has a “lean right” rating, and an affinity with the Republican party. Nearly 25 years ago, his internet career began at the trailblazing company Netscape. “Like everybody else, I drank the Kool-Aid back then,” he says. “I completely believed in the possibilities of the internet to connect people. But I was concerned that the internet might also train us to discriminate against each other in new ways. The main thing I saw was that it would encourage us to think in terms of metaphor, or category: ‘This is similar to that.’ I thought that it might also train us to stereotype people, and think less of them. It got a lot worse than I ever thought it would. But I had my first concern back then.” What AllSides does is clearly intended to be an antidote – and when I suggest that he is trying to reverse the march of forces far stronger than his somewhat niche website, Gable tells me that history may eventually favour his view of things. “We think of the printing press, and we think about the Enlightenment, and reformation,” he says. “We forget that for the first 100 years or so, there was great social chaos, before people created new things: libraries and publishers that were credible, so you could start distinguishing the better materials from the not-so-good materials.” He says the internet is stuck in “that early, chaotic stage”, but that AllSides and similar initiatives have a chance of “taking the 100 years of chaos from the printing press, and shortening it to about 15 years”. AllSides, he tells me, has about 2 million users a month. The site also has a schools initiative that has taken it into all 50 US states, and that allows teachers to talk to their pupils about current affairs while swerving allegations of bias. But the intentions of this work, he says, are even more ambitious. “We actually have a whole programme about how teachers can train their kids to talk to each other, and listen, even when they disagree.” What else, aside from visiting his site, does he think people trying to push beyond polarisation should change about their online habits? “There are two things, really,” he says. “One is to create a friendship with somebody on the other side, politically. The way that change happens is person to person. The other thing is, with anything you believe, work at it so you can make a fantastic argument for the opposite point of view. Until you can really argue the other side, frankly, you don’t understand the issue.” H aving spoken to Gable, I blow the dust off my Facebook account and make a few changes. On a whim, I decide to follow the Conservative party and a campaign called Brexit means Brexit, and send a couple of friend requests to prominent rightwing columnists, to no avail. I then spend the next couple of days flipping between OneSub and AllSides. AllSides takes me to a rather nasty piece about homelessness in northern California that essentially says living on the street is a matter of personal choice; a piece about the Democratic party’s position on LGBT rights that tells me these things “are best handled locally and not by the inhabitant of the White House” (the lessons of the struggle against racial segregation, it seems, have rather dwindled); and different takes on Trump’s policy towards the Kurds that all serve to make me feel very bleak indeed. OneSub, meanwhile, continues to encourage me to see things – Brexit, conflict the Middle East, Trump’s possible impeachment – from three different perspectives and congratulates me when I do so. In so far as I am newly aware of views very different from my own, this all seems worthwhile. The problem is that I seem to remain stranded in a world of polarisation and mutual loathing, when I would like to be somewhere very different. Which takes me to Cathy Deng, who lives in San Francisco and works for the crowdfunding platform Patreon. Three years ago, she was at the research-and-development wing of the online news outlet BuzzFeed, working with people who were reeling from Trump’s victory, and worrying about what it said about the internet’s effects on politics. “When I joined, it was right after the 2016 election,” she says. “And a lot of people were talking about filter bubbles: ‘Oh, we are only getting information from people like ourselves.’ There were a lot of discussions about getting more things into your information feeds.” Most of these conversations, she says, revolved around the division between Democrats and Republicans and so-called red and blue states. “But I felt like that was really reductive, because it reduces all the information in the world and all the different kinds of things you can be exposed to into one axis, and two sides. What you end up with is really just another kind of personalisation: ‘I am on the right, so I want more information from people on the left.’ That’s the same problem. The only true way to reject it is to go for randomness and serendipity. So that’s what I tried to do.” Her answer was a gloriously simple Chrome plugin called Noisify. Once in place, it puts random nouns into Facebook’s search bar, presented in block capitals. “Aren’t you curious about … AIRCRAFT?” it asks me at one point; a few moments later, it is suggesting I search for TUITION, COMMAND, FACES and ARMENIA. Pursue these things, and then like or follow some of what comes up, and you begin to gently subvert Facebook’s algorithms, and your feed becomes smattered with stuff you might not previously have thought about. After two days of using Noisify, among other new sources of interest, I have started reading the local news in Tucson, Arizona, and been alerted to the dire effects of the climate crisis in the Maldives. Stranger still, the sense of dread with which I usually approach Mark Zuckerberg’s platform and my usual expectation of being greeted with either the mundane flotsam of people’s everyday lives or a great cacophony of anger have slightly subsided. “Being exposed to new things is good for people’s brains,” Deng says. Whether the resulting pleasure is down to oxytocin, dopamine or some other brain chemical remains unclear – but the internet feels better than it has in ages."

          "bodyText": "It was “an honour” to become chief executive of Smith &amp; Nephew, “a company I greatly admire”, gushed Namal Nawana when he got the job last year. What he failed to mention, it turns out, is that these warm feelings were dependent on the willingness of his new employer to whack up his pay at the first opportunity. Eighteen months later, Nawana has quit because a package of up to $7m (£5.4m) a year doesn’t meet his lofty expectations. Technically, his departure is a “by mutual agreement” affair, but the language need not detain us long. Nawana seems to have looked at what bosses in charge of similarly-sized US healthcare companies can earn – around the $15m mark – and asked for the same. When the board said no, and pointed out that UK shareholders would never wear it, Nawana declared that maybe he wouldn’t hang around. Cue an inevitable invitation to pack his bags sharpish. One can call that outcome mutually agreed, but there’s no doubt about who instigated the quarrel. Did Nawana, an Australian who had previously worked in the US, not notice that Smith &amp; Nephew is a UK company that pays according to UK notions of acceptable avarice? Actually, he must have realised because he made a point in interviews of mentioning how he had taken a pay cut to join. Or perhaps he thought Smith &amp; Nephew itself would be heading to the US via a relisting, with a remuneration rethink to follow along local lines. A corporate switch has been rumoured but Nawana would have been unwise to bet on it happening. Even mighty Unilever couldn’t persuade its shareholders to accept a re-domicile to the Netherlands. One is left to assume that Nawana, after injecting some life into Smith &amp; Nephew’s share price, had gambled that he could bounce the board. If so, chairman Roberto Quarta (perhaps bruised by his annual showdowns over pay at WPP in the Sir Martin Sorrell era) deserves some credit for standing firm. Nawana was on a base salary of $1.5m, with the chance to earn an estimated annual maximum of about $7m for hitting targets. If that’s not sufficient motivation to get out of bed in the morning, don’t take the job in the first place. How corporate types fail to anticipate the bleedin’ obvious Still on remuneration matters, it’s farewell to Marion Sears, chair of the pay committee at Persimmon, the housebuilder that caused uproar when it shovelled a £75m bonus in the direction of chief executive Jeff Fairburn, now thankfully departed. Sears’ role in the Fairburn fiasco was actually minor. She didn’t design the idiotic uncapped incentive scheme and, by the time she became chair of the remuneration committee in December 2017, the damage had been done. She was, though, obliged to appear in front of MPs on the business select committee in June last year to try to defend the bonanza and, in that capacity, she provided a textbook example of how not to prepare for a session in front of MPs. Fairburn himself would probably have bet his bonus on this question cropping up: what’s the average pay at Persimmon? Sears didn’t know or, rather, hadn’t looked up the figure in advance. Cue incredulity on the part of MPs and an easy clip for the evening TV news to confirm the impression of directors living in a bubble. It’s astonishing how often corporate types fail to anticipate the bleedin’ obvious. Peter Fankhauser, the man on the bridge when Thomas Cook sank, flapped ineffectually last week when asked if he would be paying back any of his bonuses. At least Manny Fontenla-Novoa, Fankhauser’s predecessor and an upcoming witness on Wednesday, cannot enter the same “I’ll think about it” plea. He earned £17m in eight years and left in 2011 when the tour operator was on the brink of collapse the first time. He’s had plenty of time to think, and ample warning. Gender pay reporting should include SMEs Andy Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, makes a fair point. Gender pay reporting should be extended to companies employing more than 30 people, instead of being confined to those with more than 250 staff. Small and mid-sized companies may groan at the idea of more bureaucracy, but they shouldn’t. First, crunching the numbers isn’t difficult. Second, if the overall data is to be useful to policymakers, it should be comprehensive. Haldane estimates that the current reporting requirement covers only 40% of the UK working population in the private sector. Third, self-examination is worthwhile: why wouldn’t you want to know your own pay gap?"

          "bodyText": "And on that note, we are going to call it a day. We’ll be back early tomorrow morning for more estimates fun and games. Will we find out who the mysterious “they” are? Probably not because they don’t exist. Or maybe that’s exactly what they want you to think! I am very confused right now. All I know is that for a government which has argued against “gender whisperers” it can certainly embrace the they pronoun when it wants. Mike Bowers is on assignment for the rest of the week, but you’ll have Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and Katharine Murphy on board, as well as the rest of the Guardian brains trust. And however many brain cells I can scrape together to sit under my tinfoil hat, which is apparently now part of the uniform in here. Thank you to everyone for today – we really appreciated you following along. We’ll hopefully see you back here tomorrow. In the meantime – take care of you. I’m really, really not sure that the world didn’t end in 2012, and we have spent the past seven years in a bad place simulation. Penny Wong is now asking the PM&amp;C officials whether they are aware of any international agreements Australia has entered into unwillingly. They are not. *fin* “When you say this unaccountable, unelected international bureaucracy – the only thing you can point to is they give us lectures,” Penny Wong says. Mathias Cormann eventually concedes that “they” can’t direct us, but from “time to time” “they” try. Wong wants him to take on notice who “they are”. Cormann won’t because he says he has answered who “they” are. (He has not) “I am asking the department to take on notice who the ‘they’ is ... which organisations are included in the ‘they’ [in the prime minister’s speech].” This is an actual exchange in Senate estimates and not a rebooted Laurel and Hardy sketch. Mathias Cormann won’t say who “they” are, when he says that sometimes “they” impose judgements or decisions which the government doesn’t believe supports Australia’s national interest. But he won’t say who “they” is. It’s just “they”. Mathias Cormann and Penny Wong are now using Malcolm Roberts’s support as a sledge. Fair. Asking about the prime minister’s Lowy institute speech – the “negative globalism” one – Penny Wong asks for the difference between positive and negative globalism. It doesn’t look like anyone can. The PM&amp;C officials can’t think of any other reference to negative globalism. Mathias Cormann jumps in to say it was a great speech, which was very well received by those who heard it. “One Nation loved it,” Wong quips back. Cormann says he believes the “quiet Australians” would have received it well. Wong then asks what global organisations demand conformity. There is silence in the room. Cormann is now reading directly from the speech. Penny Wong is asking PM&amp;C officials about “BurnedSpy” (a name she laughs as she says out loud) and whether the department has taken any investigations as a consequence of the claims made in the story (that he regularly posts on conspiracy QAnon conspiracy sites and their partner works on the prime minister’s staff). Mathias Cormann takes everything on notice. I imagine this will be in response to Ken Wyatt’s interview last week, in which he said he would be moving to legislate a voice to parliament, rather than enshrining it in the constitution, in order to get the recognition referendum up (and passed). Indigenous people called for the voice to be enshrined, so it could not be overrun, as Atsic was. For those interested, Bob Katter and Adam Bandt are both in the chamber arguing against the free trade deal - it s not often you see those two on the same side of an argument. Angus Taylor’s disclosures regarding his interest in company Jam Land are now being scrutinised, given the department’s administration of the ministerial standards. Labor senator Jenny McAllister is asking what attempts have been made by the prime minister, Scott Morrison, to satisfy himself that Taylor is not in breach of ministerial standards which prevent the use of public office for personal benefit. Cormann insists that Taylor is not in breach, and has disclosed his interest in Jam Land as required under the rules, and says the targeting of Taylor is “smear and innuendo”. Cormann says that stopping Taylor advocating for landholders in his electorate, including himself, would be like suggesting he should not advocate tax cuts as a beneficiary. Labor senator Penny Wong accuses him of making a “ridiculous equivalency”. “He is not advocating on behalf of his constituency, he is advocating for himself,” Wong said. Labor has picked up on the prime minister’s statement during question time (highlighted below) that I do not believe that those decisions about who should be prosecuted at the end of the day should be made on the whim of politicians. Which contradicts the line that Christian Porter has taken on this – that he will need to approve any brief from the commonwealth director of public prosecutions (if there is one) before any charges could be moved ahead. Mark Dreyfus says Scott Morrison has confused the issue, asking whether Porter’s directive stands, or not. Mr Morrison’s statement suggests that this government does not know where it stands on freedom of the press and the Australian public’s right to know. A Dfat officer, Philip Green, has sent a message re this morning’s evidence - prompting clarification from Caroline Miller. Miller says that a colleague from Dfat has forwarded an email from 28 May sent to Justin Hayhurst [first assistant secretary to PM&amp;C), CC’d to Miller, which advised that Ambassador Hockey was going to send a letter re the US justice department inquiry into the Mueller report. This was an issue this morning, because Penny Wong wanted to know when PM&amp;C were aware that Australia would be co-operating with the investigation, because of Alexander Downer’s involvement. “We had forgotten about this message”, says Miller. Zali Steggall will officially present the largest ever parliamentary e-petition (there have been bigger hardcopy ones presented, including one to stop a beer tax) calling on the parliament to declare a climate emergency, in the chamber tomorrow. There were over 400,000 signatures on that one, which is no mean feat. But for it to pass, a few government MPs would need to cross over. Steggall tells Patricia Karvelas “we are writing around to request a conscience vote”. We are a democracy,” she says. PK points out that the conservative government in the UK passed a climate emergency declaration, so she asks whether she thinks anyone from the conservative side of politics would support it, if a conscience vote was allowed (which it most likely will not be). Absolutely. A lot called for a climate act to be introduced in the UK. It needs to be done, it has to be done and we need to find the political will in Australia. You need more than just lip service at an election, saying that you do believe in climate change and you will take action. We needed to be for more than just inside the party room, it needs to be outside. Everyone should be able to have a conscience vote in parliament and declare whether or not this is an issue we need to address. Back in environment estimates, Labor has been asking about the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, which received a controversial $443.3 m six-year grant from the government. At the time the grant was awarded, it was said the foundation had “unique” capacity to attract further donations for reef projects from the private sector. Senator Nita Green notes the department’s annual report says there is an investment target of between $300m to $400m. “How many funds have actually been raised?” she asks. Deb Callister, from the department’s heritage, reef and marine division, says: “To date, the amount that we’ve been advised of is that they’ve raised more than $21m as in-kind contributions from their projects.” Asked what in-kind means, she says it refers to additional provided by organisations and groups that had received funding from the foundation via the grant. This could be staff provided for projects, office space, or cash. Callister says the federal election had affected the foundation’s ability to “participate more actively in the fundraising sphere”. Labor warned the foundation before the election it would terminate the grant if it was elected. “It would come as no surprise to senators that some of the uncertainty around the future of the partnership that arose around the election...has impacted on their (the foundation’s) ability to participate more actively in the fundraising sphere,” Callister says. “But now that that outcome is known and their future is known they’re moving more actively to engage with potential donors.” Callister says in the first year of the grant the foundation spent “in the vicinity” of $25m on projects and just under $8m on administrative costs. She said the foundation anticipated they would spend $58m on projects in 19-20. Labor is now asking about how the prime minister’s office treats journalists, highlighting messages sent from the PMO to journalist Peter van Onselen that criticised coverage. Labor senator Tim Ayres has asked whether the department believes the correspondence from the PMO shows “professional courtesy” in how it deals with journalists, as is required under standards for staffers. After finance minister Mathias Cormann defended the private exchange, Ayres said “no wonder the government wants to lock up journalists”. This sparks an angry response from Cormann, who accuses the senator of conflating in a “dangerous and inappropriate” way the issue of communication between staffers and journalists, and the AFP investigation into national security breaches. Seems to be a lot of incorrect responses flying around Else Kennedy, who is doing an internship with the Guardian, listened to Sydney radio 2GB to hear Ben Fordham’s response to Anne Davies’ story this morning: “My eyes started glazing over halfway through the piece.” “They’ve ripped into me for the role I played in organising for politicians to have a fresh look at the situation.” “I’m not a minister, I’m not a premier, I’m just a radio host. All I did was appeal to those in charge to get out of their air-conditioned offices, go to the parts of the bush ravaged by drought and ask themselves the question, ‘Is this fair? Is it fair to threaten people with daily fines of $13,000 for not talking to a bureaucrat? Is it fair to bankrupt families that have been putting food on our plates for generations? Is it fair to push men and women to breaking point and whack them over the edge? We’ve already got farmers killing themselves, and I’ve had them talking to me with tears in their eyes. All I did was suggest meetings and ask for a fresh look. It was the NSW government that decided that the land-clearing laws were unfair. The government introduced a new policy. It wasn’t me, it wasn’t this radio station.” “By all means have a go at me, you can do your best.” “What I would say to the Guardian is this: you know that those farmers were in strife. You know that the worst offenders are still being prosecuted. Others have received a reprieve from the strict land-clearing laws and rules have now been changed to make them fairer. “But understand when there’s a battle between the greenies in the big smoke and the farmers in the bush I’ll be backing the farmers, and any criticism I get for that I wear as a badge of honour. I’ll be campaigning for anyone who deserves our support and I won’t be changing my approach one single bit.” That moment when you realise just how many titles you have. The no props in question time rule going very well Best angles The parliament smells of rich mahogany The answer to this question is no. Acting Greens leader Adam Bandt (Richard Di Natale had to have unscheduled knee surgery, we understand) wants to try and delay the free trade agreement implementation. Liberal and Labor have done a dirty deal to fast-track laws that will give corporations more rights than governments or workers. These dodgy deals allow corporations to boost their profits by suing governments who do things like lift the minimum wage or pass laws to protect the environment. Labor’s ‘big win’ appears to be an unenforceable side-letter from the Liberals that existing loopholes will continue to apply. The Greens stand with the workers and civil society groups who want these agreements rewritten so that basic rights are protected. We will move amendments to the bills to ensure jobs are advertised locally, corporations can’t sue our government and the Hong Kong deal is delayed while the conflict there continues.” Given Labor and the government are on the same side on this, this will fail. Jacqui Lambie tried her luck with home affairs and border force to question them about Crown again. Mike Pezzullo cautions Lambie on her use of the term “evidence”. “The department issues visas, and visas are not issued any way other than the Migration Act, so the suggestion that people come uncredentialed is wrong. The ABF checks credentials at the other end and then on arrival.” Lambie says that sounds like some people are coming in with visas on Crown planes. She asks if ABF is “going on every one of them with your boots on to check every one of them?” “I hung up my boots a long time ago,” says Pezzullo, referring it to Outram. Outram says, yes, we clear everyone – passengers and crew – who comes in on a plane from overseas. Lambie keeps pushing because “something’s wrong here”. Outram disagrees and says he’s not aware of any corporate entity bringing people to Australia illegally. Over at the Home Affairs estimates, senator Rex Patrick is asking about the department about their not-great record on FOIs. The department had 14,463 in 201718, and it increased by about 4,000 in 2018/19. The department is on track to receive about 21,500 FOI requests this year. Pezzullo says he had an obligation to prioritise risk in particular areas, and said he would have to take resources away from frontline operations, like counterterrorism and interference. He said he has tried to take out the red tape and “get more productivity” out of the FOI officers, which he agreed was likely to go up. “Beyond that until I’m convinced otherwise that there is a requirement because of faulty decision-making or more persistent overturns at review, that that area is performing very well … and I’m not looking to shift significant resources into that area because they’ll have to come from frontline operations.” Recent coverage from Chris Knaus: Here are some more FOI stats from the Home Affairs annual report. In 2018–19 the Department received 18,412 Freedom of Information (FOI) requests, including 623 amendment requests, compared with 14,683 requests in 2017–18, representing a 25.4% increase. Of the 18,412 FOI requests received in 2018–19, 16,876 were for personal information and 917 for non-personal information (619 uncategorised). The Department finalised 17,078 FOI requests. Of these 16,464 were access requests and 614 were amendment requests. Of the 16,464 access requests: • 9,401 cases were granted full access • 5,375 cases were granted part access • 902 cases were refused access33 • 786 cases were invalid, transferred to other agencies, or saw applicants withdraw their requests before a decision on access was made. The department’s FOI compliance rate (requests finalised within statutory timeframes) for 2018−19 was 75%. At 30 June 2018, the Department had 1081 overdue requests on hand. Infrastructure officials have confirmed in Senate estimates that of the projects that form part of the $4bn 10-year urban congestion fund program none – NONE – have started construction. $3bn of that spending is over the next four years, and it’s an impressive list of projects, but all of them are still at the earlier stages of planning, seeking approvals, conducting tenders for contractors etc. No digging, no hi-vis. Labor’s Murray Watt wants to know which projects are going to start before Christmas – a commitment made by cities and urban infrastructure minister Alan Tudge – and wants precise delivery dates. Officials suggest that perhaps Tudge was referring to the preliminary steps (rather than the digging). Watt has also drilled down to the micro level – including a $1m spend on a pedestrian traffic light in Doncaster. Officials suggest it will help “manage pedestrian flow” and there is also a safety element, because it’s near an aged care facility. Now he’s moved on to the $500m commuter carpark fund. Officials describe the choice of 32 car park projects as a “decision of government” based on departmental advice about need and priorities. No construction has started on the carparks. Watt’s questions have prompted a flurry of post-it notes from officials sitting behind the front-rowers to help provide answers: One of the carparks in Hurstbridge (Vic) is out to tender which will be awarded in November and be constructed “quite quickly”. Cragieburn (Vic) will go out to tender soon. There’s another in Mandurah, WA out to tender; and Two in NSW where property acquisition is underway. Scott Morrison adds to the answer to Warren Snowdon’s question: On 13 September of this year, I can confirm that the tender was awarded to Australian company Oricon, an engineering company that will lead the Kakadu road strategy, and they’ll work in a consortium with PwC, and PwC Indigenous consulting, beginning the work immediately. The roads of strategy will be developed in conjunction with the tourism master plan, access to key sites and planned upgrades. I thought the member would be interested in that additional information. And we are done. 11 more question times left in the year. The folders are stacked. We are done as soon as Greg Hunt finishes this dixer. Warren Snowdon to Scott Morrison: I ask the prime minister how does the government expect to unlock the full potential of Kakadu national park when it’s pushed back the start date for the upgrade of roads in the Kakadu national park to beyond the next federal election. Sussan Ley takes it: I thank the member for his question, and I find it quite extraordinary that he should be suggesting that $216 million committed by the prime minister and this side of politics for the upgrade in Kakadu national park is somehow insufficient. We know what happens when you roll out an infrastructure program too quickly because it we saw it in government with Labor time after time. We know what happens when you shovel the money out the door – no policies, guidelines or procurement. $216 million has been dedicated to the upgrade. I was there recently. The traditionally owners are very happy with the process, the tourism initiatives that are starting – they’re very happy with the process. We have good relationships with the Northern Territory government. We’re not playing politics about this. How could you come into this place and talk this sort of nonsense? Honestly, Mr Speaker. Damian Drum has a dixer for David Littleproud. He stumbles getting through the long list of junior ministries Littleproud holds. “Why do you have so many titles,” Ed Husic calls out, which makes even Littleproud smile. Still doesn’t make up for losing the one he really wanted though – agriculture – to deputy leader Bridget McKenzie. Anthony Albanese to Michael McCormack: Can he confirm that the gap between what the government promised on budget night and what they’ve actually spent on infrastructure is on blackspots, $123m, heavy vehicle safety program, $134m, bridges renewal, $154m, cattle supply, 96, northern Australia roads, $266m, western Sydney infrastructure, $915m, major road projects $2.8bn and asset recycling initiatives $1.5m. McCormack is talking, but for some reason, all I can think about is over-boiled cauliflower. Melissa Price just told Anthony Albanese he was “very rude”. This is where we are. Alicia Payne to Scott Morrison: Since coming to office the government has spent a total of $5bn less on infrastructure than it promised including $123m less than it promised on blackspots. Why? Morrison: Mr Speaker, as members opposite would know, the program and schedule of projects, which the government pursues, one that is put together in partnership with the states and territories as we seek to implement that plan. And, Mr Speaker, and indeed whether it’s with local government even on projects that we pursue, our job is to ensure that we provide the allocation of the funds and to set the priority projects and to sit down with the state and territory governments. Now those opposite would know, and in particular the leader of the opposition would know, from his time when he served as a minister for infrastructure, that the scheduling of projects is set out together with the states and territories and the profile for the delivery of those projects is often revised based on the advice provided by those states and territories. And that is why the changes in the schedule arrive as they have. I’d make this point, though. Under our government, this year we will spend around $10bn on infrastructure. That is what is budged to be spent in this very financial year. All around the country. Now, Mr Speaker, that’s almost double, almost double, what we inherited from the Labor party when we came to government and the leader of the opposition, who sits at the table now, I think from memory, and I’ll be happy to stand corrected on this figure, but I understand the figure at that time was around $6bn. And so this year we’re spending $10bn or thereabouts just slightly less than that, and the reason we’re doing that is because two budgets ago we decided to put in place the $75bn pipeline of projects over 10 years, and in the last budget, recognising the difficult situation that we’re facing in the global economy, we increased that pipeline of investments over the next 10 years $100bn. We upped it, Mr Speaker, because we knew that’s what the Australian economy would need just not now but over the next 10 years and, more importantly than that, we have the budget discipline and the budget to back those sorts of commitments up. So, Mr Speaker, the reason for any change in schedules is not because of the lack of fiscal capacity or discipline because of this government but because of any changes to scheduling that is done in relation to our negotiations with the states and territories. Well, I know from those opposite when they’re in government the reason they cut defence spending the reason they don’t list pharmaceuticals, the reason they have to [insert] flood levies and all these things is because they never know how to manage money. Australians knew they could trust this government to deliver and manage money. Again, the last time Labor was in government, there was the GFC. (No) right to know While question time rolls on, officials from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet are declining to answer a bunch of questions. They won’t say whether Brian Houston appeared on a list of possible guests to attend the state dinner in Washington supplied by the PMO on the basis that might prejudice international relations. (No I’m not joking). They won’t answer questions about Alexander Downer on the same basis. Officials from PMC also said they don’t know who Scott Morrison told Donald Trump was the primary point of contact for the Barr inquiry, even though Trump made a special call to Morrison to ask for that point of contact. An official from PMC tells the hearing he got a short read-out of the call between Morrison and Trump from a member of Morrison’s staff afterwards, but the read-out was verbal and he didn’t take notes, (so there’s no paper trail to FOI.) He says the Department of Foreign Affairs is the lead agency. Finance minister Mathias Cormann says the first point of contact is our “outstanding and distinguished” ambassador to Washington, Joe Hockey. Milton Dick to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm for every $100 of the roads of strategic fund only 50 cents will be spent in Queensland this year. Michael McCormack is given the nod, meaning Milton Dick is on my list. We are getting on with funding, funding, roads of strategic importance. And projects in Queensland. And I have asked Mark Bailey, the minister responsible to bring forward projects. We’re getting on with making sure that we build the roads, build the ports, and do everything that we need to do as a government to build a better Queensland. We’re getting on with the job of making sure that if it comes to Queensland or indeed any state or territory that we’re building roads of strategic importance. Those opposite wouldn’t ever have funded a program such as the roads of strategic importance because they never, ever worried about a regional program unless they could rort it. And speaking of the chief rorter here she is. That’s Catherine King he is referring to, as she is at the despatch box. She asks for the comment to be withdrawn. “How do you know he was talking about you,” says a government minister, proving just how much attention they are paying to McCormack. Because he said it as she was at the despatch box, genius. McCormack withdraws, but he is still speaking, and now he is talking about truck drivers and whether or not people have been in them lately and just saying “strategic importance” randomly, like he has just discovered the phrase. The government is supporting “hardworking businesses”. So all you slackarse businesses take note. Anthony Albanese is trying to have a dixer to Angus Taylor ruled out of order, because it referred to “emissions reductions” and emissions are going up. Taylor: We haven’t just turned around the financial deficit, we have turned around their abatement deficit. Every moment I refrain from running from the chamber rampaging is a victory. “We are getting on with planning,” Michael McCormack says. Bookmark that as an election slogan. And to think he actually used to work with words for a living. Kate Thwaites to Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that none of the eight Victorian projects listed under the roads of strategic importance fund has even reached the planning stage? Morrison: We have a timeline and we are working on it with the premier of Victoria (That’s a paraphrasing because I have lost the will to live) The opposition may want to engage in the theatre of politics on these matters, but the premier of Victoria and I are engaging in the business of delivery of infrastructure projects in Victoria. Oh dear JLo. Now Michael McCormack is at the despatch box. He is talking about pipelines and I am willing my cells to start collapsing in on themselves because it would be less painful. Josh Frydenberg just took a lickspittle which is only helping to prove while the entire question time process in Australia needs to be scrapped, and started again. #deathtodixers Catherine King to Scott Morrison: Why did the government spend nearly $17m on taxpayer-funded congestion funding advertising in the lead-up to this year’s election but did not spend a single cent from the urban congestion fund the whole of the last financial year? Alan Tudge takes it – and that’s enough for me to become exceptionally fascinated with my cuticles. Jason Falinski asks Josh Frydenberg a dixer about his trip to the IMF meeting. We hear about how important it is (I guess it is an example of positive globalisation) so at the end of the answer, Jim Chalmers asks to table a transcript where Falinski described the IMF as a “leftwing organisation”. Permission is not granted. Zali Steggall has the independent’s question: Foodbank is the large provider of food and groceries to food relief charities around Australia. These charities provide relief to over 815,000 Australians each month including people in my electorate and farmers affected by the drought. 252 tonnes of food and groceries were shipped out of the New South Wales warehouse, alone, 110 tonnes went to regional and remote areas in New South Wales yet foodbank is not receiving any emergency funding to meet the demand. Will the government increase funding and support food support strategy as part of Australia’s response to climate change? Scott Morrison: I thank the member for her question and I will ask the minister representing the minister for social services to respond further to the member’s question. The government does provide support to Foodbank. We do to many Foodbank services around the country. And we are pleased to do so because we acknowledge the tremendous work that they do. As we continue to work particularly in response as part of our drought program, we are working with a whole host of different charitable organisation. We have provided over $50m in fact to organisations like the Salvos and Vinnies and others, the Country Women’s Association, in ensuring we’re providing the support where we can. I’ll ask the minister for - representing the for social services to add further. Paul Fletcher: I do thank the member for her question and the prime minister for the opportunity to add some further information in relation to the support that the government provides for food banks. $750,000 a year in funding over a 4.5-year period. That of course is not the only food relief program that the commonwealth government, Morrison government supports. We also provide funding for two other significant charities in this area, Second Bite and OzHarvest. These are all important measures designed to provide support to needy Australians, to vulnerable Australians, and of course we continue to work with these important agencies for the delivery of this funding. And continue to work with them and a whole range of other agencies to support Australians affected by drought. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: When the Reserve Bank, the IMF, the Business Council of Australia, AI group, Master Builders and others have all call for action by the government to support the economy, why is the government refusing to consider a proportionate, measured and responsible stimulus program to boost the economy by bringing forward infrastructure investment? Morrison: The government’s budget contains some almost $10bn of infrastructure in this financial year, Mr Speaker. That’s monies that is hitting right cross the country. In addition to that, Mr Speaker, the tax cuts that were legislated by this country, fought against by the Labor party, who said these shouldn’t happen and in fact the Labor party argued at the election that we should be imposing $387bn of higher taxes. Higher taxes on the Australian economy. I don’t know what sort of a stimulus package $387bn of higher taxes constitutes, but that was the description that was ... member for Lyons. That was offered by the shadow treasurer when he was the shadow finance minister and he was the joint architect, Mr Speaker, with the former shadow treasurer and the former leader of the opposition who said they thought at this time of great uncertainty in the global economy that adding $387bn to the tax burden of Australians would be a good idea. Now, we don’t share that view, Mr Speaker. We believe and we have demonstrated in our budget that the right way to go about addressing the issue in the global economy, indeed in the domestic economy is the stable and considered approach of rolling out our program of reducing the costs of doing business, whether it’s on removing unnecessary regulation, ensuring that we’re training people for the skills needs of the future, delivering tax relief to Australians, taking further out, Mr Speaker, our trade barriers to ensure that we’re dealing with in more and more countries in the world, taking our trade agreements coverage from 26% to 70%, and we’re seeking to go further. So, that is the economic plan that we took to the election. The Labor party would have us engage in the reckless spending policies that they last implemented when the member ... who asked the question ... the member for Rankin, and instituted one of the most reckless, reckless spending packages which crashed the budget and took money away from things like pharmaceuticals, defence spending and a whole range of other important priorities ‘cause the Labor party did not know how to manage money. Now, he refers to the governor of the Reserve Bank and I’m happy to quote him. ‘The Australian economy’, on 1 October, ‘Appears to have reached a turning point. The economy has been through a soft patch recently but we are expecting a return to around trend growth over the next year. There are a number of factors that are supporting this outlook. These include the low level of interest rates, the recent tax cuts, ongoing spending on infrastructure, signs of stabilise identification in established housing markets.’ Just your standard reminder that the GFC happened when Labor was in power. The department of agriculture has put out this statement, after the footage of horses being mistreated was shown on the ABC’s 7.30 The regulation of animal welfare remains the responsibility of the states and territories. The Department of Agriculture’s role is limited to export abattoirs where it works to ensure Australian export standards are met. Consistent with the department’s responsibilities, we are conducting a critical incident audit of the facility at the centre of recent footage depicting the mistreatment of horses. Queensland authorities are working closely with the department on this audit. A preliminary report will be produced early this week. The department will then determine any regulatory action to be taken. The department understands that Queensland has requested the original footage from the ABC, which will assist in determining a number of important factors, such as when the incidents took place. The department urges anyone with evidence or concerns about animal welfare to immediately report it to the relevant state jurisdiction. In environment estimates Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young is asking about the statutory review of Australia’s environment laws (the EPBC Act) that is due to commence this month. The department confirms it will begin in the next 10 days but doesn’t have a date. A terms of reference has been drafted that will be released when the review is announced. They can’t tell the hearing who will be leading the review. “It will commence within the next 10 days,” the department’s deputy secretary Dean Knudson says. “The last review took about a year. I expect this will be of a similar length.” Officials say a department team of 13.4 full-time equivalent staff has been set up for the review. Just on Scott Morrison’s answer just before: If we get to the point where the leader of the opposition wants to arbitrarily, outside the law ... decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t, Mr Speaker, then that’s not a country that I think Australians would want to live in. That is pretty much what the attorney general does. He will look at the brief that is put forward by the commonwealth director of public prosecutions and then decide if the commonwealth pursues it. That’s a pretty big part of the nation’s first law officer’s job. Someone has subjected us to Michael McCormack at the despatch box, and it’s as substantial as watching rice boil over. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: (referring to the Right to Know campaign) Does the prime minister agree that journalism is not a crime? Morrison: I agree that journalism is not a crime. But I agree also, and I wonder if the leader of the opposition agrees, that if people – whatever profession they’re in, whether they’re politicians, whether they’re journalists, whether they’re anyone, Mr Speaker, a public officials, there is no one in this country who is above the law. People should not be prosecuted for their profession. They should only be prosecuted if indeed they have been found to be falling foul of the law, Mr Speaker. And I do not believe that those decisions about who should be prosecuted at the end of the day should be made on the whim of politicians. I think they should be made based on the rule of law, Mr Speaker. Members on my left. And the proper assessment of appropriately constituted law enforcement agencies. And that is why, Mr Speaker ... the government believes absolutely in press freedoms in this country and we have taken steps ... we have taken the step to add additional defences into our laws to ensure that journalists, Mr Speaker, can get about their task. In fact, Mr Speaker, protections that exceed that apply to many others around the country, and those were put in by our government, not those opposite, because I remember when those were in government ... they sought to gag the press right across the country, Mr Speaker. They sought to gag the press in this country with their failed media reforms that wanted to implement a public interest a public interest media advocate to try and stifle the press in this country. Now, Mr Speaker, I am not going to take lectures from a Labor party who sought in this place when they were in government to try and muzzle the press. In stark contrast we provided guidelines from the minister for home affairs to the AFP and other law enforcement agencies about how best to go about their business. And I know the statement from the commissioner of the AFP the work he’s doing to review those matters. But if it comes to a position in this country where prime ministers and politicians decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t get prosecuted ... Without taking the appropriate advice and without seeing the appropriate release which are required under legislation. If we get to the point where the leader of the opposition wants to arbitrarily, outside the law ... Decide who gets prosecuted and who doesn’t, Mr Speaker, then that’s not a country that I think Australians would want to live in. Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation director general Mike Burgess is up in Senate estimates. In his opening statement, Burgess described the threat level to Australia from both terrorism and foreign interference as “unprecedented”. He cited the threat of extremist groups in Syria and Iraq encouraging attacks in Australia and added that the threat of extreme rightwing groups “continues” and is an important area of focus. It’s interesting he said “continues” because the Asio annual report said the rightwing extremist threat has actually “increased”, but eventually he picks up the script from the report and says the threat is “more cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years”. Under questioning from Labor’s Kristina Keneally, Burgess said a rightwing extremist terrorist attack is “plausible”, citing a matter in the NSW courts at the moment. He said there was “”no doubt” the horrific Christchurch attack would inspire some individuals. Burgess confirms no rightwing extremist groups are listed as terrorist organisations and says he’s not aware the UK has listed one. “We are actively [investigating] ... we have subjects of investigation and they are ongoing. We’ve had a mind and eye to this for a number of years now,” he said. Liberal senator Amanda Stoker asks what proportion of Asio’s work is focused on rightwing extremism, leftwing extremism, Islamic extremism and “other” forms of extremism. He takes the question on notice. We have our first reference to “chaos and panic” from Scott Morrison in regards to Labor. It’s all part of this new narrative of why the government is holding on to its surplus, in the face of more and more calls to stimulate the economy. That narrative boils down to this from Scott Morrison: And so they elected a government that they knew would be able to address these very difficult circumstances with stability, with certainty, with measure and do so in a way not afflicted by the politics of crisis or the policies of crisis but with the stable and calm approach that enables them to get on and plan for their future with confidence. And that’s why, Mr Speaker, as a government we are continuing to do that. Whether it is maintaining the discipline in our budget management, which is one of the reasons why – the big reason why we’ve been able to take what was an absolute fiscal wreckage that was left to us under the Labor party and over the last six years we have painstakingly done the work, getting expenditure under control, making the choices that are necessary to get the budget back into a position that gives this country resilience at a time when it needs it. But because politics is as subtle as Cardi B, Labor is “panic and chaos” while “stability and certainty is the mark of our government”, a point Morrison hopes to be able to keep making until it catches on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Will the prime minister convene a cross-party drought cabinet to ensure that representatives from across the parliament work together constructively to respond to the drought emergency in the interests of farmers and rural communities? “Good question, take the politics out of it,” someone in Labor yells. The government benches laugh. Morrison: The government’s drought response over a year ago was based on the multiple sclerosis party, multiple sclerosis organisation drought summit that was convened in the Old Parliament House which the opposition was invited to attend as were all states and territories as was the National Farmers’ Federation, the many different agricultural producer groups, charitable organisation, the Country Women’s Association. Mr Speaker, experts and officials from across government agencies and departments and, Mr Speaker... (INTERJECTIONS) Yes, the drought coordinator was in attendance there ... and he was central to the organisation of that drought summit. All – there were many members from this House who were present at that summit as well and that summit framed the drought response the government has continued to rollout since that time. And since that time we’ve continued to listen very carefully, particularly through the minister for drought to rural communities across the country to ensure that the response that we are continuing to provide is up to the mark in terms of the needs in rural and regional communities across Australia. I remind the House that that response has three components. The first of those components is to ensure the direct financial support and assistance as is the responsibilities of the commonwealth under the national drought agreement which was revised and updated after that drought summit which made it very clear that it was the commonwealth’s responsibility to look after the income support and other financial assistance to farmhouse holds and those communities, and issues such as fodder subsidies and subsidies and the direct care of animals and others involved in the welfare of the farms themselves. That was the responsibility of the states and territories. So the reforms we have made to Farm Household Allowance alone means with a period of just over four years with the announcement last year that individual households will have received as couples $125,000 in direct financial support. Not alone but direct financial support over and above what they are able to do in terms of earning off farm income which we lifted the threshold up to $100,000 and that enables them even with that off farm income to access the Farm Household Allowance. There was drought to drought affected communities through a community. So it’s not just about farmers and graziers, it’s also about the communities that are infect – affected and we have invested in over 120 councils and their shire areas to ensure wear supporting the continuation and growth of their economies during difficult times and of course we have invested in water resilience. That’s our plan. We’re getting on with it. We’ll continue to get on with it will being to farming communities. And so does my eye twitch Scott Morrison is in the House and is having a chat with Anthony Albanese which they both seem to be enjoying, given the laughter. We are in the chamber for question time - who is that MP? It’s Susan Templeton, the member for Macquarie. And now it’s John McVeigh, the member for Groom. Penny Wong is now FOIing the documents PM&amp;C received and then sent in regards to the William Barr investigation into the Mueller report, given Alexander Downer’s involvement. Dear FOI Officer RE: FREEDOM OF INFORMATION APPLICATION – INVESTIGATION INITIATED BY THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR CONCERNING THE FBI’S RUSSIA INVESTIGATION I request the following documents held by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act): All documents created, or received, since 1 May 2018 related to the investigation initiated by the United States Attorney General William Barr concerning the FBI’s Russia investigation, including, but not limited to, communications with the United States Government and briefs to the Prime Minister. This request excludes media reports, press releases and duplicate documents. I note that the objects of the FOI Act include giving the Australian community access to information held by government and promoting Australia’s representative democracy by increasing scrutiny, discussion, comment and review of government activities. I expect that as soon as practicable, and no later than 30 days after receiving this request, I will be notified of a decision. Documents should be provided to [redacted] Yours sincerely Senator Penny Wong Also from AAP, an update from that noted climate scientist Pauline Hanson: #notallcorals A defiant Pauline Hanson has maintained coral bleaching is a natural occurrence, in an exchange with the chief scientist of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. The Queenslander used a Senate estimates hearing on Monday to question the link between heatwaves and back-to-back mass coral bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. “You’re saying that coral bleaching is affected by water temperatures,” she told David Wachenfeld. “Yet around Indonesia, closer to the equator ... where the water temperatures are 29C, it’s a known fact that coral actually grows faster and more prolific in warmer temperatures.” Dr Wachenfeld explained that corals live in a variety of water temperatures over the world, with substantial differences even within the Great Barrier Reef. Corals bleach when stressed – such as when exposed to warmer than normal temperatures – and die if stressed for prolonged periods, he told the senator. “The fact that corals in Indonesia could withstand higher temperatures than corals on the central Great Barrier Reef is of no benefit to the corals of the central Great Barrier Reef when they die.” But Senator Hanson was not swayed, asking how the authority planned to address both water temperatures and the “natural occurrence” of bleaching events with its taxpayer funding. The GBRMPA is trying to stamp out crown-of-thorns starfish, improve water quality in catchments while urging for greater global action on climate change, Senator Hanson was told. The authority recently released its latest five-year outlook for the reef, that found it to be “very poor” unless more action was taken to slow climate change. From AAP: Taxpayers forked out millions to sell the federal government’s infrastructure promises in the lead-up to the May election, dwarfing spending in the previous year. Infrastructure department officials confirmed more than $13 million was spent on advertising projects in the past financial year. But just $272,000 in taxpayer funds went to similar advertising in 2017-18, while $64,000 was spent in 2016-17. Labor frontbencher Murray Watt asked cabinet minister Bridget McKenzie about the issue during a Senate estimates hearing in Canberra on Monday. “It spent $11.626 million of taxpayers’ money in the three months leading up to the election – you got a pretty good return on your investment didn’t you?” he said. Senator McKenzie said the decision was based on market research indicating a low level of community awareness about infrastructure spending. “This campaign was about informing the Australian public about spending on infrastructure in their local communities,” she said. Senator Watt noted the government spent about 60 times more money on infrastructure spending in an election year than the previous year. “That’s just a total coincidence?” he asked. Environment officials have answered some questions about the Angus Taylor grasslands saga. Specifically, they were asked about occasions when the former minister Josh Frydenberg or his office sought information about the investigation into alleged illegal land clearing by Jam Land Pty Ltd, which Minister Taylor part owns. Labor’s Katy Gallagher has asked the questions to follow up on this story by Guardian Australia last week. Monica Collins, the department’s chief of compliance, lists some dates in July, August and October 2017. But Gallagher is interested in some earlier requests from the minister’s office in February 2017. As revealed by Guardian last week, an email shows staff were asked to prepare “urgent” talking points about the grasslands listing after a compliance case was raised in parliament. But searches by Guardian Australia of Hansard records found no mention of it. Today, Collins confirms the department also went looking for a Hansard record at the time and they, too, found nothing. “I’m not sure where that request came into the office but my recollection of that document is that it was on the basis with a phone call with somebody,” she told the hearing. “I know that staff also searched Hansard and didn’t find a direct mention of it in parliament. Gallagher: “So they did [a search] on that date? Around the time the request came in, they did a search to see whether it had been mentioned in the parliament?” Collins: “Yes that’s right” Gallagher: “And, could they find anything?” Collins: No, nothing specific. Nothing specific about Jam Land and grasslands. Collins says the information supplied to Frydenberg’s office was “very high level” in terms of “a brief update on the investigation, some information about the grasslands listing” and things of that nature. The Greens senator Larissa Waters asks when the department conducted site visits to the Jam Land property near Delegate in NSW and when it first launched proceedings against Jam Land. Collins says she can’t give dates of site visits because the investigation is ongoing, but there have been four site visits. She said the department received the report about alleged illegal clearing in November 2016 and first wrote to Jam Land in December 2016. Waters asked why the investigation has taken nearly three years. Collins says a lot of factors influence this, such as the caseload of individual officers, but “we’re hoping to conclude it very soon”. The Senate estimate committees are all on a lunch break and the House is on the downhill slide to question time, so it’s a catch your breath moment. The climate emergency motion debate ran out of time – it will continue tomorrow. Penny Wong says she understands US senator Lindsay Graham wrote to the prime minister on 2 October ... but we go to the scheduled break before we can see if this is a question Mathias Cormann will allow the PM&amp;C officials to answer. Also, a couple of extra bits from the Albanese press conference: he addresses the rumour that Labor MP Mike Kelly might trigger a byelection in his marginal seat of Eden-Monaro, saying Kelly will be here “for a long time” and is an “important member of the team”. He says the only way that the government will be able to claw back the seat will be to beat him in an election. Albanese is also asked about the Right to Know campaign, saying he agrees on the importance of a free press and commenting that it is “unacceptable” that journalists should be facing criminal prosecution. The Labor leader is also asked why only five MPs were in the chamber when the opposition introduced its climate emergency motion, saying that was “what happened in parliament” and it was no reflection of the importance of motions or legislation. Back in estimates, Penny Wong says she is just trying to work out how Australia went from “we’ll co-operate if asked”, which is what Marise Payne said, to Joe Hockey proactively sending a letter saying we would help. This is all taken on notice. “This is the most interventionist you’ve ever been,” Wong says. “... I’m quite relaxed, actually,” Cormann says a little later. Labor will vote in support of three new free trade agreements after securing a range of concessions from the government on labour market testing, worker exploitation, and outdated agreements regarding investor legal rights. Labor leader Anthony Albanese and shadow trade minister Madeleine King have held a press conference confirming their support for enabling legislation tabled last week, saying the agreements with Indonesia, Hong Kong and Peru would be good for Australian jobs, business and the national economy. Albanese said that, had Labor been in government, it would have made a different agreement with Indonesia that would have better dealt with labour market testing and would have excluded investor state dispute settlement clauses. “This is not an agreement that Labor would have made, we would have made different provisions,” Albanese said. “But it is an agreement the government has put forward, and one in which, overall, provides benefits for Australian workers, Australian jobs and for our national economy, which is why Labor will be supporting these three agreements.” As part of its negotiations, Labor has secured from the government a commitment to bring forward criminal penalties for the worst forms of worker exploitation, which Albanese said would now occur as a “matter of urgency”. The trade minister, Simon Birmingham, has assured the opposition that the government will seek to terminate a bilateral investment treaty signed between Indonesia and Australia, including “survival clauses”, but this will require Indonesian agreement. Albanese said that he believed this was a “matter of courtesy”, but he was confident that the old agreement would be scrapped. The argument is now dissolving into who is speaking over who. When did the PM&amp;C officials become aware of our assistance with the Barr inquiry? Mathias Cormann attempts to stop this one as well. Eventually we get to someone saying it is being dealt with by foreign affairs and trade and has no involvement from PM&amp;C. But when did they first become aware, Wong asks Caroline Miller, who heads up the PM&amp;C international division, once again. Cormann again stops the answer. I swear to JLo, this is like watching a report being redacted in real time. “Are you aware now,” Wong asks again. “That’s a very funny question,” Cormann says. While this sideshow is happening in PM&amp;C estimates, Michaelia Cash has shown up in the home affairs estimates hearing. “If it was business as usual, surely you wouldn’t be worried about answering questions,” Penny Wong asks. “I’m not worried,” Mathias Cormann says. And around and around we go. “The front page of the papers is looking very accurate,” Penny Wong says, after around 1,000,000 of back and forth between her and Mathias Cormann about when officials in the prime minister’s department knew it was the government’s position to assist with the US justice department inquiry into the Mueller investigation and Alexander Downer’s role in it. Labor’s Murray Watt has asked infrastructure and regional development department officials whether they have read any of Barnaby Joyce’s texts about the drought. Answer: no. Agriculture minister Bridget McKenzie offers a lot of generalities about what Joyce delivered – including “a lot of correspondence about how we can better help drought affected communities”. He offered a “range of advice” which “informs our ongoing response” to the drought. Watt then takes up the attack about the eligibility of councils for drought assistance funding. Officials revealed that Moira shire failed because only 16.9% of its workforce is in agriculture, fisheries or forestry and the cutoff is 17%. Watt suggests that, likewise, Singleton, Kiama, Shoalhaven, Eurobadalla and Yass are “all badly drought-affected but not eligible” because of the workforce threshold. Departmental officials take on notice how far they fell short. Officials also revealed the government made an election commitment to provide drought funding to 14 councils and the department did not apply the same criteria because it was a “decision of government” to commit funding. Watt criticises the decision to “hand out money during an election” while “poor old Moira shire missed out”. Officials take on notice whether any of the 14 councils would have failed the eligibility test, if it were applied. McKenzie said the decision was based on ABS and Bureau of Meteorology data, but can’t say whether they met the criteria. Penny Wong is trying for the fourth or fifth time to find out if anyone within the prime minister’s department knew of the US justice department announcement, given Alexander Downer’s involvement. It has now been taken on notice by Mathias Cormann, to stop Wong from asking any of the officials about it. But apparently the senior PM and C international division officials were unaware of Joe Hockey’s letter agreeing to assist with the investigation, before it was sent. Cormann again says it would be remarkable if we didn’t agree to assist, as is normal practice. “There is actually nothing remarkable in this, it would be very strange if Mr Hockey, representing the Australian government, had said anything else,” Cormann says. Cormann wants these questions to go to foreign affairs and trade. Was the government informed about the investigation before it was publicly announced, Penny Wong wants to know? Mathias Cormann says the Australian government “of course” seeks to co-operate with official investigations and it would be remarkable if Australia did not agree to co-operate. He says there is only so much he can talk about. But he doesn’t answer the question. Penny Wong is now moving on to the investigation the US justice department has ordered into how the Mueller inquiry came about – you may remember that Alexander Downer is wrapped up in that. Penny Wong says Mathias Cormann is attempting to make assertions about what is in “my mind and heart” about the motives in her questions (about what Australia thinks is the risk of Da’esh coming back). Cormann says the imputations were clear. Wong says she just wants answers. “I am actually just asking about consequences ... about the current situation in northern Syria,” she says. Cormann can’t let go of what he thinks the imputations. Now Jacqui Lambie is pissed with how it’s all going, and she just wants to know if there is a risk assessment – telling Cormann the problem is “you have no plan”. “The Australian public would like to know,” she says. “You have nothing on paper ... there are a lot of unanswered questions here.” Wong lets her go. Lambie says given Cormann and Scott Morrison said Donald Trump’s actions didn’t come as a surprise, since Trump had spoken about it in the past, what conversations did Australia have about protecting Australian troops, given there was a risk of the US withdrawing its own troops. “When did you actually open up dialogue about this – was it just the day [he announced it]?” Cormann just says Australia has a good relationship with the US, and we have “ongoing and consistent” dialogue with the US. Lambie still wants to know when Australia first discussed this with the US. “We have answered this question,” Cormann says. Which means, based on these answers, the first conversation was after Trump publicly announced the withdrawal. “So in other words, Australia had no idea, and Trump just walked over the top of them and you just went, ‘that’s it, we can’t do anything’, because you left your run too late,” Lambie says. Cormann disputes this, but we still don’t get any answers. Another 10 minutes have passed and we still don’t have any more idea of whether the Australian government has made any sort of risk assessment over whether there is likely to be a re-emergence or strengthening of the Da’esh terror group, given the Syria situation. Amnesty Australia has responded to the AFP’s apology to Hakeem al-Araibi: An apology, albeit belated, is the very least Hakeem should expect for the ordeal he and his family endured,” Amnesty International Australia campaigner Tim O’Connor said. It’s a welcome acknowledgement of systemic failure in the AFP and Department of Home Affairs processes. We look forward to the Department of Home Affairs also offering an apology to Hakeem and his family. The evidence we have garnered through Freedom of Information clearly shows it is the failure of Home Affairs systems and communications that led to Hakeem’s detention in Thailand. It is troubling that more than 10 months after these Australian government departments failed Hakeem, that their systems are still not fixed. What happened to Hakeem could happen to someone else, which is why Australian taxpayers should receive an independent and transparent inquiry so we can all have trust in our government’s systems. In rural and regional affairs, infrastructure department officials have revealed just 430 public service jobs have been decentralised from the ACT, central Sydney and central Melbourne. Labor’s Murray Watt makes Bridget McKenzie read out the whole list, making wise cracks about the fact that Adelaide, Brisbane and Parramatta are hardly regional centres. Watt also wants more detail about which jobs are due to move or have moved already. Some 239 jobs moved in 2018 including: The Unique Student Identifier Registrar moved 40 positions from Canberra to Adelaide The office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations moved 10 from Canberra to Darwin The Indigenous Affairs group in PMC moved 32 jobs, including 25 from the Sydney CBD to Parramatta The office of the Rural Health Commissioner moved 4 new positions to Adelaide. The infrastructure department moved 12 including 3 to Perth and 9 in the Inland Rail division Australian Maritime Safety Authority – moved “up to 69 new positions” Australian Law Reform Commission – 12 positions from Sydney to Brisbane. Aboriginal Hostels Limited moved 40 new positions The Australian space agency will move 20 from Canberra to Adelaide. And another 191 jobs moved in 2019, including: The regional programs branch of the infrastructure department is moving from Canberra to Orange The Australian Financial Security Authority moved 15 positions to Hobart, Perth and Brisbane Comcare will relocate some positions and establish offices in Darwin and Launceston The National Indigenous Australians Agency moved 35 from Canberra to Alice Springs, Coffs Harbour and Broome. The Murray Darling Basin Authority moved 76 to Albury, Wodonga, Grififth, Mildura, Murray Bridge and Goondiwindi. Labor’s Glenn Sterle has asked about suggestions up to 1,700 jobs would be moved. McKenzie and departmental officials suggest the bigger number reflects jobs moved before the April 2017 launch of the decentralisation agenda and an ongoing commitment. The precise breakdown has been taken on notice. “These are the front pages today, the front pages today, and you won’t even answer a question about whether or not there was a note taker,” Penny Wong says, holding up the Adelaide Advertiser front page. “Oh the cameras are going, you’ve got them all lined up,” Mathias Cormann says. I mean first of all, no, we are all able to work out that Wong and Cormann in estimates will lead to an argument, because this is not our first time at the rodeo. It’s not even our second. And secondly, this whole place is a theatre. It’s how it works. Anthony Albanese has just called a press conference in the next five minutes. It’s Penny Wong v Mathias Cormann in Senate estimates. They both seem happy to be back on familiar ground. Ten minutes into the hearing, Cormann is talking over Wong, Wong is telling him why she believes he is wrong, and James Paterson is trying his best to keep order. Wong is trying to find out about how Australia found out about the Syria US troop withdrawal (through the public announcement) and whether in follow-up phone calls between Australian and US officials, notes were taken. Sarah Martin is listening for you, and will have more for you soon. As far as Reece Kershaw knows, the AFP is not planning any more raids on journalists, he tells the Labor senator Raff Ciccone. “But it’s something that we’d obviously be having a look at.” Penny Wong has just entered Senate estimates for the first time. She is in the finance and public administration committee, to question the prime minister’s department. From AAP: Australia’s new top cop has personally apologised to refugee footballer Hakeem al-Araibi for the months he spent behind bars in Thailand. Al-Araibi, a permanent Australian resident, was locked up in Bangkok after Bahraini officials pursued him over vandalism charges. Australian federal police commissioner Reece Kershaw, who has been in the job 19 days, acknowledged a trail of bureaucratic bungles led to his detention. Kershaw said he was now working with the Department of Home Affairs to address a “lack of connectivity” between border security systems and the Interpol database. “I have delivered a letter to Mr al-Araibi to extend AFP’s apology for his unfortunate detention in Thailand,” he told a Senate committee in Canberra on Monday. “And to reassure Mr al-Araibi that the AFP is continuing to review and improve processes in consultation with other relevant agencies to ensure we respond appropriate to these matters in the future. “The AFP is working closely with the department to resolve the overarching policy and legal questions arising from this matter.” The chamber is still debating Mark Butler’s motion to declare a climate emergency. There is an inevitable end to this – the government does not support it, so it won’t pass. Pauline Hanson has made an appearance at the estimates committee grilling the AFP. She wants to know about pill testing. Hanson asks the police commissioner whether pill testing is encouraging the drug trade in Australia. The commissioner says he doesn’t believe organised criminal syndicates would be influenced by whether pill testing exists or doesn’t. “It’s a global business,” the commissioner says, of the drug trade. Pill testing isn’t relevant. The Greens have just spent a good 10 minutes or so asking about their climate emergency hot air balloon which they wanted to launch over Parliament House last week. Senate president Scott Ryan has explained that when approval was sought, he learned that it was up to Casa to control the airspace above parliament, and a request was then made by DPS to have the access denied. Larissa Waters asked about a balloon that was seen above parliament this morning and why it had been allowed when its climate emergency protest balloon had not been. Ryan says that regardless of the cause, the presiding officers did not believe that any balloon should be allowed access to the airspace above Parliament House. He said it was a matter for Casa to police the current exclusion zone and added that they wanted to make the no-fly zone permanent. Andrew Wilkie has introduced a “protect refugees” bill in the House. This bill provides for a sustainable, equitable and humane response to the protection and processing of asylum seekers and refugees in the Asia Pacific region. A key component of this bill is the Asia Pacific Asylum Seeker Solution (Apass), a regional framework to be initiated by the Australian government in partnership with other Asia Pacific countries. All countries party to Apass must be legally bound to provide effective protection for asylum seekers and refugees as provided under international law. It is identical to the refugee protection bill 2018, introduced to the House of Representatives by the member for Denison on 18 June 2018. In rural and regional affairs estimates, Labor is probing how Moyne shire council was declared eligible for $1m of drought assistance funding when the council said it wasn’t in drought. Diana Hallam, the infrastructure department executive director of regional development and local government, explains that Moyne shire qualified because between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2019 more than 60% of the shire had received 14 consecutive months of a one-in-20-year rainfall deficiency, and 17% of the workforce was engaged in agriculture, fisheries or forestry. But after the shire said it didn’t need the funding, the department conducted an audit and discovered a small stuff-up. Either the data from the Bureau of Meteorology or the selection of it the department used ran until the end of May 2019 not June. Hallam said this did not affect the result – Moyne shire and the other 12 councils all qualified when the numbers were rerun over the correct 24-month period. No decision has yet been made by the government about what will happen to the $1m, which Moyne will not receive. Hallam: “We assess rainfall on a quarterly basis. With the conclusion of the 1 July to 30 September quarter we will assess eligibility again, and there will be another opportunity regarding whether new shires become eligible.” Angus Taylor, on Sky News this morning, said he didn’t know what a climate emergency actually meant (as in policy) and called it “empty” virtue signalling (which is something the Tories in the UK might raise an eyebrow at, considering they passed one.) Anyway, Mark Butler has moved this motion in the House: notes that: Climate change is a significant threat to our economy, natural environment, farming communities and national security; Australia’s annual emissions have been rising in recent years; as a global problem, the solution to climate change requires concerted international cooperation to limit the production of greenhouse gases; as the only global agreement designed to address climate change, the Paris accords must play a central role in addressing climate change; the Paris accords require signatory countries to deliver actions consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2C above preindustrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C; based on the latest scientific advice, the world is currently on track for warming of above 3C, and efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts; and as a result of the threat posed by climate change, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Portugal, Argentina and the Republic of Ireland have declared a climate emergency; and therefore, affirms that: Australia remains committed to delivering on its obligations under the Paris accords; failing to meet the goals of the Paris accords would have unprecedented and devastating environmental, economic, societal and health impacts for Australia; and the threat posed by climate change on the future prosperity and security of Australia and the globe constitutes a climate change emergency. Senate president Scott Ryan is refusing to answer questions about a hack on Parliament House that the country’s intelligence agencies have said was carried out by a foreign government. Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick asked a series of questions about the data breach that took place in February and which targeted Australia’s political parties. Ryan said he would not comment on whether a foreign government had been identified, nor any details of the data breach. “I don’t think it is appropriate for public consumption,” Ryan said. “I don’t think these matters are appropriately canvassed in a public forum.” Ryan said he had received a report on the data breach, but he did not think the report was “appropriate” for publication.”I am not convinced that publishing the report I have received, even in a redacted form would be helpful.” He said he would be receiving a further briefing and consulting with Speaker of the House, Tony Smith, before updating the Senate on what took place. It was reported by Reuters earlier this year that China was responsible for the cyber attack. Prime minister Scott Morrison told parliament that a “sophisticated state actor” was responsible for the “malicious activity.” Mike Bowers was in Senate estimates to capture new AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw doing his best Mariah Carey’s “I don’t know her” in response to questions about the media campaign today: You could also insert Keke Palmer’s “sorry to this man” response gif to not knowing who Dick Cheney was. In environment estimates, Katy Gallagher is asking about the department’s failure to publish freedom of information documents on its public disclosure log for more than 10 months, a breach of FOI law. The department is saying an increase in FOI requests and “IT matters” have caused the issue. “We made a decision last year to change our disclosure log process so that documents were made immediately available,” Margaret Tregurtha, from the department’s general counsel branch, says. “It’s apparent that in doing that we encountered some difficulties with the website. “We’re now in a situation where we’re making every effort to catch that up.” Katy Gallagher is asking why, if it’s a relatively simple process to upload documents to the website, has the delay in disclosures occurred. The department says that once the backlog of disclosures arose it became difficult to find time to catch up because they were prioritising the processing of FOI applications. Officials don’t have information available to tell Labor the average processing for FOI applications it receives. The department says its intention is to publish the documents that should have been uploaded to the disclosure log since January. The department tells the committee that there are about 120 document packs that need to be published and there could be thousands of documents within those document packages. Katy Gallagher asks why advice was not sent to the ,inister’s office if the department was in breach of the law. “If I was the minister I would want to know if my department was breaking the law,” she says. Matt Cahill, the deputy secretary of the strategy and operations group, says the department is working to bring itself in line with the act. “We will bring ourselves up to standard in the next week,” he says. Still with the AFP at estimates, the police commissioner has been asked by Green senator Nick McKim about the leaking of a home affairs briefing document that included advice from Asio. Quotes from this document, which was about the medevac regime, ended up in the front page of the Australian. The commissioner, Reece Kershaw, confirmed the AFP “declined to escalate” even though it was an unlawful disclosure. McKim wonders why. The commissioner says about 200 people had access to drafts of the document, but the final version went to 11 email addresses. He says there is a “priority system” when it comes to launching leak investigations, which includes costs and the likely success of being able to produce a brief of evidence. McKim is less than convinced. Oh, there we go The Parliamentary Budget Office is being asked about a thought bubble from DPM Michael McCormack to move the ABC’s Ultimo headquarters to regional Victoria. Labor senator Kimberley Kitching requested the PBO cost the proposal. Parliamentary Budget officer Jenny Wilkinson said the PBO was not able to calculate the fiscal impact of the idea, given it would require industry-specific expertise that it did not have. “We were not in a position to make a judgment.” Yes this is inside baseball, but it was a big deal to everyone who works in this building, after a project clusterfriz ended with the entries being closed for more than a year, meaning a lot of equipment was lugged up a lot of stairs, rain, hail or snow. Reece Kershaw on press freedom (before admitting he had not seen the front page of today’s papers, or “turned his mind” to the campaign: In regards to the recent inquiries and media reporting on the freedom of the press: as I have previously stated, police independence and freedom of the press are both fundamental pillars that coexist in our democracy. I strongly believe in these two pillars and this is the approach I intend to take. I welcome the direction from the minister for home affairs outlining his expectations in terms of taking into account the importance of a free and open press. In support of the direction, the AFP has finalised an internal national guideline on investigations of unauthorised disclosure of material made or obtained by a current or former commonwealth officer. I am also aware of the direction issued by the attorney general to the commonwealth director of public prosecutions. The attorney general’s direction reaffirms the importance of the AFP to thoroughly investigate these matters and to collect all relevant information and evidence to ensure the attorney general and CDPP can make a fully informed decision, where relevant. As I mentioned earlier, the outcomes of the review conducted by John Lawler into sensitive investigations will better inform the AFP on how to deal with these matters. I look forward to working with you and your parliamentary colleagues to ensure the review takes into account the deliberations of other parliamentary inquiries currently under way. On the review the AFP commissioner has ordered, Reece Kershaw said: Further, in light of my public commitment to improve the processes around the recent investigations involving News Corp and the ABC, I have enlisted the services of former CEO of the Australian Crime Commission, Mr John Lawler AM, APM to conduct a review into all sensitive investigations. This incorporates matters relating to unauthorised disclosure; the application of parliamentary privilege; espionage and foreign interference; and war crimes. • The review will not be an audit into the current matters at hand but rather a holistic approach to ensure we have in place investigative policy and guidelines that are fit for purpose. Mr Lawler will provide my office with options around opportunities for interventions and strategies to ensure the AFP is best placed to address sensitive investigations in the future. This will include: • Baselining of what constitutes a sensitive investigation • Articulation of the human resources, skills, training, technology and facilities required • Reformation of governance and business processes (including alternative mechanisms for referring entities beyond the AFP) • Organisational structures. Over in the House, Greens MP Adam Bandt plans on introducing a private members’ bill to have the voting age lowered to 16. A parliamentary inquiry looked into this last year, and said no. But Bandt says Gen Z have proved their worth: Most of the world’s young people, including Australian teenagers are denied the right to vote and determine their country’s and therefore the world’s future. That is why they have taken to the streets. The Greens believe this reality of the climate crisis is one of the most profound reasons why our longstanding policy of enfranchising young people should finally once and for all be implemented. And that is why today I am proud to introduce to the House this bill to give 16 and 17-year-olds the right to vote. Senate estimates for the environment portfolio is under way. The first questions for the session are from Labor, who have gone straight to questions about Angus Taylor and the grasslands saga. But the right people from the department aren’t in the room to answer questions, according to the department’s deputy secretary, Dean Knudson. There’s talk of calling them up early, including Geoff Richardson, who was one of the senior officials at a meeting with Taylor, the then minister Josh Frydenberg’s office, and the department on 20 March 2017. More likely we will hear more about this when the department’s biodiversity and compliance divisions are up later today. From Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, where the Department of the Senate is first up. Senate president Scott Ryan is being grilled by Labor senator Jenny McAllister about the government’s failure to comply with a Senate order regarding meetings with lobbyists and advocacy groups. McAllister says the government has claimed that it complies with ministerial standards and therefore is not providing further information. McAllister says this does not appear to be a public interest immunity reason for not complying with the request and says the response is “contemptuous”. Ryan says he has not followed up the possibility of noncompliance and would only do so if the Senate moved a motion calling on him to do so. AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw takes on notice a question about whether or not there was a third day of raids planned, and then takes on notice a question on, if there was, when it was scrapped, and why. Kristina Keneally is asking Reece Kershaw if he has seen the front page of any newspaper today. He has not. Because “the bit of software I had said there was no front page today”, he said, when asked the first time. Asked for the similarities, Kershaw says they seem to all have “big black marks through them”. But as an “evidence-based police officer”, Kershaw says “I haven’t turned my mind” to why the media campaign may be going on. Keneally says the AFP raids on journalists probably have something to do with it, but Kershaw says he would like to speak to the editors of the papers to see if that is what they think, before commenting. The senator then asks why Kershaw mentioned press freedom in his opening statement, if it’s not something he had turned his mind to as yet. He says he is aware it has been an issue. The new AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, is facing his first estimates hearing since taking on the role, following Andrew Colvin’s retirement. He is announcing a review “into sensitive investigations/disclosures” to be conducted by John Lawler – but it is not going to be looking at the current investigations (that’s the press freedom stuff). Home affairs estimates has begun – we were expecting Michaelia Cash to be in with the AFP, but Marise Payne has been sent in her place. Honestly, why this is allowed to continue is absolutely flabbergasting. There is a reason spouse and family interests are declared. That reason is obvious. Estimates are about to get under way. Christopher Pyne is speaking to Laura Jayes on Sky – she asks about finding your place in politics, which is very timely, given the number of people who are jostling for front-row positions at the moment. Pyne said he worked out very early on he would never be a “star like Malcolm Turnbull” so found a place he was comfortable with. Which was, presumably, “the fixer”. Scott Morrison also says no to Anthony Albanese and Joel Fitzgibbon’s drought war cabinet idea (which is a dramatic way of saying a cross-party committee, with ministers and shadow ministers, dealing with an issue) Well, I’ve noticed that point. If we as a government continue to consult widely and listen, most importantly, to people in rural and regional Australia. But I do note that even at a time, even when Australia actually was at war, there was no such war cabinet as described by the leader of the opposition. So they can explain the context of the nature of their proposal, but we were elected to get on with the job, and that’s exactly what we’re doing. I think those sorts of proposals are novel, but they sort of, don’t bear out against Australia’s government experience. If you’re not having a war cabinet involving non-government members in an actual time of war, and I point out that at the time of world war two breaking out, Sir Robert Menzies then, in the UAP who had sought to form coalitions both with the Labor party and the Country party at the time at a time of war, and that didn’t come to effect and ultimately a Labor government was formed at that time under John Curtin. So they can make those proposals, but our government is filled, both in cabinet and on our benches, of Australians who have a direct experience and live in drought-affected communities, right across New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia, and indeed from other states where drought has affected them in the past. And so we have the right people and our ears are wide open and the commitments we’ve made on the drought continue. It is a rolling response. Late yesterday, Scott Morrison spoke about that meeting Murph just wrote about. Here is what he had to say: I think what we saw today is that there is much analysis about the relationships that countries have with China and I think there is indeed a lot of over-analysis of those relationships and whether it’s the United States and China, or anyone else. And I simply made the point, which was well received, that Australia is an independent sovereign nation. Yes, we are very much proud of our western liberal democratic tradition, our open economy and our engagement with the rest of the world, and that gives us a set of eyes that look into the world very much from our perspective. And I respect the fact that whether it’s China, or indeed Indonesia or any other country in this part of the world, they will have their unique perspective and that’s all fine. There’s no issues with that. But what we also stressed today was, is that we will never feel corralled into any sort of binary assessment of these relationships. Binary assessments of a relationship which says pro-United States or pro-China, as Australia has a comprehensive strategic partnership with China and we have an enduring, and incredibly important alliance with the United States which is fundamental to our security. We have our biggest investment partnership with the United States and our biggest trade partnership with China and these are not mutually exclusive. And the comments that I’ve made, particularly more recently which have been quite stoically in support of this independent, anti-binary view, I think are very well received. I took the opportunity to congratulate China on where they were able to get to with the United States on the first phase of their trade discussions. I think that’s very good for the global economy and I think it bears out the optimism that we’ve always had about rejecting this binary nature. It’s simply a fact that China has arrived at an incredibly impressive point in its economic history. It’s impossible to dispute that. And that means that they’ve done incredibly well and raises their level of technological achievement and capability. Similarly, more broadly in their economy but also say, militarily, and that’s a reflection of the significant progress they’ve made over that time. And so, you know, one can only acknowledge that and then pursue our partnership based on our interests, which are aligned with China to the extent that we have both done so incredibly well out of their success. And so that was the dominating part of our discussion today. It’s interesting that the prime minister used a visit to observe the Indonesian president Joko Widodo’s inauguration to have a meeting with the Chinese vice-president, Wang Qishan. I’ve written a lot over the past month or two about Scott Morrison’s efforts to align Australia and the US but less about the effort over the same time period to warm up the relationship with Beijing. Over the past couple of months, the foreign minister, Marise Payne, has met her Chinese counterpart twice (most recently in New York during UN leaders week), and now this meeting in Jakarta. Australia sought the meeting and it was approved by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Anthony Albanese was also asked about press freedoms yesterday –and why Labor is now pushing for change Well, the urgency is that what we didn’t see under Labor governments was consecutive raids on journalists. What we didn’t see was the sort of attacks on media freedom and what we also wouldn’t have seen, to be frank, is a prime minister, who when first asked about this in London, basically said: ‘Nothing to see here.’ It is a dismissal as a government that wasn’t prepared to protect media freedom. The government needs to step up to the plate here. Labor’s prepared to. The government should as well. Scott Morrison was asked about press freedoms yesterday, while in Indonesia: Well, we are, and we have a process currently going on the way at the moment in a joint parliamentary inquiry. We’ve already acted to issue the minister for home affairs’ guidelines and direction which I think both well codify what the processes are, and in fact improve them, and I think that’s been well received, particularly by groups like the AFP which are finding those instructions very, very helpful. So I do think that’s an improvement, but we’ll still await the report from the inquiry. But let me simply say this – my government will always believe in freedom of the press. It’s an important part of our freedoms as a liberal democracy. Also believe in the rule of law and that no one is above it, including me or anyone else, any journalist or anyone else. And the rule of law has to be applied evenly and fairly in the protection of our broader freedoms. And so I don’t think anyone is, I hope, looking for a leave pass on any of those things, I wouldn’t and nor should anyone else. Barnaby Joyce had a few things to say about the media freedom laws – it went as you would expect. Welcome to day one of Senate estimates! The House will sit while the senators do their thing in the committee rooms. It’ll be the first time we’ve seen Penny Wong really unleashed since the election, so that in itself should be something. Kristina Keneally also gets some time with the home affairs officials, so that’s another one to watch. Scott Morrison arrived back in Australia (he was in Indonesia yesterday for Joko Widodo’s inauguration as president) to an unchanged Newspoll (yes, insert all the polling caveats here), 51 to 49, in the Coalition’s favour. The “big stick” energy laws will be debated (Labor has given its support, despite originally opposing them) and religious discrimination will be back on the agenda. The medevac inquiry bill was tabled on Friday – it went, as you would expect, down party lines, with negotiations with Jacqui Lambie ongoing. The Senate can’t vote on those until it next sits in November, and that is where the legislation’s fate hangs. Lambie is the swing vote – and she will spend the next few weeks continuing to meet with everyone who has something to say on this legislation before casting her vote. And all of the Canberra going ons are happening as media companies unite against the secrecy laws which make it increasingly difficult to do our jobs. As Guardian Australia’s editor, Lenore Taylor, has laid out: We have six core demands: The right to challenge the government’s application for warrants against journalists and media organisations, before they are issued. Exemptions for journalists from laws that would put them in jail for doing their jobs, including the security laws enacted over the last seven years. Adequate legislated protections for public sector whistleblowers. A new regime to limit which documents can be stamped secret. Reform of the freedom of information regime. Reform to laws that make Australia the defamation capital of the world. We’ll have all of that, as well as everything else. Mike Bowers will be with you, as will Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. I will find another coffee and find some more brain cells to be with you in just a moment. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "bodyText": "As a teenager in the 1970s, I ranged on Saturday afternoons across the ravaged industrial-revolution landscapes of the West Midlands, arguing politics, progressive rock and religion with a gang of similarly precocious, shandy-fuelled ranters, on a succession of free public transport options. We deserved to be beaten soundly by strangers. And often were. But we saw ourselves in the grand tradition of Birmingham’s intellectual sects – the Lunar Society of Handsworth, the Birmingham Surrealists of the Kardomah Café and, from Shard End, both the Electric Light Orchestra and the radical splinter group ELO Part II (featuring Bev Bevan and Kelly Groucutt), formed as as result of philosophical differences. One Saturday afternoon, when we were 16 or so, we descended drunkenly from the lush green archipelago of the Lickey Hills to the grounds of Oratory House, to smoke upon the shared grave of the 19th-century theologian Cardinal John Henry Newman and his friend Ambrose St John. Newman had asked to be buried with Ambrose, presumably in light of the scarcity of serviceable holes in overcrowded Victorian Birmingham. Our A-streamer friend Plimpton, a tortured, repressed homosexual Christian with a Cambridge classics scholarship looming, said the Latin headstone read: “Out of shadows and phantasms into the truth.” We made it our motto and gave our adolescent philosophy group a name, in honour of Newman’s friend. We were the New Ambrosians, and the world was ours for the taking. On the way home, some Zulu Warriors, local football hooligans, clubbed me to the concrete with a rolled newspaper near Paradise Circus for “looking gay” and spat on me. They knew not what they did. Such were the sufferings and degradations of a New Ambrosian, but they would not break me. Sadly, the New Ambrosians were soon to divide into the Original New Ambrosians and radical splinter group the New New Ambrosians (featuring Plimpton and Speccy Hawkins), as a result of philosophical differences. I lost touch with Plimpton, who struggled to reconcile his faith with his sexuality throughout his life. He was last seen, some time at the turn of the century, by none other than Speccy Hawkins. Hawkins’s contact lenses had clocked his fellow New New Ambrosian, sat alone in soiled trousers at Newman’s headstone, as he cruised past the graveyard on Leach Green Lane in his grey Ford Focus. On Tuesday night, along with many other self-congratulatory Observer readers, I saw the young rap singer Kate Tempest looking and sounding like the prophet this absurd age deserves, an Abiezer Coppe for the Deliveroo generation. If we were young today my fellow Original New Ambrosians would have loved her as I did. I went home, anxieties amplified, values confirmed, an evening well spent. Meanwhile, beyond the Hammersmith Apollo, police job definitions deformed to encompass arresting environmentalists who will, within years, be hailed unequivocally as heroes by a drowning, burning, starving humanity. Struggling with implications beyond his paygrade, a police spokesman on LBC on Tuesday complained that driving vans of officers from Scotland to capture protesters was actually increasing emissions. It was clear that the environmental impact caused by crushing the demonstrations was weighing heavily upon his conscience, a sure sign that Extinction Rebellion’s message was getting through. But in the midst of all this misery, some good news. One of the Catholic church’s marketing strengths is that it has a patron saint for everything. St Adrian of Nicomedia is the patron saint of arms dealers and butchers; St Jesús-Malverde is the patron saint of drug-traffickers and bandits; St Maturinus is the patron saint of comic actors and plumbers generally, and of sailors, but only if they hail from Brittany. (I can’t help thinking the Panini company are missing a major collectible sticker-set market here.) So weep no more, disappointed liberals in the Age of Hate. Last Sunday the pope himself, who often seems to be operating to an agenda designed to amuse him personally in private at a later date, made a saint of a man who was probably gay, and hailed from Birmingham, where homophobic hate crime is up 333% in the wake of School Gate-gate’s religious aggravations; a man who, says Father Ignatius Harrison, the provost of Birmingham Oratory, “would have been a Remainer”. In the shape of Cardinal John Henry Newman, we now have a patron saint for Remainers, homosexuals and people from Birmingham. All three of these are traduced and demonised groups whom Christ would obviously have held close to his heart, as he did prostitutes, lepers and people who worked for the Inland Revenue. There were some teething troubles in Newman’s canonisation. The church had tried to separate Newman’s remains from his friend Ambrose’s in 2008 but found none left. The Oratory website explains: “There are no First Class relics of Saint John Henry Newman available for distribution.” Presumably that’s what happens if you bury a saint in a damp city, and it explains the Brummie saying, “It’s so black over Bill’s mother’s we’ll have no First Class relics available for distribution.” Late on Wednesday night I found myself wondering what my old friends the Original New Ambrosians would think of Newman’s sainthood. I even found myself remembering fondly the traitorous New New Ambrosians (featuring Plimpton and Speccy Hawkins), whose dissenting views on the relative merits of the second Hatfield and the North album no longer seemed important. Then the phone rang. “Out of shadows and phantasms into the truth,” said a shaking voice, and the line went dead. It was Plimpton, 40 years since I last heard him. I tried unsuccessfully to call the number back. On Thursday morning, an anonymous package arrived, a lone femur swaddled in bubble wrap. Plimpton, it appeared, had made his peace with his god in his own particular way. I expected no less from a New Ambrosian.

          "headline": "Have you heard of the catastrophic men theory of history? Step forward Boris Johnson...",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson concludes his Churchill biography with splutters against historians who insist the “story of humanity is not the story of great men and shining deeds”. The story of Winston Churchill, he cries, “is a pretty withering retort to all that malarkey. He and he alone made the difference.” The story of Boris Johnson withers too. He is shrivelling Britain: making it cramped, poor and irrelevant. Modern historians may sniff at the 19th-century notion that “the history of what man has accomplished in this world, is at bottom the History of the Great Men” to use Thomas Carlyle’s words. The rest of us should not be so complacent and register the capacity of catastrophic men and women to change the world for the worse. In his classic study On the Psychology of Military Incompetence, Norman Dixon analysed British generals who had led their men to pointless deaths from Crimea to Arnhem. How familiar his diagnosis feels. Dixon identified “overweening ambition dedicated to one goal – self-advancement” as a persistent fault; and that sounds familiar. Catastrophic men equated “war with sport”, he continued, and one thinks of Theresa May’s warning in 2016 that “politics isn’t a game.” She surely had Johnson in mind. For him, it is a game and winning is all. Last year, he told the Democratic Unionist party that a border in the Irish Sea “would be damaging to the fabric of the union”. He jutted out what passes for his jaw and with a Churchillian boom thundered: “I have to tell you that no British Conservative government could or should sign up to any such arrangement.” Last week, he signed up to “such an arrangement” because betraying his allies wins him the game of politics. Dixon noticed “an underestimation, sometimes bordering on the arrogant, of the enemy”. And one thinks of Dominic Cummings, so lost in his deluded machismo that he told EU countries that they “will go to the bottom of the queue” if they dared challenge the mighty Britain. A mere fortnight later, Johnson capitulated to Brussels so thoroughly the EU will no longer has to worry about the Irish border and can adopt the toughest of stances when and if trade negotiations begin. No one should be surprised. It is an essential part of the catastrophic character that catastrophists do not learn from their mistakes or realise they are making them. On the small matters as well as the large, political incompetents mirror military incompetents. Generals who display “a love of bull, smartness, precision and strict preservation of the military pecking order” are prone to lead regiments to disaster, Dixon wrote. Remember Jacob Rees-Mogg’s semi-literate instruction to his civil servants that they must address untitled men as “esq” when the practice is archaic. Or his insistence that they never use “hopefully” in his presence: even though the adverb has stood in for “I hope” for centuries and no serious linguist has the smallest problem with it. Hopefully, you can see the links between disastrous generals and politicians. Catastrophic business leaders share their characteristics. Since the crash, there has been an explosion of interest in how unstable men and women are overrepresented at the top of business. The Australian Psychological Society’s congress heard a study of 261 senior professionals in the US, which found 21% had clinically significant levels of psychopathic traits compared to one in 100 in the general population. Once again, Johnsonian flippancy was in evidence. Psycho bosses treated business as “a game about getting where they want and having dominance over others”. Meanwhile, economists have demonstrated how overconfident managers fail to account for risks. You might object that a democratic politician is different from Fred Goodwin at RBS or Adam Neumann at WeWork or a general who will not tolerate insubordination. They work in hierarchies, where it can be impossible for subordinates to criticise without risking their careers. By contrast, hundreds of thousands were on the streets of Britain yesterday making every criticism of Johnson imaginable – all of them correct. For all that, Johnson remains in a bubble that feeds narcissistic delusions. The Tory press fawns over him because he is one of its own. His party toes the line because Johnson removes the whip from Tory MPs who challenge him and Cummings orders armed police officers to take away allegedly disloyal aides on the flimsiest of excuses. Johnson’s career of failing upwards since he left Eton illustrates that overconfidence is class determined. In politics and so many other British institutions, you see mediocrities take jobs for which they are not remotely qualified, because wealthy families and a private education have emboldened them. In all spheres, catastrophic men and women are united by an imperviousness to the suffering they cause. Even on the most optimistic assumptions, UK in a Changing Europe found Johnson’s “deal” will take £16bn from already dangerously underfunded public services and all who depend on them. (The pessimists believe £49bn will go.) The PM’s lack of concern for them is typical. Dixon described the siege of Kut in 1915 in what is now Iraq: an operation that led to 30,000 British and Indian army casualties. It distinguished itself, even in the First World War, for having no military purpose whatsoever. When Maj Gen Charles Townshend surrendered, he was treated with the utmost courtesy by his Turkish opponents. They sent his 13,000 surviving men on a death march across the steppes that claimed 7,000 lives. Townshend’s concern “for the welfare of his dog was considerably more in evidence than for the welfare of his troops”. Catastrophic men can determine the fate of armies, businesses and countries. Without fail, the catastrophes they bring are always someone else’s problem. I will grant Johnson this. There is every chance that history will say: “He and he alone made the difference.” • Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist"

          "headline": "What happens if your mind lives for ever on the internet?",
          "bodyText": "Imagine that a person’s brain could be scanned in great detail and recreated in a computer simulation. The person’s mind and memories, emotions and personality would be duplicated. In effect, a new and equally valid version of that person would now exist, in a potentially immortal, digital form. This futuristic possibility is called mind uploading. The science of the brain and of consciousness increasingly suggests that mind uploading is possible – there are no laws of physics to prevent it. The technology is likely to be far in our future; it may be centuries before the details are fully worked out – and yet given how much interest and effort is already directed towards that goal, mind uploading seems inevitable. Of course we can’t be certain how it might affect our culture but as the technology of simulation and artificial neural networks shapes up, we can guess what that mind uploading future might be like. Suppose one day you go into an uploading clinic to have your brain scanned. Let’s be generous and pretend the technology works perfectly. It’s been tested and debugged. It captures all your synapses in sufficient detail to recreate your unique mind. It gives that mind a standard-issue, virtual body that’s reasonably comfortable, with your face and voice attached, in a virtual environment like a high-quality video game. Let’s pretend all of this has come true. Who is that second you? The first you, let’s call it the biological you, has paid a fortune for the procedure. And yet you walk out of the clinic just as mortal as when you walked in. You’re still a biological being, and eventually you’ll die. As you drive home, you think: “Well, that was a waste of money.” At the same time, the simulated you wakes up in a virtual apartment and feels like the same old you. It has a continuity of experience. It remembers walking into the clinic, swiping a credit card, signing a waiver, lying on the table. It feels as though it was anaesthetised and then woke up again somewhere else. It has your memories, your personality, your thought patterns and emotional quirks. It sits up in a new bed and says: “I can’t believe it worked! Definitely worth the cost.” I won’t call it an “it” any more, because that mind is a version of you. We’ll call it the simulated you. This “sim” you decides to explore. You step out of your apartment into the sunlight of a perfect day and find a virtual version of New York City. Sounds, smells, sights, people, the feel of the sidewalk underfoot, everything is present – with less garbage though, and the rats are entirely sanitary and put in for local colour. You chat up strangers in a way you would never do in the real New York, where you’d be worried that an impatient pedestrian might punch you in the teeth. Here, you can’t be injured because your virtual body can’t break. You stop at a cafe and sip a latte. It doesn’t taste right. It doesn’t feel like anything is going into your stomach. And nothing is, because it isn’t real food and you don’t have a stomach. It’s all a simulation. The visual detail on the table is imperfect. There’s no grittiness to the rust. Your fingers don’t have fingerprints – they’re smooth, to save memory on fine detail. Breathing doesn’t feel the same. If you hold your breath, you don’t get dizzy, because there is no such thing as oxygen in this virtual world. You find yourself equipped with a complementary simulated smartphone, and you call the number that used to be yours – the phone you had with you, just a few hours ago in your experience, when you walked into the clinic. Now the biological you answers the phone. “Yo,” says the sim you. “It’s me. I mean, it’s you. What’s up?” “I’m depressed, that’s what. I’m in my apartment eating ice-cream. I can’t believe I spent all that money for zilch.” “Zilch?! You would not believe what it’s like in here! It’s a fantastic place. Remember Kevin, the guy who died of cancer last week? He’s here too! He’s fine, and he still has the same job. He Skypes with his old yoga studio three times a week, to teach his fitness class. But his girlfriend in the real world has left him for someone who’s not dead yet. Still, lots of new people to date here.” I have to resist getting carried away by the humour of the situation. Underneath the details lies a very real philosophical conundrum that people will eventually have to confront. What is the relationship between bio you and sim you? I prefer a geometric way of thinking about the situation. Imagine that your life is like the rising stalk of the letter Y. You’re born at the base, and as you grow up, your mind is shaped and changed along a trajectory. Then you let yourself be scanned, and from that moment on, the Y has branched. There are now two trajectories, each one equally and legitimately you. Let’s say the left-hand branch is the simulated you and the right-hand branch is the biological you. The part of you that lives indefinitely is represented by both the stem of the Y and the left-hand branch. Just as your childhood self lives on in your adult self, the stem of the Y lives on in the simulated self. Once the scan is over, the two branches of the Y proceed along different life paths, accumulating different experiences. The right-hand branch will die. Everything that happens to it after the branching point fails to achieve immortality – unless it chooses to scan itself again, in which case another branch appears, and the geometry becomes even more complicated. What emerges is not a single you, but a topologically intricate version, a hyper you with two or more branches. One of those branches is always going to be mortal, and the others have an indefinite lifespan depending on how long the computer platform is maintained. You might think that since the bio you lives in the real world, and the sim you lives in a virtual world, the two will never meet and therefore should never encounter any complications from coexisting. But these days, who needs to meet in person? We interact mainly through electronic media anyway. The sim you and the bio you represent two fully functional, interactive, capable instances of you, competing within the same larger, interconnected, social and economic universe. You could easily find yourselves meeting over video conference. At the simplest level, mind uploading would preserve people in an indefinite afterlife. Families could have Christmas dinner with sim Grandma joining in on video conference, the tablet screen propped up at the end of the table – presuming she has time for her bio family any more, given the rich possibilities in the simulated playground. It’s this kind of idealised afterlife that people have in mind, when they think about the benefits of mind uploading. It’s a human-made heaven. But unlike a traditional heaven, it isn’t a separate world. It’s seamlessly connected to the real world. Think of how you interact with the world right now. If you live the typical western lifestyle, then the smallest part of your life involves interacting with people in the physical space around you. Your connection to the larger world is almost entirely through digital means. The news comes to you on a screen or through earbuds. Distant locations are real to you mainly because you learn about them through electronic media. Politicians, celebrities, even some friends and family may exist to you mainly through data. People work in virtual offices where they know their colleagues only through video and text. Each of us might as well already be in a virtual world, with a steady flow of information passing in and out through CNN, Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and text. We live in a kind of multiverse, each of us in a different virtual bubble, the bubbles occasionally merging in real space and then separating, but always connected through the global social network. If a virtual afterlife is created, the people in it, with the same personalities and needs that they had in real life, would have no reason to isolate themselves from the rest of us. Very little needs to change for them. Socially, politically, economically, the virtual and the real worlds would connect into one larger and always expanding civilisation. The virtual world might as well be simply another city on Earth, filled with people who have migrated to it. We’ve always lived in a world where culture turns over with each generation. But what happens when the older generations never die, but remain just as active in society? There’s no reason to think that the living will have any political, economic, or intellectual advantage over the simulated. Think of the jobs people have in our world. Many of them require physical action, and those are the jobs that will probably be replaced by automatons. Taxi driver? Publicly shared, self-driving cars are almost here. Street cleaners? Checkout operators? Construction workers? Pilots? All of these jobs are probably for the chopping block in the medium to long term. Robotics and artificial intelligence will take them over. The rest of our jobs, our contributions to the larger world, are done through the mind, and if the mind can be uploaded, it can keep doing the same job. A politician can work from cyberspace just as well as from real space. So can a teacher, or a manager, or a therapist, or a journalist, or the guy in the complaints department. The CEO of a company, a Steve Jobs type who has shaped up a sweet set of neural connections in his brain that makes him exceptional at his work, can manage from a remote, simulated office. If he must shake hands, he can take temporary possession of a humanoid robot, a kind of shared rent-a-bot, and spend a few hours in the real world, meeting and greeting. Even calling it the “real” world sounds prejudicial to me. Both worlds would be equally real. Maybe the better term is the “foundation” world and the “cloud” world. The foundation world would be full of people who are mere youngsters – mainly under the age of 80 – who are still accumulating valuable experience. Their unspoken responsibility would be to gain wisdom and experience before joining the ranks of the cloud world. The balance of power and culture would shift rapidly to the cloud. How could it not? That’s where the knowledge, experience and political connections will accumulate. In that scenario, the foundation world becomes a kind of larval stage for immature minds, and the cloud world is where life really begins. Mind uploading could transform our culture and civilisation more profoundly than anything in our past.

          "bodyText": "Let’s be clear: a shallot is not an onion. You could be forgiven for thinking they are the same, and substituting them for onions in a recipe. Very few recipe writers will specify shallots for this reason, myself included sometimes. It’s so much more convenient just to say “onion”. Editors will say to me: “No one will know the difference, so why fuss?” But you should fuss, because shallots have a completely different flavour profile. Shallots are yin to the onion’s yang. I grew up thinking shallots and onions were the same, too. In Thai, shallots were referred to as hohm. I should have realised something was up, as the literal translation is “fragrant”. No one in their right mind would sniff a raw onion and call it fragrant. If you sniff a shallot, however, I could understand that. It’s still going to make your eyes water, but it is not as pungent. Shallots are more delicate and aromatically perfumed, much sweeter to eat raw. Randy Moon, one of the “Four Horsemen” behind my favourite wine bar in NYC (with a killer menu, too) says onions are a crucial base note to dishes that require a long cooking time. Some of the world’s greatest dishes have onions as a starting point. Meanwhile, shallots are the top note. “Everything in its place and a place for everything,” is what mise en place means, and that’s the motto for all self-respecting cooks and chefs. There’s a place for shallots, and a place for onions. Use shallots raw in a salad and they will sing harmoniously with your other veg; use onions when making a stew. Shallots when you require finesse, onions when you need weight. Shallots are in the allium family (Allium cepa, if we’re being pedantic) and look very much like onions. But, surprisingly, they’re more closely related to garlic than onions. Shallots grow like garlic, with clusters of offsets genetically identical to their mother bulb, whereas onions are a loner bulb, and easier to grow from seed. Shallots come in a few different forms. Most common in Australia are the French red eschallot. Long and tapered, they’re daintily pretty. Cuter still are the petite Asian shallots. They are clumpier and fiddlier to peel, but the extra sweat is worth it. Their colour varies from yellow to pinky grey to an eye-catching deep crimson. In the last decade, they’ve become easier to find in Australia. The first time I came across them, my eyes bulged. It was at a Vietnamese-owned farm in Darwin, where massive piles were being cured. I bought as many as I could fit in my suitcase to take back to my kitchen in Sydney, where I gleefully used them in place of everything calling for an onion in Asian recipes. Onions aren’t common in south and south-east Asian culinary traditions. When chefs and cooks come to Australia, where onions are plentiful, they sigh in relief. Peeling a box of onions is a walk in the park compared with peeling a box of itty bitty shallots. That’s why in restaurants, Asian ones included, you will nary see a shallot, even if it is traditionally called for. But don’t be put off from using them at home. The rewards are many. Upon cooking, shallots excrete a lot less moisture than onions, which makes them a better choice to fry until crisp. You can buy them ready-fried in Asian grocers, but why not make it a Sunday afternoon meditative experience? The benefits of that session will be a hundredfold. Store-bought fried shallots are often rancid, and fried using dubious sources of palm oil. Making it yourself, you can use a much better quality oil. My current obsession is macadamia oil, which has a fantastically high heating point and great health benefits too. Macadamia oil is rich in oleic acid and monounsaturated fatty acids, and it’s high in omegas three and six. When combined with the high levels of polyphenols and flavonoids (anti-oxidants) from the shallot, it’s practically a superfood flavour bomb. Fried shallots are incredibly versatile. You can use them as a garnishing flourish on anything you like to finish a dish. Pasta, noodles, rice, soups, vegetables, meat … even dessert. Seriously. That’s what Thais do. It’s not weird … not at all. I used fried shallot recently in the dessert course of a dinner I cooked in New York, a royal cuisine dish called som chun: iced fresh fruit, perfumed with a floral aromatic syrup, bergamot, fresh ginger, sliced macadamias and finished with crisp fried shallots. Try it this summer. It teeters on the balance between fresh sweetness from seasonal fruit and savoury flavour from the shallots. Just don’t try it with onions. It wouldn’t be the same. Fried Shallots 6 shallots 500ml macadamia oil Grey salt to season Get into the zone, with nowhere to be but peeling and finely slicing the shallots. You don’t need to halve them before you slice, as once they fry up they will shrink. On the highest element, heat the oil in wok or frying pan for about five minutes. Gently nudge the shallots into the oil and watch it bubble away. Turn down the heat to low-medium. Resist the urge to push it around for approximately five minutes. Then get at it using a wooden paddle or spatula and stir the shallots around the pan constantly. Stand by the stove, focus on your breathing and inhale the smell of allium delight. If you don’t want your entire house to smell like shallots, I highly advise you to turn on the hood to the highest extraction and open your windows. Once the shallots start to turn a golden brown, take them off the heat and drain into a steel mesh colander, lined with a few paper towels. Have a stainless steel bowl underneath the colander to catch all the oil. Cool the shallots down, then toss a teaspoon of salt into them. Stored in an airtight container, you can keep them refrigerated for up to six months. Keep the oil separately in another jar and use it for salad dressings or as a finishing oil for absolutely anything and everything. These will become your favourite pantry staples. They are for me."

          "bodyText": "As the news of the success of the Letwin amendment filtered out to the hundreds of thousands who had once again marched to Parliament Square to demand a People’s Vote on the Brexit deal, there was the most reassuringly British of reactions: widespread applause in the rain. Throaty cheers and whistles gave way to nuanced conversations from under umbrellas and the hoods of cagoules as to what might happen next. Could the prime minister really defy the law on an extension to force his pig-in-lipstick deal through? There had been plenty of good reasons not to travel from the country’s four corners to march in the capital: the rugby, the money, the ennui. And above all there had been the danger that the timing might make it all futile anyhow. That – by the time marchers reached Parliament Square– the demand for a confirmatory referendum would have finally been thwarted, and the latest million man-woman-and-child march would turn into a wake or a vigil. But the marchers turned up anyway, and they were, under darkening skies, rewarded with yet another possible hint of light. The prime minister had attempted to choreograph his “Super Saturday” session of parliament in the tradition of previous crisis-sittings, those that had assembled for debate about war in 1939 and conflict in Suez in 1956 and the Falklands in 1982. This time, in Johnson’s telling, the battle lines were drawn between parliament and the people. By “people” Johnson meant that section of the population identified by Nigel Farage on the morning after the referendum vote when, in announcing his poundshop “independence day”, he had talked of Brexit as a victory for “real people, a victory for ordinary people, a victory for decent people.” Among the most dangerous themes of that politics of division has been to tell some parts of the population that they are more grounded here in blood and in soil than others. The hundreds of thousands of very real people determined to march once more in London told a very different, more inclusive, island story. One that cuts across borders of politics and circumstance and region. And if ministers had wanted to see the will of those people in full force, they could have looked out of the windows of the Palace of Westminster. They would have seen people like Dave Blackburn, 62, a support worker for autistic adults, who had come down with a small group overnight on the bus from Glasgow. “It was getting down to the wire and I still thought there was a chance of a second vote,” Blackburn told me before the march set off. “My friends are mostly for Scottish independence, and whatever happens I think that battle will now be won. But I think this, leaving the EU, will anyway be a disaster for working people.” His fellow sleepless traveller Sheila Connolly, who works with young homeless people, laughed at how their bus down had been advertised with reclining seats “but that only seemed to apply to seats in front of you”. She had to be here because she would be devastated if Johnson’s deal passed. “I don’t care what they say, this is another way for them to come for working people,” she said. Or the politicians might have seen Emmanuelle Brook, a teaching assistant in her 40s with two children, among 500 people up from Cornwall. Brook, born in France, has lived in the UK for 24 years. “We came here on a set of rules we thought would last, and now I have been made a foreigner again,” she said. “I get asked where I am from all the time.” She had been scared about today, had the deal been ratified. “Not just the economics but the human impact of Brexit. I may be safe here, but I no longer feel it.” Strangely, as the debates unfolded and the march once again inched toward its destination, there appeared to be no mention of the presence of its massed ranks at the government dispatch box. Not for the first time in recent years it was as if the world inside the chamber bore no relation to that outside its doors, a Westminster bubble indeed. Among the marchers there was, oddly, a similar lack of curiosity about the progress of the debates happening up the road, a sense that everything that could have been said on the subject had long since been said, and that it was now a stubborn numbers game of ayes and noes. The turnout of marchers, coaches and buses from all over, and their mostly irrepressible good humour, once again provided an alternative set of figures to contemplate. Despite the heckling of Andrea Leadsom and Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was with his young son, as they left the Commons, this may well be the most good-natured and well-mannered of protest movements the country has ever mustered, but no one should doubt its determination. The thousands on the streets in this most British of rebellions was testament to the persistence of that constituency who still believe that “just get it done” is not a basis on which to run a parliamentary democracy. And, like Oliver Letwin, that four hours is not long enough to scrutinise the most significant piece of legislation in a generation. Talk to almost any one of that number and you would be hard-pressed to make a case against the idea that, at heart, Brexit has become an assault on the salt of the earth. Judith Spencer, who spent her career as a psychologist on the civil servants’ appointment board, is 79; she is walking with the “In Limbo” group of EU citizens and UK citizens in Europe, the five million who still live with willed uncertainty. “I was born here half-Japanese in 1940,” Spencer tells me. “And I encountered discrimination from the word go. To see mature professional Europeans who have made their lives here suffering discrimination in this country now really horrified me. Hearing that their kids are being terrorised in the playgrounds. I can feel the country moving backwards.” By now, among seasoned marchers, there are few new placards under the sun, but there seemed more saltires and Welsh dragons and county flags alongside EU flags and Union Jacks this time, as people asserted what should never have been in doubt: that all citizens enjoy layers of identity. In among these banners, there was the usual smattering of blunt regional aphorism. A party from Aberdeen had gone with the straightforward “Boris is a Bawbag”. Those from Stratford had chosen a quote from The Tempest “bless our Europe”. Then there was “Bramm orth Brexit”, which translated, I was reliably informed, with apologies to Monty Python, as “I fart in Brexit’s general direction.” Cassie Histed, a warehouse worker from Warwick, is amused and heartened by the good cheer of the march, the fact that it represents all ages and classes. Most of the marches she has joined in the past have had an angrier edge. She has always identified herself, she tells me, as part of the Sea-Green society which traces its history of protest back to the Levellers of the English civil war. She is on the Europhile wing of that group. “Those who don’t want to be left adrift in the north Atlantic with Boris steering.” Those famed “ardent” Leave voters who favour that latter option might swallow the idea that these odd alliances of Remainers are a representation of some elite or other. They may snigger about the commitment of people who are angry at the railroading of our politics but who are not, by nature, angry people. They might, too, however, reflect on the fact that, in three-and-a-half years, the most notable collective showings of Brexit voters has been the 29 March “Brexit Day” gathering, dominated by the intelligentsia of the Football Lads’ Alliance and their arthritic desire for a ruck in the name of Engerlund. Martyn Cattermole, a retired management consultant, who was marching with his family, has discovered many things in the course of protests over the last year. One of them is that a hollowed-out Pringles tube makes a very effective loud hailer. He brought his two young sons along, he says, because “we are trying to teach them that democracy doesn’t just happen or exist – you have to keep trying to fight for it”. Those drifting away from Parliament Square, and gathering for coaches and trains, carried that idea home with them. The chances are they will be back again later in the year to demonstrate it once again."

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson isn’t good at deferred gratification. Sulk wants. Sulk must have. Jennifer Arcuri had driven him mad by insisting he stick to Google Hangouts when he’d been dying to move on to spreadsheets. But today of all days he had been certain nothing could spoil his triumph. He’d looked the EU in the eye and he had blinked first. It took some skill to go back to Brussels and negotiate an even worse withdrawal agreement than Theresa May, but somehow – against all the odds – he had defied the gloomsters and pulled it off. So this was to have been his Super Saturday. A day to go down in the history books, when parliament met for the first time on a weekend in 37 years and he, the World King, would be carried aloft along the Tory benches as the “Man who Delivered Brexit”. OK, it would almost certainly be a short-lived triumph once everyone realised that he’d promised polar opposites to different groups of MPs and the real arguments would only emerge once the UK had left the EU, but he could live with that. He wasn’t a man used to taking responsibility for the long-term consequences of his actions. Instead this turned out to be Not-So-Much Saturday. All thanks to Oliver Letwin, who had wanted to give the Commons more time to examine the legislation and to prevent the UK crashing out with a no-deal Brexit on 31 October if the ERG chose to play dirty. Typical boring Girly Swot. “Trust me, I’m Boris,” he had said and to his astonishment 322 other MPs had decided they didn’t. Though the real philosophical impossibility had been that 306 reckoned they could. Yet again, Brexit continues to make fools of fools. But the result was still the same. Boris denied. His exquisite petite mort had turned into a dispiriting grande mort. The Sulk did what the Sulk does. He sulked. OK, he’d almost certainly get his deal in the end, but he didn’t want to wait. He wanted to go back to Downing Street to play back clips of “His Finest Hour”. If not the country’s finest hour. But now he was going to be locked back into a Groundhog Day of having to explain why his shit deal wasn’t shit. It just wasn’t fair. “Pifflepafflewifflewaffle,” he mumbled sulkily. Kevin the Teenager had behaved more gracefully. He wasn’t going to say if he was going to write a letter to the EU asking for an extension. He might. There again he might not. But if he did, he’d do it later. Much later. At the very last minute. “DEEr DoNAld, I aM rRITing vis leTTa coz I HavE bin made 2, wiv NO luv. BoRIs.” Classic Boris. Classic Dom. Clearly the pair were made for each other. Combined they have an emotional age of nine and three-quarters. Proceedings had begun with the prime minister making a statement to the Commons. It was his deal and when he’d said there would be no border down the Irish Sea what he had meant was that there wouldn’t be any badgers in wetsuits conducting underwater checks. Instead the badgers would be surrounding Liverpool in night-vision goggles. Besides what better way was there of expressing our commitment to the European cause than by telling the EU to sod off? It wasn’t you, he had told Michel, it’s me. I’ve got commitment problems. Jeremy Corbyn’s reply had been typically drab. The words come out in the right order but his heart never appears to be in what he’s saying. All passion spent. It’s as if what he’s reading out is a total surprise to him. Maybe it is. The only other highlights of the session were John Baron insisting both that he had never been a member of the ERG and that he had stopped being a member of the ERG, while insisting that his excitement the previous day over the deregulation of workers’ rights had been a total aberration. Arise Baron Baron. Where would the country be without idiots like him? The debate proper also mostly lived down to expectations. No cabinet minister has worked harder to make himself more forgettably average than Steve Barclay and he appeared thrilled that every word he said lost its meaning long before it had escaped his lips. His most compelling argument for not publishing the impact assessments which showed the UK would be 6.9% worse off under the new deal was that Classic Dom had some stats which proved everyone would be 7.9% happier to be 6.9% poorer. Truly the country is screwed. Not for the first time, by far the best speech came from the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer. Mainly because he is about the only person in the Commons who really understands this stuff. And cares about it. He tore through the hypocrisies and deceits in the bill and laid bare the almost inevitability of crashing out with no deal in December 2020 as agreeing a new trade deal in little more than six months was nigh on impossible. Thereafter things fell apart. Theresa May proved you can never lose what you don’t have. She is the presence that feels like an absence. It also turned out that things she could never countenance as prime minister she is more than happy to suck up as a backbencher. She’s at her best when she says nothing at all. Fittingly, Chris Grayling provided the day’s nadir. Cheek wobbling uncontrollably – the nervous tic that’s the only giveaway for signs of intelligence that may lurk within – he begged Letwin to withdraw his amendment. Tories pleaded with Failing Grayling to sit down – every time he speaks he loses votes – but the damage was done. Letwin was home and dry. The day ended in chaos with Jacob Rees-Mogg having a strop of his own and refusing to tell anyone exactly what business the government had planned for the next week. It might try to have the same vote again on Monday, but there again it might not. There would be votes. Some of which would be Meaningful, others of which would be Deep and Meaningless. A parliament of donkeys, led by nematodes. And not very bright ones at that."

          "headline": "Led By Donkeys: ‘There is a political power in laughing at these people’",
          "bodyText": "The campaigning group Led By Donkeys is always on the lookout for what it calls “thermonuclear hypocrisy” in politics, and specifically on Brexit. So when, in August, its founders belatedly came across an article that Michael Gove had written for the Daily Mail in March 2019, they felt they had hit the jackpot. In it, Gove, who is now chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster – or more prosaically, the man charged with making Brexit happen, deal or no deal – had noted: “We didn’t vote to leave without a deal. That wasn’t the message of the campaign I helped lead.” “It was like, ‘Hang on a second: that should be the iceberg to the government’s no-deal Titanic,’” exclaims 45-year-old Ben Stewart, one of the four founders of Led By Donkeys. “The leader of the campaign, the person charged with no-deal planning has said there is no mandate for this. And now they are claiming a mandate for it. So I felt and we all felt: we need to make that quote famous.” Led By Donkeys, which came into existence only in January, had already had considerable success, and a lot of fun, reminding politicians of words they have said, written or tweeted, and probably wished they hadn’t. The project started with blowing up tweets – from the likes of David Cameron and Leave tub-thumpers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage – and slapping them on billboards in the dead of night. But the group quickly became more ambitious and its work has appeared everywhere from a 40m x 20m banner at the People’s Vote demonstration in London in March to projections on the cliffs of Dover. Their targets are overwhelmingly on the right of the political spectrum, though Jeremy Corbyn was mocked with a billboard that had his Twitter handle but was otherwise left blank, so that people could write on to it what they would like the Labour leader to say on the issue. Its work has been, to some camps, the Remain campaign that never was: impassioned, humorous, compelling. Through more than 50 poster designs, photographs of which have had more than 200m views on social media, Led By Donkeys has taken the fight to the flip-flopping Brexiters. They have also taken potshots at Donald Trump and what they consider the dangers of post-truth politics. When the US president visited the UK in June, they projected his approval ratings (and those of Barack Obama) on to the Tower of London, and a video in which Boris Johnson called Trump out for “quite stupefying ignorance” was superimposed on to Big Ben. In the US, these stunts were picked up by Stephen Colbert on The Late Show and Rachel Maddow on MSNBC. Just last week, Led By Donkeys launched posters satirising the government’s Get Ready for Brexit campaign, designed by members of the public, and, as this article went to press, were finalising plans for Saturday’s People’s Vote march. Back in the summer, as Boris Johnson pushed more insistently for a no-deal Brexit, Led By Donkeys decided its Michael Gove quote needed a special treatment, eventually settling on a sand sculpture of his words for Redcar beach in Teeside. Redcar was chosen because, for one thing, it has a massive beach, but also because analysis suggests that the north-east will be profoundly affected by leaving the EU without a deal, especially up the coast in Sunderland, home of Nissan, the UK’s biggest car plant. On 1 September, Gove’s face and his comment (“We didn’t vote to leave without a deal”) were carved into the sand in ginormous letters, covering around 7,500 square metres of the beach. Stewart smiles. “So it’s like: ‘Oh well, if Michael Gove thinks he can take us out without a deal he needs to own what he said on a sand sculpture visible from space.’ And he saw it, because Sarah Vine, his wife, replied to our tweet saying: ‘Wow, that’s really impressive!’ So that fucker saw it over the breakfast table and maybe he’ll think twice before repeating that bullshit.” It has been a wild, confounding and very busy few months for the Led By Donkeys team who, besides Stewart, are Oliver Knowles, 44, James Sadri and Will Rose, both 40. At the beginning of the year they were unknown; now they are one of the loudest voices in opposition to the government’s Brexit policy. Drone footage of the Redcar sand installation has been watched 1.1m times. The Led By Donkeys coverage of the pro-Brexit march in March – which took the form of regular updates to their 300,000 Twitter followers, long after the media pack had departed – was perhaps primarily responsible for revealing it as a lacklustre, poorly attended shambles. Yet, while the Led By Donkeys team are heroes to many who would like a second referendum, their work is not universally adored. The founders, anonymous initially, were “unmasked” in May by the rightwing Guido Fawkes website. All four had worked at Greenpeace at one point – two of them still do – leading them to be described as “lefty environmentalists”. For some, Led By Donkeys epitomises the “Remoaner” camp, preaching to other like-minded zealots (and hardly anyone else) mainly on social media. Certainly, it is not always clear how much damage their stinging attacks on Leave-promoting politicians are really inflicting. After skewering the March to Leave, and especially Farage’s half-hearted involvement, Led By Donkeys was dismayed to watch the Brexit Party perform buoyantly in the European elections in May, winning the highest share of the vote in nine of the 12 regions, and 32% overall. These criticisms, for the most part, miss the target, the Led By Donkeys founders think. They don’t believe they can single-handedly bring down the government; in fact, they started the project for “catharsis”: they could either laugh or cry – and they would rather laugh. And that’s still true today. “You just have to laugh with this massive shitshow going on,” says Stewart. “We have this unifying thing where we do laugh at Gove and Cummings and Fox and Johnson and I hope that comes out through the project. And there is a political power in laughing at these people.” That’s not to say, though, that there isn’t serious intent behind the project. “At the moment, we’re thinking, ‘Can we stop Brexit happening on 31 October?’” says Stewart. “Look, we alone are not going to do it, but what is our tiny, tiny role in that effort?” Blue or red, Leave or Remain, the rise of Led By Donkeys is an entertaining caper that often slides into farce, and it’s told with vim in a new book by the founders, Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit. The broad aims of the project were conceived in a pub, the Birdcage in Stoke Newington, north London, last December. Much has been made of the founders’ connection to Greenpeace, but the make-up of the group was as random as nights out often are. “It just happened to be us four in the pub that night. It could have been five of us, or us two with two others,” says Stewart. The camaraderie between the four is clear when we meet this month at a cafe in north London. Stewart, Greenpeace’s deputy programme director, speaks the most, and the most bluntly, while Knowles comes across as clear and concise, a moral anchor for the group. Sadri, whose background is in human rights and the Middle East, cuts through any pomposity that might creep in and runs the digital side of the operation, while Rose – who today has just arrived, on next to no sleep, from Sweden, where he lives – is a photographer and often designs the Led By Donkeys posters. No one remembers who first thought of doing quotes on billboards, but there was unanimous agreement that the initial target should be David Cameron and his evergreen 2015 line: “Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice – stability and strong government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband.” They ordered the posters and Sadri came up with a name for the group, a riff on “lions led by the donkeys”, the phrase used in the first world war to describe the tragedy of the British footsoldiers led to slaughter by incompetent or stupid generals. When it came to putting up the first billboard in January, by the A10 in Stamford Hill, close to the Birdcage, the job fell to Knowles and Stewart, who both live in the area. The team didn’t have the money to pay for the billboard, so they decided to requisition one. This, of course, is illegal: criminal damage at the very least. All four men had, in their activist pasts, had skirmishes with police, specifically campaigning on the climate crisis and against the Iraq war, and they knew their actions could result in them being arrested. As Stewart explains: “We come from a political culture that is comfortable with civil disobedience and thinks that civil disobedience has got us a lot of the freedoms we’ve got, and, speaking personally, isn’t that bothered by getting a conviction.” “It felt important to do something that was more than just writing a letter of concern or protest,” adds Sadri. “It feels like this is such a momentous political moment that there should be more people out there prepared to do a little bit more to stop this calamitous thing from happening. So this was a very modest and small way of personally doing something.” Putting up a billboard poster, it turns out, is a skilled task. “It very nearly didn’t continue as a project,” says Knowles, the man up the £90 B&amp;Q ladder that night. “We were covered in paste, couldn’t get the poster up and people were stopping in their cars and looking at us and laughing. So for a moment, it didn’t feel like it was going anywhere.” A little too amateurish perhaps? Stewart bristles a little. “I would describe it as guerrilla-style,” he smiles, then relents. “No, it was amateurish. Sheet one of poster one was nearly the sum total of this project. But we got that fucker up! And it just developed from there.” The plan was always to combine the analogue – billboards – with the digital: taking photographs and videos of people interacting with the work and posting them on their social media channels. So after the Cameron poster went up, Stewart contacted the Guardian columnist Marina Hyde through Twitter. She retweeted the image, and within minutes Led By Donkeys had hundreds of followers and interview requests had begun to come in; there was a special frisson among the four when Gary Kemp from Spandau Ballet started following them. “I didn’t know anything about it at all,” remembers Hyde, “but as soon as I saw their first billboard I thought it was so striking and funny. It’s so rare to see a sense of pisstake in any political campaigning. I just thought it was a great, simple, modern idea – one of the few things on what I suppose you’d call the Remain side to try and elicit an emotional response. It definitely shits on another ‘letter to the Times from 100 businessmen’.” Led By Donkeys describes what it does as “political theatre” and it’s most effective when, whether it’s a physical billboard or the Angel of the North, you can’t just thumb past it on your smartphone. “People talk about how the problems in today’s world are because we live in these little echo chambers, all talking to ourselves, and Twitter is one of the worst culprits of that culture,” says Sadri. “So there’s something about taking a politician’s tweet – something that flies past you at a million miles per hour – and slapping it on this massive, wooden, 100-year-old structure in the middle of somebody’s neighbourhood that breaks that, and says: ‘We have to look at that if it’s a sunny day, if it’s pissing with rain.’ And it gives you time to digest it if you’re sitting at a bus stop or talking to your neighbours.” The “anarchic, guerrilla” phase of Led By Donkeys actually lasted for little more than a week, but took in cover-of-darkness assignments to Romford, which voted 70% Leave, and Dover where, their pasting skills improving, they covered four sites in a night. But life was becoming increasingly complicated at work and home – all four have two young children each – and when the idea of crowdfunding to rent billboard space came up, they decided to dip a toe in. Not only would it make them legit, but it would allow Led By Donkeys posters to cover the entire country, not just towns that could be reached at night and get them home for the morning school run. They set a target of £10,000, which they hit in three hours; by the end of the day they had raised £30,000. The total now is over £600,000. Going straight hasn’t always been easy for Led By Donkeys: there was clearly a thrill to dodging police and furious Leavers, which was heightened by being anonymous and sometimes overhearing friends or colleagues talking about their latest stunt, without having a clue that they were involved. “I did a lot of activism when I was younger and then I settled down, mortgage, kids,” says Stewart. “So suddenly finding myself with Olly out on a ladder, doing something that was actually illegal but you really believed in it, was something I hadn’t done for eight or nine years. And there was something beautiful for us about doing it with friends, not doing it as part of a big group or organisation.” Still, even if they are “mired in Excel spreadsheets” now, there are clear upsides. From the beginning, Led By Donkeys had been conscious it could be accused of only existing in a bubble, but now it has the resources to reach a much wider audience. There is satisfaction in getting 10,000 retweets from a post, but these days the founders insist they are more excited when their work is picked up by regional papers, sparking local debate. They also want their message to be heard beyond British borders: to that end, they have bought billboard space in Brussels and beamed “SOS” on an EU flag in a 75x50m projection on the Dover cliffs. “Quite something to see the white cliffs of Dover turn blue,” noted Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister and now the EU parliament’s representative in the Brexit negotiations. “We have a project that definitely reaches Remainers, but what we’re increasingly passionate about is finding people outside that camp,” says Knowles. “And our premise is that there’s a lot of people who have changed their mind who aren’t being heard at the moment. Can we find a way to talk to them and bring them into the discussion?” The concepts can also become more outsized. “Being in Redcar,” says Rose, “watching them draw it out on the sand and then seeing the drone go up and looking at the screen and seeing the message revealed – that was a different level of excitement.” Alastair Campbell suggested that, if Brexit were to be averted, Led By Donkeys would deserve a special award as “secret heroes” of the campaign. But it’s hard to tell what impact, if any, they have had on the political discourse. “I have absolutely no idea!” says Hyde. “I mean it all gets worse, doesn’t it… We know politicians lie or make promises they can’t keep, but that perception seems to have achieved full spectrum dominance on all sides of our political divides. I think the implications of that are still playing out and will do for a long time, but are generally very bad.” Posting the politicians’ quotes without any additional comment or analysis of their own (the idea is to get people talking) has not always worked seamlessly for Led By Donkeys. After putting a pronouncement from Anne Widdecombe – “Homosexual acts are wrongful” – on a billboard in Christchurch, Dorset, they had to apologise and quickly backtrack, noting that some might take her words at “face value”. But mostly the group has shown a sophisticated and intuitive understanding of conveying a political message in 2019. You can’t rely on people seeing a billboard or reading an article in the local paper or not scrolling past a tweet – but if you hit all of those spots then you increase the chance of them seeing one of them. It’s a radical, even pioneering, mashing of old and new media – albeit one that sometimes spirals in ways the four never remotely considered when they started out. “We’ve taken a quote, turned it into a tweet, put it on a billboard, tweeted a photo of that billboard, the tweet’s gone viral, the local newspaper’s written about the viral tweet of a billboard of a tweet, that article itself has gone viral, then our tweet about the article has exploded,” they write in their book. “It’s a kind of meta-virality that we struggle to get our heads round.” For their part, the Led By Donkeys founders will keep hoping, angling for a second referendum. If it does happen, they’re clear that the Remain campaign has to learn lessons from 2016. It shouldn’t base itself in central London, for a start. It has to concentrate on issues that people really care about and “not let Dominic Cummings and that crew spread bullshit about the NHS”. But mainly it has to show an energy and vigour it didn’t have last time. Knowles says: “People have told me, ‘I didn’t feel the Remain campaign offered anything positive. And there was passion and emotion behind the Leave campaign.’ Any new campaign has got to get to the things people love and that’s the NHS, values, education and much more positively framed.” If it comes down to passion – well, here, Led By Donkeys think they will be in their element. And even though they are doing things legally these days, the subversive spirit remains. “We are always on the look out for something that would take us back out there,” says Sadri mischievously. “We were slightly disappointed when the government decided to put its ‘Get Ready for Brexit’ posters on digital screens and not on actual physical billboards, because we’d been honing our ‘cut-out giant letters and re-word giant billboards’ technique.” “The ladder is safely stored,” says Knowles, “and is ready to come out again.” • Led By Donkeys: How Four Friends With a Ladder Took on Brexit is published by Atlantic (£10).

          "bodyText": "We are going to get to Scott Morrison, and parsing his methodology, but I want to start with a bit of insight that flew below the radar in a busy week for political news. The Museum of Australian Democracy has been spearheading important research by political scientists about trust in politics, and this week it released the results of a recent survey of federal parliamentarians. The results revealed an appetite for institutional reform on some fronts, but the most interesting element for me was the resistance among our MPs and senators to opening the political system up to direct input and influence from the public. The superficial takeout from this insight would be this: politicians are type A power junkies and they don’t like sharing, so participatory democracy concepts like citizens juries are always going to struggle. But if you dig into the survey results a little deeper, what comes to the fore is anxiety, not overweening arrogance. The perception is voters don’t have a good grasp on how the system works and there is concern that media disruption increases scope for misrepresentation. There is a desire in the political class for more civics education as a corrective to promote engagement and better political literacy. It makes sense that Australian politicians are worried about how entrenched disengagement impacts their business in the age of Brexit, where a rash moment of participatory democracy in the shape of a national referendum triggered a profound institutional crisis which is not yet resolved. But now I’m drifting away from Morrison, and we need to get back to the prime minister, and what he’s doing, and why. The point of me flagging the MOAD stuff is professional anxiety about disengagement and its consequences sits at the heart of Morrison’s prime ministership. It’s important to grasp he’s a product of his age. I spent time this week watching Morrison thundering away at the dispatch box with parliament back in session, watching him work, trying to pinpoint exactly how he is different from his predecessors. The first thing to observe is he speaks predominantly to disengaged voters. Apart from the empathy offensive underway in the bush on drought (which on some internal views is cunning crowding out of Nationals and on other views helping Nationals) Morrison doesn’t need to rally or mollify the base, at least not yet, because he has one palpable advantage: he is not Malcolm Turnbull. Morrison doesn’t need to waste energy signalling to engaged fellow travellers that he is one of them, as Turnbull had to do more or less constantly, eroding the life force of his prime ministership genuflection by genuflection, because they already know that. He can focus his energy on courting the people who aren’t tribal and aren’t listening, the swingers who decide the outcome of federal elections, speaking simply, yet vividly, in an effort to capture their scant, reluctant, attention. The other thing Morrison does is cast Labor as the government, while laying a personal claim to the prime ministership. Morrison does this constantly. This is a genuine innovation, presenting simultaneously as a prime minister both in power and in exile. It’s the next iteration of his solo act during the election. Shortly after sunrise each day, Scott launches his valiant quest to prevail against the forces of Labor recklessness; the same quest, over and over, like it’s Groundhog Day, because with all the disengagement and disruption, you have to keep grinding away with your G-rated picaresque until enough people see it. Morrison wants to project himself as the prime minister, because incumbency is bankable currency in times of anxiety – just ask Paul Keating, who saw off John Hewson even though there had been a major recession. Like 1993, 2019 is an anxious time. The economic orthodoxies that have underpinned the post-war world are shaky, and serious weirdos ululate at the apex of governments. So Morrison wants you to know he’s in The Lodge, large and in charge, but he also wants you to worry that his incumbency might be transient; that someone might take it away. Morrison as a human is tactile, and he wants you to be tactile too. He’s a hugger, and he wants a hug back. He wants something more durable from you than abstract bystander regard. He wants you to buy-in, to make a commitment. It’s important to him, to be with him and not against him, or worse, indifferent. Morrison’s daily quest manifested this week in a bodice ripper about him saving Australia from Labor simultaneously applying billions in new taxes and unleashing a reckless burst of panicked stimulus that would destroy the budget. Given we were in absolutely no danger of any of that happening, it seemed strange that the threat had to bloom in technicolour from the bear pit, but it did. There are two possible explanations. The first is this is what government is now, either in democracies or in autocracies: build your own reality, create your own facts, and anchor this consequence-free environment with the constant suppression of your opponents. The second possibility is less nihilistic fortunately. Perhaps Morrison is just working overtime to prevent any buyers’ remorse taking hold in the community post 18 May, with the IMF this week issuing yet another warning that the economy is in trouble. Prime ministers castigating their political opponents isn’t new, but Morrison’s ratios are. John Howard, the inveterate culture warrior, was the master of government being an exercise of “us” and “them”. But Howard’s government was always present, and assertively so. Morrison is 80% Labor 20% government (and that’s generous frankly). Morrison not only keeps his boot on Labor’s throat, he also torches the apparatus around him to try and prevent the opposition clambering up again if he gets a sudden leg spasm. By torching, I mean all the propaganda about the “bubble”. Morrison actively devalues the institution and eco-system to which he owes his position – which just seems like so much faux everyman blather to propagate the populist projection of elites versus the rest – until you watch Labor trying to get a grip on the institution to help hoist itself off the mat, and then you clock the arson is actually more extensive. This was particularly evident this past week. With voters fretful about the economy, Albanese attempted to use the power of the parliament to invite a debate on the issue, so the government might be pressed to articulate its own plan rather than just distract. Morrison responded to this by signalling this garden variety request was the most risible thing anyone could have suggested. Imagine suggesting a deliberative process in the parliament when the government was busy doing stuff. Far too busy for all this bubble business, like debating a plan, or even articulating one, beyond we’re not panicking, if we need stimulus, at least it won’t be crap like Labor’s. So if we snapshot Morrison this week, we had the prime minister who was in government probably, but mostly keeping Labor out of government, disdaining the institution which gives him his status in an effort to be relatable to people who don’t have time or inclination to tune in, while laying the ground for possible pump priming of the economy by declaring pump priming is terrible except when Scott does it. Morrison won an election doing this stuff, and post-election, he’s adjusting the formula to try and expand his mandate. I have no doubt Morrison can win doing what he’s doing, having seen him crash through every roadblock put in front of him. But I’m left pondering the flip side of the new political normal our prime minister is busy creating. I get how you win by defamation, hugging, doing as little as possible lest it prove controversial, setting fire to the building and blocking the exits, but I have three questions, and I’m enough of an optimist to believe they still matter. How do political leaders build themselves up in the new environment? Is it even possible to build up, or is politics now just polarisation and spectacle? And does Morrison have any interest in finding out the answer to these questions? Katharine Murphy is Guardian Australia’s political editor"

          "bodyText": "“You can pretend a couple of times, play a role a bit, but in the end you are what you are,” Rodrigo Hernández says, and he is a deep midfielder. The way he tells it, player and person are inseparable and everything makes sense. Listening to him talk a little like he plays – intelligently, thoughtfully, calmly – it is as if there is an inevitability about it all, an inescapable logic; like this is just what he is and where he was always going to be, even if his story need not have brought him here, to his place: the middle of a football pitch. Rodri sits on a bench on the grass at Spain’s Las Rozas training camp, tracing his journey. He hasn’t come far – he was raised near here to the north-west of Madrid and began playing just down the road – but he has come a long way, learning en route. He describes himself as a sponge, soaking it all up, from Madrid to Villarreal and back via a university degree he’s still doing and on to Manchester, where he became the most expensive player in City’s history. Five times he mentions some of his “bests” – the best decision he took, the best years of his life, the best atmosphere, best experience, even his best friends – and none have anything to do with football. Playing professionally wasn’t his grand plan, yet looking back it feels mapped out and even the things that have nothing to do with football ended up having everything to do with becoming the footballer Pep Guardiola most wanted. With being him. “Very few players are one thing on the pitch and another completely different off it; personality translates,” he says. “He even looks like a midfielder,” his manager says. When Rodri signed, Guardiola said he would be “amazing”, highlighting an abnormal normality: “He doesn’t have tattoos or earrings. And his hair … he looks like a holding midfielder; a holding midfielder must be like this.” Rodri glances at his arms, and smiles. “If you like tattoos, perfect. But I’m scared. I think: ‘At 60, I’m going to have this…?’ “I think what Pep meant,” Rodri says, “is that the holding midfielder, more than anyone else, has to maintain order, keep a cool head, and maybe that also means being the most ‘normal’. Think of those top players – Xabi Alonso, Sergio Busquets, Xavi – they tend to be the ‘plain’ ones. You can choose between doing what’s best for the team or what showcases what you can do. Forwards get the spotlight, which is understandable because the hardest thing is scoring goals, but there’s work behind that which has to be done. Those players understood. Everything I do for the team is good for me. I’m like that off the pitch. “Everyone develops their own characteristics, but the best players are the most intelligent. The ones that think quickly and clearly have an advantage. Spain might not have always had the most skilful players, virtuosos, but they had the most intelligent.” With Rodri, that’s nature and nurture. The son of an engineer and a businesswoman, he went to an international school, speaks excellent English and joined Atlético at 11. “Their training ground was near and I could get there by bus,” he says simply. Some days, his coach would see him at the stop and give him a lift. En route, they would dissect the game. “That’s not normal in a boy his age,” Fran Alcoy recalled; Rodri admitted he was more interested in understanding the game than just enjoying it. “Fran showed me how to play. He was the first to put me in this position and say: ‘This is how to play this role.’ I was only 12, but at that age you really take things on board. I’d always enjoyed watching football and it’s true I found it easy to understand, to read the game; when a team was successful, I could see why, how they created space. ‘This player’s going to do this, that player will do that.’ It’s not easy to translate that to the pitch but that vision of how a holding midfielder should play, interpret the game, was something I had from a young age. Fran made it easy for me.” Your parents, too? “Well, my dad was a football fan,” Rodri says, laughing, “but he’d tell me to keep the ball more, dribble more, shoot more, be a bit greedier. And I’d be like: ‘Dad, that’s not my role’. He urged me to get forward because the fun part is scoring, but I’d say: ‘I like doing this; it’s what I’m good at.’ My parents’ role was vital: they kept things in perspective, didn’t let me get wound up or obsessed, and I take that tranquility on to the pitch. The plan was always to study, too.” Right up to the day he made his debut, and beyond. Released by Atlético, Rodri joined Villarreal. He also enrolled at university, reading business in Castellón, and moved into a hall of residence. “The best years of my life so far,” he says. “My parents suggested going into halls and it was brilliant. There’s a good, happy atmosphere, people your age from all over. I met my girlfriend there. One of the best experiences I’ve had.” The student life, eh? Rodri laughs. “The best atmosphere in the world! No, no. I’d go for dinner and a drink but obviously not the after-hours stuff. I was the lame guy who never did anything, haha. People didn’t understand; then when I started playing for the [Villarreal] first team they began to. Some didn’t even know, then they’d see me play.” First‑team football didn’t mean shelving the books. “It’s a personal challenge now more than anything, the time invested. I want the pride of finishing. It’s harder because of the distance. I have to go back for exams. “Obviously, football takes over, but studying is a healthy distraction. You’re dedicated to football 24 hours, but you need to clear your head occasionally: it’s intense and, particularly at this level, you can’t afford mistakes. If you think continually about a defeat, if you don’t occupy your mind with anything else, you might pay for it. It’s good to be informed too: we live in a bubble, but my best friends are mostly from school and university and it’s good to put yourself in [other people’s] skin. The problem is in football one day you’re here, the next day you’re far away. It’s more difficult to maintain relationships, but I try.” He’s even further away now. The decision to leave Villarreal and join Atlético, a club with a footballing identity seemingly opposed to his was deliberate: he wanted to learn from Diego Simeone, developing qualities he lacked, and his adaptability was summed up in a stat: the player who completed the most passes became the player who completed the most tackles. He was a hybrid; a classic positional midfielder built for the modern game. He was ready for City, seemingly the perfect fit. But, Rodri admits, England is totally different. He says he has never quite had this role where he is often alone, the other midfielders way ahead of him. Elbows fly, there isn’t a second to think, the rhythm is higher, the refereeing different, and he finishes games “dead”, he admits. “People said: ‘You can rest [after Simeone]’. Bloody hell, not at all.” And then there are the results. “It’s pointless beating Watford 8-0 then losing the next game,” he says, and especially with Liverpool reducing the margin for error to the minimum. “I touched down to find one of the best teams I’ve seen in recent years,” Rodri says. “Liverpool get seen as a counterattacking team, but they dominate, score from set plays, the attacking mechanisms are well-worked, they have variety. Klopp’s teams are tough, physical. They go at you like animals. They’re like a knife: one comes at you, then another. But every team has their bad moment and we have to be there [if they do]. “Nobody likes to lose, still less with our demands and Guardiola isn’t going to settle for defeat but he knows how to keep calm and lift the group, not ‘killing’ the team. We know the situation we’re in: we’ve had players out, we’ve played a lot of games and maybe that’s taking its toll. He’ll work on what we have to improve. We’re better when we rob the ball in the opposition’s half; when we press, we have to deal better with counters.” That means him, lessons still there to be learned. “We’re very offensive; we need a player who defends as well as attacks. It’s one of the most important roles in the team; it’s important to control what happens when attacks end, but it’s not just without the ball. If you take the initiative, you’re constantly moving. One of the things I have to improve is having the patience to wait for the right moment against teams that defend deep and we can’t penetrate. And when you lose the ball, you have to leap like mad to get it back so we can keep attacking, keep attacking, keep attacking because this team never stops.” It is some responsibility. “Yeah, but that’s my role. It’s why I came.” It’s also who he is."

          "bodyText": "Harry Styles Lights Up When it came to his solo career, 1D’s smouldering satyr initially gave it a lot of huff and puff, sending worrying signals that everything he did would have to be draped in the art-directed maximalism of a capital-A Artist. So it is a relief that Lights Up – our first peek at what has been heavily trailed as a daring new Styles-goes-cosmic direction (AKA took mushrooms once) – actually feels so effortless and laid-back. It is a blissed-out track, never coming down from a higher state of consciousness, that occasionally goes a bit heavy on the phasing effects but otherwise burbles along like deluxe bubble bath. Halsey Graveyard It’s mid-October and you know what that means: time to get S-P-O-O-K-Y. But also S-A-D. That’s the takeaway from Halsey’s latest moody-banger, now with added creepy funfair vid. It’s a poignant, spiralling snapshot of doomed romantic obsession that courts the goth vote (lots of references to loitering in graveyards) but gets severely marked down for the lyric “let that sink in”. It’s not Twitter, Halz. Hayley Kiyoko Demons Kiyoko’s new ongoing musical project rejoices in the #relatable title I’m Too Sensitive for This Shit. With its ominous roaming bassline and nervy pizzicato strings, standout track Demons is another Halloween anthem-in-waiting, albeit one where the scary monsters are trapped within rather than roaming the streets. It is spidery, moreish ghost train music of the highest order. Cher Lloyd MIA For one hot second, it looked like Mathangi Arulpragasam AKA MIA had recorded a song about indefatigable X Factor striver Cher Lloyd. But sadly it’s just Lloyd lobbying hard for a romantic bunk-off over some R&amp;B-inflected beats and playground whoops. It might not be the superpowered song potent enough to transform her into a belated superstar but it still thrums with emphatic, if wildly misplaced, self-belief. Maroon 5 Memories Great news for fans of Pachelbel’s Classic FM staple Canon in D. Maroon 5’s soulful scarecrow Adam Levine has heard it, too, and believes that what Johann P’s memorably boomeranging chord sequence needed to unlock its true potential was some trite lyrics about how gallons of booze can reactivate bittersweet memories. Guitar-free, drum-free, fun-free dreck."

          "bodyText": "Alice Birch’s new play, whose title comes with built-in parentheses, is both a challenge and a provocation. It consists of 100 scenes from which each director is allowed to make a pick-and-mix choice. Maria Aberg has selected 22 in a production marking 40 years of Clean Break – a company that works with women affected by the criminal justice system – and, while there are individually powerful scenes, the result is like a jigsaw puzzle with several pieces missing. Mostly the play is formed of a series of short, sharp vignettes. A daughter breaks into the family home and robs her mother. A woman, fleeing a violent man, is refused sheltered accommodation. Another woman seeks to explain her motives for stabbing her two daughters. But there is one long dinner-party scene in which a group of affluent, professional women, who live in their own liberal bubble, find their assumptions questioned by a mutinous guest. How, she asks, can change ever be achieved if we do not accept that people should be held responsible for their actions? You can see the influence of Caryl Churchill on that scene and more generally on Birch’s experiment with form. The problem is that Birch’s build-your-own-play approach ends up giving us slivers of information rather than a coherent whole. There are recurring themes, especially to do with the cyclical nature of abuse and the inadequacy of penal institutions in dealing with the root causes of criminality. But it is only in the one sustained scene – and quite late in the course of it – that you feel any debate is taking place about the big issue: whether it is possible to break patterns of behaviour and overcome our genetic inheritance. Aberg’s skilfully marshalled production makes good use of Rosie Elnile’s multi-levelled set and is strongly acted by an all-female cast including Shona Babayemi, Joanna Horton, Thusitha Jayasundera, Kate O’Flynn and Jemima Rooper. But, for all the play’s momentary insights, it still feels like fragments of a mosaic. At the Donmar Warehouse, London, until 30 November."

          "bodyText": "Right, my brain is as broken as my publishing program today (and that is saying something) so I am going to call it a day before I run screaming through a window. The blog will be back next Monday, when the House sits and Senate estimates start. But there is no rest for the wicked, so check back on the Guardian tomorrow, where we will have all the information on what is happening with the medevac report, the press freedom inquiry, and the Liberal party council, which is being held this weekend. A big thank you to Mike Bowers, who has walked close to a marathon in kilometres across this building this week, to bring you images of all the crazy. And Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp and the rest of the brains trust who not only helped keep me as close to sane as I can be, they also made sure I didn’t miss a thing. It’s those guys who are the heart and soul of this project. We’ll be back early Monday, but I hope you have a wonderful weekend. Thanks for joining us this week. We’ve got four sitting weeks to go. And please – take care of you. Siggghh Helen Davidson also had this story today: An Afghan doctor who was transferred to Australia from Manus Island for medical care has died in Brisbane. Sayed Mirwais Rohani had been in Australia for around two years, after more than four years on Manus Island. The 32-year-old Hazara man is believed to have taken his own life, and is the 13th death of a person sent to Manus Island or Nauru by Australia under its offshore immigration system. Rohani’s father is a refugee living in the UK with his wife, and he travelled to Manus Island in 2016 seeking his son’s release to join him in the UK. The spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, Ian Rintoul, said that request was denied because Rohani was not a minor. • Crisis support services can be reached 24 hours a day: Lifeline 13 11 14;Suicide Call Back Service 1300 659 467; Kids Helpline 1800 55 1800; MensLine Australia 1300 78 99 78 Arthur Sinodinos, who is doing his farewell tour across the parliament (he’s off to Washington), was asked by Patricia Karvelas what message his colleagues should take from his valedictory speech yesterday: Look, ultimately it’s up to people what messages they take out of it. I think that is a message. I think one of the other messages is that ultimately this is a team game. And you have to accept in politics you can’t always do what you want, even as a backbencher. You’re part of a team and government only works if it’s a team. There will also be a lot of media bigwigs in Canberra tomorrow – the media freedom inquiry will hold a public hearing. The medevac senate report is due to be handed down tomorrow. Amanda Stoker led the committee, which is government heavy, so I think we can assume it is going to recommend the legislation be repealed. Labor and the Greens are expected to enter in dissenting reports. Then, when the senate returns in November, it will all be up to Jacqui Lambie. In the meantime, Helen Davidson had this story: The Australian Border Force transferred a seriously mentally ill man to Perth from Melbourne, where a youth mental health facility was preparing to treat him – then took almost a month to bring him back. On Tuesday, after being flown 2,700km across the country, admitted to hospital emergency or psychiatric departments six times, held in various forms of detention, then flying another 2,700km, the young man was finally taken to the facility that had originally offered to treat him. The shock early-morning transfer from the Melbourne detention centre, Mita, to Perth, was on a commercial Qantas flight – just one day after the Qantas chief executive, Alan Joyce, proclaimed that the company would not be silent on social issues. The young asylum seeker was removed from the Melbourne detention centre in the early hours of 19 September, allegedly without warning and without consulting the external health professionals who were arranging to have him readmitted to the Melbourne facility. No reason for the transfer was given, as far as Guardian Australia is aware. This is not a sight you will see too often – an LNP senator sitting with the crossbench, against the government. Susan McDonald chaired the committee that recommended the additional maintenance requirements be removed from charity flight operators – which is what Rex Patrick is calling for. Labor voted with the government. And from this, I think you can infer from this answer on the voice to parliament, Ken Wyatt has set out that the government will be pushing to legislate, before heading to the referendum Patricia Karvelas: You do know you’ll break a lot of hearts by not putting the voice to the people? Ken Wyatt: We also have to be pragmatic and that’s a reality. PK: But do you acknowledge you’re going to break a lot of people’s hearts? KW: Some people have told me it will break their hearts. We have to think about whether we want to be recognised in the Constitution. PK: What’s the point of recognition without power, Senator? KW: Recognition was in section 127 in the Constitution but in the sense of not allowing us to be counted. 127 was struck out. The 1967 referendum created a number of myths around what it really meant to people. The reality was, was the striking out of that and then the amendment, the 51-26. This requires further work on what are the sets of words that recognise this within the Constitution. 51-26 has been predominantly used for Indigenous Australians to support Commonwealth legislation on very critical issues such as the Mabo decision, land rights, etc ... What I don’t want to see is that removed totally which then leaves a challenge in terms of the legitimacy of those. PK: Would you like to see it changed? KW: I’m going to wait to see what comes out. I’ve been meeting with people and there is a degree of willingness to have recognition. I think that once we work through whatever the voice is, and that may give us another option. What I suspect will happen is that we may legislate first and then when that’s successful, then we can go back for the next bite of the Constitution. On the legislated voice issue, Ken Wyatt says he is pushing ahead: Well, we’ve got a timetable I’m proposing to take to the PM. Once that’s been agreed to in the process that he and I will undertake, and my cabinet colleagues and certainly members of parliament, then we will announce that and we will clearly lay out the process and the structures that are within that. Patricia Karvelas: What about if people don’t want a legislated voice? KW: I suspect that if we went with a nebulous notion of a voice to the greater Australian public, it would not have the support. Constitutional recognition, with the exception of John Howard’s referendum, tends not to come back as a question to be put at a later stage. Local government is slightly different because people have fought to try and get local government recognised in the constitution and we’ve had parliamentary committees deal with that. But I don’t want to see us lose an opportunity. And that’s what we’ve got to do, do it very steadily. I don’t want this to be rushed that we get it wrong and that we lose it. When I look at the referendums that have been successful, Labor was successful with one on social services. That’s because Bob Menzies is the leader and did not oppose what Labor had done to the Australian public. In a sense there was this bipartisan support. But you need both sides to the political divide. PK: What process have you gone through now to get Labor on board? It is meant to be bipartisan. KW: I’m having dinner with my colleagues on an evening that we have chosen next week – the Indigenous members of the parliament who are predominantly Labor. PK: In terms of the timeline, I know you’re taking this to the PM, can you give me an indication of the kind of timeframe that you think is workable. KW: It is before the next election because we don’t a referendum tied in with an election. There is an unintended consequence of that we don’t need. It’s important we have this pristine space in which the question can be put, the debate’s had andAustralians make the decision. PK: You think you can have a referendum on recognition before the next election? KW: I’m optimistic. Patricia Karvelas: Many Indigenous people are opposed to this idea of legislating the voice. Have you convinced them? Ken Wyatt: No. I haven’t. But we will start a process. I’ve been talking to a lot of people as I’ve moved across the nation. Issues like sovereignty come up. Communities say, “Who will listen to our voice? We want local issues and access to health, better education.” I think Linda Burney discovered that when she travelled from Port Hedland to Uluru because I saw her and she made the very pertinent point – they were concerned about local matters that needed resolving. PK: In terms of a proposal for changing the Constitution, you’ve made it quite clear to the disappointment of many that you don’t want the voice to be in the Constitution. So what will constitutional change look like under the Morrison Government? KW: We will work through those over the next 12 months. PK: Can you give me some parameters? KW: There will be recognition. PK: What will that look like? KW: That will need to be worked through with our people. And has to be acceptable within a legal framework. What I don’t want is a section 44 issue being created. We have to be pragmatic and have many non-Indigenous Australians who are supportive but are saying, “I’m concerned until you tell us what the sets of words are because I’m not going to commit to something that creates a division between a nation that is becoming more unified.” The number of non-indigenous people who have said, “We will stand with Indigenous Australians. We want to see them recognised but get the words right.” On the ABC, Patricia Karvelas has an interview with Ken Wyatt about where the plan for Indigenous reconciliation is at. We will announce in the very near future a working group that will define the voice but will take in to consideration local, regional, state and national approaches. One of the things I’ve made very clear to state and territory ministers is they already have voices ... I don’t want to take them out of the equation. There will be a substantial piece of work that will be undertaken and as soon as I finalise it, crossing a couple of Ts and dotting some Is then we’ll start the process. PK: My understanding is you’re about to take that proposal to the PM. Can you give me an indication of what is in that proposal? KW: I can’t do that until I’ve had a discussion with my leader. PK: Am I right you are about to take a proposal to the PM for a way forward on legislation to actually establish a voice in this term of parliament? KW: What I’ll be doing is taking forward a series of propositions to do with constitutional recognition, the voice and truth telling. Each of those are separate pieces of work because they are critical in their own right. But what I also want to do is talk about the way in which government will take elements of that forward as we co-design. I’m seriously committed to working through with our people to a solution that they’re comfortable with as well, not just as we’ve always done in the past, come forward with the voices of a few. And then made a decision. Rex Patrick has been fighting to have the aviation body, Casa, reduce the number of maintenance requirements on charity aircrafts, and adopt the NZ model. Over in the Senate, new LNP senator Susan McDonald is crossing the floor to support a motion from Rex Patrick This is either “waiting for a mate”, or “sorry, it’s saved”, depending on your generation. Question time as seen by Mike Bowers Scott Morrison, playing the role of today’s mood (as captured by Mike Bowers) And we are done. The folders are very stacked though. Hopefully this means we are coming to the end. Nope. Scott Morrison just raised a finger and said “one more” to Tony Smith. It’s on the Prime Minister’s Science Prize. So at least it’s a worthy dixer. We’re at the swap sides of the chamber stage of the latest farce Luke Howarth and Andrew Laming have both made beelines for the frontbench this time round. Christian Porter seems very confused about whether or not there is a motion before the House. Tony Smith seems very confused about why Christian Porter is confused. Tony Burke is now trying to explain to Christian Porter about how the motion process works. Tony Smith is now agreeing with Tony Burke while still trying to work out why Christian Porter is confused. And now we all have to sit here for another four minutes because that whole explanation of standing orders took so long, Smith has to extend the bells. “Bring back Christopher,” Anthony Albanese yells. Christian Porter has been confused into silence, so I guess there has been some silver lining. Labor is attempting to suspend standing orders, to debate the economy. It will fail. Obviously. Joel Fitzgibbon is taking the silences in between the divisions to troll Michael McCormack about his press conference being overshadowed by the prime minister’s radio interview, where he made the same announcement, but got in first. National MPs are still sending ‘can’t believe that happened’ messages. Good times all round. Stay with me folks. My computer program is struggling. I know the feeling. After a Senate estimates session dominated by two topics – the economy and raising Newstart – Labor’s Kristina Keneally has asked Mathias Cormann three ways why the prime minister has repeatedly refused to deny that he sought to have Brian Houston invited to the White House. Cormann is keeping the answers simple - he has nothing further to add to what Scott Morrison has said. Labor MPs are calling out “what are you hiding?” Seems they’ll need Senate Estimates next week, or maybe to bring out medieval instruments of torture like thumbscrews, to get to the bottom of this. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister: Yesterday in the Parliament the Prime Minister shut down a proposed debate on the economy and organised an additional question to himself so that only he could talk about the economy. Is that because the Prime Minister only wants to listen to himself? Will the Prime Minister agree to a debate on the economy today or doesn’t he have the confidence in his own economic management? Morrison: When the Labor Party can confirm what their actual policies are, maybe that’s when they want to start asking those questions. That’s the entire answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Former prime ministers John Howard, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull all facilitated parliamentary debate at this time in the parliament on important economic issues facing the nation. Does the prime minister have the confidence in his economic position to be able to swallow his pride, follow their example and agree to a debate on the state of the economy today? Morrison: Every time, almost without exempt exemption, I come to this despatch Box, I’m talking about our economic policies. And the reason I do that – the reason I did that at the last election, Mr Speaker, the reason I do that is because I know that the strong economy is absolutely central to everything. It’s ensuring that you have the right economic policies that provide the bedrock to create the budget that can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. That’s exactly what our government has been doing. In season and out, despite what the global challenges are, we have continued to be able to build the strength and capability of our budget position, but also of the Australian economy which has seen now almost 1.5 million Australians get a job. Now, Mr Speaker, that is the greatest argument when it comes to the economic policies of this government and that’s almost 1.5 million Australians who have got a job. That’s - that’s the great evidence, Mr Speaker, of 1.5 million almost lives of Australians that have been transformed because as a result of the policies of this government that has set the framework and economy for people to go and invest and take people on, Australians’ lives have been changed because the Liberal Party and Nationals believe that strong economic management, that disciplined and stable and certain financial policies are what actually at the end of the day guarantee our ability to reach record levels of hospital funding, record levels of education funding, and in the midst of what is a very severe drought, Mr Speaker, that we could again today confirm that those who would be coming off the farm household allowance will be given a $13,000 payment as a supplementary payment and just over $7,000 - $7,500, Mr Speaker, for individuals to continue to support them. And we’re able to do this within the constraints of the budget which has been brought back to surplus. As I remarked in this place some time ago, the Leader of the Opposition, he wants to have debates. I’m getting on with things. But how can the Leader of the Opposition have a debate when he can’t tell us what his tax policy is, what his climate change policy is or any other critical issues that he fails to answer questions on a daily basis. He hasn’t got a policy agenda, Mr Speaker. The reason we have to talk about their record in government and their policy agenda from the last election is they haven’t had any policies since that time. So it is absolutely fair for the Australian people, Mr Speaker, to hold them to their record of the policies they took to the last election and they were condemned for those policies by the Australian people at that time. We will continue, Mr Speaker, to deliver the policies that were confirmed at the last election - policies that over the last six years have created more almost 1.5 million jobs for Australians. To his credit, Dave Sharma manages to look a little embarrassed asking the next dixer, especially when he gets to the ‘alternative views’ part. “It’s terrible when bad questions happen to good members,” Ed Husic says. He is very much making hay from his backbench position. We are just about 3/4 through this and we have had 11 mentions of “panic” and eight uses of “crises” from government ministers in response to Labor questions. Deidre bloody Chambers! It’s almost like they ... have talking notes ... on ... a ... phrase they would like to catch on. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia’s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition seems quite insistent on this point. But he obviously wasn’t insistent this morning because the matter of public importance which has been tabled today by the federal member for Barton does not mention the word “economy” at all, Mr Speaker. The word “economy”... is not even in it. So, Mr Speaker, if he can’t get his own side to agree about something, and that’s not uncommon at the moment, Mr Speaker, it’s not uncommon... I know that the Labor Party’s penchant is for panic and crisis, Mr Speaker, but honestly - he’s got to try to resolve the panic and crisis that is going on within his own party on so many issues. Whether it’s on - their response to climate, which they say is an emergency, but we’re not going to know their policy about it until the next election. And in between times, we’re going of the constant infighting between the member for Hunter and the member for South Australia... What is it again? Hindmarsh. The member for Hindmarsh, or member for Sydney or any other members. Or whether the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is going to tear itself apart. Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I’ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the Prime Minister. Given that yesterday the Treasurer falsely claimed that drought was the number 1 call on the budget, will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate on Australia’s economy and in particular the plight of farmers today based upon the facts? Morrison: Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition seems quite insistent on this point. But he obviously wasn’t insistent this morning because the matter of public importance which has been tabled today by the federal member for Barton does not mention the word “economy” at all, Mr Speaker.

The member for Hindmarsh, or member for Sydney or any other members. Or whether the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party is going to tear itself apart. Not only ridden by corruption but also seemed today by sexism as well, Mr Speaker. The leader of the Labor Party has got plenty on his plate and so I’ll leave him to deal with that all on his own measure Angus Taylor actually just uttered the words “we are unified on energy and climate policy on this side of the House,” with a straight face, and honestly, I now understand how he got that Rhodes scholarship. It’s Peter Dutton HOW SAFE ARE YOU time! How safe are we today, Peter Dutton? Well, Australia, I’m really glad you asked. You are as safe as we can make you. BUT JUST IMAGINE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. THE CHAOS. THE PANIC. THE KRAKENS! WHY, THE TRIFFIDS WOULD RISE UP. Thankfully Australia, you have Peter Dutton. So it’s all cool beans. Dutton finishes. Ed Husic: “Yeah, but you choose Greg [Hunt] as your deputy leader. It’s TRUE.” Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is again addressed to the prime minister. Given wage growth is the lowest it’s ever been, household debt is at record highs and consumer confidence is at a four-year low, why does the prime minister dismiss the role that this parliament has to play in debating the economic policy direction of the nation? Or doesn’t he have the confidence in his own position to be able to do so? Morrison: It’s all about you, isn’t it?! Through you, Mr Speaker! It’s about the Australian people, Mr Speaker. We debate these matters in the parliament everyday as the measures that we ... Apparently, Mr Speaker, when we bring legislation into this parliament that deals with economic measures, they’re apparently not debated in this place. The Leader of the Opposition has been here long enough to know that this debating chamber deals with copious pieces of legislation, Mr Speaker, and there is ample time. Now, before the election - next election, Mr Speaker, there will be the opportunity for the types of things that the Leader of the Opposition is speaking about and I have no doubt that will be the case as it is on every other occasion. But, Mr Speaker, it seems the debate he needs to have is within his own party because within his own party, they have got the climate fight club going on over there with umpteen different positions on climate change and, Mr Speaker, he’s got his own problems when it comes to the distractions of the New South Wales branch where I see compensation payments are measured in how many Aldi bags they’re handing out. [This bit was very, very loud.] Tony Smith pulls him up on relevance. Morrison: I’m in this place every single day talking about the economy. When we came to government, the real wage growth through the year was 0.5% and now today it’s 0.7%. I note the comments of the most recent RBA minutes and it says this, “Despite the level of high household debt in Australia, relative to other countries, the risks from household debt appear to have been mostly contained. Members noted that households continue to have large repayments on their housing debt and aggregate mortgage repayments equal to 2.5 years of repayment.” Mr Speaker, whether it comes to what we’re doing on jobs, whether it comes to what we’re doing in restoring the budget to surplus to ensure we’re there not only to meet the needs of today but we’re thinking ahead to meet the needs of tomorrow because we know how to keep our heads, to keep calm, Mr Speaker, and to ensure we continue to lay out the policies which we know are having the impact that they need to have and particularly in relation to employment. Employment in this country is the beginning of everything. Michael McCormack is summoned to the despatch box, and the longest three minutes of all our lifes begins anew. Empires have risen and fallen in this time. It’s amazing how he can make every minute feel like an hour. It’s Bob Katter time. He wants to know about a drought/dam plan. Are you aware that the PM after the north’s flooding cattle deaths came, listened and delivered two dams and $200m. At the drought summit in contrast, did you not say that the free market is not necessarily benevolent, we must learn to accept climate change, we cannot carry you forever. Ideology – where is the survival plan? Isn’t this the policy of the corporate elites when you buy up owner-operator Australia and the city suits enriched by selling to foreigners. Have you stopped a single sale? Minister, who is the master that you serve? He directs the question to David Littleproud, who tells him that was a question for the treasurer, but that the government is working to do what it can, but needs the states to come on board. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Can the Prime Minister confirm that since 2002 only two Australian Treasurers have presided over an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average? Will the Prime Minister agree to have a debate in this Parliament on Australia’s economy today? And will he admit the only two Treasurers who have had an unemployment rate that is higher than the OECD average are the current Treasurer and himself? Morrison: I’m interested in the jobs of Australians. Hear, hear. That’s what I’m interested in. The Leader of the Opposition is clearly only interested in his own job because all he wants to do is have a talk-fest in this place. I’m interested in the jobs of Australians. And taking action to ensure Australians are in work. Mr Speaker, more and more Australians in work and more Australians are in work today as a share of the Australian population than at any other time in Australia’s history. So, Mr Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition may be thinking that this place, Mr Speaker, and the chatter that goes on here is terribly important to him and his position. I’m going to remain focused on those Australians, Mr Speaker, who simply want us to get on the job, on with the job, of ensuring we’re providing the stable and the calm and the responsible financial management which has brought the budget back to the surplus. Albanese stands up for a point of order, and Morrison goes to sit down, but not before saying what sounds like ‘another spurious point of order’ Albanese: There were two parts to the question. One part went to whether the current Treasurer and the current Prime Minister are the only two Australian Treasurers who... Yeah... He hasn’t mentioned that. The second is if he’s confident let’s have a debate about it. Tony Smith: No, I was just going to say to the Leader of the Opposition - whilst there’s additional tolerance extended to him because of his position and to the Prime Minister, points of order are not going to be used to ask another question or to make a political statement. There were two parts to the question. The Prime Minister can address one or the other or both. That’s the way it works. The Prime Minister has the call. Morrison: The Leader of the Opposition may want to come into this place and throw a tantrum at Question Time. Over whether or not someone’s going to agree to what he wants to do. He’s entitled... Mr Speaker, the tantrums of the Leader of the Opposition in this place only re-enforce their addiction to panic and crisis on the Labor Party. They love panic. They love crisis. And even when, Mr Speaker - even when circumstances don’t bear their argument out, they seek to create them, Mr Speaker, because they will look to any excuse to put their hands in the pockets of the Australian people and to rapidly increase spending to a reckless level. I referred earlier, Mr Speaker, to the catalogue of Labor Party failures in government when it came to policy. And the reason they engaged in those failures is they could never break their cycle of panic and crisis. They put in ill-considered measures, they didn’t think them through, they just smashed them through and in the Australian community and Australians have been paying for them ever since. At the last election I said, “You vote Labor once, you pay for it for the next decade”, and it seems exactly the same thing is true under this Leader of the Opposition. He can throw as many tantrums that he likes, we’ll just get on with the job of good government. There are quite a few high school students in the gallery today, who are looking very bemused at how they arrived at this place. Samesies. It’s another lickspittle to the prime minister on the economy. But rest assured - Michael McCormack will get his moment to pretend he still has ownership over drought policy as the Nationals leader. He’s just got to wait his turn. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Given that since May the Reserve Bank, the OECD, and the International Monetary Fund have all downgraded Australia’s growth forecast for this year, will the prime minister agree to have a debate in this chamber today on the economy? Morrison: I note – I understand from my colleagues that – they have listed for the MPI today [it] isn’t about the economy. So I’m a bit puzzled why they want one but they’re not prepared to table one, Mr Speaker. I tell you what – what our government is going to do, it’s not about debating the economy, it’s actually about implementing the policies that make our economy stronger and that’s what our government is doing. That’s what we’re doing, Mr Speaker. And we will continue to implement those sound and carefully-managed disciplined and stable and certain policies that as I have said today, Mr Speaker, has resulted in three years of consecutive increased in employment every single month, the longest run of jobs growth on a monthly basis this country has ever seen. So what we will do is not talk about it, we’ll get on to do it. I mean, government does job is a weird flex, but cool. You do you, Morrison government. We are now hearing the same answer again, but as a dixer. Dante obviously missed a circle. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: My question is addressed to the prime minister. Yesterday the prime minister refused to debate the economy in this House. Will he debate today whether the IMF was wrong to downgrade Australia’s economic growth forecast? Morrison: As I confirmed yesterday, the IMF ... midyear budget update and of course at budget time. So that is the normal process in terms of budget forecast and other forecasts that are presented here or elsewhere. And so that is a matter of public record, Mr Speaker. We have made no commentary regarding the accuracy of others’ forecasts because the government provides forecasts of its own as part of the midyear budget process. We’ll be doing that when it comes to the end of the year in the normal course of events, but given I have been asked about forecasts and economic data, Mr Speaker, I’m very pleased to report to the House today that employment has increased by 14,000 jobs in the month of September. And that was in line with the expectations – around 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, and I can say that we are rapidly approaching a 1.5m jobs since this government was first elected and I can also inform the House that this monthly increase in jobs in this last month, jobs have increased every month for the last three years under this government and that is the longest run, I’m advised, of consecutive monthly jobs growth ever, Mr Speaker. This government has reduced the level of unemployment from 5.7 to 5.2% and also decreased the level of youth unemployment by also a full percentage point, Mr Speaker, over that period of time. This government is doing the work through patient, through methodical, through stable, through disciplined economic policies whether it’s ensuring Australians can keep more of what they earn, or investing $100 billion in the infrastructure that the Australian economy needs to grow, investing and ensuring that we’re putting the right skills programs in place to enable people in this country to get the skills they need for the jobs that are there, Mr Speaker, and supporting business in the same way. Reducing the costs for business whether it’s in the industrial relations area, and I commend the minister for the work he’s doing, looking through all the things that are preventing people from getting jobs and costing unnecessarily the process of getting jobs and the work that the assistant minister is doing in stripping away regulations that is cost investment in this country. We’re expanding our trade horizons, lifting the percentage of trade agreements that cover our trade from 26% to 70 %. Our economic plan, the calm, measured, stable certain plan just gets on with the job of delivering for Australians and the increase of almost 15,000 jobs, Mr Speaker, 26,200 full-time jobs, bears that out. Given the Indigenous recognition push, this will be interesting. Scott Morrison has walked into the chamber with David Littleproud. See? EVERYTHING IS FINE Who’s that MP? It’s Ken O’Dowd. I’ll be heading to the chamber for question time – hit me up with your predictions (but I would say drought and the economy would be on the money). This is an interesting story from AAP: The Canberra bubble is truly full, with countries looking to set up shop in the capital being turned away because of a lack of available land. The National Capital Authority, which manages federal land in Canberra, told a parliamentary briefing they couldn’t offer much to those seeking land for diplomatic missions. “We’ve had a number of countries where we’ve basically said, ‘No, we can’t offer you anything’,” chief planner Andrew Smith said. He also told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their vacant land was ongoing. Smith said new embassies could be built for a number of reasons, including the beginning of a new diplomatic relationship with Australia or countries already stationed in Canberra looking to move out of rented premises. But some countries were also requesting larger premises for missions. “We are actually at a situation where we really can’t effectively offer anything much,” Smith said. He said there were a couple of vacant sites but the authority couldn’t offer them due to “reasons associated with terrain or soil conditions”. When contacted by AAP, the authority said it was up to the individual missions to confirm whether they had been turned back. The authority manages vacant sites but countries then have to look after it once they pick up the lease. It also has a “use it or lose it” policy where countries may have leased land taken away from them if they show no signs of developing it. Smith told the committee negotiations with the Russian and Iranian missions to see them start works on their own missions were continuing. Last year, the committee was told that Kuwait, Iran, Brunei, Russia and Bangladesh had stalled or inactive development on their land. At the time, Iran attributed delays to the unexpected death of their embassy’s new architect. It also said it was holding discussions with the ACT government on the shortage of diplomatic land. Just for a bit more context on that spat Sky’s Thomas O’Brien has been reporting on – the Nationals have been annoyed about how the drought policy has been handled for quite some time. There was agitation within the party when Malcolm Turnbull was prime minister, with members pushing Michael McCormack to do more. Then, when Scott Morrison took over the leadership, he also took over on the drought, which furthered angered a group of National MPs, who thought the Liberals should not be leading on a policy area which traditionally, has been theirs. So there has been angst, but a truce was called, given the drought was, from a PR point at least, a headline issue for the government. Then the announcement happened – and those tensions boiled over again. For the record, none of the National MPs are willing to go on the record to say this. But yes, they are *annoyed* Labor and the Greens are teaming up against an expansion of the fast-track visa process which among others would cover asylum seekers who arrived by plane. Contrary to some reports this morning, it is not a motion to scrap the controversial process altogether – although the Greens’ position is that it should be scrapped. What is the fast-track process? It’s complicated and has changed over the years but essentially: The fast-track assessment and removal process was introduced in 2014, and later expanded. It applies to the group of people who sought asylum in Australia by boat from August 2012 to January 2014 (and any of their children) commonly referred to as the “legacy caseload” and numbered more than 30,000. Under the process, asylum seekers can only apply for three-year temporary protection visas (TPV) or five-year Safe Haven Enterprise Visas (Shev), and are denied access to a full administrative review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. A refusal will automatically receive a limited review by the Immigration Assessment Authority (which was established for this purpose and sits within the AAT), but the IAA won’t hear new information. Some fast-track applicants are excluded from this. The process is controversial, with some legal and refugee experts criticising it as being more focused on speed than fairness. The Greens and Labor motion seeks to scrap an expansion of the process to cover people from the legacy cohort reapplying after their TPV or Shev expires, as well as anyone who arrived by air and who applies for temporary protection. It applies to any application made after 1 April this year. Immigration minister David Coleman told the Australian this would result in application assessment times blowing out from an average of 23 days to 504 days and would put more strain on the AAT. Labor disputes the figures, claiming that as of February last year the average time (from lodgement to a primary decision) was 415 days for TPVs and 316 for Shevs. “Labor does not support the government’s unfair fast track process because it is neither fast nor fair – if it was the third term Liberal government would have been able to process these applications by now,” said a spokesman for shadow home affairs minister, Kristina Keneally. Greens senator Nick McKim said the fast track process was neither fast nor fair. “It should be scrapped altogether, not expanded,” he said. “It was set up with the clear aim of reducing people’s chances of claiming asylum and denying them avenues of appeal. This government continues to demonise people who have fled persecution.” A group of ex-judges, anti-corruption commissioners, and experts have laid out a blueprint for improving political and democratic integrity in the wake of this year’s election. The Centre for Public Integrity used a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to argue there was “ample evidence” of the need for integrity reform, pointing to the $70m campaign spend by Clive Palmer and the post-political appointments of Christopher Pyne and Julie Bishop. The centre, chaired by former NSW judge Anthony Whealy QC, wants parties and candidates to report all single donations of $1,000 or above or aggregated contributions of $3,000 over three years. The current threshold is $14,000. Donations should be disclosed to the public in real-time and include income from “party fundraisers, corporate sponsorship of business forums, and membership fees over $600 per year”. Electoral expenditure should be capped, and advertising limited by the finance or attorney-general’s department, which would purchase advertising space and distribute it to parties, candidates, and third parties. The centre also wants to see stronger post-separation employment bans apply to former ministers and parliamentary secretaries, preventing them from lobbying-related activities for five years in any area linked to their former portfolio. The ban would be enforced by an independent parliamentary integrity commissioner. “The Commonwealth has the weakest integrity laws in the country. Reform is crucial in the wake of the 2019 federal election,” Whealy said. The Centre for Public Integrity board includes ex-judges Tony Fitzgerald QC, David Ipp QC, Stephen Charles QC and Whealy, professors George Williams and Joo Cheong Tham, and barrister Geoffrey Watson SC. Mike Bowers has been very busy this morning. This would be the moment the Nationals gathered to announce the farm household allowance changes, but were overshadowed by the prime minister who was on not-Alan Jones radio doing exactly the same thing. Some colour in parliament, thanks to a Mongolian dance troupe. A very fed up Jacqui Lambie And that Senate light Katharine Murphy and Paul Karp have put together exactly what happened when Labor voted against the Greens motion to stop the government from scrapping the education infrastructure fund, in favour of redirecting it to emergency disaster responses: Labor has done a deal with the Morrison government to pass legislation redirecting education infrastructure money to disaster relief despite significant objections from the education spokeswoman, Tanya Plibersek. The opposition made the decision to sign on to the emergency response fund in a special shadow cabinet meeting on Wednesday night, which also considered Labor’s stance on the free trade deal with Indonesia. But Guardian Australia understands Plibersek objected, and concerns persist within the caucus that the decision will blunt Labor’s ability to pursue the Coalition over cuts to education funding. Labor MPs, including the former research minister Kim Carr, have expressed concern that the redirection will deliver a significant blow to investment in research infrastructure. I have been flipping through some annual reports this morning. The Department of Employment provides us an update on the progress of its struggling $250m PaTH internships program. You might remember it’s the scheme where the government pays businesses like Hungry Jacks and Woolworths $1000 to host young welfare recipients. The interns get an incentive payment, which unions say equates to about $4 a day. The program was supposed to offer 30,000 internships a year – instead there have only been 6,464 since April 2017. The report does say that 65% of those internships led to a job. “Those who have completed Youth Jobs PaTH have achieved strong outcomes, but take-up continues to be a challenge,” the report says. The government poured another $10m into the scheme in August. Nick Martin (the doctor from the post a few down) approves this message Here’s the dairy industry inquiry motion Pauline Hanson put up and won (with the support of most of the Senate, excluding the government). That the following matter be referred to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for inquiry and report by the third sitting day in March 2020: the performance of Australia’s dairy industry and the profitability of Australian dairy farmers since deregulation in 2000, with particular reference to – (a) the ability of Dairy Australia to act independently and support the best interests of both farmers and processors; (b) the accuracy of statistical data collected by Dairy Australia and the Australian Bureau of Statistics; (c) the funding of Dairy Australia and the extent of its consultation and engagement on the expenditure of levies revenue; (d) the merits of tasking the ACCC to investigate how it can regulate the price of milk per litre paid by processors to dairy farmers to ensure a viable dairy industry; (e) alternative approaches to supporting a viable dairy sector; (f) the introduction of a mandatory industry code of practice; and (g) any related matters. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has also unleashed on Labor for its decision not to back a motion to save the education fund (Jacqui Lambie was also very, very angry at the move). Labor and the Government have teamed up to stab education in the back by abolishing billions in education funding. I don’t expect any better of the regressive Liberals who have cut education funding at every turn, but Labor used to be the party of education. Now they are just selling out communities and young people to remain politically relevant. Labor are so eager to please the Liberals they voted to abolish the infrastructure fund they themselves established. The reality is unis, Tafes and research have all suffered under this Liberal-National government. Education in Australia is being dangerously underfunded. The official Labor press conference on the free trade agreement decision is out. From Madeleine King’s office: We will back these agreements, although we are concerned about how this Government will implement them. We have consulted widely on these issues with stakeholders in the union movement, industry, academia and the public service. I have written to Trade Minister Simon Birmingham seeking firm commitments to ensure that the implementation of the agreements safeguard Australian jobs and maximise market access for Australian businesses. We are seeking: A guarantee that these agreements protect Australian jobs. An assurance that working holiday makers are not exploited and are appropriately qualified for the work they undertake. The termination of the existing bilateral investment treaty with Indonesia. The termination or updating of out-dated bilateral investment treaties and investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) clauses. A review of recent ISDS mechanisms in trade agreements. An inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT) into Australia’s treaty-making process. An assurance that there is no inference from the agreements that would require the privatisation of government services, nor restrict any future decision to bring acquire public assets. Labor’s call for the Government to pursue the termination of the existing Bilateral Investment Treaty between Australia and Indonesia was recently backed by JSCOT’s recent review of these trade agreements. This old treaty contains ISDS clauses with poor safeguards. Labor does not support the inclusion of ISDS provisions in trade agreements, but the report noted that the provisions in these new agreements include strong safeguards. Labor MPs on the JSCOT committee were instrumental in ensuring that these recommendations were included in the final report. Back in the Senate, One Nation put forward a motion to set up an inquiry into the “performance of Australia’s dairy industry and the profitability of farmers since deregulation in 2000”. Labor, the Greens and the crossbench all supported the inquiry. The government opposed it. Ayes - 33 Noes - 28 It is not often you see that section of the chamber supporting something One Nation puts up, but there you go. Just on Peter Dutton’s latest intervention on medevac, I have been reminded of this story from earlier in the year: A doctor on Nauru who blew the whistle on the deliberate medical neglect of refugees and asylum seekers on the island has been awarded a global award for free speech. Dr Nick Martin, the former senior medical officer for International Health and Medical Services on Nauru, spoke out publicly against what he described as Australia’s “inflexible, unswerving, and shameless” offshore immigration regime, that deliberately harmed asylum seekers and ignored doctors’ recommendations to treat dangerously ill people. In London on Wednesday night, he was awarded the 2019 Blueprint for Free Speech prize, an award previously won by Chelsea Manning, who revealed US military abuses and suspected war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, and John Kiriakou, the former CIA intelligence officer who revealed information about torture techniques including waterboarding. Martin is a veteran military doctor. The drug testing bill is on its way to the Senate. Labor is supporting the government’s call to abolish the $4bn education investment fund (the Coalition has wanted it gone since 2014 and, when it couldn’t get rid of it, just stopped spending the money from it, meaning it has sat there untouched), mostly because it doesn’t want to be seen as standing in front of emergency response fund (which is where the government wants to put this money). Jacqui Lambie has been calling for more Tafe funding for Tasmania since returning to the Senate. That’s why she is so angry. The money that is there, for that purpose, is now being officially taken away. Oh FFS. From AAP: Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has claimed Australian war veterans want refugee medical evacuation laws scrapped. Mr Dutton is locked in negotiations with Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie, herself an army veteran, as he seeks to repeal the so-called medevac laws. “I believe very strongly that most Australians and certainly the vast majority of veterans would want us to abolish this law,” he told 2GB Radio on Thursday. There does not seem to be any evidence for this, other than Dutton is courting Lambie’s swing vote on this. We were expecting a press conference on the party’s position on free trade agreements after a lively caucus debate this morning, but it has now been called off. We are still waiting to get the details of what has been agreed upon, but expect something on scrapping old investor state dispute settlement clauses with Indonesia, independent economic analysis of the trade deals, and a concession on future labour market access. The unemployment figures are out That vote Paul Karp has been telling you about, on the $4bn education investment fund, is happening. Labor created it when it was in government. The Greens put in a motion to protect it. Labor is voting against the motion. Jacqui Lambie is ESPECIALLY pissed about it. Jacqui Lambie has just got stuck into the deal struck between the Coalition and Labor – describing it as “pretty pathetic” that Labor has agreed to abolish a $4bn education investment fund in return for $50m for Tafe. “I can get more out of the government with just one of me, than all of you put together,” Lambie said. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says the $50m is “measly” and criticises Labor, which she said “used to be the party of public education”. Mathias Cormann has moved the bill out of the committee phase and is now setting a limit on the time for debate – so we’re going to have a final vote by 11.45. Is there anyone in this building not having a tantrum right now? If so, feel free to swing by the Guardian office for a chocolate. Because this whole place is one giant sulk right now, on all sides. Like I said, totally and absolutely, fine. Everything is fine. The Labor senator Murray Watt has revealed that the opposition has done a deal with the government to pass the emergency response fund bill, which abolishes the education investment fund and redirects it to “future emergency response and natural disaster recovery”. The bill is now being debated in the Senate – where the Greens attempted to stop its progress with amendments saving the education investment fund, and Jacqui Lambie has an amendment that limits the amount that can be taken to three-quarters of the education investment fund. Watt has moved opposition amendments that reflect the deal – to increase the quantum of the emergency response fund and lift the amount it can pay out each year from $150m to $200m, with the extra $50m to be spent on “disaster preparedness and mitigation infrastructure”. The government leader in the Senate, Mathias Cormann, thanked the opposition for their “constructive engagement” on the bill, indicating that the government will support the opposition amendments. Cormann explains that an extra $50m will be given “to establish a $100m Tafe revitalisation grants program in partnership with the states”, with 50/50 funding from the states. It seems the same $50m is being characterised as about disaster mitigation infrastructure and upgrading Tafes! But – in any event – a deal has been done so we expect the bill to pass this morning. It’s safe to say not all members of Labor’s movement are happy with the party’s decision to support the Indonesian free trade agreement. Joel Fitzgibbon also notes that while the FHA changes are being put into the parliament today, the Senate doesn’t sit again until November. He says the lump sum payments are not enough and the government’s response has not been enough. It is putting its budget surplus in front of the livelihoods of Australian farmers. Joel Fitzgibbon continues: Labor will use ... every mechanism available to it to try to prevent the government from taking people of the modest Farm Household Allowance and obviously they could be constitutional restrictions on what we can do in the parliament because it is effectively a money bill, proposition to spend more money, but I will make this point about that, while we may be barred from making amendments which have fiscal implications, restoring the payment for these families until this drought breaks, and we all pray outcomes in the not too distant future, is a modest amount of money, a very modest amount of money, in proportion to the total commonwealth budget. And if the prime minister wants to maintain this fiction, so loose with the truth is he, that he is spending $7bn on drought, then people everywhere will be asking well, why prime minister do you find it necessary to cut, cut these farming families’s of this modest payment. Joel Fitzgibbon: The time for in action and talking is behind us. It is time now to act in a meaningful way and I make the appeal to the prime minister again. Establish a bipartisan rural cabinet, drought cabinet, drought advisory committee – whatever he wants to call it – because the opposition understands the seriousness of the situation the country now faces. This really is approaching a wartime-like situation. And we stand ready to work with him to make the decisions that will be necessary to ensure another farming families can stay on the land, that rural communities can survive, and we can secure our food sources in this country without becoming too dependent on the importation of our food and fibre. Joel Fitzgibbon says the government’s response to the farm household allowance was “not good enough”, describing it as “modest” and “inadequate”. Dipping into state politics for a moment, because of the review Anthony Albanese has ordered into NSW Labor: Earlier today, Kaila Murnain tendered her resignation as General Secretary of the NSW Labor Party. The terms of the separation agreement are confidential, but consist of Ms Murnain’s basic legal entitlements. The full terms of the settlement will be reported to the next meeting of the Administrative Committee. The Party is actively considering seeking the recovery of all of its costs related to the Inquiry, including the sum payable to Ms Murnain, under its insurance policies and from its previous lawyers. A new branch secretary will not be elected until the review into the branch currently being conducted by Professor Michael Lavarch has provided its recommendations on the role of the General Secretary. Joel Fitzgibbon will hold a press conference at 10.45 today to give Labor’s response to the government’s latest drought announcement. Speaking of Ed Husic, you might remember that yesterday’s blog included a speech he made to the federation chamber about the rise of rightwing extremism – which is exactly what Asio warned about in its public annual report, released late yesterday. Ed Husic, talking to Sky, says there is “very little modelling” done on the trade agreements but Labor will “support them, because it is the right thing to do”. He says Labor wants to keep a close eye on “what they do to jobs” but that the agreements open up markets in way they haven’t been previously. Today’s announcement also might help explain why Josh Frydenberg yesterday called the drought the “biggest call on the budget”. Obviously, as the treasurer, he knew this was coming. From a money point of view, it’s still not – but it is certainly the reason he has had to rework quite a few figures lately. Bridget McKenzie gets to put the release out on it: Today the Australian Government introduced improvements to the Farm Household Allowance (FHA) that will help more farmers through periods of hardship. This is our next step in responding to the Independent Review of FHA which will see more than 30,000 farmers able to access this immediate support. Minister for Agriculture, Senator Bridget McKenzie said the changes extended farming families’ access the FHA from three years in their lifetime to four years out of every 10, recognising that farmers experience hardships, including droughts, more than once in their lives. “...A one-off drought relief payment of up to $13,000 for a farming family, and up to $7,500 for an individual is designed to help people determine whether they will be sustainable, should look at succession options or, in some instances choose to sell. “For the first time, we’ll link farm enterprises with their directly-related businesses and consider income and losses together – not just income – a big change in how Government support payments are provided to families. “Our Government had already made changes to make the FHA quicker and easier to access by reducing paperwork by a third and by temporarily increasing farm assets threshold to $5 million from 1 July 2019. “It is all part of the radical simplification of the FHA application process and key policy settings that the Prime Minister announced on 27 September.” These improvements include: a simplified assets test a significant redesign of the application process and form, including allowing farming couples to apply using the same form a strengthened case management approach to better support farmers in hardship through periods of financial difficulty. ...The FHA has been supporting Australian farmers since July 2014. It has paid more than $365 million to around 12,700 recipients in that time. David Littleproud, who had some interesting things to say about “metropolitan commentators” who were “frothing at the mouth” this morning *cough*, is now introducing those FHA changes in the chamber. Scott Morrison has announced changes to the farm household allowance – on the John Laws Sydney radio 2SM (who is not Alan Jones, you might note) show. At the end of the four years (the current time allowed for the payment, which essentially is welfare for farmers, and is paid at the same rate as Newstart) farmers will receive a lump sum payment of $7,500 for singles, and $13,000 for couples. Peter Dutton is speaking to the media and he says he feels there may be “some complacency” around security, because “thank God”, Australia has not been the scene of a major terrorist attack within its borders. He’s addressing Duncan Lewis’s parting call – to publicly request more money for Asio, noting that the resources were strained in the *public* report, as well as warning of a growing rightwing terrorism threat. Dutton blamed Labor for cutting Asio’s budget (Labor has not been in power since 2013) and said the government had been putting that money back. The prime minister is talking to John Laws on 2SM, but none of us can listen in, because the 2SM site is down. AAP on the NDIS announcement: The next boss of the agency responsible for the National Disability Insurance Scheme is a former senior NSW bureaucrat. Martin Hoffman, who has been both a commonwealth deputy secretary and secretary of the NSW Department of Finance, Services and Innovation, will take up the job from November 4. He has also held roles in the private sector, including as chief executive of Ninemsn. NDIS Minister Stuart Robert said Mr Hoffman has the “dedication, vision and expertise” to lead delivery of the transformational scheme. “He will build on the ground-breaking work already underway and will make a real difference in delivering on the government’s commitment to realising the full benefits of the scheme for participants,” the minister said. Labor had this week put pressure on the coalition to appoint a new leader for the National Disability Insurance Agency, with its previous chief executive Robert De Luca resigning in April. “It is literally leaderless,” opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten told the lower house on Monday night. The organisation’s deputy chief executive Vicki Rundle had been acting in the top job since Mr De Luca’s resignation. Mr Hoffman has been appointed for a three-year term. Labor has voted to support the Indonesian free trade agreement, at the end of its shadow caucus meeting. Jim Chalmers was asked about Josh Frydenberg’s interview on his way into parliament his morning: The weakness in the Australian economy isn’t primarily because of weakness in the global economy, it’s primarily because the Morrison government doesn’t have a plan. Too many Australians are looking for work or for more work because the economy is floundering on the Liberals’ watch. Business knows, and the community knows, that we won’t get the economic growth we need to create good jobs while the government continues to sit on its hands. The call to parliament has sounded. Huzzah. Stuart Robert has called a doorstop to discuss this at 9.45. Asked for some of those specifics, Fiona Simson told the ABC it was about planning for the future, while looking at ways farmers could diversify their businesses: So, certainly, I think it’s about looking at how we farm now in Australia. How sustainable that is. It’s about looking at add to those income streams. It’s about supporting. We’re looking at, for example, at the moment we can create perhaps energy, we can create income streams from energy on underground gas … We know that there’s, you know, for example, solar energy can save farmers enormous amounts of money. It’s about looking at planning for drought on a regular basis. [It’s about] how can we make sure that farmers have access to, to to infrastructure on farms, and there’s a whole suite of measures that we want to discuss with the government, but it’s not just about farmers. It is also about rural regional communities. Because if we’re going to relieve the population pressures in the city, if we’re going to really truly build our regional communities at the moment – we’re talking about indoor agriculture, for example, with vertical farming … There’s many things we need to look at, Hamish, and that they need to be done together collaboratively, not in this sort of one government at a time, with the industry out of the room and communities out of the room. We need to plan for it. Fiona Simson, the president of the National Farmers’ Federation, also had a chat to ABC radio this morning. Here is some of what she had to say about the drought policy: [Policies] are being developed in a vacuum because there’s no real effective way of measuring whether or not these these measures have been robust. When we get to the end of a drought, and we’ve done it before, we’ve done it recently in the millennial drought, then we just sort of seemed to go that one’s over, pick up our pieces and and wait for the next rather than thinking every day – how can we make a rural and regional communities more resilient? How can we make our farmers, our really important food- and fibre-growing people, more resilient? How can we keep jobs in the in the country areas? How can we make sure that people have access to fresh water, which is just a first world sort of thing? And these are things that our strategy, which involves all levels of government, working together hand in hand on a regular basis with the community, with farmers, to actually get, you know, put in a new way, a new paradigm of dealing with drought in Australia … I’ll just finish the that no other government has been able to do this yet. It is an incredibly difficult space to work in. And look, we are really grateful for the Morrison government’s commitment to look at this and to work with us in developing this new strategy. And this new way of treating drought in Australia. There has also been a bit of chatter this morning about Josh Frydenberg’s interview with Phil Coorey in the Fin, in the lead-up to his attendance at the IMF meeting in Washington. It’s an extension of what he was saying yesterday, in response to calls for stimulus after the IMF’s downgrade of Australia’s economic growth outlook. The promised surplus is now being billed as an “economic buffer”. “A strong budget position helps build the resilience of the economy for external shocks, whenever that may occur, and your ability to respond to those shocks with a fiscal response,” Frydenberg told the Australian Financial Review. I am not sure that is going to calm the calls for stimulus, given the economy’s position, but you can start to see the narrative they are building – stimulus is coming, but it will be after the surplus, and what the government considers “good” stimulus (“bad” stimulus, in this scenario being painted, was Labor’s response after the GFC). The attorney general, Christian Porter, will introduce amendments to native title today. From his release: The native title legislation amendment bill 2019 implements a range of measures recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and the Council of Australian Governments (Coag). It was also informed by extensive consultation with native title claimants who said they wanted more flexibility and efficiency built into the system. The bill will provide claimant groups with:  Improved pathways for dispute resolution following a determination of native title;  Increased transparency and accountability for prescribed bodies corporate (the corporations set up to manage native title);  Greater flexibility for bodies corporate to set their own internal processes. Importantly, the bill also seeks to end the uncertainty created by a 2017 full federal court judgment that cast doubts over the validity of hundreds of what are known as “section 31” agreements, which are negotiated between claimant groups and industry to facilitate land access. The McGlade decision found that such agreements were only valid if they were signed by all representatives of a claimant group, rather than by a majority – even if the only reason for not obtaining every signature was because a single representative had died. The bill will validate all affected agreements and ensure that a majority of representatives can negotiate on behalf of a claimant group in the future. For some history on this issue, you can head here. I told you drought was going to be the issue of the day. I’m listening to Hamish Macdonald interview David Littleproud on RN, and it sounded as though Littleproud just took a swipe at some city media types, saying that “while I get a lot of metropolitan commentators are frothing at the mouth at the moment” in regards to the drought and what needs to be done, says we “need to be careful” not to scare the next generation from entering agriculture as a career. Macdonald pulled him up on the “metropolitan commentators ... frothing at the mouth” comment. HM: To be perfectly fair, having spent a fair amount of time in drought-affected regions recently, I mean, that is what you hear when you go there – I mean, I don’t think it is just metropolitan commentators saying this sort of stuff [that more needs to be done], people on farms are quite desperate at the moment; are you sort of diminishing their plight by suggesting that? DL: Totally not, Hamish. I don’t have the comfort of tucking myself into a bed in a metropolitan [area], I actually live and breath it every day, my friend. I actually see these people and I know them by face and by name. These are resilient people. And they believe in what they do and they know what they are doing is the best in the world. Now we are going through a tough time and we’ve continued to have these conditions over our whole agricultural history, but we’ve faced up to them, and we’ve continued to work through them. So we will get through this, and when people say they want hope, then it is about leadership of hope and saying we will get through this, your government will stand shoulder to shoulder with you in this, and we will get you through, in the here and now ... the community and the future, that is why we are going to prepare to get them through this one and prepare them to get through the next one. While it is not unusual for National MPs to talk down about metro journalists with the “latte sippers” line alive and well in Michael McCormack’s world, Littleproud’s comment is interesting given its timing. The conservative Sydney 2GB radio host Alan Jones had quite the combative interview with Scott Morrison on Monday on the issue of the drought, loudly interrupting with “how is that going to feed cows?” as Morrison detailed his government’s spending, and then, when talking about the drought on his Sky News show the next night, broke down crying. I’m not sure if that counts as “frothing at the mouth” but I’m also pretty sure there will be some raised eyebrows when the comment gets back to some of those metropolitan offices. Meanwhile, Paul Karp had this story late yesterday, after taking a look through the Asio annual report: The threat from extreme rightwing terrorism in Australia has increased in recent years and will remain an “enduring threat”, according to Australia’s spy agency. The Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation issued the warning in its latest annual report, adding that “extreme rightwing groups in Australia are more cohesive and organised than they have been in previous years”. The comments amp up the agency’s concern about rightwing extremist terrorism, after Asio boss Duncan Lewis told Senate estimates in April it was an important issue but the Christchurch massacre had not changed the agency’s calculus. Asio has also reported a strain on its resources, with more calls for advice. Kristina Keneally told the ABC the security agency had sounded an “alarm bell”. “It’s an incredibly important agency in our national security framework and for them to be reporting in this time when the challenges they face are quite complex, that they are stretched for resources, well that’s an alarm bell,” she said. Labor MPs have been called to a special meeting of caucus at 8.30am this morning to decide their position on three new free trade agreements. The meeting comes after a working group of shadow ministers and union leaders held meetings on Wednesday afternoon to try to work through concerns over the Indonesian FTA. Labor is expected to endorse the enabling legislation but a number of MPs from both the left and right factions will push for the party to demand concessions on labor market access and skills testing. It’s expected to spark a heated debate in caucus, particularly given that elements of the agreements are at odds with the party’s national platform. The ACTU has been spearheading lobbying efforts to get the deals knocked off, raising fears about future market access for temporary visa holders under the Indonesian deal. The shadow trade minister, Madeleine King, has been clear that she wants the party to support the agreements but may be forced to adopt a new negotiating position to appease the concerns of caucus. We will know more later this morning. Welcome to the last sitting day for this week. After the parliament rises today, senators will turn their attention to Senate estimates next week, while the House will sit alone. But the ongoing drought looms large over everything being done in this building at the moment, with the government repeatedly forced to defend their strategy. Yesterday, on Sky, Labor’s Joel Fitzgibbon called for a drought “war cabinet”. The government says it is working with everyone it can to deliver its policy. The National Farmers’ Federation released its own drought plan late yesterday, after repeated calls to plan for the future. From Sarah Martin: Under the policy, the NFF framework proposes that industry, community groups and the three tiers of government all work together in developing a drought strategy. This would identify specific drought measures that need to be maintained, amended or reviewed; and to propose new drought measures, build on the Coag national drought agreement and incorporate lessons learned from past droughts, create a drought forum and establish a drought committee. “While this national drought policy comes too late to help those managing this drought, the NFF is determined to see that we don’t find ourselves, once again, without a plan for drought,” the NFF’s Fiona Simson said. “We continue to consult with the government about further measures to assist farmers during this drought, including recommendations for commonwealth support for local government rate relief.” David Littleproud, speaking to the ABC this morning, says the government “already has” a drought strategy. “Our response has been one of being responsive to the situation,” he said. This is not an issue that is going anywhere. And it is only going to get bigger, with no rains in sight. We’ll bring you that, as well everything else that happens today. Mike Bowers is, as always, up and about, cameras in hand, while Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp will also be burrowing away on stories. You’ll catch me on the socials, and, when I get a chance, in the comments. And of course, the coffee line. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "headline": "Humpback whales recorded using huge fins to forage",
          "bodyText": "Humpback whales have been captured on film herding shoals of fish into their cavernous mouths with their oversized pectoral fins. Marine biologists recorded the extraordinary feeding behaviour for the first time off the coast of Alaska, where the whales lurk around salmon hatcheries that release juvenile fish into the sea. Humpbacks are known to corral fish into meal-sized shoals by surrounding them in streams of bubbles released from their blowholes. But the footage shows that some have taken their foraging methods to another level. In footage recorded off Baranof Island in south-east Alaska, whales corral young salmon in “bubble nets”, then rise up from beneath and swish the fish into their mouths with elaborate movements of their pectoral fins. “The first time I saw this behaviour it was from boat level and it looked chaotic,” said Madison Kosma at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. “But when I got a bird’s eye view with a drone, I was ecstatic. It wasn’t chaotic, it was actually graceful, intentional and calculated.” Humpback whales have exceptionally long pectoral fins. Though slender, the flippers can reach to a third of their body length, making them up to 5 metres (16ft) long in adult whales. The fins are primarily used for manoeuvring and providing sudden bursts of acceleration. When a humpback lunges at a shoal of fish, the whale’s baleen, a large comb-like filter in its mouth, sieves the food from the inrush of water. Kosma noticed the whales’ unusual feeding strategy while working for a master’s degree. Fascinated and perplexed by what she had seen, she got hold of a small video camera and strapped it to a pole with cable ties. With this she recorded some of the first footage of the whales using their pectoral fins to round up and capture prey. She later saved up to buy a drone and recorded from directly above the feeding whales. Analysis of the footage revealed that the whales used their pectoral fins in at least two ways. During “horizontal pectoral herding”, the whale creates a bubble net around the fish it is hunting and then rises up at an angle, using one pectoral fin to swish the fish into its mouth. In “vertical pectoral herding”, the whale again creates a bubble net but then lunges at the shoal from beneath with its fins pushed upwards. The light colouring of the insides of the fins may scare the prey into the dark refuge of the whale’s mouth, the scientists believe. Writing in the journal Royal Society Open Science, the researchers explain how the herding strategy may make feeding more efficient by squeezing more prey into the volume of water the whales take in. “We believe that the whales are getting more bang for their buck by using pectoral herding techniques,” Kosma said. Further studies in other parts of the world are needed to confirm whether the trick has been learned by whales elsewhere, she said."

          "bodyText": "And on that note, we are going to call it a night. A big thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin. They’ll be back tomorrow, with more of the 46th parliament’s fun and games (yes, our fun radar is very low). And of course, to you, for making it all worthwhile. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning, but you can catch me on the socials, if you have a burning issue. In the meantime though – take care of you. Meanwhile, this just happened: On the leaks from the right caucus, Joel Fitzgibbon tells Patricia Karvelas that he would never stop debate in the Labor party and it is “no skin off my nose”. Despite multiple attempts from PK, Fitzgibbon does not concede that his 28% emissions reduction target idea is dead, and just says the discussions within Labor will continue. The government is also calling for a do-over on the vote it messed up overnight. The government in the House rejected the amended legislation (the sunset clause on the police powers at airports bill that Rex Patrick had inserted – and won) so it has sent the bill back to the Senate. Obviously the government will have made sure it has the numbers for this now. Honestly, I wish I could have a do-over this easily. I have new ideas about how to ruin my life and I’d like to see how they play out. On the emissions target debate, Joel Fitzgibbon says he posed the question that Labor match the government target to highlight that Scott Morrison is “telling porkies” over the government meeting its target “in a canter”. He says he doesn’t regret raising those questions because he wants the focus to be on Morrison and the government. But he acknowledges that there have been “various views” from his colleagues over his intervention. Meanwhile, remember this story from Helen Davidson? The Morrison government is sitting on a major review it commissioned last year to explore better ways of resettling humanitarian migrants in Australia. The review into integration, employment, and settlement outcomes for refugees and humanitarian entrants, was led by Prof Peter Shergold, the former secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, now coordinator general of refugee resettlement in NSW. Guardian Australia understands the final report was delivered to government in February but the immigration minister, David Coleman, does not intend to release it until the end of this year, when it’s expected to be published along with the government’s response. The government has repeatedly refused requests for both the report and for an explanation of why it hasn’t been released.” The Senate just passed a motion demanding the government produce it. On whether or not he believes there is a climate emergency, Joel Fitzgibbon says yes, and that is the terminology which has been used by other nations, including the UK. He says he supports it. But he says that what he has been arguing is that Labor needs to get “the focus on him”, meaning Scott Morrison, and ensuring that Morrison does the things that he says he is going to do. Joel Fitzgibbon says Labor offered the government a “blank cheque” to support drought-stricken communities (as in Labor will support any motion) but the government hasn’t taken it up on the offer. Joel Fitzgibbon tells Patricia Karvelas on ABC radio that the government has been promising it would build dams for six years “and is yet to break ground”. He says the government didn’t mention that 25% of its 50% commitment was in concessional loans, and that the states haven’t agreed because they don’t have the money to match the funding. Given all the dam debate in the parliament this week, this story from AAP is interesting: Queensland’s Natural Resources Minister says the federal government has him feeling like a jilted teenager over dams. Minister Anthony Lynham says the state government has made $872 million worth of promises for water projects across the drought stricken state. Dr Lynham said the government has applied for $95 million through a Commonwealth development fund for projects including at Wamuran, Theodore, Bungunya, Lockyer Valley and at the Lower Burdekin - with little success. “We have had more knockbacks than I had as a teenager,” Dr Lynham told parliament on Tuesday. “We have not seen a brass razoo for Rookwood (Weir) from the LNP.” Politics and sport. You do the rest. This will be good: Labor just managed to pass this amendment to a motion in the Senate (the bit in bold) Senator Ciccone : To move—That the Senate— (a) notes that: (i) after six years under this Liberal-National Government’s watch, from 1 July 2014 to 19 31 August 2019: (A) 95,943 people have come through Australia’s airports and sought asylum, as is their right to do, and (B) in nearly the same period, bridging visas have blown out from 94,000 to almost 230,000 - an increase of over 140%, (ii) of the protection visa applications decided by the Department of Home Affairs in that period, 62,732 - 84.2% - were rejected, (iii) those waiting in Australia on a bridging visa as their claims for asylum are assessed are often being exploited and trafficked by labour hire companies and criminal syndicates, (iv) stakeholders have expressed concern as racketeering around visas and asylum applications have been allowed to flourish, (v) the Assistant Minister for Customs, Community Safety and Multicultural Affairs, Mr Wood, remarked on the blowout of airplane arrivals and stated ‘Organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies are using this loophole...’, and (vi) the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton, stated that: ‘...If you cannot control your borders, you cannot govern the country’; and (b) condemns the Morrison Government and the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Dutton, for losing control of Australia’s borders and allowing exploitation, slavery and trafficking to go unchecked, having a devastating impact on workers and their families, and the ability to do basic mathematics and provide accurate data to the Senate on the number of people who have been trafficked to Australia under their watch. The Red Meat Council has put out the free lunch klaxton for tomorrow. Turns out they are a brisket crowd. (Archer fans will get the joke.) In the midst of all of that is this nice little alert from DPS: The official portrait of Ms Nova Peris OAM, the first Aboriginal woman to become a federal parliamentarian and Senator, will be unveiled at Australian Parliament House, Canberra on Wednesday 16 October 2019. The Department of Parliamentary Services commissioned the portrait for Parliament’s Historic Memorials Collection. The portrait was created by Dr Jandamarra Cadd, a Yorta Yorta and Dja Dja Warung descendant. This is Dr Cadd’s first portrait for the Historic Memorials Collection and he is also the first Indigenous artist to paint a portrait for the Collection. Dr Cadd has been a finalist in several prestigious portrait competitions and his work is held in a number of collections. He is a graduate of Deakin University and holds an Honorary Doctorate in Creative Industries from Central Queensland University. The Historic Memorials Collection is Australia’s longest-running art commissioning program. Founded by Prime Minister Andrew Fisher in 1911, the collection has commissioned portraits of the Head of State, Governors-General, Prime Ministers, Speakers and Presidents for more than a century. Meanwhile, over in the Senate, a Greens motion to ban any new thermal coal mines in Tasmania failed. Ayes - 8 Noes - 47 (Which means Labor voted against it) The attempt to suspend standing orders to move a climate emergency declaration has been lost. Ayes 65 Noes 72 There was a division a little earlier, that caught Greg Hunt on the hop: Anne Aly meanwhile, had a lot to say: Labor, the Greens and the crossbench (except Bob Katter I would assume) are calling for the climate emergency declaration. The government is not. Zali Steggall says she is disappointed listening to the government submissions, and if the government “accepts the science that we need to reduce emissions, then it has to accept the science that is saying we are not doing enough”. “If the science is telling you have to do more, then you have to adjust,” she said, adding that is not a failure – it’s just a normal response. Adam Bandt is moving the crossbench climate emergency motion in the House right now. He is moving to suspend standing orders to debate it this afternoon. (It will fail, with the government (obviously) not on board.) Over in the Senate and Kristina Keneally was having a little dig at Peter Dutton for not answering questions on notice. Dutton has so far not lodged answers for questions asking for details about the breakdown of country of the arrivals, where in Australia they are, or what actions he has taken to address these surges from countries such as Malaysia and China. Question on Notice 382 – asked on 12 August 2019 – 35 days overdue Question on Notice 698 – asked on 13 September 2019 – 3 days overdue Also, we do this over Twitter now too. From Mike Bowers’ lens to your eyeballs: And on a nice note: Because it is only “radicals” who care about the climate, apparently. #owningtheleft Tony Burke jumps up to congratulate Tony Smith on the integrity award he received today (have a look a few posts down and check out Kenneth Hayne’s speech) and thanks him for some of the difficult decisions he took during the medevac debate (you may remember that Smith stuck to the parliament rules, and ensured the parliament had a vote, and also ordered the solicitor general advice Christian Porter was relying on to shut down the debate, be tabled – which revealed the advice was not iron-clad). Scott Morrison then gets up to add his congratulations, and a few in Labor respond with “now you think about it” to which Morrison gets very upset and accuses Labor of politicising the moment. It’s like divorced parents fighting over a speech at wedding. So, I guess, congratulations Tony Smith? Scott Morrison, the folders having been stacked, calls an end to whatever the hell this last hour was. We bring Angus Taylor back for a lickspittle on the 70th anniversary of the Snowy Hydro, which the Rhodes scholar (don’t you know) attempts to link to the 75th anniversary of the Liberal party. Taylor: He is right, this week does mark the 70th anniversary of the Snowy Hydro scheme and it is a great time to reflect on that iconic engineering feat and its long history in serving our nation. Indeed, this week we are also celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Liberal party and it is important to note that the snowy scheme is just another incredible achievement of Liberal government. This is TOO far for Anthony Albanese: Ben Chifley was no Tory. You opposed it, your lot. #goodjobAngus Amanda Rishworth to Scott Morrison: My question is to the prime minister. Why won’t the prime minister admit childcare fees have increased by 30% under his three-term government? Morrison: I will invite the minister for education to add to this answer, but on this matter, as minister for social services, which had responsibility for childcare at the time, it was actually our government that introduced a package to childcare, which those opposite when they were in government and those opposite when they were in opposition failed to deliver. And that is ensuring the people particularly on low and middle incomes are getting access to up to 85% rebates, 85% rebates, and our government and we got rid of the caps that were applied to those seeking childcare rebates that had previously seen them run out of childcare support by about February and March of every year. We took action to address the manifold issues in the childcare system that turn into a money pit from what was designed under those opposite when they were in government and I invite the minister for education to add further. Dan Tehan: And thanks prime minister, because it pretty much covered it all. (“Dill, dill, dill,” yells Labor.) Tehan finishes his non-answer with “and, prime minister, I commend you for what you did because you have put this sector on the right path”, which just leads to a chorus of “get a room” from the opposition. Phil Thompson, who can’t be taken seriously, given his preference for tomato sauce on bacon and egg rolls (I mean honestly – and for this to come from a Queenslander as well is a knife to my hot sauce heart) invokes Peter Dutton for the HOW SAFE ARE YOU troika of minutes. VERY SAFE. BUT JUST IMAGINE HOW UNSAFE YOU WOULD BE IF LABOR WAS IN POWER. “You’re the government you dill,” someone from Labor yells. There seems to be some who are yet to get the memo. I mean, they could just check their salaries. That’s one hint, if the side of the chamber they sit on isn’t enough of a clue. It’s such a mishmash of a QT that even Shayne Neumann gets a question. My question is to the prime minister. Why does he claim the government has a drought policy, when the National Farmers Federation president says it doesn’t. Michael McCormack gives his best impression of having a personality and tries to interject with something, but no one is buying it. “Throw him out,” the Labor benches holler. He stays and I’m pretty sure I saw a fairy die. Scott Morrison: I thank the member for ... his question because it gives me an opportunity to point out exactly what the National Farmers Federation has presented to me on these issues. The National Farmers Federation has been extremely supportive of the government’s response to the drought. They said as much and last night at the 40th anniversary of the National Farmers Federation, I’m not sure whether the member was attending that night, I thank those members from around the chamber, including from the opposite side, that were attending. The National Farmers Federation and the president was very clear about the appreciation they had for the extensive and comprehensive response that has been provided to the drought by the government in concert with the state and territory governments, where they are affected. The point the National Farmers Federation has been making about the issue they have raised is about an agreement they would like to see, between all the states and territories, with the commonwealth, common standards and triggers for the activation of state-based drought response. That is what they are seeking, and that is what is currently not in place. After the drought summit last year we have put in a reformed national agreement on drought, which added to the original agreement which made it clear states and territories were responsible for the initiatives that went directly to the welfare of animals, that is the fodder and support for the animals themselves. The commonwealth government was responsible for the direct assistance, income support for the farmers and graziers. That’s what the agreement was reached at the end of last year. What they would like to see is a common set of standards, and triggers and policies by state governments. There has not been the response from the state and territory governments to move to that level of standardisation on the drought responses. They believe they would like to keep complete autonomy about how they customise their response to the drought in their jurisdictions. That’s a matter for them. They are sovereign, they have constitutional authority for these matters, that’s what they would like to see, I understand why the National Farmers Federation would like to see greater consistency across these areas, that is a matter I have undertaken to work with them to see what such a common standard might look like. At the end of the day we have to respect the autonomy of each of the state governments to deal with the issues they present at the end of the day. I thank the member for this opportunity to make the issues crystal-clear. Meanwhile, in the Senate: Tony Burke raises a point on the unparliamentary language. The way Scott Morrison pronounced ‘dill’, you get the feeling that ‘dill’ wasn’t originally the ‘d’ word he was reaching for. Tony Smith warns against the unparliamentary language, and says that if the government keeps doing it, then both sides will get to use it. “Bring it on,” says someone from the government benches, because this is now apparently a schoolyard. But with less cool kids. Joel Fitzgibbon to Scott Morrison: When will the prime minister admit his Future Drought Fund hasn’t delivered and will never deliver one cent directly to desperate farming families. Morrison: Mr Speaker, the question that has just been posed by the member for Hunter once again demonstrates his complete lack of understanding of the policy issues that that fund is seeking to address. The drought fund, which he opposed from the day I first announced it at the drought summit, which he attended, and we were pleased for him to attend, on the very day he was speaking against it, he sought to have it frustrated even in this place, the national drought fund which begins at $3.9bn investment, over the course of the decade will grow to $5bn, from 1 July next year, it will draw down $100m to invest in water infrastructure resilience projects from the 1 July of next year. That’s what we said the purpose of the drought fund was, it will draw down on investment from 1 July next year as we put it in place and we seek the advice of the board. The $300m we spent last year on infrastructure and farm household allowance projects, and support, I have already explained to him once. He is interjecting again. The drought fund, the Future Drought Fund, is not to provide direct financial assistance payment to farmers, it’s there to provide direct support for water resilience projects, to fund for the future. If the member for Hunter doesn’t think it’s a good idea to invest in water resilience for the future of Australian agriculture, he should leave the post of spokesman on agriculture immediately because he doesn’t understand one of the most fundamental elements of agriculture in this country, which is you have to provide water! When there is a drought, it means there is no water, therefore you need to provide storage facilities... Fitzgibbon is getting in trouble for his interjections, and Michael McCormack takes the opportunity to make a joke, because David Littleproud acts like it is the funniest thing he has ever heard. I mean, I know the Nationals party room isn’t the most supportive of rooms, but there has to be limits. Morrison: If he took the time to understand what the Future Drought Fund was for, rather than seek to pay petty politics with this, he might understand that funder is there to provide for future water resilience. What doing on farmhouse allowance in rural financial counsellors and support for mental health, to do everything from on-farm water infrastructure, whether it is to increase allowances for silage investments, or on-farm water infrastructure projects to farmers doing it themselves, or the water we are putting into counsellors to make sure they are keeping local community supported through the drought, or the more than $50m we have directly put into charitable organisations like the Salvos and Vinnies, this is a comprehensive response. I would appeal to the member for Hunter to support the government initiatives reaching out to farmers and stop being such a dill. Labor’s Louise Pratt is testing the minister for youth, aged care and sport, Richard Colbeck, by asking if youth underemployment has risen from 12 to 20%. Colbeck pauses to thumb through his brief, Pratt gives him a few moments but then starts up with cries of “where’s that brief” and “it’d be under U for underemployment”. Colbeck finds some pre-canned lines about 1.4m jobs created in the last 12 months, more than 100,000 of which were for young people. By this stage Anthony Chisholm and Murray Watt had started heckling about “Johnno” [Jonathon Duniam] not having to wait long for elevation to the ministry because “they’ll need another Tasmanian”. When he gets through an answer, Labor applauds, which was ruled disorderly. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Why won’t the prime minister be upfront with the Australian people? About the slowest economic growth in a decade, the fact the OECD has lashed Australia’s growth outlook by twice as much as the G20 average, declining productivity and the fact that net debt has more than doubled on his watch? Morrison: Australia’s economic growth is the second highest in the G7, Mr Speaker. 1.4 million jobs have been created under the stewardship of this government. In fact, today there are more people who are employed as a share of Australia’s total population than at any other time in Australia’s history. Now, only the Labor party could find a problem with that. And that is why we took the strong economic plan we did to the election and it was a complete contrast to the plan that was taken by those opposite. What we took was a plan to lower taxes, to ensure that we are cutting the cost of doing business in this country, that we are investing in the skills needs of the future of this country, that we are expanding their horizons of our economy by both supporting our traditional industries and developing new export markets and that we are investing in the infrastructure that Australia needs to grow. That is what we are doing, that is what we talked of to the Australian people. Those opposite offered a very different plan. Those opposite took a plan which was going to impose $387bn of higher taxes on the Australian economy. How they thought that that was going to actually support Australia’s growth into the future was a mystery to Australians and they rightfully rejected those policies at the ballot box. And so there is a clear alternative. It is a clear choice as we have continued to demonstrate and that is the sound, stable and certain policies – not getting riled up, not getting spooked by the international conditions we are faced with, but ensuring we protect budget resilience that enables us to meet the challenges ahead. The shadow treasurer would have us blow the budget on reckless spending. The shadow treasurer would have us blow the budget of individual Australians and their families by putting up their taxes. The shadow treasurer, who knows what his position is on the climate reduction targets? There is a climate fight club going on over the other side. The thing they have forgotten about climate fight club is you are not supposed to talk about it. They can’t help talking about it. We have support for the 28 position over here from the member for Hunter, we have the, for the 28, but I am not sure if I’m for 45% from the climate change spokesperson, the minute is hidden – like the member for Sydney and the leader of the opposition who wants to come into this place and effectively engage in a protest and glue his hands to the dispatch box, with his latest today, which I know would see the full banning of coalmining in Australia. Melissa Price gets a lickspittle for the first time in a while. “Manufacturing in this country is alive and well,” Price says. Scott Morrison nods along. He actually hasn’t stopped watching her deliver the dixer answer. It’s like a teacher watching a recalcitrant student do a make up oral exam. Catherine King to Scott Morrison: Why won’t the prime minister admit to this table from his own minister by the department shows that not a single project under the urban congestion fund announced over 18 months ago has actually commenced? Not one. Alan Tudge takes it. (sigh) Can I thank the member for Ballarat for her question, and what I can confirm is that we have 130 projects under way right now as we speak, supporting thousands of people across the country in work, across the country. On top of that, we have 280 major projects under way as we speak. If I can find the list, I could go through them one after another after another of those projects, which are well under way. “You sound like Bruce McAvaney,” yells Ed Husic. “So many projects, I’ll name them all.” “Name them in alphabetical order,” someone else yells. (The joke being he is not naming the projects.) Tudge continues: On top of the 130 major projects which we have under way, we also have 166 smaller scale urban congestion front projects which we announced before the election of which we are working in close consultation with state governments to get them going and the first ones will begin at the end of this year. I just remembered, I just mentioned ones in Brisbane which will begin at the beginning of next year. She asked me again what about projects which haven’t started. Mr Speaker, there are two projects which haven’t started. The one I mentioned last time is the East West Link. That is one we do want to get under way. We have $4bn on the table to get this started. The Labor party constantly said bring forward projects, get them done. There is a project with $4bn ready to go and if only the leader of the opposition, the member for Ballarat would pick up the phone to her state counterparts and just say, let’s get the job going! And the other one which I know is also strongly supported over in Western Australia is the railway project. Another project which we would like to see delivered. The other not being delivered but our other projects absolutely are getting under way, delivering on our agenda, 166 smaller scale projects which we are negotiating with state governments, getting the job done and they will begin at the end of this year. Alan Tudge is taking a lickspittle and I’m suddenly reminded of those old school end of transmission broadcasts I’ve seen on YouTube. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Why do the prime minister’s talking points make no reference to the 1.9 million Australians looking for a job or for more work, the worst wages growth on record, weak household consumption and retail spending. The worst household savings rate in a decade? Morrison: I’m very pleased the member made reference to the talking points. I suspect we might want to make a habit of issuing these on a weekly basis because it was the first time I had seen our policies faithfully recorded in some publications for some period of time. (It’s us. He’s talking about us. OH THE HILARITY.) There’s a lot about tax after this. Josh Frydenberg, who has once again forgotten HOW MICROPHONES wOrK, is doing his best to explain that the economy is JUST FINE. Somehow, the people who are not in government are still very relevant here. Andrew Wilkie has the independent’s question today – and it’s to Angus Taylor: The government claims Australia will meet its Paris agreement targets at a canter. The truth is the government is relying on accounting tricks to meet the targets, by counting artificially inflated credits left over from the Kyoto protocol, credits most developed countries have agreed to reject. Official government figures show emissions have reached record highs and continue to rise, feeding the climate emergency, the effects we are seeing in our backyard with the drought and fires. Our planet is cooking while the government cooks the books. Minister, why the denial and when will the government take real action to reduce emissions? Taylor starts talking about how Australia will meet its targets, without addressing the Kyoto issue. “Literally no one believes you,” calls out someone from Labor. Even the government benches seem to have given up on this one. There is barely a hear, hear to be heard. Anthony Albanese is asking to table the prime minister’s media release – which shows the government has offered 50/50 funding contributions for dams, without mentioning that 25% of those contributions will be concessional loans – but the request is denied. Anthony Albanese is back with a question for Scott Morrison, asking again why he is raising hopes and claiming the federal government is funding a new dam 50%, when it is only 25% (25% funding and 25% concessional loans). Morrison: I refer again to my answer. I was very clear, our 50-50... Our contribution is comprised half of grant and half of concessional finance. That is the commitment we made and we set out on Sunday. I refer the members opposite to the statements that have been made about this. We were very upfront. I’m pleased the New South Wales premier was so pleased to receive the support because it was a month ago, we sat down, the deputy prime minister and I with the deputy premier and the premier of NSW to see how we could fast track important water infrastructure projects in NSW. I was very pleased to get that collaboration and cooperation and the urgency the NSW premier was going to bring to this task, not only to bring their resources to the project, but their commitment to blast away the bureaucracy and congestion to prevent those projects going ahead. We are happy to partner in the way we have, took a $75m commitment to one of those projects to $280m indirect grant assistance, a very significant increase on the commitment we have made for important water infrastructure. Now that the man has finished telling us how wonderful women are, we move on. Michael McCormack has Michael McCormacked his way into this dixer. It’s meant to be about the role of rural and regional women, but he manages to Michael McCormack it from the first line. I thank the member for Mallee for her question and acknowledge that she is one of those fine women and there are many in the house, appreciate many on this side... M E R I T Terri Butler has a question for Scott Morrison, on dams, but he does not have an answer for the specific question. He has an answer for the question he wanted to be asked – why are Labor state governments standing in the way of dams. We’ve had our first lickspittle and it’s about just how amazing is this government and are there any alternative views. It’s a great government, thanks for asking. Also, Labor is terrible. I am paraphrasing, but you know. It’s the mood. I have obviously pissed off the technology gods because OMG this has been a drama. But we are back and running. Question time has begun with a question focusing on asbestos victims and it has got angry very, very fast. In case you can’t read that tweet, here is the text: That the House: 1. notes that: a. climate change is a significant threat to our economy, natural environment, farming communities and national security; b. Australia’s annual emissions have been rising in recent years; c. as a global problem, the solution to climate change requires concerted international cooperation to limit the production of greenhouse gasses; d. as the only global agreement designed to address climate change, the Paris Accords must play a central role in addressing climate change; e. the Paris Accords require signatory countries to deliver actions consistent with keeping the global temperature rise this century to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius; f. based on the latest scientific advice, the world is currently on track for warming of above 3 degrees, and efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions need to be strengthened to avoid catastrophic climate change impacts; and g. as a result of the threat posed by climate change, the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Portugal, Argentina and the Republic of Ireland have declared a climate emergency; and 2. therefore, the House affirms that: a. Australia remains committed to delivering on its obligations under the Paris Accords; b. failing to meet the goals of the Paris Accords would have unprecedented and devastating environmental, economic, societal and health impacts for Australia; and the threat posed by climate change on the future prosperity and security of Australia and the globe constitutes a climate change emergency. Despite appearances, this is not a mugshot: And the motion itself is here: Looks like Jim Chalmers has found one of the question time attack lines: In its latest Board minutes, the Reserve Bank of Australia has confirmed what Australians know but the Government will not acknowledge: Australia’s economic growth is the lowest in a decade, wages are stagnant, and employment is fragile. The Reserve Bank has highlighted that “Year-ended growth had slowed to 1.4 per cent, the lowest outcome in a decade” and that “employment growth was forecast to slow over the period ahead.” Collapsing confidence and weak growth are the inevitable consequence of a Liberal Government which has a political strategy but not an economic policy. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have recklessly left the Reserve Bank to do all the heavy lifting in the face of worsening home-grown economic challenges and increasing global risks. Right when Australians need and expect a plan from the Morrison Government to get the economy going again all they get instead is finger-pointing, blame-shifting and wedge politics. It is time Josh Frydenberg and Scott Morrison brought forward a budget update to fix their forecasts and properly outline an economic plan that supports the floundering economy and better safeguards Australians from global turbulence. And yup, as we reported a bit earlier, the Greens’ climate emergency hot air balloon, which was technically against Casa rules, was able to be inflated (but not really get off the ground) because it was outside the authorised assembly area – and therefore outside of the parliament precinct rules. Just a point of order there – Labor will be moving its own climate emergency motion. The Greens have responded to Labor’s announcement it will move a climate emergency motion: The Australian Greens welcome Labor announcing that they support the Greens-led crossbench Climate Emergency Declaration, said Leader of the Australian Greens Dr Richard Di Natale and Greens Climate Change Spokesperson Adam Bandt MP. “It’s great to hear the Labor Party’s announcement today that they support the Greens-led Crossbench Climate Emergency Declaration,” Di Natale said. “I know that there are ongoing divisions within Labor regarding taking strong action on climate change, so it is heartening to see them publicly joining the Greens and the community in support of a climate emergency declaration.” “With Labor coming onboard and joining the Greens and the crossbench, there is now a very real chance that Parliament will declare a climate emergency before the end of the year,” Bandt said. “Now it’s time for Liberal members to decide which side they’re on and go on the record. History will judge them for how they vote on the climate emergency.” Back in the chamber, the crimes legislation amendment (sexual crimes against children and community protection measures) is being debated. Labor wants to move this amendment to the legislation: Kenneth Hayne finished with this: To take any step of that kind will require honesty and courage. It will take honesty to recognise that there may be a problem and courage to devise means for dealing with it. It will take honesty to recognise that slogans may sell, they do not persuade. It will take courage to recognise that slogans sell by appealing to emotion not thought or reason. It will take courage to engage with facts and issues knowing that their depth and breadth cannot be reduced to, or explained by, a series of sound bites that capture a single 24 hour news cycle. It will take courage, in the world as we now know it, to engage with facts and issues rather than pursue the path to populism. Honesty and courage are needed if we are to maintain trust in our institutions. Maintaining trust may require the legislature to explain better than it now does what policy choices are made in the law it enacts and why they were made as they were. If trust has been lost or has been damaged, we can hope to repair it only through qualities of the kind we celebrate with the awards that are made today. And central to the criteria for those awards are what I earlier called standards of eloquent simplicity: honesty and courage. Kenneth Hayne: If you seek a model of the kind of argument I have in mind, go back and look at the submissions that were made to Cabinet in 1965 and again in 1967 about what was to become the Constitutional Alteration (Aboriginals) Act 1967. Those submissions laid out in elaborate detail the arguments for holding a referendum to amend constitutional provisions referring to Aboriginal Australians. And the submissions identified the arguments that were later placed before the voters before the referendum which so decisively made the amendments to s 51(xxvi) and s 127 of the Constitution. We readily accept that electors should not be asked to consider constitutional amendment without articulation of the arguments for and against the proposal. Are we at a point where we need to think again about how we are recording and publishing why policy choices embodied and reflected in legislation were made as they were? We have long required judges to state their reasons for decision. More and more we require administrative decision makers to give reasons for decision. Are there some analogous steps that the political branches of government, and in particular the legislative branch, should consider taking? Kenneth Hayne continued: Notice that I divide the issues in three: how policy is formed; how the policy that is formed is explained and justified; and how the policy is being applied. Development of policy is almost always very hard. It is hard because, much more often than not, there are competing considerations pulling in diametrically opposed directions. And because there are competing considerations, choices must be made. Yet it remains an essential role of government to explain to the governed why it takes the steps it does. It is essential because, if governments do not do this, trust in the institutions of government is damaged or destroyed. Explanation is often difficult. It is difficult because spelling out an argument simply and persuasively is hard. And it is all too easy to treat simplicity and persuasion as demanding reduction of the argument to some conclusory proposition cast in terms that appeal to or rely upon universally desired objectives like a strong economy, supporting the family, or keeping the nation safe. There cannot be a hint of criticism about pursuing those objectives but demonstrating how a particular measure supports the objective demands more than bare assertion. There is always an intermediate step which connects the measure in question with the desired end. Identifying and explaining how a measure contributes to achieving an end like “strong economy”, “supporting the family” or “keeping the nation safe” is no easy task. Not only is it not an easy task, it demands honesty and courage. It demands those qualities because it demands honest acknowledgment of choice and the courage to lay out, for the world to examine and criticise, the argument that supports the conclusion that was reached. Kenneth Hayne, the former high court justice and royal commissioner to the banking royal commission, presented the awards to both Cathy McGowan and Tony Smith today. In doing so, he made a speech about the trust in institutions, and how the recent increased calls for royal commissions may be a symptom of that. Hayne: If I am right to think that trust in institutions has been damaged or destroyed, we must consider what the increasingly frequent calls for royal commissions are telling us about the state of our democratic institutions. Has trust in the political processes been damaged? If it has, what can we do about it? No doubt individual actors in those processes must have the courage to act and continue to act with complete integrity. Individual integrity is essential for maintaining, or (if restoration is needed) restoring, trust. But it is necessary to ask whether some additional measures may be desirable, even necessary, to maintain or restore trust. More particularly, do we need to examine more closely the ways in which policy is formed, explained and then given effect? Centre Alliance’s Rebekha Sharkie supported that motion. Once the matter of public importance is done later this afternoon, the division will occur. Here is the motion Andrew Wilkie wants to move: That the House of Representatives calls on the Australian government to establish a royal commission to inquire into and report on the Australian casino industry, with particular reference to: Allegations of Crown casino’s links to organised domestic and foreign crime, money laundering, tampering with poker machines, domestic violence and drug trafficking, including but not limited to: the allegations concerning Crown, raised by the Member for Denison in the House of Representatives on 18 October 2017; the Member for Clark’s referral of the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, and Victoria police, to the Victorian Independent Broad-based Anti-Corruption Commission on 24 July 2019; reports by Nine newspapers and 60 Minutes in July 2019 concerning alleged criminal activity involving Crown; the Member for Clark’s referral of the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation to the Victorian Ombudsman on 13 August 2019; the Member for Clark’s referral of Crown Perth to the Premier of Western Australia on 19 September 2019; the allegations of criminal activity provided by a driver formerly associated with Crown revealed by the Member for Clark in the House of Representatives on 30 July 2019, and again during a media event yesterday, including the failure to process inbound and outbound flights and passengers; the evidence of money laundering at Crown revealed by the ABC and the Member for Clark today; the response to these allegations, including the possibility of criminality, by relevant state and federal agencies including but not limited to the Victorian Commission for Gambling and Liquor Regulation, Victoria Police, the Australian Federal Police, Border Force and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre; the conduct of people associated directly with Crown, including the possibility of criminality and corruption; and the conduct of serving and former politicians and party officials especially relevant to Crown, including the possibility of criminality or corruption. the performance of relevant federal agencies regarding the operation of Australian casinos generally including but not limited to the Australian Federal Police, Border Force and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre. the conduct of Australian casino owners, board members and staff generally; the conduct of serving and former politicians and party officials regarding Australian casinos generally; and any related matters. Andrew Wilkie’s motion has been delayed until later in the session. *I misheard that and originally thought it failed on the voices, so apologies. In the Senate, the Greens will also be moving some motions, including Mehreen Faruqi’s motion calling for an inquiry into truth in electoral advertising (along with a petition on the same issue with 35,00 signatures) “We know the last election was riddled with false or misleading advertising which eroded public trust in our democracy. I’m proud to table this petition of tens of thousands of Australians demanding this problem be fixed once and for all,” she said. “People are really concerned about the total lack of accountability for the scare campaigns run by political parties. They are sick and tired of politicians openly lying to voters with no consequences.” The Greens will also be looking to move a motion calling on the government to review the Commonwealth rental assistance rate, after the productivity commission report into low income renters. Stepping outside of the parliament for a moment - former Indi MP Cathy McGowan has just been awarded an integrity award. The Accountability Round Table (ART), which aims to improve accountability and transparency in the nation’s parliaments, awarded McGowan the Alan Missen award for her “commitments to reforms” which were seen as “essential for open, accountable and transparent government”. “We recognise her commitment to those in her electorate, and her embrace of significant issues crucial to Australia’s parliamentary democracy, in particular her work on the National Integrity Commission and parliamentary standards bills,” ART chair Fiona McLeod said. Speaker Tony Smith was presented the John Button award for being “an outstanding example of an independent/non-partisan speaker in the finest traditions of the office, and has done much to restore its standing in recent years”. Over in the House, Andrew Wilkie has kicked off proceedings by attempting to move a motion to have a royal commission into Crown Casino. The government isn’t supporting it, so we are heading to a division (which will be lost on the numbers, even if Labor supports it). The bells are ringing for the beginning of the parliament session. This is what doom sounds like. Anthony Albanese: We’ll continue to hold the government to account in question time. It’s important that the Prime Minister can’t just walk away from questions. We asked a simple question that’s about his evasion, nothing else, about his evasion of whether he sought to have Brian Houston invited to the White House. How is it that the Prime Minister thinks he can get away with saying, ‘Oh, that’s just a report in the newspaper?’ The question is, is it true or not? The question is why is this Prime Minister, when he’s asked questions, responding with, ‘Oh, that’s just in the bubble,’ or other prevarications, which are all designed to avoid scrutiny? Well, our job, as the opposition, is to hold the government to account and we’ll continue to do just that. Anthony Albanese is holding his press conference on the climate emergency motion. He says Scott Morrison is “all rhethoric...when it comes to substance, he gets caught out that he is loose with the truth”. [National debt] has doubled on this government’s watch. Household debt is the highest it’s ever been. When it comes to productivity, it’s gone backwards, fourth quarters in a row. When it comes to growth, the OECD has downgraded Australia’s growth predictions by more than it’s downgraded the UK, which is going through Brexit. Interest rates are at 0.75%. When they were at 3%, the Coalition was saying that was emergency levels. That’s a sign of no confidence in this government’s capacity to stimulate the economy.” The government’s climate policy is another example of that, Albanese says. Seems like Labor has settled on some sort of climate policy. Pauline Hanson on her ‘legislation strike’ (speaking to Sky News): I said on critical, non-critical legislation, which I haven’t. And I think it’s very important that we do have security at the airports, which I did support that last night about the amendment that was put up by Rex Patrick. So I said I will look at it. But as far as I’m concerned, I’m not interested in looking at legislation. This is important. I’ve got people here that ... suicide. They’re going under. This is an industry that we have to, I’ve got to take a stand on this, the government’s not doing anything about it, the National Party have done nothing about it. Labor will talk no action, the role, you know, full of BS, as far as I’m concerned, do something about it. I’m sick of hearing that we’re giving money there. Scott Morrison comes out and says we’ve put $318.5 million into the industry. He’s just giving $150 million to NASA. So he’s quite prepared to send the, you know, the astronauts into into space, and then meantime they come here and he is sending our cows to heaven. Update from the Labor caucus meeting: Save the Children Australia acting CEO Mat Tinkler and Kamalle Dabboussy, spokesperson for the 60-plus Australian children and women trapped in al-Hawl camp in north-east Syria, just held a doorstop about what is happening in the region “and the closing window of opportunity for repatriation”. Dabboussy’s daughter is one of those. I think there’s a great concern as to how the situation may change on the ground. As I said, it’s very difficult to predict what happens next in the Middle East and this region of the world. Part of the issue that we have a concern is not only who will take control, but the process between now and when they take control. There’ll be a period of lawlessness, areas where people are not being patrolled or supported, and in that environment you will have ISIS sleeper cells and radicalised women in the camp and they in turn may take action. Remember the Australian women have all been deemed as apostates or non-radicalised women who don’t believe in the ISIS ideology, and their ideology allows them to be killed as a result. So they are open and vulnerable at this point in time. Without sounding too brutal, obviously knowing your own personal family situation, but are these people at risk of being killed or dying if we don’t get them out? I’ve been saying that to the government for quite some time. Sooner or later, we’ll face an Australian death. At that point in time, I was explaining, that we would probably face an Australian death over their winter but they also face death from disease and they also face death from the lack of food and water, they face death from security threats from inside the camp, from attacks external to the camp. There is no other support to the Australian women in that environment at all and the only rescue – the only avenue for their survival, really – is through the Australian government, and sooner or later, there will be a death in the camp. And since the majority of the deaths in the camp have been children under five, they are the ones most exposed in this situation. Pauline Hanson is using this story from 2013 to justify her views on false allegations in the family court. She says no one from the government has asked her to tone down her rhetoric on the issue, ahead of the inquiry she is about to deputy chair. Mike Bowers is out the front of parliament at the moment. “ ... I will look at it,” Pauline Hanson tells Sky News about legislation. “But as far as I am concerned, I am not interested at looking at legislation.” Hanson also says something along the lines of Scott Morrison is quite happy to send astronauts into space, but meanwhile “he is sending cows to heaven”. Anthony Albanese has announced a press conference for 11.45am. That’s just after the caucus meeting and just before parliament sits (it starts at midday). He’ll be in the opposition leader’s courtyard, which is Labor’s fancy press conference zone. The balloon is not flying though. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority put the nix on that, although there are quite a few examples of hot air balloons flying over parliament. I have been informed by a few people who know that the parliamentary precinct doesn’t actually extend all the way down the front lawns. The hot air balloon is still on the front lawn of parliament, but I expect we will be seeing a parliamentary “get off my lawn” response fairly soon. Paul Karp reported on some of the balloon dramas earlier this week: The Greens’ hopes of flying a hot air balloon over Parliament House to protest global heating have been deflated by a last-minute restriction on flights due to security concerns. Despite blocking the balloon plan, parliament’s presiding officers have approved an Extinction Rebellion protest at the authorised assembly area in front of parliament from 14 to 18 October, the Senate president, Scott Ryan, has revealed. Last week the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, wrote to members hoping to raise $10,000 for a hot air balloon to provide extra lift to the party’s efforts to get parliament to declare a climate emergency when it returns on Monday. The Greens had obtained approval from the National Capital Authority to use the East Lawn at Parkes and Federation Mall for use in climate emergency protests and also claim to have consulted the Australian Federal Police about use of the balloon. The Greens have a “climate emergency” balloon up on the lawns of Parliament House. On whether or not the government should be looking to try and bring some of those women and children home to Australia, Kristina Keneally told Sky News: The government themselves are the only people who can make a decision about what to do in relation to the women and the children who are currently in the al-Hawl internal displacement camp in Syria. They are the only people who have the capacity and the information on national security. ... It is a moral issue as the prime minister has reflected, as has minister Peter Dutton about the terrible situation some utterly innocent children are in, some 40 children who are either Australian citizens, or who have a claim to Australian citizenship are ... in this camp in Syria. By all accounts, they’re quite horrific conditions there, and they are innocent victims. We also know, I know, I’ve been briefed by the Department of Home Affairs that some of the women there were taken against their will or taken as children are now adults, and they are victims too. And it is incumbent upon the government to consider if it is safe to remove those children and women. I’d also reflect that the United States president and the United States secretary of state have been calling on their western allies to deal with their citizens in Syria. The independent national security legislation monitor here in Australia has warned that leaving foreign fighters in the Middle East in Syria in particular, is akin to leaving foreign fighters in Afghanistan in the 1970s. Those people went on to form al-Qaida. There is a risk yes, to bringing people back to Australia, particularly those who have a determination and I accept fully that there are some people either those manual imprisoned or some of the women in the camp who do have a determination to harm Australia. But I think the prime minister and the minister for home affairs need to be straight with the Australian people that while there is a risk to bringing people back, there is also a risk to leaving them there and talk to the Australian people honestly about what those risks are to leaving people there. From AAP: Two Australian women trapped in a camp for relatives of Islamic States fighters have pleaded for Australia to help them as Syrian forces move in. Mariam Dabboussy, a mother of three, is begging the Morrison government for help. “Please don’t let us fall into the hands of the [Syrian] regime,” Dabboussy said in a recording given to the ABC by her father, Kamalle Dabboussy. “We’re asking just as humans, just as regretful people. “If this happens that’s it for us. That’s it for my kids.” The second woman, Zara Ahmad, sent a message to her sister saying a woman’s mutilated body was found in the toilets at the al-Hawl camp. “I’m so scared, I don’t know how much longer I can do this for,” she said. Conditions at al-Hawl, where more than 60 Australian women and children are being held, have deteriorated since the United States announced its withdrawal from northern Syria. This prompted the entry of Turkish fighters to the area in an offensive against Kurdish fighters. Russia-backed Syrian forces have now responded by deploying forces deep inside Kurdish-held territory south of the Turkish frontier. Women’s advocates will be in Canberra today, as the Greens attempt to move a motion to scrap the latest family court review. That would be the one headed up by Kevin Andrews and Pauline Hanson. Advocates, legal experts and domestic violence survivors will be in parliament to try and convince senators to support the motion. Where are we up to with the big stick? I mentioned in a news story published last night about Joel Fitzgibbon’s lively session in the right and left caucus meetings that the shadow cabinet was considering its position on the big stick legislation. Quick recap: Labor opposed this legislation (which creates a power to break up big energy companies if they engage in price gouging) in the last parliament. But the opposition has been warming up for a change of heart. I’m told Labor will pass the government bill if the government accepts an amendment ruling out privatisations or partial privatisation as a consequence of the proposed regime. I believe this is how it works: the effect of the proposed amendment is a public entity that is receiving a divested asset must not have a smaller share of public ownership than the original public entity subject to a divestiture order. If you need a backgrounder, you can read one here. Bridget McKenzie has called a blue room press conference (the second most fancy press conference room) after authorities at Sydney International airport became the first to cancel a visitor’s visa for a biosecurity breach. McKenzie’s office says a 45-year-old woman from Vietnam had her visa cancelled for “failing to declare an extensive cache of food concealed in her luggage, including over 4.5kg of pork”. That is a pretty big deal, particularly at the moment, as Australian biosecurity officials attempt to keep the nation free of African swine fever, a devastating disease which experts predict has wiped out about a quarter of the world’s pig population. You may remember that Pauline Hanson has announced that she and Malcolm Roberts would be going on a voting strike in the Senate until the government decides to regulate the dairy industry. The senator herself explained it last week on Sky News, creating what appears to be Schrödinger’s intervention: Both Jacqui Lambie and Kristina Keneally have pointed out that One Nation voted with the government last night (in the vote the government lost). One Nation has said its strike will apply to “non-critical” legislation. Which seems a bit of a pointless strike really. Just like that time I went on a talking strike because my family had annoyed me. As they liked to repeatedly remind me, they were the double winners in that situation. But then again, these are also the people who think protests should be held at convenient times and places, so I guess it is on brand. On the “ensuring integrity” bill, though, Jacqui Lambie is firm. If John Setka doesn’t step down from the CFMEU, she will vote with the government on the bill, ensuring it passes. “Has John Setka resigned this morning? Then absolutely not,” she said. “Absolutely not. Nope. John Setka needs to go. I would like to see the sisterhood out there, of the unions, that is the ACTU, all the women out there, who complain about ... issues, bullies, all of that sort of stuff, they have all gone quiet, they have gone amiss. “Why aren’t they standing outside the CFMEU house down there in Melbourne and saying ‘remove yourself, we want you gone mate, you know, you are a meathead, see you later, this is what you have done to our union, we know what you are like, how you have treated your wife in the past’ and all the rest. John Setka needs to go. And the only person who doesn’t realise that is John Setka himself.” Setka pleaded guilty to harassing a woman by text messages, with his wife Emma revealing herself as the woman, earlier this year. The pair have both publicly stated they have moved on from that period of their life. Setka has repeatedly said he sees no reason to step down, despite the Labor party moving to expel him from the party. But the political arm has no power over the union movement, with the CFMEU by and large flanking around Setka in support. Jacqui Lambie was just on Sky News, where she said the same things about the medevac bill that she said on ABC radio. For a good overview of the phonics debate in Australia, Michael McGowan has this piece from last year. Like it or not the government is bringing back phonics to Australian primary schools. From Dan Tehan: “Our Government will fund the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership (AITSL) to provide expert advice on incorporating phonics into the national accreditation standards for initial teacher education. “I have tasked AITSL to create a small taskforce to advise on implementing the Government’s phonics in ITE election commitment. “AITSL will draw on the taskforce’s expertise, focusing on ensuring graduate teachers can teach the fundamentals of literacy through learning how to teach the five essential elements of literacy: phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary development, reading fluency, comprehension. “Our Government believes in the primacy of developing strong literacy and numeracy skills as the bedrock of a quality education. “There is clear evidence that children benefit from phonics instruction in learning to read and spell so our Government wants teachers to have the skills to teach phonics well. “AITSL will progress the proposed changes to the accreditation standards to all education ministers for endorsement in December 2019. “Our Government will also introduce a free, voluntary phonics health check for Year 1 students so parents and teachers can better understand a child’s reading level and what support they may need.” We know there is a left and a right Labor caucus (with both, as Katharine Murphy reported yesterday, having something to say about Joel Fitzgibbon’s intervention in the emissions conversation) but now Labor has established a multicultural policy caucus committee as well. From Andrew Giles, Anne Aly and Raff Ciccone: The committee will be chaired by Anne Aly MP, and senator Raff Ciccone will be its secretary. It brings together the lived experience and representational understanding of caucus members, in examining legislation impacting on multicultural communities, consulting with stakeholders and providing specialist advice to the leader and the shadow minister for multicultural affairs. Shadow minister for multicultural affairs Andrew Giles said that the caucus committee will have a focus on consultation with multicultural stakeholders, especially new and emerging communities. “The Morrison government has no plan to support multicultural communities, tackle racism and no plan to realise the strengths of Australia’s diversity. “I look forward to working alongside my caucus colleagues to boost Labor’s engagement with established and emerging culturally diverse communities and ensure that we work alongside these communities every step of the way to better reflect their concerns in parliament.” Caucus committee chair, Anne Aly MP said: “Approximately 1 in 4 Australians was born overseas, and many people born here will have migrant parents. This committee represents Labor’s commitment to ensuring that our policies are meaningful for all Australians. I look forward to my role as chair and working with my colleagues on this committee.” Secretary of the committee, senator Raff Ciccone said that after six years under the Liberal National government multicultural communities in Australia have been overlooked and not given the respect they deserve. “Labor is committed to working with people from every background who call Australia home. “My parents left their home country in search of a better life to give my brother and I the very best opportunities that Australia has to offer. They believed that with hard work and dedication Australia was the best place to raise a family. “I am excited to be helping make sure multicultural communities have a voice in the decisions of our Caucus,” Ciccone said. The MPCC will operate in a similar fashion to existing caucus committees such as the status of women caucus committee and the First Nations caucus committee, and membership will be open to all caucus members. The vote was one by one. According to the Senate Hansard, here is how that went down: AYES Ayres, T, Bilyk, CL , Brown, CL Chisholm, A Ciccone, R Di Natale, R Dodson, P Farrell, D Faruqi, M Gallacher, AM Green, N Hanson-Young, SC Keneally, KK Kitching, K Lambie, J Lines, S McCarthy, M McKim, NJ Patrick, RL Polley, H Pratt, LC Siewert, R Smith, M Steele-John, J Sterle, G Urquhart, AE Walsh, J Waters, LJ Watt, M Whish-Wilson, PS NOES Abetz, E Antic, A Bragg, A J Canavan, MJ Cash, MC Chandler, C Colbeck, R Davey, P Duniam, J Fierravanti-Wells, C Hanson, P Hughes, H Hume, J McDonald, S McGrath, J (teller) McKenzie, B McMahon, S O’Sullivan, MA Paterson, J Payne, MA Rennick, G Roberts, M Ruston, A Scarr, P Seselja, Z Sinodinos, A Smith, DA Stoker, AJ Van, D PAIRS Carr, KJ Fawcett, DJ Gallagher, KR Askew, W Griff, S Henderson, SM McAllister, J Reynolds, L O’Neill, D Birmingham, SJ Rice, J Ryan, SM Sheldon, A Brockman, S Wong, P Cormann, M Kristina Keneally had a bit to say about it though: “This is the latest chapter in the comedy of errors that is the Morrison government. The Liberals started the day by accidentally sharing their talking points with the entire press gallery and finished it by stuffing up a vote in the Senate.” Speaking of the Senate, someone in the government side will be in trouble this morning after the government lost a vote in the chamber last night: It sounds like there are going to be A LOT of conversations this week. “The legislation does serve its purpose and they do have the opportunity to get medical attention, I don’t think we need to be arguing about that,” Jacqui Lambie continued. “But, I have got to look at the bigger picture as well, and, as I said, what has happened over the last four or five days in Syria, certainly that will come into the equation now.” Lambie says she is not sure if she would have voted for the medevac bill if she was in the Senate last year when it passed. But she comes back again to her point that “things have changed in the last four or five days, so I just need to get more clarification from that on home affairs and we’ll go from there”. The report doesn’t come out until Friday, but the Senate won’t have to vote on the repeal until the Senate returns the week of 11 November. There is also estimates next week, where the legislation will no doubt play a big role. Over on ABC radio, Jacqui Lambie says she still has not made up her mind on the medevac repeal legislation. With One Nation siding with the government, and Centre Alliance firmly against the repeal, the Tasmanian senator is the swing vote. She says the government can’t give her anything for her vote, because her constituents would not “expect me to go in there and sell those people out, for a deal for Tasmania”. “It is just not on the cards, it is not the way we operate down in Tasmania,” she told RN. Instead, Lambie says she is approaching it as a conscience vote. “This will be a conscience vote, from Tasmania,” she said. Lambie says she will be going through the Senate report on the medevac bill, which is due to be handed down on 18 October, over the weekend, including the dissenting reports. This week is full of meetings, with the immigration lawyer who appeared with her on the SBS show Go Back To Where You Came From meeting with Lambie this morning. “She has some concerns as well. She does not want the medevac repealed. She wants to put her concerns across the table. There will be a few other people with who I am meeting with this week as well,” Lambie said. On the medical bodies who came together for a joint statement, asking for the legislation to remain in place, Lambie says she believes national security grounds need to be taken into account as well. “Especially with the tempo that is happening in the Middle East in the last four or five days,” she said. “We also always need to make sure and consider that boats making sure that those boats don’t start coming back in, and whether or not that signals, whether or not that is going to set off that domino effect. “Word doesn’t always get back to people, where there are other war zones not to get on boats, because you won’t be allowed into Australia. “So making sure that they get that information correctly. And I know those people right now, that are going to be under the medevac law, it is only contained to those people who are already there. “... So there is a lot up in the air. “ Lambie says the decision by Donald Trump to pull out US troops from northern Syria has “put a whole new spanner in the works” and the “discussions have slightly changed”. “I’ll be going to see home [affairs] this week as well, and catch up with them, and just see where they are at with that sort of stuff and what else is going on with the Middle East.” There’s been no release of the government talking notes this morning, so I guess the big red button has been moved. Instead, the prime minister started his morning talking to Alan Jones, because I don’t know. People get their morning gee up in different ways, I guess. The Sydney radio 2GB host was very vexed about the drought, but Scott Morrison said he couldn’t make it rain. “We want the farmers and the communities to get through this drought, but we can’t kid ourselves that there’s a magic wand and a magic cash splash that is going to make this thing totally solved” he said. As we saw from the talking points yesterday, the government is feeling a little vulnerable on the drought. It keeps pointing to its $7bn spend, but as we know, $5bn of that hasn’t been spent. It’s in a future fund, locked away. Regional and rural advocates say while the government has a strategy, it’s ad hoc, doesn’t involve the states and needs a more wholistic approach. The government, of course, defends its response. Expect more on that. Jacqui Lambie has been up early, speaking to ABC radio, so I’ll bring you that soon. We’ll also have the outcome of the party room meetings and caucus being held a little later this morning. It’s also International Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. The Senate will acknowledge that during the sitting session. But thinking of all of those impacted by pregnancy and infant loss. I hope you get a moment today for yourself. Mike Bowers is already roaming the hallways, and you’ll have the considerable brainpower of Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Sarah Martin at your disposal. I have two coffees in front of me, thanks to benevolent benefactors who have learned I am in a better mood when properly caffeinated. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "bodyText": "1) City’s embarrassment of riches Manchester City sit top of the pile after earning maximum points from four matches, with their latest victory a comprehensive 3-0 win against the basement side Birmingham. It was a game in which the gulf between the teams was clear but Nick Cushing’s side appear a more clinical beast this season, with an embarrassment of riches going forward, a raft of internationals including Janine Beckie, Tessa Wullaert and the electric teenager Lauren Hemp that offers no end of ammunition. Then there is the South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min, who completed the scoring, and Pauline Bremer, who has shone since returning from a broken leg sustained on her City debut. Last season City struggled to put lesser opposition to the sword but they have shown a ruthless streak that will surely stand them in good stead in their quest to take back the title. The same cannot be said for a pointless Birmingham, mainstays of the division who appear in a sorry mess. 2) England shining for Chelsea Chelsea stamped their authority with a victory against Arsenal that showed they mean business. Inevitably hurting after failing to qualify for the Champions League, Emma Hayes’s side have no distractions this season and are determined to return to Europe’s top table. They came from behind after Danielle van de Donk opened the scoring, with Beth England, again spearheading the Chelsea attack, equalising from close range before the substitute Maria Thorisdottir’s late strike sealed victory to end Arsenal’s 100% record. England has been a revelation for club and country and the No 9, who spent 2017-18 on loan at Liverpool, appears at home leading the line for Hayes’s side. As far as Chelsea are concerned, victory against their London rivals is the perfect platform on which to build and it is a three points, even at this stage of the season, that could prove a defining moment in terms of their hopes of returning to the Europe’s elite competition. Arsenal came unstuck just once last season en route to winning the league and know they can ill afford another blip if they are serious about retaining the title. 3) Galton has the devil that could benefit Neville Manchester United had nothing to show for encouraging performances against Manchester City and Arsenal but Casey Stoney’s side are beginning to yield results in their first season in the top tier. After swatting aside Liverpool before the international break, United eased past Tottenham, another team relishing the step up this campaign. Stoney, a former centre-back, has built an organised and stubborn United side – they have kept successive clean sheets and conceded only two goals all season – but they are equally beginning to flourish going forward. The arrival of Jackie Groenen has been a big plus, while the form of Leah Galton has been a huge boost. Galton was involved in all three goals at Spurs and her displays must have caught the attention of the England manager, Phil Neville. The uncapped 25-year-old could provide the kind of devilish wing displays Rachel Yankey and Sue Smith did in bygone eras. Galton wreaked havoc on a defensively frail Tottenham, who must have one eye on shoring things up in the next transfer window. 4) Williams and Moore make difference for Reading A blitz of four goals in 16 first-half minutes set the tempo as Reading edged out Everton 3-2 in an end-to-end thriller but the wise heads of Fara Williams and Jade Moore, who have more than 200 England caps between them, that made the difference in victory. Williams is an evergreen performer in midfield and the 35-year-old’s set pieces pierced Everton’s bubble. Willie Kirk’s side started the season at the league summit but, despite Chloe Kelly, player of the month in September, extending her wonderful start to the season by scuttling in an equaliser from close range, it was Reading who prospered, with Williams supplying Lisa-Marie Karlseng Utland to nod in at a corner. Kelly passed up a gilt-edged chance late on and Reading served a reality check to Everton, who have succumbed to consecutive defeats. 5) Lawley gets Liverpool up and running Liverpool and Bristol City could not be separated in a game that was a tale of two English players reaping the reward of first-team football at different stages of their careers. Melissa Lawley, who departed Manchester City in the close season and started her career in Bristol, scored her first Liverpool goal to get her new club up and running after a disappointing start to the season. Lawley cancelled out a brilliant debut goal by the 18-year-old Ebony Salmon, who joined from Manchester United in the summer. Salmon curled in from the right flank beyond Anke Preuß before a mazy run by the 21-year-old winger Rinsola Babajide lured Loren Dykes into a foul. Up stepped Lawley, 25, to coolly convertand provide Liverpool with a point they must build on. This season BT Sport will air more women’s football than ever before, continuing with coverage of Arsenal Women vs Manchester City Women on Sunday 27 October on BT Sport"

          "bodyText": "And on that note, we will land the blog for the night. We’ll be back early tomorrow morning – when it is party room bonanza. I’m going to go out on a limb and suggest that we will have been taken off the government talking point distribution list by then. A massive thank you to Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp. And to everyone you don’t see, who work behind the scenes keeping it all going. Of course, the biggest thank you, as always, goes to you. Thank you for joining us today. We’ll be back soon. In the mean time – take care of you. Zali Steggall on her inclusion on the (latest) family law inquiry: I am very pleased to have been confirmed on the family law inquiry. Relationship breakdowns are a highly emotional time and this inquiry needs to be balanced and handled sensitively to ensure our family law system works the best way possible in all areas, both in property and parenting disputes. Pauline Hanson has been promised the deputy chair role in that family law inquiry. Here is how she has been promoting her involvement: The joint select committee into Australia’s family law system has just been announced – the House members anyway. They are: Kevin Andrews Llew O’Brien Fiona Martin Zali Steggall For the Greens motion to be successful they would need both Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie to vote to shut the family law inquiry down. At this stage Centre Alliance’s Rex Patrick is holding the line that Pauline Hanson’s public comments about domestic violence don’t invalidate the whole process. He told Guardian Australia: “I often strongly disagree* with remarks Pauline Hanson makes, but I respect that she is a member of the Senate and was voted for by a number of people. Her remarks taint her own reputation, they will have no effect on the committee itself, which is made up of 10 parliamentarians.” *An earlier version of this post had an unfortunate typo. Rex Patrick often strongly disagrees with Pauline Hanson, not agrees, as I first had. Sorry. We have a statement from the joint security and intelligence committee: Today the Chair of the Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee tabled its Advisory report on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (2019 Measures No. 1) Bill 2019. The Chair of the Committee, Mr Andrew Hastie MP said “This Bill makes changes that are designed to keep Australians safe. It implements a COAG agreement to ensure a presumption that neither bail nor parole will be granted to those persons who have demonstrated support for, or who have links to, terrorist activity. This decision followed the terrorist attack in Brighton, Victoria in June 2017. The perpetrator of that attack was on parole for State offences, and had previously been charged with conspiracy to commit a terrorist attack.” The Bill: amends the existing presumption against bail in section 15AA of the Crimes Act so that it covers persons charged with or convicted of a terrorism offence, amends section 19AG of the Crimes Act to require a court, when sentencing a terrorist offender who is under the age of 18, to fix a non-parole period of three-quarters of the head sentence unless the court is satisfied that exceptional circumstances exist to justify a shorter non-parole period, and provides that exculpatory material does not need to be included in a continuing detention order application where the material would be the subject of a claim for Public Interest Immunity. The Committee has recommended amendments so that the onus is on the Australian Federal Police Minister to satisfy the Court that any excluded exculpatory information is protected by Public Interest Immunity. This addresses the concerns raised by submitters whilst ensuring that the intended aim of the amendment is achieved. The Greens will be moving a motion to dissolve the Kevin Andrews chaired inquiry into the family law system. From Larissa Waters: The Greens will introduce a motion in the Senate today to dissolve the damaging Joint Select Committee Inquiry into Australia’s Family Law System, for vote tomorrow. Greens co-deputy leader and spokesperson on women, Senator Larissa Waters, said the inquiry was already ramping up the risk to women and children. ‘Australia’s family law system has serious problems which need addressing, however this inquiry is politically motivated and should not go ahead,’ she said. ‘The Greens are in discussion with other parties and with Senators who may have changed their minds about supporting this inquiry, which is stacked with extremists that have pre-determined, non-expert opinions on violence against women and their children. ‘There are serious concerns from experts, service providers and women in the community that the inquiry will make women less safe, and that victims and survivors of family violence and abuse do not feel safe giving evidence to the inquiry.’ Speaking of the Senate, Arthur Sinodonos will deliver his Senate valedictory speech on Wednesday afternoon. He’s off to be our man in Washington. Malcolm Roberts, the servant of Queensland and the nation, is now refusing to vote on government bills in the Senate, as part of a One Nation standoff to have the dairy industry regulated. Roberts just said this in the Senate: As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I want to make comments on the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation Amendment bill 2019. Let me first say that in support of Senator Hanson’s decision to not vote on legislation, other than critical legislation, until the government has addressed the plight of dairy farmers, I will not be voting on this bill. Pauline Hanson has announced the vote ban will apply to “non-critical legislation” but I guess PHON will decide what is critical and what is not. To pass legislation Labor and the Greens disagree on, the government needs four of the six Senate crossbenchers to pass legislation. Usually that’s Cory Berardi and One Nation, and then either Centre Alliance or Jacqui Lambie. Without One Nation, Centre Alliance AND Lambie become crucial. But again, we don’t know what counts as non-critical legislation. On the speech Penny Wong delivered to the Australian Institute of International Affairs, which, for her, was quite political, Wong had this to say: I thought very carefully about this speech. As you would know, it is not usual for me to have such political attack in a foreign speech. I talked about strategic composition in the region and I focused on foreign policy with some criticism but this was considered because I do think that, whether you look at his most recent speech at the Lowy Institute, where he rails against negative globalism, his decision on Jerusalem, where he sought to walk away from a bipartisan position on Jerusalem when he first became prime minister, when you look at his language on China, this is a prime minister who is prepared to play domestic politics and domestic political tactics and foreign policy in a way I have not seen. The Lowy speech was interesting and disturbing. Disturbing because it was lightweight but also because it broke from Julie Bishop’s white paper. The one [plan] the government had was a rules-based order and [to] work multilaterally in our region to achieve that and we have an Australian prime minister doing what really no prime minister has done, of either persuasion, which is railing against global cooperation at a time when we need it. You cannot be an isolationist and free trader. He claims he wants free trade, more trade, but he does not like multilateral institutions, which presumably include the World Trade Organisation which is critical to Australia. On Peter Dutton’s comments on the Chinese Communist party, Penny Wong says: I would like to make a couple of points. We are different society to China under the Chinese Communist party. And I have made the point for quite a long time. And inevitably with our democracy [we] will have differences of views on a range of issues between us and China. My question to Peter Dutton is – was [it] a thought-through plan? Was it part of the clear strategy or part of a political tactic because ...it’s very difficult to tell where the government’s strategy on China is. If you accept that we are, as we are, an ally and partner of the US, and we have an important economic relationship with China, you want to make sure you have assessable strategy in dealing with [a] China which is much more assertive, but we are going to have differences of views on whether the relationship is more challenging. ... Scott Morrison appeared to downplay it so it does look from the outside like another tactically domestically focused press conference. ... Of course it matters how you handle the relationship as well as what decisions you make. This is not just about substance. That is important. But it’s also about how you handle rhetoric and advocacy. But my concern is, we don’t appear to have a plan when it comes to dealing with an increasingly challenging relationship with China, which is becoming more assertive and more willing to present interests. There will be times when we our interests converge, and we will engage closely, but times where our interests are different. On Scott Morrison’s visit to the United States, Penny Wong says: What was interesting … is that [the prime minister] didn’t achieve anything through that trip when it came to the trade war between China and the US. And certainly there are a lot of other distractions that the prime minister chose to engage in, including discussion about China’s status at the WTO bank and he made that announcement in the US, but fundamentally I think it was to distract from the fact that we have a deep interest, both for stability reasons and for economic reasons, in the trade dispute being comfortably resolved. Penny Wong is the guest on Afternoon Briefing today. Wong tells Patricia Karvelas she believes Scott Morrison is very short sighted in his strategy on foreign policy: My point is this, it’s a very challenging time in foreign policy, with a very challenging regional and global environment, and a very challenging time in our relationship with China. It would be best if those issues were managed with very clear on the national interest and in a bipartisan manner. And what we have is a Prime Minister who does seek partisan advantage, who does it to manoeuvre and play tactical gains. Paul Karp with a balloon update: Just on Scott Morrison’s answer on negative globalisation, where he cited examples of times the UN has asked Australia to change its policy – I guess it’s positive globalisation when we do it? Because that’s a fairly common part of diplomacy and being part of the international stage. For instance, we have recently expressed our concerns to Turkey over its policy in north-eastern Syria. As we should. We finish up with a dixer from Greg Hunt on health spending. The folders are stacked though, so we are done. Lisa Chesters to Scott Morrison: Why does the prime minister’s talking points say that the government recognises how tough drought is when he is withdrawing Farm Household Allowance from hundreds of drought-stricken farm families? Morrison: I thank the member for her question. She may be interested to know that, in the year 2017, the amount paid out under the Farm Household ... Allowance was $33,735,000. In the numbers we received this morning, the number was $114,00155,000. Since since the drought summit of last year, as I referred to in an earlier answer today, we have made some very significant changes to the Farm Household Allowance. And we didn’t make those changes unilaterally. The minister for drought, then minister for agriculture, commissioned a review of the Farm Household Allowance and went out and spoke directly to all those affected in the sector through that independent review process. That independent review process recommended that we go from three years to four years - and for that four years to be four in every 10. Four in every 10. I remind the member that, when the Labor party was in power, it was three years only - for life, Mr Speaker. Three years for life. The member for Hunter. We increased that to four years in 10, and we are now, in this year most recently completed, we have put $114.2 million to support those families and to ease up on the compliance requirements and the assessment requirements that has enabled more of those families – some 6,000 now – which, when Labor was in, numbered only around 300 or thereabouts, Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker, I hear before that the drought had just started. ... We learnt in Queensland today, in the minister for drought’s electorate, it’s been going for eight years. It’s been going for eight years, Mr Speaker. So in all of that period of time, what we have done – and what we have most recently done through the National Drought Summit – has been to increase access to that payment. And we will continue to consult closely with the community when it comes to making any further changes if they are considered necessary. But we’re acting in accordance with the advice, Mr Speaker, and the head of the farmers in Queensland has been very, very clear about the need to maintain those arrangements as they’ve been set. So we’re going to listen to the farmers and listen to the rural communities, and that’s why, in just the last few weeks, since we sat in this place, we’ve put – together with the New South Wales government – over $1 billion into new dams and upgraded dams. We’ve put, Mr Speaker, over $60 million into additional farm household assistance just since we have come back to this parliament. On top of that, we’ve put an additional $14 million into drought-affected local government areas to ensure that we can keep those local economies moving. Mr Speaker, we will continue to respond to the drought as and when and each and every day as we need to, and that will go on into the future with our full support. We get a bipartisan note, with both David Littleproud and Anthony Albanese mourning the couple who died in the NSW bushfires, and praising the firefighters who have worked to keep the fires as contained as possible. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Today, the prime minister has refused to give a straight answer to questions about record household debt, about record-low wage growth, and about whether he tried to invite Brian Houston to the White House. Why won’t the prime minister just give straight answers, whether it’s here or in media interviews? Morrison: Mr Speaker, once again, the leader of the opposition comes to the dispatch box and he casts a whole range of aspersions across the table, Mr Speaker, without being able to back them up. The problem is, the leader of the opposition doesn’t like the answers to the questions, Mr Speaker. He doesn’t like the fact that, when it comes to our economy, we continue to be one of the strongest-growing developed countries in the world, that we’re continually providing jobs for Australians, and that 1.4 million Australians have been able to find work, that our AAA credit rating has been maintained, that taxes have been reduced, Mr Speaker, under our government, and that we continue to provide support to the farmers and rural and regional communities of this country, including protecting those very farmers from those who would seek, Mr Speaker, to go and invade their farms and create even further anxiety and insult at a time when they are under greatest pressure. Morrison moves into a bunch of government talking points, concluding before there can be a Tony Burke point of order. Labor has also been focusing on Scott Morrison’s Lowy speech in Senate question time, asking whether he was referring to the UN when he warned of an “unaccountable internationalist bureaucracy”. Foreign minister Marise Payne took the opportunity to read extensive quotes from before the offending phrase in the speech, more generic sections about threats in the strategic environment. Labor raised multiple points of order on relevance, but president Scott Ryan agreed with the minister that the content of the speech was all relevant. Labor’s Penny Wong suggested the prime minister had “humiliated” Payne and Julie Bishop “would’ve stood up and fought” against the talking points. Payne responded that Labor was selectively quoting the speech. She said that the world suffered from “peak commentary” – presumably international institutions lecturing Australia – and the PM was “trying to navigate a path through that in the national interest. Asked about the related warning of “negative globalism”, Payne said Morrison was seeking “an approach to globalism that facilitates/aligns rather than directs and centralises” which she said was “not provocative, [but] considered”. Peter Dutton does his usual LABOR IS TERRIBLE ON BORDER SECURITY but it is not as firey as usual. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: I refer to reports in the Wall Street Journal that the prime minister was determined to bring Brian Houston to the White House, with several rounds of discussions between Canberra and Washington before the White House vetoed the idea. Why won’t the prime minister give a straight answer to this question: “Did the prime minister or his office seek to have Brian Houston invited to the White House?” Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I refer the member to my previous answer about how invitations are issued, Mr Speaker. It is not my practice to go around commenting on the unsourced reports, Mr Speaker, and just respond to the rumours that go around this place. The member opposite might want to engage in that but, if the member opposite wants to make comments about the individual in question ... Anthony Albanese gets up on relevance: It is Question Time for a reason – there’s questions and there’s answers. The prime minister has just said ... My point of order goes to relevance. The prime minister can’t say “I’m just not answering.” He’s got to actually answer questions in this place. That’s what it’s for. Tony Smith rules the answer in order. Morrison continues: I responded to the question, Mr Speaker, but I do ask, Mr Speaker, in the way that the question has been put to this House, that if they are suggesting anything serious or casting any aspersions on the individual which is the subject of the question, then perhaps I suggest they go and attend that church and they explain their concerns directly to their parishioners. Albanese is not happy with that. NOT AT ALL. The pair, who attended and had a laugh together at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning, continue to argue across the table. Morrison turns his back on Albanese, but turns back, to answer something else. That is fairly unusual – the pair usually leave the politics to the despatch box. It has to be said, although I know that the PMO will disagree, but Morrison was a little nervous before getting up to answer those questions. He does this thing where he shakes the paper a little, and continually folds over the same spot when he is nervous. The hands were moving like crazy in that answer. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Did the prime minister or his office seek to have Brian Houston invited to the White House? Morrison: As the member knows, the invitations were handled by the White House, so that’s a matter for the White House. I think the Australian people are more interested in who Jamie Clements was inviting to dinner, and how much cash was in the wine bag. He’s pulled up on relevance, but Morrison has already concluded his answer. Paul Fletcher got very worked up in his lickspittle. Something about no one having moved from welfare to work under Labor. Weird flex, but OK It pains me to say I missed an interjection during the prime minister’s answer on which multilateral institutions were pushing us towards negative globalism. Ed Husic wanted the prime minister to refer to the Illuminati or Agenda 21. As an agent of the deep state, I can assure you agents are already on the mention of the Illuminati and Beyoncé is being notified as we speak. Paul Fletcher is now basically reading from the government’s talking points on welfare. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Which multilateral institutions was the prime minister talking about when he warned about the dangers of negative globalism? Morrison (with a lot of shouting): I thank the member for his questions about my speech to the Lowy Institute which I understand he doesn’t share my views that Australia’s national interests should always come first and take priority over the agendas of global institutions, Mr Speaker ... I’m surprised that the member opposite thinks that global institutions should be telling the Australian public about what should be happening in this parliament, Mr Speaker. And I make reference to a number, Mr Speaker, about policy positions that the Australian government has been urged to change. I’m happy to name them, leader of the opposition. There are those who are overseas who think that our commitment to 26% reduction emissions by 2030 should be changed. And it should be higher, Mr Speaker. And we don’t agree. And neither do the Australian people. ‘Cause we took it to an election, Mr Speaker. And the Australian people said – and supported – the re-election of our government, Mr Speaker, on the basis of us going forward with a commitment to 26% reduction of emissions. The other thing we recently had some correspondence from the UN, Mr Speaker – from the UN – we had some correspondence ... Anthony Albanese jumps up to ask about relevance. Morrison continues: I was making reference, as I was about to, on border protection issues, Mr Speaker, where we have been written to by the UN saying we should change our policies. I can remember when the UNHCR used to write to us and say we should change our policies. We don’t agree. Does the Labor party agree that we should be changing our border protection rules to comply with the international issues, whether it’s the UNHCR or any other organisations, when it’s in conflict with the express policies of the Australian people taking to election, Mr Speaker? But I return to the issue of emissions reduction. We are in no doubt about our policy on this side of the House. 26% reduction in emissions by 2030. But on that side of the House, the member, Mr Speaker, for Hunter – he actually agrees with us. He thinks it should be 26%, Mr Speaker. (The government benches go nuts) Not only that, but the deputy thinks it as well. There’s a lot of support for the member for Hunter’s ideas, but sadly not from the member for Sydney. She reserves her right to perfectly disagree with the member for Hunter, so she’s still for the 45% target, Mr Speaker. Then we can go across to the member for Kingsford Smith – I should say, the member for Wills – who says he doesn’t know. He says, “We don’t have the answers right now,” Mr Speaker. Then there’s another position which was put forward ...” Tony Smith pulls him on relevance and for straying from the question. Morrison says he was responding to an interjection, but Smith says he didn’t hear one. We eventually come to the end with this: While you may not have heard any interjections from your left, I can assure you the member for Hunter does. The Labor party is riven with division on climate change. #welldoneJoel Apparently our space program is another example of how we are helping our farmers, according to Karen Andrews. I think we are getting to the link here somewhere (and I’m hoping its not we are going to mine an asteroid for water, because I have seen that movie and it doesn’t end well). Oh, nope, there we go. Satellites. Satellites help farmers. Also, something about Mars. Labor’s Katy Gallagher has asked finance minister Mathias Cormann about the Reserve Bank’s decision to cut interest rates to 0.75%. But she’s done it with a twist, quoting Cormann’s own words when he warned of interest rates at “emergency levels” under Labor, when he argued the RBA had “not cut rates because the economy is doing well”. Cormann responded that the RBA had responded to the “international context”, and particularly the need to cut because of low global interest rates. Funny, he didn’t mention anything about household spending. This is what the RBA said on that subject: “The main domestic uncertainty continues to be the outlook for consumption, with the sustained period of only modest increases in household disposable income continuing to weigh on consumer spending.” But there are plenty of good stats for Cormann to deploy: 28 years of continuous economic growth, 1.4m new jobs, and Australia’s AAA credit rating. Cormann adds that RBA governor Phil Lowe “expects the economy to gradually strengthen” due to income tax cuts, infrastructure spending and the stabilisation of the property market. Rob Mitchell gets booted for asking Dan Tehan to table the document he was talking from, as there is no mention of education in the talking points. Worth it. Tanya Plibersek to Dan Tehan: Isn’t it true that, under this government, the number of Australians doing an apprenticeship or a traineeship is lower than it was a decade ago? So why has this government cut $3 billion from Tafe and training? Tehan: LABOR CUT FUNDING (this is not a quote, but it is the general vibe) Meanwhile, no one is mentioning the Scott Cam contract, which I don’t know, doesn’t seem like the greatest way to appeal to teenagers. Not that we know how much the Cam contract has cost, because for some reason, that is being kept under wraps. Cool, cool, cool (which Scott Cam is not, btw. I don’t make the rules.) Peta Murphy has the next question for Scott Morrison: Can the prime minister confirm that this Liberal government’s record on wages growth is worse than any previous government? Is this a contributing factor to record household debt? Morrison: I thank the member for her question and I’m pleased to inform the House - again - that in the most recent through-the-year figures in the national accounts, that real wages growth was running at 0.7% a year. (“It’s a runaway train,” someone from Labor yells.) Well, Mr Speaker, I note the interjections of those opposite who seem to think that 0.7% is not satisfactory. Then, what do they think about 0.5%, as we inherited from the Labor party when we came to office, Mr Speaker? Mr Speaker, the Labor party condemns themselves from their own mouths, Mr Speaker, when it comes to their own track record, when it comes to managing the economy. Maybe the member opposite wants to look up the size of the deficit when they left office, Mr Speaker, or all the other matters, Mr Speaker, in which Labor set fire to the budget when they were in office. Mr Speaker, I’m also asked about household debt. I’m asked about household debt. And the treasurer gave, I think, a very good answer about the issues around household debt. But one of the things that I would also add to that is that households themselves are proving to be very effective in how they’re managing their own debt. The House may not know that there is a three-times coverage - three years in advance, that is, that people have been able to build offsets against their mortgages. And they’ve been doing that, Mr Speaker, in a very prudential way. And one of the big differences between Australia’s household debt and household debt in other parts around the world is this: Australia’s rental housing market - 30% of the entire housing market - is owned by mums and dads who invest in investment properties. And if those mums and dads didn’t invest in those investment properties, we would not have the rental stock that is available to people to rent today. And what was Labor’s policy when it came to rents at the last election? To whack a big, fat housing tax on mums and dads who were simply investing in the rental stock of Australians who are renting to put a roof over their heads. The Labor party has never understood the economy. They’ve never understood how to manage money. The economy and the country’s finances has never been safe in Labor’s hands, and the Australian people know it, Mr Speaker. For anyone interested Paul Karp and Luke Henriques-Gomes have factchecked the government’s talking points for you Dave Sharma has the next lickspittle question, on the ACCC inquiry. “It’s page five,” Anthony Albanese tells his benches. They all dutifully turn their pages to page five. “This is word for word,” Jim Chalmers yells. Labor MPs are now mouthing along with Josh Frydenberg as he gives his answer. Graham Perrett appears to be having a particularly great time. Anika Wells, who is not a previous treasurer, despite being the member for Lilley, has the next question: Why won’t the prime minister confirm that household debt is now nearly double disposable income, higher than it has ever been? Frydenberg: The member for Lilley – who may not have learned any economics from her predecessor, Mr Speaker ... we hope not, we hope not ... The George Costanza, Mr Speaker... The value of household sector assets is five times greater than its debts. And importantly, around three-quarters of the debt is owed by households in the top 40% of the income distribution, Mr Speaker. And they’re generally at a higher capacity to make repayments and are less likely to go through a period of sustained unemployment, Mr Speaker. And then it is just a bunch of yelling. It’s not quite Fatman Scoop, but still. Josh Frydenberg has just proven he knows how microphones work though. So there is that. Meanwhile, politicians really should be banned from using Dorothea Mackellar’s poem as proof that Australia has been in drought before. WE GET IT The government really, really, really wants to talk about what it is doing about the drought. Helen Haines has the independents’ question and it is to David Littleproud: The minister today wrote in an opinion piece, ‘Our drought strategy is clear.’ This morning, Fiona Simpson, president of the NFF, said, ‘Unfortunately, Australia remains without a national drought strategy.’ Like many farmers around the country, I’m bamboozled. Can the minister clarify – does the government actually have a drought strategy and is the strategy the minister referred to the one the NFF doesn’t agree exists – a strategy which was written in 1992 when the minister himself was 16 years old? A bit of millennial shaming there, but that’s part of the game. Littleproud: (refer to the government talking point on drought for the answer) Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: Is the prime minister aware of any year when household debt was higher than it is now? Morrison: I thank the member for his question on household debt. Household debt does continue to trouble the government. And the pressure that it places on families. And that is one of the reasons why, Mr Speaker, we provided the tax relief - through this parliament - when we were re-elected on May 18 to ensure that we could be taking the pressure off families - particularly those on low- and middle-incomes - so they could be able to meet ... the ... increasing challenges that they do on their household budgets. And of course, a big part of that, Mr Speaker, is the things that they owe. But the good thing in Australia is the times’ coverage when it comes to household debt – the treasurer will correct me if I’m wrong – but it’s about five times, five times, Mr Speaker, the asset coverage to the debt coverage, and it’s predominantly within the housing sector. If the shadow treasurer thinks there is a significant issue in terms of the credit-worthiness of the Australian housing market, which underpins the credit position of Australians in this country, then he should say so. He should say that. But he won’t say that, because he knows it’s not true. The shadow treasurer once again is seeking to talk down the Australian economy and, Mr Speaker, talk down and create anxiety about issues, Mr Speaker, which are being well-managed by Australians - and conscientiously managed. We really are back in 2016 Labor’s shadow foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has started Senate question time by asking what Australia has done about the Turkish military operation in northern Syria. Foreign minister Marise Payne said the operation will “certainly cause additional civilian suffering”, displacement of people, and risk the return of Daesh [Isis], a “serious threat” to regional security. She paints a picture of a full court press – with Australia engaging Turkish diplomats in Canberra, Ankara, talks with the US secretary of state Mike Pompeo, the French president Emanuel Macron, and talks with her Turkish counterpart. Wong then asks about Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw US troops. Payne responds that Turkey (not the US) is “totally responsible” for the decision it has made through the incursion, the “humanitarian suffering” and the “detention, custody and escape of any Daesh fighters”. She refuses to go into the content of talks with Pompeo. Payne said Australia is “very concerned” about the possibility Daesh, despite its territorial defeat, could regain the capability for “violent extremist activity” in the Middle East and more broadly. But it does give me an opportunity to watch Darren Chester attempt to crouch down to speak to the crossbench, and witness the seven circles of hell pass over his face. Barnaby Joyce can add inflicting Michael McCormack on us to his list of sins. He starts with this: I don’t have my talking points – I think they went to the member for Hunter, because the member for Hunter is very much onboard with our climate policy ... I don’t know what else he says because I have metaphysically thrown myself off the press gallery balcony. Tony Burke tries to have the prime minister table his talking points, but Scott Morrison says he wasn’t quoting from anything. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: Where in the prime minister’s talking points for today is the prime minister’s description of the banking royal commission as “hollow populist nonsense”, and how is this description consistent with his new inquiry announced today? Will he just say anything at any time when it’s convenient? Morrison: I thank the leader of the opposition for his question. As he may recall, I was the treasurer that initiated the banking royal commission, Mr Speaker ...[Labor dissolves into laughter]... I don’t recall a banking royal commission being initiated by the member for McMahon when he was treasurer, or the member for Lilley when he was treasurer. I don’t remember that at all, Mr Speaker. I remember there was this government that took that action, and it’s now this government that is acting on the recommendations of the royal commission through the good work of the treasurer, Mr Speaker. And now is taking further steps – just as we were doing from when we came into government, Mr Speaker, and particularly even before the royal commission reported – we introduced the Banking Executive Accountability Regime, we increased the resources for Asic and Apra, and we made sure they had the powers available to them to do the work they need to do, Mr Speaker. So we’re taking action. And I’ll tell you who we’re taking action for when it comes to the banking sector, Mr Speaker – that’s for bank customers, Mr Speaker. That’s who needs the greater competition that we want to see in this sector – for small business lenders as well – that’s why we’ve put $2 billion into the Small Business Securitisation Fund to deepen and widen the pool of capital available for these new lenders to get their hands on, to provide even better business opportunities to small businesses. Mr Speaker, our government has a real plan, and is implementing a real plan to ensure we get greater competition, greater accountability and better outcomes out of our banking and financial system to support those who want to go and buy a home, for those who want to go and run a business, for those who need that support to sustain them through the drought they’re facing now. That’s what we’re putting in place, Mr Speaker. When those opposite were in this place – when those opposite were in this place, Mr Speaker, when it came to the needs of those who were customers of the banking and financial sector, they just simply looked the other way. Rowan Ramsey, who always looks like an extra in a Dickens novel to me, is the first lickspittle. Please refer to the government talking points on the drought for Scott Morrison’s answer. Anthony Albanese to Scott Morrison: The prime minister’s talking points for today say “the major banks have decided to put their profits before their customers”. If that’s the case, why did the treasurer say, just nine days ago, “I’m not focused on new inquiries” – only to announce a new inquiry on interest rates today? Josh Frydenberg takes this one. He again seems to have forgotten how microphones work over the spring break. On this side of the House, we’re focused on CONSUMERS MR SPEAKER! We’re focused ON LOWER BORROWING COSTS. Lower borrowing costs. For the Labor party, you had the member for Rankin out there last week calling for higher levies on the banks, Mr Speaker. Because for every question, the Labor party HAS THE SAME ANSWER – higher taxes, higher levies. The reality is, we have announced today a very significant new inquiry by the ACCC. And this inquiry will be looking at the pricing of the nearly $2 trillion residential mortgage market, Mr Speaker. And what we need to understand better is the difference in prices that the banks offer their existing customers and new customers, Mr Speaker – otherwise known as the front book and the back book, Mr Speaker. What we need to know in better detail is the difference between the advertised price and the actual price paid, Mr Speaker. And what we need to do is to understand if there are barriers for customers to switch banks in order to get a better deal. So on this side of the House, Mr Speaker, we stand for loyal bank customers and getting the best possible deal for them. I expect Darren Chester might find it a little difficult jumping up and down during question time today, after he completed his first marathon over the weekend. It took a little longer than two hours, but congrats to everyone who crosses that finish line. It’s more than I could ever do (I look like a drunk baby giraffe which has been crossed with a confused duck when I run). This has prompted a lot of MPs to get their skin checks done – when was the last time you had yours? The sincerest form of flattery? We are in the chamber, where the member for Fairfax, Ted O’Brien, is today’s “Who’s that MP?” It’s the downhill slide to question time – hit me up with your predictions! The SBS political editor, Brett Mason, has followed up on his FOI request into how much Melissa Price’s recent overseas trip cost (the department came back with a total of $2,515 for 142 hours’ work processing the request) with a statement from the minister herself: “The department arrived at the FOI cost estimate on its own and my office was not consulted,” Minister Price said in a statement to SBS News. “I am more than happy for the costs of my official travel to the UK and Europe last month to be released under normal FOI processes.” Anna Bligh, the spokesperson for the Australian Banking Association, has given the banks’ response to the ACCC inquiry. She says it’s a “complicated” process, but that she hopes that it will show people what goes into the decisions. I look forward to an inquiry that is genuinely and authentically focused on casting more light for the public on the many factors that go into making up our interest rates. I don’t want to pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry, but I do hope that, at the end of it, Australians will have a clear understanding of the many factors that determine their interest rates. The One Nation members have so far raised just $240 of their $15,000 total. The reason the members who created the PHON page want Pauline Hanson removed from the executive and James Ashby gone is: 1. To expel James Ashby from One Nation (Pauline Hanson’s One Nation), and all divisions, for life. &gt; The reason being for bringing One Nation into disrepute due to his actions over the past few years. Ie the American trip to the National Rifle Association with Steve Dickson (Senate candidate), the scuffle and fight with former One Nation Senator Brian Burston in Parliament House last year, the One Nation aeroplane saga and investigations that came with it and for other headlines that have hit the media. 2. To remove Pauline Hanson as President for Life of One Nation federal division. &gt;The reason being that One Nation should be democratic and members should be able to nominate for executive positions within the party. This is also for the better management of the party, which will in the future minimise any litigation that the party may encounter, due to any poor decisions. One Nation has been subjected to this in the past, with Pauline Hanson even being put in jail. You may not be a supporter of Pauline Hanson or One Nation but One Nation is a political party that was intended to hold the major political parties to account. Without democracy in this party, this will never happen. Once again: these are the words from PHON’s supporters. Sarah Vogler from the Courier Mail first reported this on the weekend, but it deserves another look. One Nation appears to be charging its members to attend its AGM this Saturday. As Vogler reported, members have set up a Go Fund Me page because they want to be able to send enough members to the meeting to knock Pauline Hanson off as “president for life” and also “expel James Ashby from One Nation and all divisions, for life”. From the Go Fund Me page: Political parties in Australia should be democratic. When a person joins a political party as a member, they are all entitled to attend the organisation’s AGM and have voting rights. Unfortunately, at the upcoming One Nation annual general meeting on the 19th October, many members will not be able to attend due to the exorbitant attendance fee that the One Nation executive are charging ($150 a ticket and $100 for pensioners). In this case, many members have not even been invited to the AGM. The One Nation executive is headed by Pauline Hanson, who has made herself President for Life, and Pauline’s advisor is James Ashby, who is also a member of One Nation. Pauline Hanson is a Queensland senator, which is more than a full-time job. There are many party members who are of the opinion that Pauline needs to concentrate on her Senate work and leave other capable people to manage the executive and finances of One Nation. Unfortunately, because Pauline has not had the time to dedicate to the management of the One Nation political party, there are party members that believe that she has trusted and let the wrong people in to manage the party. Pauline cannot do every job herself and One Nation and Queensland need all jobs done efficiently and properly. This GoFundMe is to raise money for those members who cannot afford to attend the AGM, to pay for their tickets to go, and vote on important party decisions. To put the One Nation party back on track to being a democratic party once again, some members would like to be able to attend and back the following motions at the meeting. Rod Simms is talking on the ACCC inquiry into banks not passing on the interest rate cuts: This inquiry is going to help us understand what decisions banks make in relation to mortgage interest rates, how they make them, why they make them, what implications there are for consumers and for the community in general. The banking sector that is a very important one. The mortgage rates that consumers pay are often the most important financial transactions that they make. We want to make sure that the customers, consumers, community really understand exactly how banks make their decisions, why they make their decisions, there is often a lot of confusion amongst customers in relation to the big difference between the headline rate, the standard variable rate they see and what people actually pay. It is important to understand why that behaviour happens. It is often quite confusing and frustrating for customers. So we are very interested in finding out what we can to inform customers, inform the community, see where we can improve competition in the banking sector, see where we can get consumers getting better deals under the interest rates. For those looking for the grand plan of why the government’s talking points were released, may I direct you to the age-old adage of “cock-up over conspiracy”. There is nothing in there we did not know. There is nothing in there that has not been made public before. It is interesting from a lol perspective, because these things aren’t supposed to be mass mailed out to the media, and interesting from a news perspective because it shows you what the government believes its vulnerabilities are and the lines it has come up with to counter it. But there is no grand conspiracy. Cassandra Goldie from the Australian Council of Social Services says there is at least one obvious way the government could address Australia’s poverty statistics – increase Newstart: The majority of the Senate, all lower house crossbenchers and the opposition all support an increase to Newstart, along with more than 70% of the community and a wide range of organisations, including the Council of Small Business Australia, the Business Council of Australia and the Country Women’s Association. “We’ve also heard from members of the government that they also support raising Newstart, which has not had a real increase in 25 years, while living costs have gone through the roof. This Anti-Poverty Week, it’s time for the government to get on board and finally fix the country’s major fairness failure. By increasing Newstart, the government can act on poverty while providing much-needed economic stimulus, creating jobs, including in regional areas. Raising the rate will get Newstart working by allowing people to focus on their futures rather than having to be totally consumed with their current situation of financial crisis. We already know what the government is going to say though. It’s the same thing they have been saying since last year. David Littleproud was on RN this morning, and was asked about the latest episode of fish kills in the Murray-Darling Basin: DL: Yeah well look obviously after that horrific event last year, the federal government and the basin state governments came together to make sure that we had a strategy to work together to collaborate and to make sure that we minimise the impacts of these events. We’ve got to understand this isn’t the first of these fish death events; in fact there’s been over 600 in New South Wales alone in the past 30 years. But what we’ve got to do is equip our water managers with the tools to be able to manage the waterways and the natural environment better and that’s why we made an $80m response after the Vertessy report to make sure that these events are minimised into the future. Question: Look, I’m sure listeners will be thinking why did it take a disaster and such a crisis for everyone to realise there was such terrific strains on the system. What is your answer ultimately? DL: Well as I said, these – this isn’t a new event. Fish deaths happen from this, over the last the last 30 years we’ve had 600 of them. The reality is how do we equip our water managers better with the tools and that’s what we’ve looked at and made sure that with the science, $20m extra in science, to equip them with the understanding of how the water moves through the system. What you’ve also got to understand is that the water that was released that many say caused this event, actually created the largest spawning event of Murray cod in our nation’s history. So the water that was released out of Menindee did have an environmental benefit. The water managers used the information they had in front of them at the time that conditions were going to be normal in the sense that rainfall may have come through to replenish it, but it didn’t and obviously that was where a lot of the issues came from so we’ve made sure that we’ve invested in the science and technology to equip them to make better decisions and also make sure that those water flows get through. With using even satellite technology, we’ve invested more than 20-odd million dollars into satellite and remote river sensing to make sure that the flows that are for the environment get through to the environment. Question: You did say in a statement that it was a major wake-up call and with the drought still ongoing, isn’t it the case there are many options open in terms of water management? There’s virtually no environmental water left over for the northern area the moment. DL: Well exactly right. Unfortunately until it rains, it hits the landscape and runs into the rivers. No one has been able to create water and the only way we can is from rain. And so what we need to do is prepare our water managers with the tools to be able to manage that and the community has a role to play, we all have a role to play. There’s reporting in making sure we understand where the hot spots are now and we’ve actually got an interactive map that community can be part of in identifying where they’re seeing water quality diminish and also the lack of water coming through. We’re making sure that we’re working with our state authorities and also making sure that we get this right through simple technology such as aerators, putting them into parts of the river that have stopped the flow to keep the oxygen moving so that we don’t get these fish death events to the extent we did last year. I see in the comments there are some eyebrows being raised about the latest inquiry Labor has ordered (this time in NSW Labor, for what should hopefully be obvious reasons). So you might find this article in the Australian interesting: Jeff Kennett and Campbell Newman have called on governments to wrest back control from bureaucrats and take firm action on major decisions, as it emerged that the Morrison government had commissioned and endorsed 72 reviews in the past year. Analysis of reviews and inquiries supported by the federal government since September last year reveals a range of decisions deferred to departments, agencies and commissions for consideration. It is also anti-poverty week. From Linda Burney’s office: 3 million or 13.2% of Australians live below the poverty line – when defined as 50% of median income; 739,000 children or more than one in six Australian children live below the poverty line; Those on Newstart and Youth Allowance experience poverty at the highest rates; and As many as one in five Australians have experienced food insecurity in the last year. But hey – as Michael McCormack has told us, you can just drive to another town and get a job. SIMPLES. This was bound to happen Honestly - the government could save itself the hassle of releasing its talking points - it has Michael McCormack. Exhibit A “We want to build dams, we are building dams, we are getting on with the job.” In other news, the coffee stain on my desk has suddenly taken on Daniel Craig levels of magnetism. Annelise Nielsen from Sky News takes one for the nation and speaks to Michael McCormack, so you don’t have to. He is very excited about the new dam which was announced over the weekend. He is a walking talking point, and just as interesting. This is also ticking away today. I mean.... Penny Wong was also asked about Gladys Liu. She says the most telling part of the whole saga was that Scott Morrison, along with the rest of the government, were unwilling to stand up in parliament and say that Liu was a “fit and proper person” to sit in parliament. Penny Wong on Scott Morrison’s speech to the UN (Wong is speaking at the Australian Institute of International Affairs): I think the prime minister should explain what he meant in that speech. There are two points in that speech. The most and most important one, we are a trading nation. Australian jobs demand open, fair and transparent trading arrangements and that is why Australia and the Coalition have been supportive of the trade organisation. Scott Morrison wants, for domestic political purposes, to rail against globalism but he is pro free-trade. You cannot be pro free trade and go against globalism. Rebekha Sharkie has introduced a private members’ bill to raise the age of criminal responsibility in Australia from 10 to 14, in line with international standards. Here is what she had to say about it on Sunday, when she released her statement on the issue: Our current laws are not consistent with the medical and social science evidence we have about the mental capacity of children who commit offences and the detrimental effects early contact with the justice system have on our children,” Sharkie said today. We also know that our current laws have a disproportionate impact on Indigenous children with almost 70% of the young people in our youth jails being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. It’s been almost two years since the Northern Territory’s 2017 royal commission into the protection and detention of children recommended raising the age of criminal responsibility. Meanwhile children as young as 10 continue to be arrested and detained for relatively minor offences when we should be looking at diversionary justice processes instead. We need to acknowledge the evidence and we need to act so Centre Alliance is moving legislation for the government to consider and take up.” One for the diary: On Wednesday, 16 October 2019, Democracy 2025 will release a new report that explores the ways in which federal politicians would like to reform Australia’s democracy. The report is the fifth in a series of reports developed by Democracy 2025 that examine how to strengthen democratic practice and bridge the trust divide in Australia. The director of Democracy 2025, Professor Mark Evans, will present the report at a special event at Parliament House. Wednesday, 16 October, 12pm – 1.30pm Committee Room 2S3, Australian Parliament House Panellists include: · Professor Mark Evans, director of Democracy 2025 and co-author of the report · Michelle Grattan AO, chief political editor at the Conversation · Dr Helen Haines MP, member for Indi · Hon Tanya Plibersek MP, member for Sydney · Dave Sharma MP, member for Wentworth · Professor Gerry Stoker, centenary professor of governance, Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis at the University of Canberra and co-author of the report The bells are ringing, and with them, a sense of pervading doom settles over us all. The Greens will be pushing for the parliament to declare a climate emergency. Adam Bandt spotted this on the way into Canberra Someone in Labor has crunched the words on the government’s talking points, and found they mention Labor, or Anthony Albanese, about 40 times. As the great Regina George would say “Why are you so obsessed with me?” The National Prayer Breakfast was held this morning. Seems the tea was hot. From AAP: Aged care royal commission chair Richard Tracey QC has died. The former federal court judge died on Friday, the aged care royal commission announced on Monday at the beginning of a Melbourne public hearing examining workforce issues. Commissioners Lynelle Briggs said Tracey died in California, where he was being treated for cancer diagnosed seven weeks earlier. Australian Associated Press is reporting the aged care royal commission chair Richard Tracey has died. We will bring you more on that when we can. The House and Senate are both about to sit: The committee for the latest inquiry into the family law court will most likely be announced today. That’s the one Pauline Hanson has been elevated to deputy-chair on, despite her already having announced her (abhorrent and evidence-less) views going into it. There has been a push on to have Zali Steggall – who has a background in family law – to sit on the committee. We’ll see if that pays off. In brighter news, the annual “Girls Takeover Parliament” event is on this week. It’s run by Jasiri Australia, which is a “youth-led, expert-guided social enterprise committed to seeing gender equality in our communities and in our leadership”. The bipartisan event will see 60 young women paired up with MPs and senators. At the end of the event a charter will be presented to Scott Morrison. Meanwhile, the parliamentary inquiry into the worst of all hours – question time – continues. The parliament is looking at how it, and other parliamentary procedures, could be made better. Question time is the one hour of parliament that is broadcast. Which means it is the one hour of parliamentary proceedings that most people see. And it’s a joke. It is an absolute farce, which does nothing to promote trust and faith in our democratic system. It is ridiculous theatre that leaves every person who takes part in it worse. That’s just my opinion of course (DEATH TO DIXERS) but it seems, from the submissions the inquiry has received so far, to be a common opinion. If you can’t be bothered putting in a submission, you can take this survey the committee has set up , which is open until 31 October. And on the ACCC inquiry announced today by Josh Frydenberg, the government wants you to know: ACCC BANK INQUIRY The government has directed the ACCC to undertake an inquiry into the pricing of residential mortgage products, particularly after the banks failed to pass on the RBA’s recent interest rate cuts in full. The Inquiry will focus on the period from 1 January 2019. Since this date, there have been three cuts (June, July and October) by the RBA to the official cash rate. Together these cuts have reduced the cash rate by 75 basis points, and the big four banks have passed on an average 57 basis points in owner-occupied home loan rates. The major banks have decided to put their profits before their customers, and that’s not a good outcome for their customers or the economy. As the Reserve Bank governor pointed out recently “lower interest rates put more money into the hands of the household sector and, at some point, this extra money gets spent and this helps the overall economy.” The inquiry will ensure the pricing practices of the banks are better understood and made more transparent by; understanding how banks make pricing decisions for residential mortgages – which is particularly important in the current context of banks not passing on the RBA rate cuts in full. assessing how prices differ for new and existing customers. investigating barriers to switching. The inquiry will consider pricing across the entire residential mortgage market by major banks, smaller banks, and non-bank lenders. But the big four banks will be a key focus of this inquiry, given they hold around 75% of residential mortgage debt. The government is committed to increasing competition in banking and promoting good consumer outcomes in the mortgage market to ensure that consumers can get a better deal. The consumer data right provides consumers with greater access to their personal information giving them power to securely transfer their banking data to other providers to get a better deal. This is one of a number of policies the government is implementing to increase competition. If asked how this differs to the royal commission and previous ACCC inquiries? The financial services royal commission specifically focused on misconduct rather than the way that banks are pricing their mortgages. The ACCC’s previous residential mortgage price inquiry specifically focused on whether the major bank levy affected the prices charged for residential mortgages. The government has also decided to acknowledge the IMF climate report which said Australia would fail to meet its Paris target: We’re taking meaningful action to reduce global emissions with our $3.5bn climate solutions package that will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to meet our 2030 Paris target. Our national target is achievable, balanced and responsible, and is part of coordinated global action to deliver a healthy environment for future generations while keeping our economy strong. In the electricity sector, we are reducing emissions while maintaining reliable and secure supply: The latest official projections show the national electricity market (NEM) is on track to be 26% below 2005 levels by 2022, eight years early. On the back of $25bn of committed investment in clean energy, Australia leads the world with more than double the per capita investment of countries like France, Germany and the UK: If asked – IMF climate change report saying we will not meet our 2030 target: We’ll meet our target without introducing a carbon tax. When Labor were in government and introduced a carbon tax, energy prices went up and industry threatened to take jobs offshore. The IMF report does not take into account our $3.5bn package which maps out to the last tonne how we will deliver the 328mt of abatement needed to reduce emissions to 26 to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. The report also states that under a $75 carbon tax, retail electricity prices would increase by 70-90% in Australia. That is not something we are going to do to Australian households and small businesses. When asked about that on Friday, Josh Frydenberg seemed to miss the question and answered along the lines of “Who said that? Labor?” which is a standard response these days. The government is also pretty into what the party who is not in government is doing. Joel Fitzgibbon has given them some extra steam here: LABOR DIVISION ON ENERGY POLICY Joel Fitzgibbon has backflipped on his recent calls for a carbon tax and again presented yet another position on energy policy – this one driven by self-interest to save his own seat, following huge swings against him at the recent election. Meanwhile Bill Shorten and Penny Wong have recently said they are “proud” of Labor’s reckless 45% target and made the case to keep it. This follows calls by the assistant climate change spokesman Pat Conroy to scrap their 45% emissions reduction target but Labor change spokesman Mark Butler won’t commit to anything. Whether it’s “Chairman Swanny” calling for Labor to keep their $387bn tax and spend agenda or Fitzgibbon looking back to the future then doing a backflip, Labor haven’t learned the lessons from the election and want to rehash policies Australia has comprehensively rejected. We’re taking meaningful action to reduce global emissions with our $3.5bn climate solutions package that will deliver the 328 million tonnes of abatement needed to meet our 2030 Paris target. Under our government Australia leads the world with more than double the per capita investment of countries like the UK, France and Germany. But the best thing about this one, is that the government actually admits that emissions have increased (at least through its notes). For the records, emissions have increased every year since 2014, when the carbon price was scrapped. If asked: recent increases in emissions: Emissions fell 0.4% over the first quarter of 2019. Emissions for the year to March 2019 are up 0.6 % or 3.1 Mt. This small increase is due to an 18.8% increase in LNG exports. LNG production related emissions increased 4.7 Mt. Absent the increase in LNG exports, total emissions would have declined. Australia’s LNG exports for the year to March 2019 are estimated to be worth $47.8bn. While this industry’s success has increased Australia’s emissions, it has potentially reduced global emissions by up to 28% of Australia’s annual emissions by displacing coal generation in importing countries. We are nearly half way towards our 2030 Paris target – emissions are down 11.7% on 2005 levels and the emissions intensity of the economy and per capita are at their lowest levels in nearly three decades. We are also on track to overachieve on our 2020 target by 367 million tonnes. And this talking note, on the drug-testing trial being extended, is actually a WTF moment: DRUG-TESTING TRIAL The Morrison government’s drug -testing trials are part of our commitment to finding new and innovative ways to breaking down barriers unemployed Australians face and supporting them to get back into the workforce so they can take control of their own lives. The government wants to support unemployed Australians become job-ready and given more than 3.5 million Australians already undergo random drug testing as part of their employment, the drug-testing trial is seeking to ensure people entering Newstart and related payments can take advantage of every job offered to them. This measure is about identifying people with substance abuse issues who need our help and supporting them to seek treatment through a $10m treatment fund. Welfare recipients who test positive will not lose a single cent of their payment but will be placed on Income Management for a period of 24 months which will quarantine 80% of their welfare payment on to the Basics Card which prevents spending on drugs, alcohol and gambling. The remaining 20% will be deposited in their regular account. A second drug test will be scheduled within 25 working days of the positive result. After a second positive test, the job seeker will be referred to a medical professional who will assess their circumstances and identify treatment options which can count towards their mutual obligation activity requirements. The two-year drug-testing trial will be rolled out in three locations – Logan, Queensland, Canterbury-Bankstown, NSW and Mandurah, WA and will test about 5,000 people entering Newstart. If asked why the government is trying to push through the testing when parliament has rejected it twice: There is clear community support for the trial as reports in the media today further show. The Labor party needs to explain to the Australian people why it wants to deny the government the opportunity to tackle a problem of drug addiction for people who are not in work. We hope that all parties support this legislation and will work respectfully with all parties to ensure the trial can take place and help as many people as possible. If asked about claims there is no evidence it works: Evidence shows drug addiction prevents people from working. The 2016 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (undertaken by Australian Institute of Health and Welfare) shows that unemployed people were 3.1 times more likely to use meth/amphetamines and 1.5 times more likely to use cannabis than the employed. As the PM said: “This is a trial. We are trying to work out if this can work. I am really puzzled by the level of opposition to the Government trying to tackle a problem of drug addiction for people who are not in work and helping them get over it with referral to proper services and funding those services in those trial areas”. The trial will be subject to a comprehensive evaluation on whether drug testing is an effective way of identifying unemployed Australians whose substance abuse is a barrier to work and supporting those people to undertake treatment. The evaluation will be conducted in parallel with the trial to allow the Government to identify any unintended consequences so these can be addressed in real time. If asked about the trial being likened to a Russian plan to send people who test positive for HIV to an island: It is disappointing to note the fear-mongering around the Government’s proposed drug testing trial which is a genuine attempt to help unemployed Australians overcome substance abuse which is a barrier to work. The Newstart talking points makes my eye twitch a little: No one is saying it’s easy to get by without a job which is why the Morrison government is absolutely focused on helping unemployed Australians be work-ready and creating jobs so working age Australians have the opportunity to gain financial independence. We are delivering results with more than 1.4 million jobs being created since we were elected which is about 240,000 a year compared with just 155,000 on average under Labor. The lowest proportion of working age people on welfare in 30 years is proof that our policies are working. Newstart is a taxpayer funded allowance that provides a taxpayer-funded safety net for people while they look for a job. It is not a salary replacement. It is already increased twice a year, every year in line with CPI which is a widely accepted measure of changes to cost of living. Everyone who receives Newstart allowance is eligible for some form of additional assistance from the welfare system including rent assistance, family tax benefit or the energy supplement on top of the $559 base rate. About two-thirds of those granted Newstart get off the payment within 12 months. The government is focused on breaking down the barriers some Australians face in returning to the workforce which is why we are investing $96m in Try, Test and Learn which is trialling innovative pathways to work for those people at risk of long term welfare dependency. The cashless debit card is financial management tool helping unemployed Australians stabilise their personal circumstances while our proposed drug-testing trial will help identify welfare recipients struggling with substance abuse and provide them with support to get back on track. Welfare cost more than $172bn in 2018-19, representing more than one in three dollars or 35% of all spending by the government. It is the responsibility of government to ensure our social security and welfare system is sustainable into the future, so that it can continue to provide support to those most in need. The Labor party continues to play a cruel joke on Australians claiming to support an increase in the Newstart rate without naming the size of their supposed increase or how they would pay for it. Anthony Albanese wants to outsource decisions on how to spend more than a third of Government spending saying it is a “reasonable suggestion” for an independent tribunal to decide the rate of welfare payments. Not only is this irresponsible fiscal policy but it reveals the opposition leader is not ready to lead because governments are elected to make decisions not outsource the tough ones. If asked could you live in $40 a day? No one is saying it would be easy and the government understands some Australians are doing it incredibly tough. Newstart is a safety net, it’s not meant to be a replacement for a salary. The focus of Newstart combined with our government’s additional supports and programs is to help people who find themselves on hard times and to support them to get back into the workforce. Whether it’s work for the dole, youth jobs PaTH or ParentsNext programs, we’re helping Australians get a job so they can earn a wage that creates a better future for themselves and their families. If asked whether an increase to Newstart would stimulate the economy. This government is focused on policies like increasing productivity and moving people from welfare into work. Our policies like record infrastructure investment, tax relief and investment in schools and hospitals are creating the conditions for jobs growth across the economy and delivering services Australians rely on. The government wants you to know that everything is totally fine with Gladys Liu. From the talking points: Ms Liu has spent a considerable amount of time over the last three weeks reviewing her association with all community organisations. With nearly 1000 Chinese organisations alone in Victoria alone it has been a lengthy task. Ms Liu has very clearly stated that she does not wish to be a member of any organisation that has not received her explicit consent. She has asked that she be removed from all organisations that have not received her consent. Ms Liu is confident that she is not linked to any organisations that may have inappropriate associations. Barnaby Joyce, who was last incensed over toilet facilities at Sydney airport, was feeling reflective on his Twitter feed this morning: The tweet before was about how monopoly ownership of Sydney airport was not healthy, with a shot of out-of-order urinals (save yourself and don’t look – what has been seen can not be unseen). What was left out of the tweet was the Sydney airport was privatised in 2002 – under the Howard government. As first reported by Rob Harris at Nine Newspapers, Barnaby Joyce is the latest person to speak out on behalf of Julian Assange. This is what Joyce had to say to reporters this morning: I, in no way, shape or form, give a character recommendation about Mr Assange. That’s not the issue. The issue is the sovereignty of the laws. And the law is for those you both like or dislike, or have no opinion on. If a person commits a crime in Australia, then you’ll be judged by Australian law. If a person commits a crime in another country while they’re there, they should be judged by those laws. If a person is residing in Australia and commits a crime in another country, I don’t believe that that is a position for extradition. If they weren’t actually there, if they weren’t present there, that is a question for Australian law. We have to follow the principle, even if we don’t have regard for the person. The first subject (after an election list of “priorities” was drought. What is most interesting about this one is that it highlights the parts the government knows it is vulnerable on – no actual national drought policy, issues with the farm household allowance and $5bn of that $7bn repeated total, going to a future fund. SUPPORT FOR DROUGHT-AFFECTED AREAS Farmers and their communities will have access to more support with the Coalition Government announcing it will provide more funding, cut red tape and increase services. This week we announced an extra $13.2 million in support for further on-farm water infrastructure – more than 2000 farmers have already taken up the chance to improve their water access by building new bores, pipelines and desilting muddy dams and the rebate will now also be made available to farmers with permanent crops like fruit trees and vineyards. The support package we announced last week will deliver nearly $100 million to drought-hit communities, which is on top of more than $7 billion in drought support funding already provided by the Government. As the Prime Minister has said, supporting drought affected communities remains our Government’s most urgent priority. That is why he headed directly to drought affected Queensland after he arrives from the US. We are delivering $33 million to resume the Drought Community Support Initiative, which will deliver up to $3000 to eligible farming households experiencing hardship due to drought. We are providing a $13 million extension to the Drought Community Programme to deliver support at the local government level where it counts. Thirteen more Local Government Areas will be provided up to $1 million for local infrastructure and drought relief products. Those areas have been chosen based on Bureau of Meteorology data about current and future weather conditions. We’re also: Delivering the $5 billion Future Drought Fund to help give our farmers tools to prepare for, manage and sustain their businesses through drought. We’ve also been slashing the complexity of the forms to apply and expanding the eligibility of the program If asked: calls for a national drought policy The federal government has a national drought policy and it was outlined following the national drought summit the Government convened last year It includes more than $7 billion worth of measures from supporting people’s mental health to additional assistance through the Farm Household Allowance, as well as our backing for 21 new water infrastructure projects Our response is strategic, comprehensive and focused on both the short-term immediacy needs of farming families and the longer-term future for agriculture in this country None of these talking points are Watergate. We all know that MPs have talking notes – how else do you think they all say the same thing, over and over and over again? And there is nothing new in any of them – we all know the government’s lines on these issues. But it is interesting that the arguments have not shifted, despite the debates having moved on – the government is still pushing the same points it has been pushing since Scott Morrison came to power. But we have come to expect that too. Everything Morrison doesn’t want to talk about is a “bubble” issue, or something he is “not getting into” or “I’ve already answered that” and we all know the issues with getting anything out of government departments. This is just more of the same. And on welfare, which is also an issue which is not going away (and nor should it) the government wants its members spreading these messages: Social services touches almost all Australians at some stage in their lives usually when people are at their most vulnerable which is why it is absolutely crucial that the system remains sustainable into the future so that we can continue to provide support to those most in need. In 2018-19 the government spent more than $170bn a year on social security and welfare, representing more than one in three dollars or 35% of all commonwealth spending. That amount equates to about 75% of the total amount paid in personal income tax As such the system it must be targeted, sustainable and in line with the expectations of the taxpayers who fund it. The government’s position on Newstart, and indeed the prime minister’s position, is very clear: The best form of welfare is a job, and the government is absolutely focused on getting people off of welfare and into work. It is a taxpayer funded allowance that provides a safety net for people while they look for a job and is increased twice a year, every year in line with CPI. It is not intended to be a wage replacement. The Morrison government is delivering the job opportunities with more than 1.4 million jobs created since the Coalition was elected. We are also providing pathways to jobs and breaking down barriers unemployed Australians face getting back into the workforce. Newstart allowance is just one element of our comprehensive social security and welfare system which include additional supplements and allowances, concessional access to healthcare, and targeted support through employment services all play a role in supporting people whilst they transition back into the workforce. Jobs growth and supporting jobseekers to fulfil mutual obligations with employment services and through activities designed to improve their job prospects has contributed to the improved lifetime cost of welfare as well as the significant reduction in people entering the welfare system and reduced persistency of payments. The proportion of Australians receiving working-age income support payments has fallen to its lowest level in 30 years at 14.3%t. There are 230,000 fewer working age recipients on income support payments between June 2014 and June 2018. If asked – 2018 Welfare Valuation Report The latest valuation shows a 10.1% reduction in the total future lifetime cost of welfare in Australia down to $5.7tn when compared to the re-based 30 June 2017 estimates, confirming the success of government welfare to work initiatives. Government initiatives have contributed to this improved lifetime cost of welfare including jobs growth and significant reductions in entries onto payments and decreases in persistency to payments. The full 2018 valuation will be released by government in due course. If asked why do the PIA figures differ from those reported in past years: The 2018 Priority Investment Approach uses a 5% discount rate based on advice from the Australian Government Actuary in line with other government estimations. The government has updated the first three years of valuations in line with that decision so we are comparing apples with apples. Changing the Discount Rate from 6% to 5% is not an accounting trick – it brings the valuation in line with the Budget discount rate and other government publications, demonstrating a realistic and responsible government response to recent economic conditions. Another big issue for the government – border protection – was also on its talking notes list. Kristina Keneally was on Insiders on Sunday (here is some of what she had to say) but it’s Labor’s stance on people who overstay their visas who arrive by air that the government is focusing on. Here is the government line on that for this week: PROTECTION CLAIMS BY MIGRANTS WHO ARRIVE BY AIR In the last three years that Labor was in office, 6,900 permanent protection visas were granted by Labor to people who arrived by air. In the last three years under this government, 4,780 visas have been granted – 3% less than under Labor. The government is focusing resources both on and offshore to prevent unmeritorious protection claims. This includes through enhancements to our intelligence systems and operational activity. Less than 0.25% of people who arrive lawfully in Australia apply for protection, and of them the vast majority are refused. And the numbers of those who do apply for protection are declining. In 2018-19, the number of onshore protection claims fell by 12 per cent, a result of the government’s focus on stopping unmeritorious claims. This number is continuing to decline at similar rate this program YTD. People who arrive by air, do so with valid travel and identity documents. We know who they are. They are not putting their lives at risk, or the lives of their children at risk, by getting on a boat. We won’t be taking any advice from Labor, whose mismanagement of our border was an absolute disgrace. Labor’s boat arrivals saw 50,000 people arrive unlawfully, 8,000 children were forcibly placed in detention, 1,200 people lost their lives, 17 detention centres were opened – all at a cost to the Australian taxpayer of $17bn. If asked about worker exploitation The exploitation of any worker in Australia is something we have zero tolerance for. We take a whole of government, multi-agency approach when it comes to the exploitation of foreign workers – this includes the Australian federal police, the Australian Border Force, state and territory police, the Australian Taxation Office and the fair work ombudsman. Labor claim to be concerned about worker exploitation, but when they were last in government they decimated the fair work ombudsman’s funding by more than $20m, cut their staff by 23% and had no policy to protect vulnerable workers. We have legislated to increase penalties for worker exploitation by up to tenfold, increased the powers of the fair work ombudsman to enforce the law, and increased their resources by over $50m and 60 new staff. Labor’s border protection policies Abolish temporary protection visas. Abolish the fast-track assessment process for boat arrivals. Increase our permanent refugee intake by 71%t, cost of $6bn. Labor has already, through partnering with the Greens, passed a law that removes the government’s ability to determine who comes to Australia from Manus or Nauru. The leader of the opposition voted to ban boat turn-backs. The shadow immigration minister Andrew Giles moved the motion. Kristina Keneally has previously written in the Guardian to “bring the refugees to Australia”. Labor’s track record on border security is clear. They cannot be trusted. And for why the medevac legislation is considered so important by medical bodies, you only need to return to this story from Katharine Murphy a little earlier this year. The medical review panel is not overturning all of the minister’s decisions. We know that, because they have to report to the parliament. In the June quarterly report, the panel, which is chosen by the government, agreed with the minister’s decision in nine of the 15 cases he rejected. Australian medical facilities have not been overrun. Elective surgeries have not been subjected to widespread cancellations (which was actually a claim put forward at the time) and the boats have not restarted. But people who need it, who are under our care, are getting the treatment doctors tell us they so desperately need. On that bolded point in the last post, these are the actual facts, as reported by Katharine Murphy when the bill was still being discussed. The minister has not lost discretion when it comes to security reasons: What discretion does the responsible minister have? Ministerial discretion applies in three areas. First, the minister can refuse the transfer if he or she disagrees with the clinical assessment. The second grounds for refusal is if the minister reasonably suspects that the transfer of the person to Australia would be prejudicial to security “within the meaning of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, including because an adverse security assessment in respect of the person is in force under that Act”. Sticking with security, the transfer can also be knocked back if Asio advises the minister that transfer of the person to Australia may be prejudicial to security “and that threat cannot be mitigated”. The third grounds for refusal is if the minister knows that the transferee has a substantial criminal record (I’ll give you some definitions on that in a minute) and the minister reasonably believes the person would expose the Australian community to a serious risk of criminal conduct. The decision needs to be made within 72 hours. If the minister denies the transfer request on health grounds (as opposed to security or criminal grounds), then the issue goes to an Independent Health Advice Panel “as soon as practicable”. The panel then conducts a second assessment and reports within 72 hours. If the panel reports the person should be transferred on health grounds, and the other vetoes I’ve mentioned are not in force, then the view of the panel prevails. Here is what the government has to say about the medevac legislation. Which MP, you ask? Oh, any of them. This is what the PMO wants them to say, so expect to see varying examples of this throughout the week. Processes for medical transfer already exist and are effective. Section 198B of the Migration Act allows for a transitory person from a country or place outside Australia to come to Australia for a temporary purpose, for example medical or psychiatric assessment or treatment. There are currently over 1,000 transitory persons in Australia. The repeal of the Miscellaneous Measures Act does not remove the ability to medically transfer a transitory person to Australia. It is important to have a single, consistent, transparent medical transfer process with all the necessary protections for the Commonwealth and individuals in place. It is a misconception that the medical transfer provisions inserted by the Miscellaneous Measures Act introduced “doctors” into the medical transfer process. It did not. The Department has consistently relied on clinical advice from doctors to form decisions on whether to bring a person to Australia for medical. It is the Government’s position that it should determine who is allowed to enter Australia, and the terms and conditions to be imposed on that entry, as is the right of every sovereign nation* Medical services in Papua New Guinea and Nauru have improved over time to more effectively respond to transferee health needs and requirements. The need for medical transfers to third countries, including Australia, reduced as medical capacity and treatment options became more readily available in Papua New Guinea and Nauru. Welcome to the 20th sitting day of the 46th parliament – and the third last week of joint sittings for the year. That’s right, we only have three more weeks (or 12 more sitting days) of having both House MPs and the senators in the building at the same time. There is an extra House-only sitting next week, with a Senate-only sitting week next month, but that is it! Before we get there, we have a bunch of things to not talk about. We know that, because the prime minister’s office accidentally emailed the government’s talking notes for the day (the list that goes out to government MPs so they know what line to stick to when questioned on issues) to the media distribution list. I’ll bring you some from that a little later. Josh Frydenberg has announced the ACCC will be looking into mortgage products after the big four banks neglected to pass on the latest interest rate cut from the RBA in full. And Jacqui Lambie, as the swing vote, is facing pressure from all sides over medevac. The government wants it gone. Labor, the Greens and the independents, who worked together to get it passed, want it to stay. In a fairly unprecedented step, the nation’s medical bodies came together in a joint statement at the weekend, asking for it to remain. Lambie says she won’t horse-trade over the legislation but is staying quiet on which way she is leaning. Lambie is taking her time this second go round in the Senate. The parliamentary report into medevac is due to be handed down on 18 October, but the Senate isn’t back until 11 November, so she still has a few weeks to think it over. You’ll have Mike Bowers, Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin and Paul Karp at your disposal, plus what ever percentage of me can be mustered up once I get my third coffee. Stay in touch with us on the socials, or in the comments. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "headline": "Tech firms still seeking venture capital in UK despite high-profile flops",
          "bodyText": "In a wood-panelled auditorium in central London, a procession of entrepreneurs are explaining to more than 100 investors how they will change the world. They just need a few million pounds first. One promises to solve hair loss with a gadget in a cap; another will make fabric out of CO2: all come armed with PhDs, slick presentations and rictus grins. Depending on your viewpoint, this is either a sign of Europe’s flourishing tech scene or further evidence of the investment bubble that fuelled bloated valuations of Uber and WeWork and looks set to burst – with potentially disastrous consequences for the economy. The founders gathering in King’s Cross recently have all come through the six-month Entrepreneur First (EF) programme, which brings together ambitious individuals in the hope that they will team up and build the next Google. The investors are venture capitalists (VCs), willing to bet on early-stage companies that comprise little more than a pair of founders with a big idea. Dr Hira Singh Virdee, for one such firm, takes to the stage and explains how his company will solve the problem of satellites running out of power by shooting lasers at them. Betting on these companies is a high-risk strategy. Matt Clifford, co-founder of EF, says: “You probably lose money on seven in 10, you do a little bit better than breakeven on two, and the last one you need to knock out of the park.” A decade ago, most investors steered well clear of the VC market, leaving it to the professionals. Then central banks around the world slashed interest rates to drive a recovery following the financial crash. That made it harder for investors to get returns, pushing them into areas previously seen as far too risky. Funds flowed into VC, where assets under management almost doubled between 2008 and 2016 to $524bn (£414bn), according to data provider Preqin. With billions in their pockets, investors went on the hunt for startups hungry for capital. With so much money sloshing around the system, funding rounds got bigger and bigger. Critics say that has left startups with money to burn and no need to show how they will ever turn a profit. Martin Kenney and John Zysman of the University of California say this has fundamentally changed the rules of the game. In a paper on entrepreneurial finance, they argue that investors with deep pockets can now take huge bets on loss-making companies and continue to fund them until they crush the competition. Kenney and Zysman say the current system does not just encourage but demands a drive for breakneck expansion. “In fact, a startup that does not grow as quickly as possible is soon overwhelmed by the startup with more capital and more reckless investment.” They argue that many of the companies hailed for disrupting entire industries have done so by raising huge amounts of VC, which allows them to undercut their rivals. Uber, for example, can charge less for rides and pay its drivers more because it raised more than $22bn in VC. Prof John Colley, associate dean of Warwick Business School, says: “The minute you have to charge market rates and pay drivers the normal rate, you’ve got a problem.” Although plenty of taxi firms have folded, he says barriers to entry are so low that competitors will quickly re-emerge when the funding runs out and prices return to normal. For their part, consumers will either have to pay up or cut down on taxis, takeaways, and any other services made artificially cheap with VC money. Colley expects more of the latter. “If you have to pay the full amount to get your Subway sandwich delivered to your home, you wouldn’t do it. That’s the reality.” That, he says, will have an impact on jobs. “Those industries of home delivery and very cheap taxis will probably reduce in size quite significantly. They’re both incredibly big employers.” So when will the bubble burst? Many point to the implosion of WeWork – once a poster child for the VC investment boom – as the beginning of the end. Deals are already shrinking in size and number. Since January, the amount invested by VCs has dropped 23%, compared with the same period last year. In the UK – although amounts invested remain high – the number of deals fell by 15%, according to Preqin. Alice Bentinck, co-founder of Entrepreneur First, says: “It’s reasonably recent that the WeWork and Uber stories are coming through, and maybe we will see a correction at some point in the nearish future.” For now, she says, the money is flowing freely. “We’re still seeing valuations go up and up and up, even for these very, very young companies.”"

          "bodyText": "Australia’s banks made a “Houdini-like” escape from revelations about their questionable lending practices as policymakers “opted to sweep some things under the carpet” for short-term economic gain, a new report by Deloitte Access Economics says. The September Business Outlook report, released on Monday, said the housing bubble and the aftermath of the banking royal commission had been expected to put credit growth “in the naughty corner” for an extended period. “But the short term costs to economic growth of reforming banking spooked policymakers, who’ve opted to sweep some things under the carpet and to throw stimulus at housing prices,” the report said. “That will see the banking sector rev up its growth once more. But it also kicks a can some distance down the road.” This month, Guardian Australia revealed that a heavy campaign of lobbying by the banks preceded the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, telling financial regulators not to enforce responsible lending laws “too stringently”. The government’s tone has changed markedly in recent months, from a generally tough-on-banks stance following the Hayne royal commission to a new emphasis on the “personal responsibility” of borrowers. Deloitte Access Economics said that banks’ profits would be tempered by low interest rates, which would squeeze margins more effectively than competitive forces. The report found that slowing global growth has actually helped the Australian economy, which should keep muddling through despite heightened global uncertainty. It said China had responded to the global slowdown with stimulus, which had helped Australians selling products like iron ore and coal into the region. “The bad news is that, although global events have so far helped our economy rather than hurt it, that could change fast. The geopolitical landscape is littered with risks to an extent not seen in decades.” Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The report describes an uncertain world run by “dictators and dumbos”, but says damage done to economies by trade wars and global crises so far appears relatively contained. It said the largest single driver of the slowdown was no longer escalating trade wars, but families and businesses who had “lost confidence in the ability of political leaders to govern wisely. “Amid that rising uncertainty, business in particular has wound back the money they spend today to help them sell more in the future.” In Australia, stimulus through interest rate cuts and tax cuts should limit any damage caused by the drought and the deflation of the housing bubble, provided the economy can steer a course clear of global chaos. “So, absent a spanner in the works from a global threat, Australia should keep muddling through the aftermath of a housing bubble and a drought. Growth won’t be flash, but it should slowly lift. Yet that recovery looks unlikely to develop sufficient momentum to see wages accelerate or to see unemployment fall much over the coming year.”"

          "bodyText": "Millions of people marched against climate crisis over the past two weeks, in some of the largest demonstrations of the millennium. Most people cheered the students who led the rallies – call them the Greta Generation. But now we’ll start to find out if all their earnest protest actually matters. Perhaps the first real test will come on 15 October, when the board of the EU’s European Investment Bank – the largest public bank in the world – meets to decide whether the time has finally come to stop expanding the fossil fuel sector. This should be a no-brainer decision: the bank’s staff has put forward a cogent proposal, supported by campaigners across the continent, that would end loans to new fossil fuel projects by 2020. That plan fits with the facts: when the world’s climate scientists declared last autumn that we would need to have fundamentally transformed our energy sector within a decade, it was clear that the first job was to stop building any new infrastructure. The first rule of holes is, when you’re in one, stop digging. In this case that means no more digging for gas pipelines or ports or anything else that will help lock in carbon emissions for decades to come. In the past week of Guardian reporting we’ve learned that the biggest oil companies plan to increase production as much as 35% in the next decade. It’s going to be hard enough to phase out the vast existing fossil fuel infrastructure in the years ahead: adding new projects at this point is insane. And if the EIB does act, it will send a strong signal to markets and to other lenders. For almost a decade now, observers have understood that restricting the flow of money to the fossil fuel industry is a key part of the climate fight. That’s why endowments and portfolios worth more than $11tn have begun divesting their fossil fuel stocks; last month the University of California system became the latest big player to join in, scrubbing its $80bn endowment and pension fund of fossil fuel stocks. Heck, even a major American utility announced that it was divesting its pension fund because it could see where the future lay. This kind of effort is beginning to actually pinch – Shell said last year that divestment had become a material risk to its business. Lending to this industry undercuts those efforts. Ending that lending would also strengthen the growing movement to stop private banks underwriting climate destruction. The big money-centre banks, the kind that lend to governments and businesses, have stepped up their financial support for the fossil fuel industry in the years since the Paris climate agreement, but a growing citizen movement is calling them to account: last week in the US activists closed down branches of Chase Bank, the largest oil and gas lender. The EIB would also be doing a service to everyone who will be hurt financially as the fossil fuel industry founders. As the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, began warning some years ago, there are massive “stranded assets” represented by oil and gas reserves that can’t be burned if we are to meet our climate targets. This “carbon bubble” hangs over our markets like the housing bubble of a decade ago: if the EIB backs away from new fossil fuel lending, it will help with the slow deflation of that bubble, lessening pressure on the system. But the biggest reason for the EIB to take this step is simple: it responds to the cries of both young people and scientists. Researchers have looked on in anguish for many years now, as their warnings have gone largely unheeded – the results so far this year include the hottest month ever recorded on our planet, giant fires across the northern latitudes and a hurricane that stalled over the Bahamas producing what meteorologists called “the longest siege of violent, destructive weather ever observed” on our planet. The iron law of climate crisis is that those who have done the least get hurt the most, but it’s now reaching the stage where even the affluent are at risk: across California last week hundreds of thousands were without power because the state’s largest utility company shut off supplies for fear of sparking forest fires in this hot and arid autumn. Young people have looked at this data and drawn the obvious conclusion: that we must do far more than we are doing at present. They’ve done the work to understand the crisis that shadows their lives, and they’ve asked adults to join in the fight for a livable future. They’ve also said – loud and clear – that they don’t want to be patted on the head and thanked for providing an inspiring moment. They want action. Action is what the EIB can provide. Obviously there will be pressure from the oil and gas industry to keep handing over public money: that’s evident in the gas industry loopholes that have fractured the boldness of the initial proposals. What had the potential to be an unmistakable signal to the world that the end of the fossil fuel age was in sight could end up a more muddled message if the EIB bends to industry pressure. Anyone who believes in physics and chemistry knows that the time for change is here – indeed, it’s past due. The fifteenth of October is a crucial day in the most important fight the planet has ever faced, and a sign of whether Europe’s governments, particularly those of Germany and Italy, who insiders report have been strongly against a fossil-free EIB policy, will respond with open hearts to the outpouring of hope we have seen in the past weeks. • Bill McKibben is the founder of the grassroots climate campaign 350.org and author of Falter: Has the Human Game Begun to Play Itself Out?"

          "bodyText": "Growth is the default setting for modern economies. Humans innovate and improve, find better ways of doing things. Only when shocks occur is this process of steady advance interrupted. One of the long-established adages in financial markets is that business cycles never die of old age, and there is plenty of historical evidence to support that view. The Depression of the 1930s followed the collapse of a speculative bubble and was made worse by a series of policy blunders. In the mid-1970s, the long postwar boom was brought to an end by the sharp rise in the cost of oil. America’s deep recession of the early 1980s was induced by Paul Volcker who was installed as chairman of the Federal Reserve to beat inflation and did so by pushing up interest rates to cripplingly high levels. The slump of 2008-09 was a rerun of the 1930s only without the policy mistakes. Again, the trigger was a financial crisis that led to a sharp contraction of credit. All of which makes the current state of the global economy particularly worrying, because none of the usual explanations for a slowdown apply. Interest rates are not being jacked up. On the contrary, the big central banks are providing more stimulus. Nor are finance ministries sucking demand out of their economies through tax increases or public spending cuts. Oil prices are steady and there has been no collapse in house or share prices. As Russell Jones and John Llewellyn of Llewellyn Consulting put it in a recent note: “The present situation is highly unusual. None of the negative shocks that customarily trigger a downturn are in evidence … and yet, the macroeconomic environment – never satisfactory at a global level since the 2008 financial and economic crisis – is souring.” On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund will release its latest World Economic Outlook. As the IMF’s new managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, made clear last week it is likely to make grim reading. The pace of global growth has been abating for the past two years. Manufacturing was first to feel the impact, but there have been signs recently that the malaise is starting to hit services. What’s more growth is weakening pretty much everywhere. Georgieva calls it a synchronised slowdown. So what’s going on? Theory number one is that this is simply a soft patch. If none of the usual causes of a recession are flashing red, then the obvious conclusion is that there is not going to be a recession. Theory number two is that global growth is weakening because policy makers are using the wrong tools: too heavy a reliance on rock-bottom interest rates and quantitative easing, too little use of tax and spending. The IMF, which wants countries that have the scope to spend more freely on infrastructure and R&amp;D, has some sympathy for this view. Theory number three is that there are objective reasons why the global economy is heading for a recession but that they are not the usual ones. Protectionism is pushing globalisation into reverse; rising inequality has resulted in a dearth of demand despite a prolonged period of ultra-cheap money. Theory number four cites the work of Nikolai Kondratiev, a Soviet economist who, in the 1920s said the world economy moved in long waves of 50 to 60 years, with an upswing driven by the arrival of a new technology and a downswing associated with its eventual eclipse. Periods of low growth come when the old technological paradigm is on its way out but has yet to be replaced by a new suite of innovations. If this view is right, the past decade will be seen as one such episode. This leads to theory number five, which is that the global economy – rather like a marathon runner in the last few miles of a race – has hit the wall. Growth, even the modest levels of growth seen over the past decade, can only be achieved through the accumulation of dangerous amounts of debt and a reckless disregard for the future of the planet. Seen from this perspective, it is not a question of hoping the fourth industrial revolution – artificial intelligence, genomics, robotics, the internet of things – will breathe new life into the existing model of capitalism. Instead, it means a complete rethink of the model from first principles. This still looks some way off. The initial response to the current slowdown has been to try a bit more monetary stimulus, even though central bankers such as Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank know it won’t really work. There comes a point when cutting interest rates is like pushing on a piece of string, and that moment has arrived. Jones and Llewellyn suspect the next step will be monetary finance, which is where bonds are issued to pay for tax cuts and public investment, and the debt is then purchased by the country’s central bank. Crudely, the central bank prints money to pay for stimulus. It is known as “helicopter money” because governments dump large dollops of cash over their economies. This sort of approach has previously been shunned for fear that politicians will abandon all restraint and will keep spending until there is hyperinflation. Weimar Germany, Mugabe’s Zimbabwe and Maduro’s Venezuela are the examples usually cited. Jones and Llewellyn say there are ways of countering the hyperinflation objection: for example that the extent of the stimulus could be legally limited to 3% of national output over two years. If ever there was a time to give helicopter money a whirl then this is it. Inflation is low, as are long-term interest rates despite high levels of government debt. Sooner or later, a government somewhere will be willing it give it a try."

          "bodyText": "By the grace of God and through the machinations of Boris Johnson, tomorrow the Irish state coach will convey the Queen down the Mall to preside over the state opening of parliament. At around 11.30am, she will address the assembled peers and MPs: “My Lords and Members of the House of Commons, there now follows an election broadcast on behalf of the Conservative party.” Well, probably not, but she might as well. It is always the case that the Queen is a jewel-encrusted ventriloquist’s dummy for the prime minister of the day. When Harold Wilson came to office in 1964, Private Eye put the monarch on its front cover with the speech bubble: “And I hope you realise I didn’t write this crap.” This Queen’s speech is especially inviting of mockery. Mr Johnson, a prime minister more than 40 votes short of a Commons majority, has no capacity to pass any legislation that is the slightest bit contentious. The occasion will not offer any clarification about Brexit, because no one will know tomorrow whether the recently more optimistic noises about striking a deal will amount to anything. It is possible that this will be the first Queen’s speech to be voted down since 1924. That triggered an election, though it won’t necessarily be the case when so many Labour MPs are tremulous about facing the voters. One thing I confidently expect to hear in the script put into the monarch’s mouth is that “my government” is going to be doing much more for public services. The Tories have suddenly started sounding like people who have discovered the joys of spending. Their recent party conference was bedecked with banners booming: “Invest in our NHS, schools and police.” Billions more are promised for “an infrastructure revolution”, splashing the cash on roads and broadband. A big pay rise is dangled before low earners as the reward for voting Tory. The next election will be the first post-austerity election. I don’t mean by this that austerity is actually over for everyone; it isn’t. Nor am I trying to suggest that the extra spending promised by the Tories will repair all the damage done to public services. It won’t. The 20,000 new police officers they are pledging won’t replace all the numbers cut in the past 10 years. What I mean is that the political contest will no longer be framed in the language of austerity. The three elections of 2010, 2015 and 2017 all revolved around arguments about deficits, debts and fiscal rules. In the first two, the Tories prevailed with their case that Labour had spent beyond the country’s means and Britain had to tighten its belt. By 2017, when Theresa May called an early election in an ill-fated bid to improve her majority, a lot of the public had lost patience with austerity. Mrs May’s worst encounter with a television audience was when she was confronted by a nurse who complained that she had not seen a wage increase in eight years. The Tory leader floundered before provoking anger by responding: “There isn’t a magic money tree that we can shake that suddenly provides for everything that people want.” Memories of that, and similar doorstep encounters with aggrieved voters, prompt the Tories to now claim that they have located a lush forest of magic money trees. They are promising the largest annual increase in public spending in 15 years and tax cuts on top. It is not hard to discern why. They are trying to cover the flanks that made Mrs May vulnerable to voter discontent in 2017. The Tories also know that they will need to replace the seats that they are likely to lose in Remain-supporting areas of the country. They hope to do this by taking Brexity constituencies in the north and Midlands represented by Labour MPs. To many of the voters that the Tories are after, state provision matters a lot and the protracted squeeze on public services has been especially painful. Having examined the Tory promises, Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, warns: “The government is now adrift without any effective fiscal anchor.” The steely axemen of austerity now declare that they will spend like an inebriated sailor. In this, the Conservatives are part of a worldwide trend of parties of the right abandoning previous histories of presenting themselves as the people who do fiscal responsibility as they morph into populists. The Trumpification of the American Republicans is the most obvious example. The shape-shifting of the Tory party on spending is a challenge for Labour. A hatred of austerity has been the signature tune of Jeremy Corbyn and yet austerity politics was the making of him in 2015 and it was the saving of him in 2017. One of the reasons he won the leadership in 2015 was the widespread feeling within the party that Labour had failed to mount a sufficiently robust counter to the austerity narrative of David Cameron and George Osborne. Ed Balls and Ed Miliband, who learned their politics as proteges of Gordon Brown, were always nervous of promising very much for fear of being painted as reckless. With Mr Corbyn, it has always been a case of in for a penny, in for a billion. He used austerity to his advantage again in 2017 by changing the nature of the battle. What Mrs May had intended to be a Brexit election turned into a contest in which a lot of the argument was about what her party had done to public services. Since the Tories are always going to attack them as economically ruinous whatever they do, the Labour leader and his shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, have taken the view that they might as well go large, very large, with their spending promises. Mr Corbyn is rather unlikely to join those saying that the Tory pledges are cavalier and unfulfillable because Labour is committed to spending a whole lot more. Labour’s last manifesto came in at something like £75bn of extra spending a year. To the large number of pledges made then, including the expensive promise to scrap all university tuition fees, Labour has added a further massive heap. They came out of their recent conference pledged to deliver free personal care for the over-65s, more generous universal credit, an end to rough sleeping, free prescriptions for everyone, a state-owned bank and a state-owned pharma company to make cheap drugs for the NHS. When it comes to spending, there is no such thing as too much for Corbyn-led Labour. The number and the scale of these additional pledges did not get as much coverage as they might have done because of all the other stuff swirling around Labour’s week in Brighton. One shadow cabinet member groaned to me that he had spent going on for £10bn while the party was at the seaside and barely got a headline out of it because his announcements were drowned out by the furore around the botched plot to depose Tom Watson and Brexit splits. Both parties are running significant risks. Unless Britain’s economy unexpectedly starts to roar along, they are going to have a lot of trouble paying for all these promises without raising borrowing and/or hiking taxes by more than they are admitting. If Britain slides into a recession, they will find it even harder to deliver and a burst of extra spending could well be followed by another dose of austerity. And if Britain suffers a calamitously disorderly Brexit, no one’s promises will be worth the manifestos they are written on. Then there are the electoral risks. Tory strategists are hoping that promising more for the public services will induce amnesia about the austerity years, or at least inoculate them against some of the anger. At the same time, it will make it somewhat harder for the Tories to attack Labour as fiscally incontinent when respected bodies such as the IFS are levelling a similar criticism at the Conservatives. A lot of Labour’s spending promises are individually highly popular. If you pay for your prescriptions at the moment, getting them free sounds alluring. The historical problem for Labour is that wary voters have often concluded that the party’s promises are too good to be true and too lavish to be deliverable. Despite everything that has happened since 2010, Labour still trails a long way behind when pollsters ask voters to rate the parties on their economic competence. Both will fight the coming election by promising an extravaganza of spending. Neither is being at all clear about who will pay for their pledges. I very much doubt that the Queen’s speech is going to leave us any the wiser about that. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

The Weekend is about three women in their 70s – Jude, Adele and Wendy – who come together over a long, hot weekend before Christmas to clean out the beach house of their recently deceased and very beloved friend, Sylvie. By this age, each of these women knows exactly who she is. They know what their lives have been about and they can more or less foresee how things will unfold from here. But, over the weekend they spend together, they find all of those certainties completely shattered. The Weekend is a book about growing older, together with others, and the way friendship works between us over a long period of time. It’s about how old friends can hold each other back – but also how they hold each other up. In the end, I think it’s a celebration of friendship and of change – even within those friendships we tend to think have been cemented into shape by time. It’s about the rewards available to us if we’re brave enough to allow that cement to crack open, to let these essential renewals take place. What were you reading while you wrote it? I loved the slightly old-fashioned, middle-class domesticity of Nina Bawden’s The Birds on the Trees, among others. The interiority of Bawden’s and Alice Thomas Ellis’s books especially, and the precision of their observations, were very appealing to me as I wrote this novel. What will you read next? Christos Tsiolkas’s Damascus. Christos is so adventurous and questing as a writer, taking big risks and exploring new territory all the time, it’s thrilling – I can’t wait to see what he does with an ancient biblical story. Christian White The Wife and the Widow Affirm Tell us about your book. The Wife and The Widow is a mystery/thriller set in a small island town in the dead of winter, when all the summer tourists have gone and only a handful of locals remain. The story is told from two perspectives: the wife of a man who disappears, and the wife of a man whose husband might be a killer. I was inspired by the question: how well do we know the people we love? What were you reading while you wrote it? Practice to Deceive by Ann Rule. It’s a true-crime book about the murder of Russel Douglas, a man who was shot to death on Whidbey Island, Washington. I drew inspiration from the book’s spooky island setting. What will you read next? Silver by Chris Hammer. I’m excited to read it for two reasons. One, this is his follow-up to Scrublands, which I thought was brilliant. Two, Chris Hammer is a charming man and a surprisingly good dancer. Elliot Perlman Maybe the Horse Will Talk Vintage Tell us about your book. Stephen Maserov, former teacher, married to fellow teacher Eleanor, has retrained and is now a second-year lawyer working at mega-firm Freely Savage Carter Blanche. Despite toiling around the clock to make budget, he’s in imminent danger of being downsized. And, to make matters worse, Eleanor, sick of single-parenting their two young children thanks to Stephen’s relentless work schedule, has asked him to move out. To keep the job he hates, pay the mortgage and salvage his marriage, he will have to do something strikingly daring, something he never thought himself capable of. But if he’s not careful, it might be the last job he ever has. Maybe the Horse Will Talk is a love story set in a toxic workplace, a reflection on contemporary marriage, and on friendship. It is also an examination of sexual harassment in the workplace and an exposé of corporate corruption. What were you reading while you wrote it? Among the books I read were: Sergei Dovlatov’s The Zone, Pushkin Hills, and The Suitcase; as well as Vladmir Voinovich’s Monumental Propaganda, and The Fur Hat; Nikolai Gogol’s The Overcoat; and I re-read Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, and Something Happened. What they have in common is an uplifting use of dark humour that I used to keep me going and in the appropriate mood. What will you read next? I think I’m probably one of the few Australians not to have yet read The Arsonist by Chloe Hooper. I’m looking forward to it as soon as my wife gives it back to me. She’s raving about its power. Chris Hammer Silver Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. Silver is Australian crime fiction, a follow-up to Scrublands. It features the same protagonist, Martin Scarsden, although it’s a stand-alone book. Martin arrives in his old hometown, Port Silver, on the far north coast of New South Wales, only to find his best friend from schooldays stabbed to death. And next to the body is Martin’s partner, Mandalay Blonde, going into shock and with blood on her hands. Martin doesn’t believe she’s the killer, so he starts searching for the murderer. But the more he digs, the more he uncovers the town’s festering secrets: more death, drug-fuelled orgies, itinerant con artists, a guru, real estate intrigues, shark attacks and a smuggling ring. But for Martin it’s also an emotional journey, forcing him to confront the traumatic events that befell his family more than 30 years ago. What were you reading while you wrote it? Favourites included: Bodies of Men by Nigel Featherstone; My Sister, the Serial Killer by Oyinkan Braithwaite; Normal People by Sally Rooney; Bruny by Heather Rose; The Rip by Mark Brandi; The Scholar by Dervla McTiernan; and The Lost Man by Jane Harper. What will you read next? There’s a pile! Tiffany Tsao’s Under Your Wings, JP Pomare’s In the Clearing and Christian White’s The Wife and the Widow. Definitely Melissa Lucashenko’s Too Much Lip. Also, Bruce Pascoe’s Dark Emu, even if I’m the last person in Australia to read it! Heather Rose Bruny Allen &amp; Unwin Tell us about your book. Bruny is a political thriller, a satire, a family saga and a love story. A massive bridge is blown up in Tasmania and an international conflict resolution specialist, Astrid Coleman, is brought home to help settle everyone down. Astrid’s brother is the premier of Tasmania and her sister is the leader of the opposition. Their parents are both fragile and there is an election coming in four months. Beyond Tasmania there’s an isolationist US president in his second term, so China is Australia’s newest ally. Astrid hasn’t been home in a long time and the Tasmania she thought was safe in its remoteness is right in the middle of a new world order. Bruny is a fiction set a little ahead and a little to the side of now, but every day that passes it seems to become more relevant. What were you reading while you wrote it? Fascism: A Warning by Madeleine Albright. This personal and global analysis of fascism in the 20th century and how it is now shaping the 21st was powerful research into the fragility of democracy. What will you read next? Favel Parrett’s There Was Still Love. Favel is a writer of particular beauty and craft – two things I admire very much. Kate McClymont Dead Man Walking Vintage Tell us about your book. Below the veneer of polite society in Sydney there is an undercurrent of shifty deals, corruption and skulduggery of astonishing proportions. Dead Man Walking chronicles the murky world of one of the nation’s richest property developers, Ron Medich, and his unwavering desire to do away with his nemesis, Michael McGurk. When you have money, and lots of it, you can buy anything – even murder. In 2009, 10 days before he was murdered, McGurk told me that Medich was going to have him killed. I felt physically ill when he was shot in his Mercedes, in front of his nine-year-old son. There were dozens of suspects as McGurk, himself a practised rogue, had lied, cheated and threatened countless business associates. The “hit” had all the hallmarks of a professional job – yet it was anything but. Dead Man Walking is also a chronicle of bungling hitmen, hopeless standover merchants and senseless snitches. The truth is stranger – and funnier – than fiction. What were you reading while you wrote it? I was also a judge on the Stella Prize, so I was getting up at the crack of dawn to read dozens of the best work by Australian women writers. It was both daunting and inspiring. What will you read next? One Hundred Years of Dirt by Rick Morton. Morton is a gifted wordsmith whose memoir of surviving grinding poverty has had brilliant reviews. Catherine De Saint Phalle The Sea and Us Transit Lounge Tell us about your book. The Sea and Us is about Harold, an Australian man of Czech origin, who has just returned to Melbourne after living in Seoul for 18 years. Harold feels he’s floating and cannot find his footing. He realises his life has always been at a remove. When he rents a room above Verity’s fish and chip shop, meets Ben and searches for Marylou, things start to change. These unlikely friends also seem to be struggling with similar subterranean preoccupations. A bit like the man who searched for the blue bird all over the world, who upon his return, empty handed and exhausted, opens his window to find the blue bird on his windowsill, Harold has found a home where he least expects it – right where he started. What were you reading while you wrote it? Nearly all of Milan Kundera; The Museum of Innocence and Silent House by Orhan Pamuk; The Emperor by Ryszard Kapuściński; and I revisited all of Guy de Maupassant. I realise these are all men – maybe I was subconsciously trying to hear how a sincere masculine voice sounded from within. What will you read next? I have no idea. I’m dying to read Helen Garner’s The Children’s Bach. But strong books are those that decide when they will be read. I’m excited because it’s an event to read Australian writers. They are so deeply rooted in warm irony, doubt and the unexpressed mysticism that is part of this continent. Anna Krien Act of Grace Black Inc Tell us about your book. Act of Grace is – I hope – a novel that reflects the times. It spans the journeys of four characters through Australia, Iraq and the USA. Toohey is an Australian soldier returned from the Middle East, carrying the literal wounds of war in his neck in the form of shrapnel. His son, Gerry, is forced to live in perpetual anxiety that often comes with sharing a home with PTSD. In Baghdad, Nasim is a budding pianist whose family is drawn into the orbit of Saddam Hussein. Meanwhile, in Melbourne, Robbie is coming to terms with her father’s cruelled inheritance. The title, Act of Grace, refers to compensation payments made to Iraqi victims or their families who’d been unintentionally harmed by Australian military. It has always struck me as a bewildering and rather Orwellian term. Throughout the novel, there are numerous acts of grace, bureaucratic and otherwise, upon which the characters lives turn – and in each of these acts there is the question: just how graceful is this? What were you reading while you wrote it? There were many books but one standout is Geraldine Brooks’ Nine Parts of Desire. Brooks was a foreign correspondent in the Middle East for six years and was initially thwarted from doing her job because of her gender. But then, after a brief spell of sulking, she realised she had access to an extraordinary and often unseen world, that of course many of her male colleagues not only could not access, but failed to see this as a loss. Brooks’ journey into the daily lives of Muslim women is compassionate, brave, revealing and thrilling. What will you read next? Rick Morton’s One Hundred Years of Dirt. I’m so excited to crack this memoir open. There is so much discussion in Australia about identity and yet so little has been said about class, it is almost as if people don’t believe it exists or that it is a legitimate factor in modern life. Morton’s journalism doesn’t do this. He is incisive, honest and compassionate, and never shirks from popping a bubble. Judy Nunn Khaki Town William Heinemann Australia Tell us about your book. Khaki Town is set in Townsville, north Queensland, in early 1942, following the fall of Singapore and the bombing of Darwin. It was a time when our country was on the brink of invasion by the Japanese, and American soldiers flooded into Townsville by the thousands preparatory to the major conflict that was to take place in the Pacific. Segregation being rife in the US, there was friction between the black and white US troops and it exploded in a nasty incident on the Ross River outside Townsville. I’ve used this backdrop and this particular incident as the basis for my novel. A mix of historical fact and fiction, seen through the eyes of my characters. What were you reading while you wrote it? “It was a different town”: being some memories of Townsville and district 1942-1945, compiled by Gai Copeman and Diane Vance, and many other research books. If you’re wondering what fiction I might have been reading at the time – I wasn’t. I don’t read other people’s fiction when writing my own. What will you read next? Fortune by Lenny Bartulin. Now that I am out on my book tour I am devouring this unputdownable, cleverly crafted plot that spans 100 years from the Napoleonic wars to the first world war, with multitudinous, fascinating characters. Loving every word of it."

          "headline": "20 of the best Alps ski resorts by train",
          "bodyText": "SWITZERLAND Nendaz This delightful old Valais village, with its timber houses, barns and grain stores, is part of the Quatre Vallées ski region, made up of Verbier, Veysonnaz, Nendaz and Thyon. There’s 412km of pistes, plus 12km of cross-country ski trails, 100km of winter hiking trails and 40km of snowshoe tracks. So even if you don’t do downhill skiing or snowboarding there’s plenty for you. Be sure to check out the glacier on Mont-Fort, from where the view encompasses peaks including the Matterhorn and Mont Blanc. Experts skiers won’t be disappointed by the challenges, with seven marked freeride areas that include Eteygeon and Plan-du-Fou, and the deserted descent at the back of Mont-Fort. By train: 9¾ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 06.18 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 11.56 TGV to Lausanne and then take the 15.50 InterRegio train to Sion, arriving at 16.57. From there it’s 25 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £165. Stay Hotel Mont Fort (doubles from €144 B&amp;B) has a spacious bar and lounge. Adelboden In the picturesque Bernese Oberland, this beautiful village has a loyal following of people who appreciate the blend of spectacular scenery, intermediate-friendly slopes and unfussy charm. There’s 86km of piste, straddling the peaks to the resort of Lenk, with outlying resorts (accessed by bus) notching the total terrain area up to 200km. Many hotels here take pride in their spa facilities, knowing that the laid-back vibe of the village lends itself to long soaks and pampering. Restaurant Aebi is in a spectacular 220-year-old farmhouse with a vast sun terrace, but in snowy weather, seek out the cosy Chuenisbargli at the top of the World Cup run, which serves traditional Swiss dishes – it’s renowned for its fondue. By train 8½ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.55 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 12.23 TGV to Basel, the 15.31 InterCity to Berne and the 16.39 RegionalExpress to Frutigen, arriving at 17.24. From there it’s 20 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £206. Stay A 71-room design hotel in the village centre, the Cambrian has doubles from €196 B&amp;B. Engelberg This resort in the Lake Lucerne region is a mecca for powder-crazy freeriders. The 3,020-metre Titlis glacier is served by a rotating gondola with a 360-degree view and 1980s classics on the speaker system. The unique topography allows for the possibility of an incredible powder descent, dropping a total of 2,000 vertical metres back to the village, best and most safely done with an instructor or mountain guide, of course. There’s also 66km of pistes, with plenty of decent terrain suitable for beginners and intermediates. There are also several sledging routes, including a 3.5km trail through the snowy Gerschniwald forest, a huge natural ice rink. The huge Benedictine Monastry, which towers above the village and dates from 1120, does guided tours. By train: 10 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 12.23 TGV to Basel, then the 16.17 InterRegional train to Luzern and then the 18.10 InterRegional train to Engelberg, arriving at 18.53. Return fares from £206. Stay Hotel Bellevue Terminus has quirky arthouse design and is centrally situated, with doubles from €142 B&amp;B. Villars With a cog mountain railway all of its own, a variety of ski slopes and plenty going on outside of the skiing, Villars has the kind of rounded feel that makes it an attractive resort for families in particular. The town’s relaxed, old-school vibe means the emphasis is on eating as much as skiing. But there are some gems on the slopes here, one of the best runs being the Combe d’Audon, with a dramatic cliff face rising up on the right. On a linked ski pass are the neighbouring resorts of Les Diablerets, with its 3,000-metre glacier, and Leysin. Often overlooked here are great freeriding possibilities too. So if some of your party insist on a long lunch, others can break off and come back bragging about the untouched powder they found. By train:9 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.31 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 11.57 TGV to Geneva and then the 16.12 InterRegio train to Aigle, arriving at 17.22. From there it’s 20 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £164. Stay Alpe Fleurie (doubles from £130 room-only) is a friendly, old-school Swiss chalet. FRANCE La Plagne The slope-side location of much of the accommodation in the 12 villages that make up the resort of La Plagne means you can clip on your skis and moments later be exploring the 425km of pistes of the huge Paradiski ski area. With 70% of the terrain above 2,000 metres, La Plagne is a good choice for early and late season trips. There’s also a 22-metre ice-climbing wall in Champagny, cheese fondue nights (€29pp) at the Igloo Village restaurant above Plagne Bellecôte, and a converted piste-bashing machine complete with jacuzzi that you can spend the night in (€320 B&amp;B for two). The village of Belle Plagne has a Deep Nature spa, with outdoor pool and treatments from €49. In the second week of April, the Subli’Cimes festival, spread across five peaks, offers games and magic shows for children, concerts, silent discos and hot tubs. By train: 8 hours Depart London St Pancras on the Saturdays-only 09.45 Eurostar ski train to Aime la Plagne, arriving at 18.46. From there it’s 30-40 minutes by taxi or bus. Return fares from £160. Stay The seven-room Hotel Le Cocoon (doubles from €150 B&amp;B) at Plagne 1800 has a boutique feel and views of Mont Blanc. Les Gets Les Gets is part of the vast Portes du Soleil ski area, with 600km of pistes, but the resort’s own mountain, Mont Chéry, has blissfully quiet slopes. The village itself is a charmer, dotted with Savoyarde chalet buildings. This season a new spa and wellness centre, Les Sources du Chéry, will open at the foot of the slopes, for a “ski-in/chill-out” experience. The resort is also introducing dog sledding for two- to 12-year-olds, following a trail though the Mont Caly area with musher Didier. In the evenings, a new speakeasy-style restaurant, Les Durs à Cuire, has menus in 1930s newspaper style, with tantalising items such as seven-hour lamb and forbidden cheesecake. By train: 9¾ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon for the 12.45 TGV to Annecy, then the 17.32 TER train to Cluses, arriving at 18.36. From there it’s 30 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £145. Stay Hotel Alpina (doubles from €106 room-only) has a pool, jacuzzi, sauna and hammam. Meribel In 1936, a keen Scottish skier called Peter Lindsay founded a ski resort that has been a magnet for Brits ever since. Part of the appeal is the resort’s enviable position at the heart of the Three Valleys ski area, with 600km of pistes and 180 lifts. You can ski here all day every day for a week and still feel you’ve barely scratched the surface. One of the most charming villages to be based at is Les Allues, just 11km from Moutiers train station. The village is a pleasure to wander around, with its stone walls and Savoyard chalets, many of them run by small British operators. In Les Allues, the Tsaretta bar and restaurant hosts regular gigs and attracts a friendly mix of locals, seasonal workers and holidaymakers, while nearby in Meribel centre there are plenty of watering holes for those seeking a late night out. By train: 7¾ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.45 direct Eurostar Ski Train to Moutiers, arriving at 18.27. From there it’s around 30 minutes by taxi or bus. Return fares from £160. Stay Ski Blanc has six cute catered chalets close to the gondola lift in Les Allues from £469pp a week for two. Tignes Gaze out at the panorama from the 3,456-metre Grande Motte glacier, then throw yourself into the 1,350-metre vertical descent – and Tignes’s popularity with intermediate and advanced skiers will be abundantly clear. High-altitude, snowsure slopes make this an ideal playground for those who love to clock up the miles on exhilarating terrain. But it’s not all about the skiing here. You can try your hand as a husky dog-sled musher with three hounds pulling you along for an exhilarating, heartwarming – and somewhat unpredictable – ride. There’s also horse riding on snow, and snowtubing, where you descend on inflated tubes at up to 45km/h, and a “magic carpet” takes you effortlessly back to the top to do it again. In the evenings, new après-ski bar Cocorico has a terrace with live bands and DJs. By train: 9½ hours Depart London St Pancras on the direct 19.45 Eurostar to Bourg-St-Maurice (Fridays only), arriving at 06.16. From there it’s 45 minutes by taxi or bus. Return fares from £160. Stay Chardons’ catered Chalet Amelie in Tignes Les Brevières, has a hot tub and is 50 metres from the lifts from £525pp a week. Vaujany This small village has access to a sizeable amount of ski terrain: the 250km Alpe d’Huez domaine. Its position at the western end of the ski area means the local slopes stay remarkably quiet – so much so that you may find yourself exchanging a nod or wave with passing skiers, as if it would be rude not to. Rustic restaurants such as La Bergerie, off the side of the Villarais piste, is the perfect stop after a powder run, and Chalet du Lac Besson, towards Huez, does meat grilled on an open fire. Evenings in Vaujany are quiet but the Folie Douce après-ski bar, above Alpe d’Huez is a good stop before a home run. In the village, families will love the recently built leisure complex, with its pool, spa and waterslides. By train: 6¼ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 10.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.38 TGV to Grenoble, arriving at 17.45. From there it’s 50 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £108. Stay Meals at Ski Peak’s Chalet Saskia are by renowned resident chef Marcus Cull, from €899pp a week. Val Cenis Not far from Modane station on the TGV route between Paris and Turin/Milan, is the resort of Val Cenis, which has three village bases to choose from: Lanslebourg, Lanslevillard and Termignon. These all access a combined 125km of very scenic terrain, overlooking the Lac du Mont-Cenis. It’s a far cry from the hustle and bustle of big purpose-built resorts, and as such will suit young families and those who appreciate laid-back Savoyarde life. There’s plenty of terrain to keep intermediates entertained here, too, and the resort has an excellent snow record. The evening scene is restaurant focused, with places such as L’Arcelle, Le Terroir Savoyard and Ta Ta’tine serving hearty mountain dishes. And to discover more about the local Beaufort cheese, the Fromagerie Coopérative de Haute Maurienne Vanoise opens its doors to show visitors how it’s produced. By train: 8¼ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.41 TGV to Modane, arriving at 18.47. From there it’s 35 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £124. Stay The Les Chalets de Flambeau apartments, with indoor pool and spa, from £341pp in a one-bedroom apartment (sleeps up to four) for seven nights with Erna Low. Les Arcs It’s no wonder Les Arcs attracts a loyal following. The layout of the slopes allows learners to cruise easy smooth blue runs at high altitude, while the sheer variety of the slopes make it a compelling resort for mile-munching intermediate and experienced skiers. This year, the funicular that connects Bourg-St-Maurice station to the village of Arc 1600 in just seven minutes has been completely renovated. The new trains have panoramic windows front and back with views over the valley. The focus on rail access is part of a sustainability programme that includes solar panels on the Aiguille Rouge and Varet lift stations and the slowing of chairlifts to save energy during quiet periods. The new Folie Douce après-ski bar at Arc 1800 will use waste heat from refrigeration to heat the building. By train: 8¼ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.45 Eurostar direct to Bourg-St-Maurice (Saturdays only, book well in advance), arriving at 19.03. From there it’s seven minutes by funicular to Arc 1600, with connecting buses to the other villages (15–30 minutes). Return fares from £160. Stay Ski Collection offers a week in the ski-in/ski-out Le Village apartments in Arc 1950, which have an outdoor pool and spa, from £472pp. Morzine When it comes to that peculiarly wonderful invention the catered chalet, Morzine is king. There are handsome examples all over the village, many of them converted farmhouses with rustic quirks, the oldest dating from 1771. Many of the chalet operators are small, independent operators who attract return guests year after year to enjoy post-slope cake, canapés, bubbling hot tubs and a home-from-home feel. The resort is in a prime position to explore the thigh-burning 650km Portes du Soleil ski area, with its tree-lined slopes and huge variety of terrain. In the evenings the village is buzzing, and in recent years microbreweries such as Ibex have sprung up. By train: 9¾ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the take the 12.45 TGV to Annecy, and then the 17.32 TER train to Cluses, arriving at 18.36. From there it’s 40 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £145. Stay Independent chalet company Alikats has stunning catered chalets with great catering from £600pp a week. Montgenèvre Few resorts do it better for beginners than this unpretentious village on the Italian border. Its gentle slopes fan out from the cafe-lined centre, making it easy for families to meet up after lessons. Intermediates will be in their element, too: the resort is part of the 400km Milky Way ski area. When the skiing is over, have a swim and soak in the impressive Durancia pool and spa complex. Restaurant menus are full of Italian influences; try the pizzas at Le Capitaine. Evenings in the resort are quiet, but cosy basement cocktail bar La Tourmente is popular with those who aren’t quite ready for an early night – and has live bands, too. By train: 9 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 09.24 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 14.38 TGV to Oulx-Cesana-Clavière-Sestrières, arriving at 19.23. From there it’s 15 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £109. Stay The attractively designed, piste-side Hotel Anova has doubles from €140 room-only and a spa, too. Le Grand-Bornand Situated in the stunning Aravis mountain range above Lake Annecy, Le Grand-Bornand’s little village is steeped in old Savoyarde chalet-style buildings, the wood darkened from years in the sun. The slopes will get a five-star rating from families, because both beginners and more experienced skiers are amply catered for. There are 86km of pistes, or 211km if you include neighbouring Annecy resorts like La Clusaz. It feels like there’s something for everyone, but in a setting that could not feel more relaxed – a world away from purpose-built and big-name resorts. This is also the birthplace of Reblochon cheese, and each week a different farm opens its doors to the ‘“cheese curious” public for guided tours and tastings. By train: 7¾ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; change to Paris Gare de Lyon and take the 12.45 TGV to Annecy, arriving at 16.29. From there it’s 35 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £170. Stay Lagrange offers the spacious Le Village de Lessy apartments, from £683 for seven nights for an apartment (sleeps up to four). AUSTRIA St Anton With its own railway station, St Anton has a long tradition of welcoming skiers by train. Whether you travel through the day or arrive in the morning by sleeper, the approach through the stunning Arlberg valley is the equivalent of canapés before dinner, as Tirolean villages glide by and peaks rear up on either side. The vibe in St Anton is a smooth blend of tradition and frivolity. A must-visit is the History Museum, which traces the development of skiing, including period film footage. The restaurant in the museum’s cavernous atrium is good, too. Some of the Alps’ finest après-ski huts line the pistes, attracting skiers on their home runs like moths to glowing lamps. Oh, and the skiing? A mere 305km of pistes, 88 lifts and 200km of freeriding terrain. By train: 10¼ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 07.52 Eurostar to Paris Gare du Nord; take the 12.22 TGV from Paris Gare de Lyon to Zurich, and from there the 16.40 RailJet, arriving at St Anton at 19.01. Return fares from £208. Stay Family-run B&amp;B the Alkira is 500 metres from the village centre, with doubles from €160 in January. Alpbach Arriving by sleeper train in this Tyrolean village is like waking up in a picture postcard. The village is one of the most beautiful in the Alps, with grand hotels and darkened wooden chalets lining quiet, winding streets. A gondola built two winters ago that links Alpbach with the Wildschönau valley has created the Ski Juwel area, comprising the resorts of Reith, Oberau and Niederau – 145km of pistes in total. For families with young children, the beginner slopes in the centre of the village are very convenient. And there’s plenty of good eating on the slopes, at restaurants like the Böglalm – famous for its Gulaschsuppe, Kasspazl (cheesy pasta) and Gröstl (bacon, potato and onion fry-up) – or with panoramic views at the 2,030-metre Wiedersbergerhorn Hutte. By train: 16¾ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 15.04 Eurostar to Brussels, and then switch to the adjacent platform to take the 18.25 ICE to Cologne; then take the 22.36 Alpen Express to Jenbach, arriving 08.50. From there it’s 20 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £212. Stay Hotel Alphof has a traditional feel and impressive spa, with doubles from €154 B&amp;B. Söll This fun, friendly Tyrolean village is a short hop from Kufstein station, between Salzburg and Innsbruck. Travelling by overnight train gives you more time in the massive Skiwelt ski area and could save you accommodation costs for a night. The slopes are particularly suited to mile-hungry intermediates, with an efficient network of bubble and chairlifts. The most remarkable peak is the Hohe Salve, with its unparalleled vista over the Wilderkaiser mountain range. At this 1,829-metre summit you can have lunch on the revolving, sunny terrace of the Gipfelrestaurant, with views of more than 70 peaks over 3,000 metres high. Younger skiers will love popping in to see the resident skiing “witches” who, in keeping with a local legend, cast spells and brew potions in a hut, the Simonalm, on Hochsöll. Down in the village there’s a good supply of restaurants and bars, with the cavernous, beamed Moonlight Bar a popular spot. By train: 19¼ hours Depart London St Pancras on the 11.04 Eurostar to Amsterdam arriving at 16.11, then take the 18.59 Alpen Express to Kufstein arriving 07.22; from there it’s 20 minutes by bus or taxi. Return fares from £229. Stay Hotel Eggerwirt (eggerwirt.cc/en/) has a traditional Tirolean feel and double rooms from €122 B&amp;B or €146 half-board. Zell am See and Kaprun Set above the magnificent Lake See, this handsome Austrian village has a pedestrianised centre, and a railway station. The distinctive altstadt (old town) has some buzzing bars, plenty of restaurants and a gothic church. The ski area is shared with the neighbouring village of Kaprun, close to the Kitzsteinhorn glacier, which this year will be linked by a new gondola, the 3K K-onnection, to the ski area of Maiskogel, after an eye-watering outlay of more than €80m. The igloo village, with its impressive ice sculptures and ice bar, is well worth a visit after or between runs. And for real adrenalin junkies, the new Black Mamba run from the glacier has angles of 32 degrees. By train: 22 hours Depart London St Pancras on the 11.04 Eurostar to Amsterdam, arriving 16.11; then take the 18.59 Alpen Express to Zell am See, arriving 09.55. Return fares from £229. Stay The elegant Hotel Steinerwirt (doubles from €158) is a stone’s throw from the station. ITALY Sauze d’Oulx If you love carving your way along tree-lined slopes and hunting down mountain restaurants, the slopes of Sauze d’Oulx won’t disappoint. Hidden in wooded enclaves are rustic huts such as Caio Paix, which serves delicious homemade cakes. The resort is part of the vast Milky Way ski area, with 400km of pistes shared with Sestriere, Sansicario and, further afield, Claviere and Montgenèvre. Beginners will enjoy the Sportinia area, with its gentle sweeping runs. The village has a cobbled centre and plentiful places to eat. A good place to begin is the sunlit terrace of the Assietta hotel. A number of restaurants compete to serve the best pizza, among them La Griglia, in the arches of an old townhouse. The resort has long shaken off its 1980s reputation as a magnet for boozy package holidays; now the atmosphere is friendly and vibrant rather than wild.

          "headline": "It’s time to get some perspective over the typhoon when lives are at stake",
          "bodyText": "Firstly, some perspective. There are people living in the suburbs of Tokyo who still do not have electricity due to the typhoon that hit a month ago. Lives were lost and houses were destroyed. Hagibis, which has caused so much disruption to the World Cup schedule, is more than three times the size of the last one. Let’s put rugby to one side for a second. We’re all here living in this micro-bubble of the Rugby World Cup but in three or four weeks we pack our bags and go home. There are hundreds of thousands of people who live here who could be badly affected for the foreseeable future. I feel for the players, fans, organisers and everyone in the rugby world affected but my deepest sympathies go to the people of Japan, some of whom will have to rebuild their lives long after we leave. Don’t get me wrong, I’m as sad and frustrated as anyone that matches have been cancelled and that there are doubts over Japan v Scotland. As a commentator I want to be talking about the rugby, this beautiful country and the wonderful Japanese culture. Yet I entirely understand that when teams and unions have put in four years of preparation, when supporters have spent years saving to travel over here, there is anger and recrimination. There are so many stakeholders here and each has their own frustrations. I’ve had fans asking me for tickets for the quarter-finals on Instagram, you have the England players deployed to Miyazaki while their wives and families are under lockdown in Tokyo. It is affecting everyone. The one thing is that a lot of people back home do not understand the size of this typhoon. It’s not something that we ever see, we get a foot of snow and everything shuts down. This is the largest typhoon seen in Japan for more than a quarter of a century. In the UK it is usually Armageddon over some rain and a bit of frost. As things stand there is optimism that Japan against Scotland will go ahead. It just has to. The No 1 priority for the World Cup organisers is safety but the forecast for Sunday is sunshine. I fully expect that from inside the stadium on Sunday you would not know that there had just been a super typhoon. The problem is more likely to be logistical. Can the safety of fans getting to and from the stadium be guaranteed? But if it has to be played behind closed doors then so be it. I can guarantee that every Scotland player and supporter would rather it goes ahead in an empty stadium than not at all. The legacy of this World Cup depends on it. It’s the first time the Rugby World Cup has come to Asia and this is such a pivotal moment in how the tournament will be remembered. If the game goes ahead and we go on and have what should be a set of breathtaking knockout matches then we get back to talking about rugby. If the game is cancelled and Scotland go home then it tarnishes the competition. We’re already being reminded of what happened with Craig Joubert in 2015 but if Scotland go out because of a cancelled match it would be incomparable. It’s an incredibly tough situation for World Rugby to be in. A lot of people have turned into typhoon experts overnight, suggesting these decisions have been taken lightly. Regardless of whatever decision was made, it was going to be unsatisfactory to some. Whether it’s moving the games, changing the venue or changing the timings, it would have affected someone. It was just damage limitation, quite literally. What the organisers have tried to do is have one option which they can blanket across every single game. They can’t say we can move the venue for one match, but not another. They can’t differentiate in terms of the “importance” of the match. They have to be fair for everyone but in doing that, the upshot is that it is still wholly unfair on some, all which comes with the undercurrent of safety coming first. But I disagree with Sergio Parisse’s comments. I think it’s totally unfair on World Rugby to suggest that a different decision would have been taken if it were the All Blacks facing elimination. I totally understand his anger but I do not believe for a second World Rugby is acting in that way. Everyone knew the tournament rules and it must be said that Eddie Jones publicly acknowledged the threat from the start. He has experience of typhoons in Japan and was aware of how important it could be to pick up wins early. I know that the players were desperate for the game to go ahead and there were some players who could really have done with the minutes. But England will not be too disheartened and have the benefit of a few days back in the familiar surrounds of Miyazaki – another demonstration of Eddie’s local knowledge paying off."

          "headline": "Here come the hotsteppers! The duo staging a Dance Dance Revolution",
          "bodyText": "Dance Dance Revolution (DDR) stirs up a nostalgic feeling in many of us twentysomethings, whether for the triumph of winning or simply the rare excitement of being given £5 to spend at the arcade. The game, launched by the Japanese entertainment company Konami in the late 90s, is simple: step in time with the coloured arrows going up, down, left and right. Step out of line and you lose. Now, the game has inspired Progress, a show amalgamating theatre and dance, and exploring friendship and competition. The duo behind it, Jasmine Price and Nikhil Vyas, met at Durham University. When I drop in on rehearsals, they remember playing DDR for the first time. Vyas recalls going regularly to an arcade in London’s Leicester Square, though he admits: “I spent more time playing the games where you shoot up zombies.” Price recalls jumping up, down, left and right in her local bowling alley in Shrewsbury. I vividly remember playing it in a leisure centre in Cambridge, and long forgotten feelings of humiliation and frustration bubble up as I recall how it felt to be defeated. So I relate to Vyas, who says: “Losing at DDR is a way of looking at what a feeling of failure is in the body. Your body is not able to do what this game is requiring.” Who wins when the pair of them play each other at DDR? “We play in ‘friendship mode’ so we win and lose together,” Price explains. But when pushed, Price tells me that when they first played at an arcade in Croydon, Vyas won. He admits to having had more practice, saying “it was in my bones” and that “Jasmine is definitely the better player now.” Price responds bashfully: “That’s not true, we’re a team, man!” They begin to rehearse, and it’s difficult to tell whether they’re acting for me or interacting with me. I suppose that is the point: Progress allows the audience a window into their friendship; to join in with it, even. They recruit me into a dance revolution in which “there will be public takeover of all open spaces like plazas and parks, and everyone gathers at the same time, unplanned, and starts dancing together”. They set up the Nintendo Wii to play DDR – in Vyas’s dream version of the show, they would have the arcade cabinet but this would be expensive. Besides, there is something satisfying about wrangling with outdated technology. I watch them hover the Wii remote over “friendship mode”… I finally realise why they are so hesitant to play against one another. “Competition is not always about making people more productive,” Vyas explains. “It’s often about making people feel anxious and unhappy.” I consider my own competitive mindset, as I’ve been obsessing over who the winner might be, thereby missing the point. This play is not about winning but about being there for a friend who is losing. There is a satisfying circularity to this production both about and created by two young people who are trying to make it in theatre. They end the show sweaty from dancing, and exhausted from balancing their MA studies alongside Progress rehearsals. The show has given Price and Vyas a way to express their complex feelings towards the competition they see all around them. “Part of us shying away from competing against our friends has informed this show,’’ says Vyas. Price adds: “It’s nice to see two people supporting one another and to remind ourselves that this is a possibility.” Progress is about how to fail, how to support friends in failure, and how to find hope. Price tells me that Monopoly brings out her competitive spirt, and Vyas admits he can become rather ruthless in drama games, but neither enjoy competing with their friends in the theatre industry. Vyas opens up about his competitiveness when it comes to promoting his theatre company, Trip Hazards. “At the fringe it gets hard sometimes, constantly measuring yourself against peers.” Price adds sombrely: “Popularity is literally a measure of your success in theatre.” So why do it? Theatre is a highly competitive industry that is notoriously tough to crack. They smile at each other for a moment, then Price replies as if I’ve asked the most obvious question in the world: “Because we really love it.” Progress is at Camden People’s theatre, London, until 12 October."

          "bodyText": "“Man is the measure of all things: of things that are, that they are, and of things that are not, that they are not,” declared the Greek philosopher Protagoras in the late fifth century BC. What – apart from placing humans rather than the gods at the centre of the cosmos – does this assertion actually mean? Myles Burnyeat, who has died aged 80, showed how the close study of classical texts could be used as a platform for creative philosophical endeavour. Protagoras’ observation is usually called the Man/Measure (M/M) doctrine, though a better translation would frame it in terms of humankind. Does humanity as a whole decide what is (true), or each individual human? And if the latter, does the individual decide what is absolutely true, or only what is true relatively to her or him? Sextus Empiricus, from around AD200, interpreted the M/M as a subjectivist doctrine: each person decides what is absolutely the case. Plato, who died in 347BC, treated it as a relativist claim: what I judge to be the case is the case for me. Yet both Plato and Sextus Empiricus argue that the M/M is self-refuting. Are they right? In a pair of articles in 1976, Burnyeat argued compellingly that on either reading the M/M is indeed self-refuting if tested in debate. If the M/M is interpreted in the subjectivist sense, then it only takes one person to disagree with the M/M for it to be false. The relativist reading is more subtle: does it matter if Protagoras says that the M/M is true only for him, while Socrates claims that the M/M is not true for him? Yes, maintains Burnyeat, it does matter. It is not simply that such a position would condemn Protagoras to isolation within his own private bubble, a bubble from which he could not converse with others; it is the inescapable fact that the M/M is the one thing Protagoras claims as absolutely true; so, again, it will take only one person to disagree with it for it to be false. This critique of the M/M was taken up again by Burnyeat in his book-length introduction to MJ Levett’s translation of Plato’s Theaetetus (1990), where he showed how Plato links it to the metaphysical view that the cosmos is in a state of flux – the view of the Presocratic philosopher Heraclitus. But, like Protagorean relativism, Heraclitean flux also cannot be adequately articulated and defended: there would be no fixed objects to be named and no fixed words to name them. In his paper Can the Sceptic Live His Scepticism? (1980) Burnyeat argued that not only must a philosophical theory be stateable without infringing itself; it must also be liveable, and radical scepticism is not: “The supposed life without belief is not, after all, a possible life for man.” Burnyeat showed how important these questions of logic and epistemology – how we can say we know things – are for how we live our daily lives: do we live in a shared world which we can at least partially understand and in which we can communicate? From detailed textual analysis he led readers to a vantage point from which sweeping vistas of the philosophical landscape are revealed: epistemological, metaphysical and ethical issues come into sharper focus and their intricate connections are made apparent. In his introduction to the Theaetetus he highlighted Socrates’ claim that “philosophy begins in wonder”, and he never lost that sense of wonder, or the capacity to inspire it in others. His book reviews – often in the New York Review of Books and covering modern as well as ancient philosophy – were also works of penetrating insight. In Message from Heraclitus, his 1982 assessment of Charles Kahn’s The Art and Thought of Heraclitus, Burnyeat made a powerful case for why Heraclitus had to choose the paradox form to avoid the pragmatic refutation of his view that human knowledge is inevitably perspectival and can never achieve a complete god’s eye view. Sphinx Without a Secret, his spiky 1985 interrogation of Leo Strauss’ Studies in Platonic Political Philosophy, set off an angry and prolonged reaction in the conservative academic and political circles in the US in which Strauss was revered. Burnyeat was an inspiring and dedicated teacher of both undergraduates and graduates. All his graduate students – I was one of them – received postcards from him, usually bearing just a single reference, such as “Republic 577c-e”. Discovering why that particular passage was so relevant to one’s current work contributed to the fun of intellectual discovery. Born in London to Peter Burnyeat, a shipping merchant, and his wife, Cherry (nee Warburg), Myles attended Bryanston school, Dorset, and spent his national service (1957-59) in the Royal Navy, where he trained as a Russian interpreter, sparking a fascination with Russian and Eastern European culture. In 1959 he won a scholarship to study classics and philosophy at King’s College, Cambridge, followed by graduate studies at University College London (1963-64), supervised by Bernard Williams. After lecturing at UCL, in 1978 he moved to Cambridge and six years later was appointed Laurence professor of ancient philosophy. In 1996 he became a senior research fellow at All Souls College, Oxford. In 1984 he was elected a fellow of the British Academy and in 1987 president of the Mind Association. He was made a CBE in 2007. In 1972 he married Jane Buckley, a lecturer in education and Jungian psychoanalyst, and they had two children, Abigail and Jake. They divorced in 1982, and two years later he married the poet Ruth Padel; they had a daughter, Gwen. That marriage ended in divorce in 2000, and from 2002 until her death in 2003 he was married to the scholar of ancient philosophy Heda Segvic. He is survived by his partner, the musicologist Margaret Bent, his three children and three grandchildren. • Myles Fredric Burnyeat, philosopher and classicist, born 1 January 1939; died 20 September 2019"

I experience this all the time, both in the House of Commons and outside. My white, male office manager is sometimes mistaken for the MP Dawn Butler. He goes really red and has to say: “I’m here with Dawn, and Dawn is the MP.” It takes a while to register in people’s minds that the MP is a black woman. The other day, I ran out of the Commons for a photograph with Thomas Cook employees, accidentally leaving my pass in the chambers. I had to get back in before a debate started. As I was going through security, one of the guards said: “She’s an MP, she’s fine,” but the other guard didn’t want to believe it. The slowness to accept can be exhausting – I have been mistaken for a cleaner by other members of parliament. How do I deal with it? It depends on the day and how much time and energy I have. The way I dealt with the situation in parliament the other day was to throw my hands up and say: “This is crazy!” when the female security guard was trying to convince the male security guard that I was an MP. The way I coped with the person who thought that my office manager was Dawn Butler MP was to say: “Don’t worry. I’m leaving now.” – because I wanted them to understand the consequences of their bias. Sometimes I will say: “I’m not going to expose you, but this is a real learning moment and I hope you will consider your actions in future.” It is about challenging racism and unconscious bias, and making society a better place for everyone. My black colleagues and I have a WhatsApp group. We survive by discussing our experiences – and we gain strength from knowing that we have a supportive base. But it can be exhausting. Recently, I was going to an event with a white colleague. I was carrying the bulk of the luggage because she has arthritis. The person designated to help us approached and asked my colleague if she could take her luggage. She said: “I think Dawn needs help.” She was shocked. I just had to laugh, because sometimes you don’t want to burst someone’s bubble. You have to pick your moments when talking about racial association and bias. Black women are used to having to justify their very existence in a space. Sometimes, at an event, I will stand at the entrance and give the room time to take me in. I am black. I am the MP. There is no one else coming. I am the person. It is as though you are working the whole room in that one moment. If someone wants to doubt me, I have already owned that space. You have to own the situation – otherwise it will destroy you, and who you are. Dawn Butler is the MP for Brent Central"

          "bodyText": "Revenues for Premier League clubs such as Watford and Bournemouth will fall off a cliff unless online piracy is faced down, the world’s largest investor in TV rights has warned. Yousef al-Obaidly, chief executive of the Qatar-based beIN Media Group, which has a $15bn portfolio of sports rights, told the Leaders Week conference in London that he was no longer prepared to bid so much for live sport. “The glorious media rights bubble is about to burst,” he warned. “And the truth is that our industry is completely unprepared. In response to piracy, they are paying lip service to the problem. “If you look at Premier League clubs, if you take Watford or Bournemouth, 88% or 90% revenue comes from broadcast revenues. So if we don’t do anything about piracy, you will have quite a reduction in the value of rights.” Obaidly pointed the finger of blame directly at the Saudi Arabia-backed broadcaster beoutQ, which uses satellite technology to broadcast stolen beIN coverage. He said that 50% of fans in the UK had accessed Premier League streams – with a third not even knowing it was illegal. “BeoutQ stole every single match in the Uefa Champions League for two years straight; every single match in the 2018 Fifa men’s World Cup and the 2019 Women’s World Cup; almost every single major football league game in Europe. The NBA, the NFL, Formula One, the Olympics and Wimbledon,” he said. “And apart from some slow legal responses and the occasional lobbying letter, the response from rights holders is simply not enough. “In fact, the CEOs of Serie A and the Spanish FA continue to see no issue with hosting their flagship Super Cup games in the very country that has been stealing the commercial rights of all their broadcast partners for over two year, destroying the value of the Italian and Spanish game in the process.” Obaidly urged the chief executives of federations, leagues, clubs and broadcasters to start shouting about piracy from the roof-tops, and engaging their sports ministers on the issue. He also said that it was time for cooperation with any governments aiding the pirates must end. “I know that some rights holders currently invest more in their Christmas parties than on anti-piracy.”"

          "bodyText": "England will not take a risk with Billy Vunipola against France after the No 8 sustained a twisted ankle last weekend, but they remain hopeful he will play a further part in their World Cup campaign. Vunipola has undergone a scan on his left ankle and was seen in a protective boot at the team hotel, despite claims from the England coaching staff on Monday that he did not require one. England are still not publicly ruling him out of appearing in his 13th consecutive Test of the year, against France in Yokohama on Saturday, but with qualification for the quarter‑finals already assured it is almost certain he will be omitted. Mark Wilson, who was absent from the matchday 23, is standing by. Vunipola was not able to take part in the training session on Tuesday morning and, while England are keeping details to a minimum, they have opted against sending the 26-year-old player home and summoning a replacement, suggesting a decision will be made on his availability for the knockout stages next week. “We are being overly cautious and if there is any risk that Billy is not going to be 100% we will rest him,” England’s attack coach, Scott Wisemantel, said. Doubts have emerged, however, over whether the match on Saturday will go ahead with Super Typhoon Hagibis changing course and heading for Tokyo and Yokohama over the weekend. The typhoon had initially been expected to cause disruption to Ireland’s key Pool A match with Russia in Fukuoka but now appears headed for the capital. Yokohama, where Japan face Scotland on Sunday, is also under threat for what the Japanese meteorological agency has described as the most explosive typhoon of the year. England and France have already qualified for the quarter-finals, meaning there would be less of an impact on permutations if the game is cancelled and the result deemed to be a scoreless draw. Japan’s match against Scotland, however, is key in determining which two teams reach the last eight. World Cup organisers do have contingency plans – including potentially relocating matches to different venues – but if they end up being cancelled, both sides are awarded two points. “Regarding the typhoon we have no control over the weather and we have to prepare for the game and see how it goes,” Wisemantel said. “Regarding the permutation around the game and shared points we are just concentrating on playing to win. I live in a bubble and I don’t know where the game would be played. One thing I have learnt in Japan is that they prepare for the worst and then usually it doesn’t eventuate.”"

          "headline": "Charlotte Perriand: the design visionary who survived Le Corbusier's putdowns",
          "bodyText": "In 1927, a young Parisian designer named Charlotte Perriand applied to work in the hallowed studio of the great architect Le Corbusier. The response she received was curt. “We don’t embroider cushions here,” Perriand was told. What part, after all, could this 24-year-old female furniture designer possibly play in Le Corbusier’s high-minded plan to revolutionise the modern world? Yet one month later, at the annual Salon d’Automne, the grandmaster found himself at Perriand’s Bar Sous le Toit, or Bar Under the Roof, which re-created a section of her own apartment. Le Corbusier was spellbound; this was the intoxicating hymn to the machine age he had been dreaming of. Nickel-plated copper stools were clustered around an anodised aluminium cocktail bar, while a chrome-plated table nestled beside a leather banquette and a built-in gramophone cabinet. Such riches – yet all cleverly designed to fit into Perriand’s small attic. It caused a sensation. As Perriand later recalled: “The upright Salon hadn’t expected its galleries to bubble with such brazen youth.” Corbusier hired her on the spot. Twenty years after her death, Perriand’s brazen, maverick, youthful spirit is once again thrilling Paris, as an epic exhibition of her life and work opens at the Fondation Louis Vuitton. There are rooms kitted out with trapeze bars, a metallic alpine cabin that looks more like a lunar landing module and chairs in zinging colours that could be straight from the Milan furniture fair. We think of 1920s modernism as a sober, static black-and-white affair, depicted in grainy archive photographs. But this shows Perriand’s world to be as bright as a rainbow and alive with ideas. In one room, a glossy-brown PVC curtain hangs in a cool, blue-tiled bathroom, its slinky folds dangling next to a futuristic aluminium shower capsule that looks as if it could transport bathers to another dimension. Across a chrome-trimmed cabinet is the living area, where a rippling-green glass dining table is surrounded by chairs in mustard yellow and cobalt-blue leather. Beside this is a compact kitchen organised with the precision of an operating theatre. This radical domestic visionappeared in the 1929 Salon d’Automne, two years after Perriand’s attic bar made such an impact. However, the new creation was credited to the studio of Le Corbusier. It was produced to spearhead the arrival of his “Equipment for Living”, which was intended to replace all traditional home furnishings from then on. Many of the pieces have become 20th-century classics: the cube-shaped Grand Confort armchair, the pony-skin chaise longue (a “machine for relaxing”), the leather swivel chair. They were branded with the LC Collection moniker, but their true author was Perriand, who had been tasked with designing the furniture, given that Le Corbusier had no time for such details. He dismissed them as “le blah, blah, blah”. As Perriand said in 1984: “I think the reason Le Corbusier took me on was because he thought I could carry through ideas. I was familiar with current technology, I knew how to use it and, what is more, I had ideas about the uses it could be put to.” The new exhibition shines a welcome spotlight on the woman who devised the furniture and much more, bringing her out from behind the plumped pillows to show her as a pioneering creator of the modern world in her own right. An athletic figure with a close-cropped bob and a penchant for doing calisthenics outdoors, Perriand embodied l’esprit nouveau. She was often pictured wearing a homemade ball-bearing necklace, giving her the look of a lithe component plucked from a finely tuned machine. A wall-sized photograph in the lobby shows her standing topless in the Alps, back to the camera, arms raised. She seems to be giving a big two fingers up to the overblown glass shells Frank Gehry created for the Fondation and the design patriarchy in general. It is a taste of the mischievous spirit that runs through all four floors of the exhibition, charting her seven decades at the forefront of furniture, photography and architecture – from her 1920s interiors to her vast ski resort masterplans, as well as a tea house she built for Unesco in 1993 at the age of 90. Enjoying the ample budget the LVMH coffers provided, the show features a number of precisely reconstructed interiors, inviting visitors to loll on loungers and swivel in replica chairs, immersing themselves in Perriand’s materially rich universe. One of the most striking re-creations is her House for a Young Man, built for the Brussels International Exposition in 1935. An arena for exercising body and mind, it features pull-up rings and a trapeze bar on one side; on the other side of a netting partition, there is a study area where objets trouvés decorate shelves and a rustic rattan chair sits beside a sharp modern desk. For Perriand, there was no prescribed method or style: neither metal nor wood, industry nor craft should dominate, she said, because “we use each in its practical place”. There is an increasingly organic, sensuous feeling to her designs as time goes on, an evolution accompanied in the exhibition by large prints of her black-and-white photographs of beach finds, tree stumps and animal bones. She would comb the beaches of Normandy with close friend Fernand Léger (whose huge paintings dot the show) and lover Pierre Jeanneret (Corbusier’s cousin), collecting “pebbles, bits of shoes, lumps of wood riddled with holes, horsehair brushes – all smoothed and ennobled by the sea … We called it our art brut.” There are echoes of driftwood in the curvaceous wooden tables she made for herself and friends, while a later coffee table takes the form of a chunk of raw marble, as if freshly hewn from a quarry. This coffee table was made during her time in Japan, following the country’s invitation to travel there in 1940 and advise on how traditional Japanese crafts could be improved for export. It seems as if Japanese craftsmanship had a bigger effect on her than she had on it. The show features a version of her famous chaise longue remade in bamboo, while the organisational principle of tatami mats would go on to influence her approach to modular interiors. A highlight from a later trip to Japan is Perriand’s wonderful double recliner, upholstered in bright red and purple fabric, on which a supine couple can face each other, legs in the air. Sadly, this is a one-off, remade for the exhibition. An enthusiastic communist, Perriand became increasingly radical in the 1930s and 40s. On her return to France after the war, she was determined to turn her hand to low-cost furniture for mass production. She again approached Le Corbusier, who was working on the Unité d’Habitation housing project in Marseille, and the response was just as patronising as before. “I do not think it would be interesting, now that you’re a mother … to oblige you to be present in the atelier,” he wrote. “On the other hand, I would be very happy if you could contribute to the practical structural aspects of the settings which are within your domain, that is to say the knack of a practical woman, talented and kind at the same time.” He would ultimately have Perriand develop the compact modular kitchens for the acclaimed Marseille project – and claim sole authorship of the result. But the show makes it clear she didn’t need the helping hand of Le Corbusier to excel. One room is devoted to Les Arcs, the 1960s ski resort masterplanned by a group of architects under the leadership of Perriand, by then in her 60s. While a previous plan had proposed a number of towers, her idea was to nestle the buildings in the folds of the mountain, arranging the apartments in a series of staggered terraces cascading down the hillside, making them almost invisible after snowfall. The buildings are perfectly tuned to their environment. To the south, the setback of the levels provides every dwelling with a generous terrace to catch the sun, while to the north the sloping facade protects the apartments from the snow. Despite accommodating more than 1,000 residents, the complex didn’t require lifts, and it adapted to the hillside contours with minimum impact on the site. A streamlined bathroom pod in the exhibition shows the attention lavished on every detail and her early embrace of prefabrication. But, despite her best efforts to engage with industrial production, none of Perriand’s designs ever made it to the affordable mass market. She had hoped her chaise longue, with its curved tubular steel frame, would go down this route, but discussions with a manufacturer came to nothing. “Our attempts at talks with the Peugeot bicycle company resulted in half an hour of total incomprehension,” she recalled. Only 170 were sold in the first decade. Today, reproduced by Cassina under licence from Fondation Le Corbusier, the celebrated recliner retails in design boutiques for more than £4,000. Not quite the egalitarian equipment for living this card-carrying communist would have imagined. • Charlotte Perriand: Inventing a New World is at Fondation Louis Vuitton, Paris, until 24 February."

          "bodyText": "I took my son to the library for the first time last week. This wasn’t so much for his benefit as my own. Despite his newfound passion for story time, he has no real desire for more books, since he would happily hear one in particular until the end of time. No longer does he seek the narrative heft of Happy Dog Sad Dog, nor the earth-shattering revelations of What’s This on the Farm? for he has become hopelessly infatuated with a new favourite, a desultory effort about a runaway bear. I’d always, quite bravely, said the Nazis were wrong for banning books. Even their reasoning – that indecent literature could warp your mind, or inspire evil in a well-balanced reader – seemed absurd. I now know it makes a kind of sense, because if I read this book one more time I will break into a zoo and head-butt every last bear I find. I hate this book with a passion that frightens me, and I hate the runaway bear himself most of all. If he was my bear and he ran away from home, I’d throw a street party. Its asinine plot and feckless protagonist have no such effect on my son, however, who will drag it to be read 20 times a day. For the sake of my sanity I buried it under a heap of toys and took him to the library to expand his collection. I felt a surge of guilt as I walked in because, like so many who love the idea of libraries, I haven’t used them much since smartphones were invented. I spent a great deal of my childhood in libraries and was delighted to find certain truths remain comfortingly universal – carpet tiles so well-trodden they might as well be lino, arrestingly artful bubble writing in the handmade shelf displays and, of course, the ancient lore of librarian staff… For every two or three pleasant employees there is one who is incoherently furious that people keep coming into their place of work and, rudest of all, reading the books therein. So it was that Todd, all sweetness and light, showed me where the newest picture books were, the best place to pop my pram, and where the little toys might be found. It was left to his colleague Agnes to scowl at me when I asked for a pen, to sneer at my son like he was a stranded, foam-mouthed rottweiler, and to monitor my itinerary around the shelves as if I might, any minute now, pause by the Mystery section and start recruiting for Isis. It was, in short, a little slice of heaven. We left with eight books, a brochure for a culture evening we will not attend, and – joy of joys – Agnes’s last pen. Back home, I produced our dragon’s hoard of new literature for my son, who took one look and, straight away, began rummaging through his canvas box to find his favourite. His little friend has run away again, it seems, and we will all have to bear it a little longer still. Follow Séamas on Twitter @shockproofbeats"

          "headline": "A Short History of London by Simon Jenkins – review",
          "bodyText": "There’s something vainglorious about trying to sum up a city in a book. (I know: I’ve tried it.) The idea that you can bend something so vast and multiple, with so many aspects and trajectories, into an overall story, requires some chutzpah. It is still more difficult if you give yourself a historical sweep, from foundation to the present. In what meaningful way is modern London like its Roman zygote? Both are, or were, trading cities, you could say, with an associated culture of openness, but not much more than that. One approach is to be avowedly personal and restricted in range, as in Nairn’s London, in which the alcoholic architecture critic Ian Nairn rhapsodised about his favourite landmarks and pubs. Another is the fine The London Encyclopaedia, first published in 1983, which offers information without the pretence of narrative. Or you can try something like Peter Ackroyd’s weighty London: The Biography, which presents itself as a sequential work but is best read as an encyclopedia of a personal kind, something you can dip in and out of. At 339 pages, Simon Jenkins’s A Short History of London is a low-calorie Ackroyd, in which the author’s interests and beliefs similarly make themselves felt. His version of London history is more political, literary and architectural than, say, social or technological. He is centre-centric: although he promises to look at the city’s outer suburbs, he does so lightly. His preferred theme is the continuous rivalry and interplay of business and government, represented respectively by the City and Westminster. He is sceptical of the journalistic tendency to announce crises and of the governmental tendency to announce plans to “solve” them, an instinct that makes him somewhat blase about current housing problems. He underplays such momentous state interventions as Joseph Bazalgette’s 19th-century installation of a city-wide sewage system. He prefers the earthy wisdom of a Samuel Pepys or of ordinary Londoners to the theories of officials and experts. The strongest part of the book is that most personal to Jenkins. His formative years as a journalist were at a time when the great postwar project of reconstruction, of clearing swaths of urban fabric to build mass housing and large roads, was foundering on the opposition of residents and conservationists. Jenkins reported and campaigned on the side of the resistance. His sympathies remain clear now. Some projects of this period, in the 1960s and 70s, now inspire nostalgia and revisionism. The Barbican complex, which Jenkins detests, is now loved by many and listed for its historic and architectural interest. Its fans wouldn’t recognise Jenkins’s description of it as depopulated and lifeless. Other modernist housing developments – Kate Macintosh’s Dawson’s Heights in East Dulwich, Neave Brown’s Alexandra Road in Camden, Powell and Moya’s Churchill Gardens in Pimlico – are similarly valued. There is renewed appreciation for a period when affordable housing could be built in large quantities to confident and (in the best examples) thoughtful designs. For Jenkins, though, the dominant story of these times is one of politicians and public bamboozled by planners, transport engineers and, especially, architects made rigid by Corbusian dogma. He celebrates the reaction – the preservation of Covent Garden, the introduction of conservation areas in 1967, which Jenkins describes as “a planning tool with greater impact on London’s appearance than anything in its history”. I’d quibble with his animus against 60s architects – it was politicians who incentivised both the building of tower blocks and the use of flawed industrial techniques to build homes. Some of the early criticisms of modernist excesses were from within the profession. Jenkins claims that architects never apologised for their mistakes: my own memories of the aftermath of this period is that they were agonised by self-flagellation. But it is no bad thing to be reminded that St Pancras station, Piccadilly Circus and Covent Garden were nearly swept away, along with countless numbers of old streets that could have been cost-effectively repaired. Or that a “motorway box”, a sort of inner M25, was going to be driven through the city. No amount of misty-eyed concrete-lust can alter the fact that these were truly terrible ideas. Jenkins tells these stories well, as he does the ways in which property developers got stupendously rich by manipulating naive government planning policies. Jenkins’s handling of the preceding two millennia is clear and informative. Perhaps inevitably, it can get sketchy and sometimes lapses both into disconnected lists of events and into cliche. Do we really need to be told again the Samuel Johnson saw that a man who is tired of London is tired of life? But there are also nuggets and insights – for example, that hostility to the accumulation of wealth is not new: at the time of the South Sea bubble in 1720 it was demanded that bankers be “tied up in sacks filled with snakes and tipped into the murky Thames”. A great book, if a less publishable one, would offer a fuller account of those crucial postwar decades. What we have is a hybrid – an accessible history that is, if a little skimpy, efficient, clear and readable. • A Short History of London: The Creation of a Wealth Capital by Simon Jenkins is published by Viking (£25).

          "headline": "‘Tesco could have gone under’: how Dave Lewis saved the firm from disaster",
          "bodyText": "When Dave Lewis took the helm of Tesco five years ago he whisked his 15 most senior managers off to a remote holiday cottage in Norfolk. There, the assembled executives were forced to step out of the executive bubble and get back to basics: shopping for food and cooking for themselves. It was the autumn of 2014 and the retail giant was in crisis. Its dominance of the British grocery landscape had come to a messy end as it was forced to confront the scale of the shopper exodus from its supermarkets, where the prices had risen and standards had fallen. The grocer had a mountain of debt after years of empire building under celebrated former leader Sir Terry Leahy, but the discovery of a gaping black hole in its accounts was a severe blow for what had been one of corporate Britain’s biggest success stories. Fast forward to 2019 and Lewis’s declaration last week that he had finished the turnaround job he set out to do: the business was once again on “firm foundations” with a “sustainable” growth plan. Profits are rising, the £22bn debt pile he inherited has almost halved and £1.6bn of costs have been carved out of the retailer. The former Unilever executive has also tackled its reputation for aggressive dealings with suppliers, and agreed to pay a £129m fine over the accounting scandal. The Tesco brand “is stronger and customer satisfaction is the highest it has been for many years”, he said. Expressing a desire to travel to Bhutan and spend more time with his family, Lewis said the job had been “all consuming” and it was time to “pass the baton” to a new leader – in this case Ken Murphy, an Irish businessman who has spent much of his career working for health and beauty retailer Boots. The 2014 executive trip to Norfolk is an example of Lewis’s back-to-basics approach. He used it to force his top managers – many of whom were used to crisscrossing the globe on the company’s now long-gone corporate jets – to confront the day-to-day reality of food shopping like an ordinary customer. More importantly, it focused minds on how Tesco’s prices and products compared with those of rivals such as Aldi and Lidl. “I think if you’re in our business and you’re not spending all of your time looking at the quality and the presentation and the taste of the food and the products you serve – what are you doing?” Lewis said at the time. The City was caught off guard by Lewis’s desire to walk away next year, but Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said he deserves to be celebrated as the “bloke that saved Tesco”. “In terms of what Dave Lewis came into, it is mission accomplished,” said Black. “People forget what a shitshow it was when he arrived. There was no credible chairman or non-executives, and colleagues were about to be prosecuted by the Serious Fraud Office. The business was in turmoil. Tesco could have gone under.” Lewis’s first set of annual results in 2015 was indeed a horror show: the company crashed to a £6.4bn loss, he axed thousands of head-office jobs – including the retailer’s famously austere Cheshunt headquarters in Hertfordshire – and closed more than 40 loss-making stores. In the 1990s and 2000s, the big supermarket chains had been engaged in a “space race” – competing to see who could open the most stores. Under Leahy that race was won emphatically by Tesco as it added small convenience stores and huge department-store-style Extras. But the 2015 loss reflected a towering £7bn of one-off costs, including £4.7bn relating to a revaluation of its store estate. Despite Lewis’s overhaul, Tesco’s UK market share continues to drift downwards as the German discounters continue their rapacious expansion. This trend makes Lewis’s decision to move into wholesaling – with the £3.7bn take over of cash-and-carry group Booker – look far smarter than Sainsbury’s unsuccessful attempt to merge with Asda, which was blocked by the competition watchdog. “The big four are competing for a smaller slice of the food market,” said TCC Global analyst Bryan Roberts, who pointed to a prediction that in the long term the discounters would command a quarter of the UK grocery market. “There has been a structural shift into the discount channel that is not going away. It is about coming up with the best self-defence strategy.” One of most successful decisions made by Lewis, who has a background in marketing, was to replace Tesco’s cheapest own-label products with generic “farm” brands and ersatz ranges – such as Bay Fishmongers, Ms Molly’s desserts and Butcher’s Choice – that stood up to comparison with discounters’ products. He also abandoned the Leahy-era ambition of becoming a one-stop-shop, quitting unprofitable sectors like electricals, closing its clothing and homewares website Tesco Direct and selling the Dobbies garden centre chain. “The Tesco business is much leaner, more efficient and has regained its focus on the shopper and delivering value to them,” said Roberts. “There are fewer bells and whistles in the stores, but availability and service levels have improved.” He added that the UK operation was “pretty sorted”, but pointed to a chequered overseas picture. “Poland is still a bit of a shambles – Tesco has a fair bit of work to do there.” One senior grocery industry executive said Lewis had done a good job of stabilising Tesco but questioned the long-term vision for the business, particularly its overseas operation, given the sale of its successful South Korean business and Kipa in Turkey. “Dave didn’t pretend he was a retailer,” they said. “He beefed up marketing and allowed the Tesco machine, which had been abused but was still there, to carry on. He allowed those people to do their jobs. But if you look at the international business, they haven’t bought anything or grown anything. It’s on hold.” Despite Lewis’s efforts, Tesco’s share price still isn’t much to shout about. It recovered from the accounting scandal nadir but, at around 237p, is a long way off the £4-plus seen at the beginning of the decade. “This market has changed fundamentally over the past 20 years,” continued the executive. “Supermarkets have thin margins and a heavy capital [requirement] – and it’s an intensely competitive business. That’s great for consumers but hard for shareholders. I don’t know what is next for Tesco. Maybe Dave Lewis doesn’t either, and that is why he’s going.” Dave’s great deeds September 2014 Acts on a warning from a whistleblower concerned that supplier payments are being mishandled, which had triggered a Serious Fraud Office investigation. April 2015 Reports a £6.4bn loss after booking £7bn of one-off costs relating to a head office job cull and writedowns on store values. September 2015 Sells the South Korean chain Homeplus for £4bn – the biggest in a series of asset disposals. March 2016 Replaces Tesco’s Everyday Value “basics” range with “farm” brands, later introducing “exclusively at” labels such as Bay Fishmongers and Ms Molly’s. January 2017 Strikes a £3.7bn deal to buy Booker, the cash-and-carry giant behind the Londis and Budgens convenience store chains. March 2017 Agrees to pay a £235m fine to settle investigations by the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority into the 2014 accounting scandal."

          "bodyText": "A tip if you are ever visiting Los Angeles: don’t be suckered in by those open-top bus tours of celebrity homes, where some wannabe actor in a headset delivers made-up facts about the Kardashian vineyards. Instead, just take a drive with Este Haim, and experience the history of La La Land as told through the eyes of her and her sisters’ teenage misadventure. “That’s where Eagles recorded Hotel California,” says Este, pointing at an impressive home from the front seat of an SUV while her two sisters, Alana and Danielle, sit in the back. “That’s where Alana had her first car crash,” the eldest and often the loudest of the trio continues, shifting into the authoritative tone of a celebrity TV travelogue as we career over Laurel Canyon. “And this is Jenny Lewis’s house; we snuck into her fourth-of-July pool party wearing Budweiser swimsuits. This was Houdini’s house, then it was Frank Zappa’s house, then it was the house I broke into with all my girlfriends and we held a seance. The police came and we all had to run away; we were like gazelles – they never caught us.” Before they started writing songs, Haim were obsessed with LA rock folklore, reading books about Joni Mitchell and Crosby, Stills and Nash, and forensically studying episodes of VH1’s Behind the Music. When people started taking interest in their own band – before topping 2013’s BBC Sound Of... poll, they would often play covers with their parents, under the name Rockinhaim – they felt prepared after an adolescence imbued in the history of California music. Now, after two albums and the greatest honour of all – a Saturday Night Live sketch parodying them, starring Tina Fey and Nicki Minaj – they have become one of the most quintessential LA bands of their generation. Recently, they have formed a creative partnership with Paul Thomas Anderson who, like Haim, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, an area of LA often sniffed at by trendier residents on the other side of the Hollywood hills. He directed their last four music videos, including new single Summer Girl, which sees the sisters removing layers of outerwear at various Valley locations. “The Valley is still not cool but it’s such a big part of who we are, we ride or die for it,” says Este as we pull up round the corner from their family home. “Growing up, we were surrounded by these virtuoso musicians; not the actual stars who lived in Beverly Hills or wherever you get the actual stars, but like the back-up guitarist for Pink Floyd or a session player for Pat Benatar; it was unpretentious, and these people would show up at our house and want to jam.” That early musical proficiency and confidence around older wizened rockers quickly defined Haim as artists. Emerging at a time when musicians tend to be introverted, electronic and serious (and guitar music has been declared dead so many times the coroner is hoarse) they have bucked every trend: a band of brash, accomplished female musicians playing classic rock while gaining a reputation as professional goofs, whether that’s with their choreographed dance-routine tour announcements or photobombing Liam Payne at the Brit awards. Our first stop is Art’s Deli and we spend 20 minutes perusing a thesis-length menu of latkes, lox and liver in various combinations. I make a few false attempts at starting the interview for real but a perfectly harmonised rendition of Tenacious D’s 2001 album track Explosivo and a discussion about which S Club 7 song they could cover in the Live Lounge get in the way. Once we get into it, it becomes the clear that their sunny disposition has disguised a difficult period for the band. Having toured and recorded almost non-stop for six years – during which time their long-time producer (and Danielle’s boyfriend) Ariel Rechtshaid had been diagnosed with testicular cancer, Alana’s closest friend had passed away and Este continued to struggle with type 1 diabetes, a condition which she had been managing since childhood that caused her to almost faint during the band’s Glastonbury performance in 2013. “There’s times when I look back at that time and I really was running away from my problems – because I could,” says Alana. Danielle, generally the most contemplative of the sisters, was hit particularly hard: “I definitely had a bout of post-tour depression when Ariel got sick; it all kind of just like hit, it hit me really hard.” That darkness can be heard in the band’s new material, which marks something of a musical departure, particularly on two emotionally brutal songs, Hallelujah, a reflection on loss and recovery, and Now I’m in It, a breathy pop ballad in which Danielle sings she feels “alone in my head”. “People think Now I’m in It is a break-up song because I sing: ‘We can’t be friends’ but I’m talking about me and my mind. It was gnarly and I was not OK with myself,” says Danielle. “There were times when collectively all of us were kind of spiralling,” says Este. “I was wanting to support my sister but also supporting her boyfriend; he wanted to get back to work and that was good but I felt guilty that we were sort of making him do the record ... I felt like I had to be strong all the time but most people with type 1 diabetes have depression. You start to get resentful of the disease. But to have my sisters take care of me, and remind me that I wanna dance at my great-granddaughter’s wedding, Hallelujah is a reflection of how lucky we are to have each other.” Haim have always worn their musical inspirations on their sleeve, but got mixed reviews for their second album, including the accusation that their nods to tasteful 80s and 90s influences sometimes overwhelmed their own voice. These new songs feel more quintessentially Haim; stripped back and direct, as if they’ve been brewing for decades. “After we’d finished some of these songs we were like: ‘Holy shit this is some of the best songs we’ve ever done,’” says Danielle. After plates of smoked fish are licked clean and excess latke apple sauce is taken to go, we head to Canter’s, a 1950s deli in Fairfax with a tiny club, the Kibbutz Room, in the back, where Haim played one of their first ever gigs. Haim are more than Jewish: they fast on Yom Kippur even if they have a gig and Summer Girl contains an interpolation of lyrics from Lo Yisa Goy, a song sung at Jewish summer camps. As more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, I wonder if there is ever a time they feel self-conscious about their heritage. “The one thing about being in LA: going to a Jewish deli is so normal for us. When we’re touring around America, there’s not just a place that Jews are just chilling,” says Danielle. “It is interesting to us to go to places in middle America where being Jewish is more like being an outsider. We are in a bubble and I think we take that for granted.” As more rounds of pastrami and pickles arrive, there is a more determined tone in the air and the sisters repeat a refrain of not taking any bullshit this time around, particularly from a male-dominated music industry. “I mean,” Danielle continues, “there was definitely a time when we wanted to be on the rock stations, and they were saying that we weren’t rock enough, which felt like a big slap in the face, especially when they play so many bands that make the same shit as us but they’re men and they play them.” “What rock bands don’t understand about us, is that we make fun of ourselves; we love to have fun but sometimes that makes people think we don’t take music seriously,” says Alana as the sisters start to rile each other up. “Yeah! I can go toe-to-toe with any male rock band and blow them out of the water,” shouts Este. The band has had some ugly brushes with the established men of the music industry in the past, particularly from Portishead’s Geoff Barrow who tweets regularly about how much he dislikes them: “Haim are not woman! they are robots sent here from the CIA/Time Warner lab to fill a playlist gap where decent music could be” and “Why the fuk are haim pretending their rise to fame was organic ? Unless massive marketing spends are now considered organic nowadays?” Alana says that Barrow’s tweets did actually push her to take action at one point. “Every fucking week he would say more and more shit. Then we were at this festival somewhere in Finland and Portishead were headlining, we were on just before. I wasn’t going to say anything, but then he started tweeting about us while we were right there in the next dressing room, putting the guitar girl emoji next to the poop emoji, so I thought fuck this I’ve got to say something. I was 21 years old at the time and I saw him, and I was so fucking angry and I literally just got into his face, I said: ‘Stop fucking talking shit about me and my sisters on the internet.’ What happened? “He looked at me and said: ‘Nermmmmmmmm waaaaaaa, blurgggggggh.’ I was expecting him to go: ‘You know what, I don’t like your fucking music’ and then we could have ended it, but all he could do, after months of saying how much he hated us as women and our music, was make a nondescript noise then slowly back away into his dressing room.” When we get back in the car for one final drive, Este is feeling fired up after all the deli meats and righteous outbursts. “You know what: I am going to get us played on KROQ,” she says – and dials the station’s request line, which she knows off by heart. “Hi, it’s Este, Este Haim, Este Haim. It’s Este from Haim! I’d like to hear my song on the radio,” she gets put through to the studio and the DJ sounds suspicious, asking to prove its her. She gives them her sister’s middle names and suddenly he is on board. A few minutes later Summer Girl starts to wisp through the speakers, and car speakers across the city. Although it is often Este who takes these gutsy leaps, it’s obvious that the source of her confidence is the bond with her sisters. By their third record, most bands are sniping about royalties and planning their solo projects, but every hurdle Haim face seems to only make them closer. Whether it’s clapping back at old rock bores, managing a period of misery or getting their songs on the radio: if Haim want something done, they will do it themselves. Haim’s next single Now I’m in It is out in late October"

          "headline": "Conservatives know Boris Johnson is a fraud. But he's their fraud",
          "bodyText": "Westminster is often accused of operating in its own bubble. If only all of its MPs were always that honourable. For the prime minister’s statement on his latest Brexit proposals, the sparsely attended government benches appeared to exist entirely in a vacuum. Both actual and moral. Deprived of oxygen and any contingent sense of reality, the Tories hallucinated a parallel future. One in which the party had reunited behind an impossible dream. Where the past was not so much another country, as another planet. At the cabinet meeting in the morning, Boris Johnson had promised colleagues he would be a model of “gelatinous emollience” towards everyone, including Labour MPs and the EU27. And he was as good as his word. There was no talk of surrender and traitors, no childish tantrums, just lavish displays of courtesy. Except Boris just can’t do sincerity. His whole act is based on a lack of moderation and the time to worry is when he’s being nice. That’s when you know he’s lying. Even more than usual. Conservative MPs know as well as everyone else that the Incredible Sulk is a fraud. It’s just that he’s their fraud. The love affair in which a sexually transmitted disease is already priced in. They know that the new deal is dead on arrival. That a double border, customs barriers and a de facto DUP veto break all the EU’s red lines – not to mention the Good Friday agreement – but they go along with it. Just for the craic. “May I congratulate the prime minister on his brilliance?” said one Tory MP after another. Johnson merely affected an air of false modesty, insisting that the brilliance was all theirs for recognising his own. It was as if Boris had solved the mystery of time travel by coming up with a fantasy proposal, whose sole purpose is to unite the European Research Group and the DUP and command a Commons majority with the help of a few Labour MPs who are now so desperate they will now sign up to just about anything. Even something worse than the deal they had already voted against. Graham Brady was quick to remind everyone that the Graham Brady amendment on which the new proposals were based was named after him, Graham Brady, and he would like it on record that he, Graham Brady, was just happy to have played a minor part in the historic Graham Brady process. Geoffrey “Mad Dog” Clifton-Brown, newly released from house arrest after the tense International Lounge siege at the Tory party conference, promised he’d take out anyone who dared vote against it. Even Steve Baker and Mark Francois, the Mark Thatcher and Simon Mann of the ERG, managed to forget that the new deal still had many of the features they’d really hated in the old one, and declared their undying support for whatever needed undying support. So brave. All that was missing from the Tory love-in was the voice of the DUP. Principally because no DUP MPs were in the chamber. They had all quickly nipped back to Northern Ireland to bank the latest £1bn cheque the government had handed over in return for their support. Brexit was turning into a nice money-spinner for the DUP. Especially when all they have to do is put their name to a deal that’s never going to materialise. It’s like being bribed to support the Flat Earth Society. It shows the state we’re in where the only deal that can find a majority in parliament is the one that is categorically never going to happen. Yet again, Brexit makes fools of fools. Throughout all this, Theresa May sat motionless on the back benches. Her face a rictus of misery. This was a deal even she could have got through parliament. But she had had too much integrity to insult the EU with an offer she knew it was bound to refuse. After an hour, even someone of her almost limitless masochistic reserves had had enough pain. With a quick glance of pure hatred at the prime minister, she stalked out. Alone as always. Not that Johnson cared. He could do the Mr Nice Guy bit just as easily as The Joker. It was all an act anyway. He had no core principles to compromise. Just narcissistic ambition. Brexit was just another play. If the EU was stupid enough to accept his deal, then job done. If it didn’t, then so be it. He was just as easy with a no deal or being forced to ask for an extension. Either way, he had set it up for those EU bastards – sorry, friends and neighbours – to take the blame. Everything was just collateral in the greater scheme of Project Boris."

          "headline": "Marise Payne defends decision to assist Donald Trump's probe into Mueller inquiry",
          "bodyText": "Foreign minister Marise Payne has rejected suggestions Australia is being “dragged into a US political issue” as she defends the decision to assist Donald Trump’s probe into the Mueller inquiry. Following revelations on Tuesday that prime minister Scott Morrison had agreed to a request from Trump to assist the US justice department’s inquiry into the FBI’s investigation of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Payne said Australia was behaving as expected of an ally. “I don’t see it as Australia being dragged into a US political issue,” Payne told ABC radio. “We’re conducting ourselves as you would expect us to do in these circumstances, we are working in Australia’s interests and we are working with our closest and most important ally.” When asked what information Australia would be relaying to Attorney General William Barr who is leading the investigation, Payne did not elaborate. “In terms of material or information that would be exchanged, it is not my practice to comment on the use of intelligence, and secure material but as I said we’ll cooperate as far as we can,” she said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese called on the government to release the transcript of the call between Morrison and Trump, saying Australians needed a “full explanation” of what he said was an “extraordinary” offer. “The prime minister needs to just be straight with the Australian people about what’s going on here,” Albanese said. The government’s defence of its decision comes after revelations in Guardian Australia on Wednesday that Alexander Downer took the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, and senior colleagues by surprise when he relayed information to the American chargé d’affaires in London in July 2016 about his now infamous conversation with George Papadopoulos, then a foreign policy adviser to Trump. Guardian Australia understands Downer’s conversation with Papadopoulos was recorded in a diplomatic cable back to Canberra. But the first senior players in Canberra knew of Downer’s conversation with America’s top diplomat in London about Russia obtaining damaging information about Hillary Clinton from her emails was when the Australian government was contacted subsequently by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more information. That diplomat-to-diplomat conversation, sources insist, was unauthorised. Controversy about the conversations in 2016 has been revived courtesy of Donald Trump’s appeal to Scott Morrison for Australia’s assistance in an investigation aimed at discrediting the Mueller inquiry. The New York Times revealed on Tuesday that Trump made the call to Morrison shortly before the Australian prime minister departed for a visit to America last week. After the call was made public by the Times, Morrison’s office confirmed it. The conversation between the two leaders was, according to a government source, a “polite request” from Trump to cooperate with an investigation being spearheaded by the US attorney general, William Barr. Barr’s inquiry is an investigation of the investigators. Trump has given the attorney general the unilateral authority to declassify intelligence documents and has ordered the US intelligence community to “quickly and fully cooperate”. Trump in the call to Morrison sought a point of contact to facilitate Australia’s cooperation with Barr’s investigation. It is unclear what, if any, specific commitments Morrison has made in response to that request. Downer, a former foreign affairs minister during the Howard era, and at the time of his conversation with Papadopoulos, Australia’s high commissioner in London, told the ABC on Tuesday he had no knowledge of Morrison’s recent conversation with Trump. “These days it’s not something I am privy to,” Downer told the ABC. “I had a conversation with this guy [Papadopoulos], I passed on one element of the convo to the Americans. There is nothing more to it.” Labor is demanding answers. “I think Scott Morrison needs to be very clear about the circumstances around this phone call, what was said and whether any agreement was reached in terms of assistance,” the opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, said. “What Scott Morrison can’t do here is do what he’s had a tendency to do in recent times, which is to dismiss questions which are legitimate from the media as just gossip or as just being in the bubble. “He needs to actually give some straight answers to what are very clear questions.” Morrison did not appear before the media on Tuesday. Guardian Australia has contacted Downer for comment about the events of 2016 but the inquiries went unanswered. Trump is under escalating pressure in Washington with calls for his impeachment triggered by a separate conversation with Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the president of Ukraine. At the root of the gathering impeachment storm in the American capital is a complaint from a whistleblower – believed to be an intelligence official – that Trump was using the power of his presidential office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 election. It is unclear why Trump contacted Morrison in advance of his visit to secure Australia’s cooperation with the Barr investigation rather than raising it during the prime minister’s time in Washington. Morrison dead batted a reporter’s question during his visit about whether Downer had come up. “Well I’m not going to go into private conversations but what we were discussing yesterday were issues about our strategic relationship from trade,” he said. “The frontier technologies, our defence relationships, these were not issues that were there for discussion.” The dialogue between the Trump administration and the Morrison government about cooperation with the Barr investigation has apparently been playing out for some months. On 25 May, Trump blasted Australia before leaving on a trip to Japan, declaring he wanted Australia’s role in setting off the FBI inquiry into links between Russia and his election campaign examined by Barr. Trump said he hoped Barr would “look at the UK and I hope he looks at Australia and I hope he looks at Ukraine. I hope he looks at everything, because there was a hoax that was perpetrated on our country.” Australia’s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, then signalled the government was prepared to contribute to the Barr investigation. Payne said at the time Australia had not yet been asked but “we would, of course, consider such a request were it to be made”. After Trump’s comments, Australia’s ambassador to the US, Joe Hockey, wrote to Barr, copying in the White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney. In a letter released by the Australian government on Tuesday after the New York Times report, Hockey said: “The Australian government will use its best endeavours to support your efforts in this matter. “While Australia’s former high commissioner to the United Kingdom, the Hon Alexander Downer, is no longer employed by the government, we stand ready to provide you with all the relevant information to support your inquiries.”"

          "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us, we are going to leave our live coverage here. Just to recap the main points: The Reserve Bank has made its third reduction in the cash rate in five months. It takes the benchmark borrowing rate in Australia to yet another record low of 0.75%. Governor Philip Lowe said the economy was at a turning point but the prospect of slower jobs growth and low inflation convinced him of the need to act; The Aussie dollar dipped 0.4% to US67.22c; Some economists were predicting further rate cuts this year; Comparison website Mozo said it will put more pressure on the big banks to pass on the cut to mortgage holders; Labor’s Jim Chalmers has criticised the Coalition’s economic management, as did the Greens The government has tried to put a positive spin on the rate cut with Josh Frydenberg saying that the RBA has pointed to “a gentle turning point in the domestic economy” and also urged the banks to pass on the rate cut There has been radio silence from the big four banks. Usually by about this time of the day after a rate cut, one of the big players would have broken ranks to announce their new rates. The banks are under enormous political pressure to pass on the full 25 basis points, but analysts have predicted Westpac, NAB and Australia’s biggest bank, the Commonwealth, will keep some of it for themselves. The cut comes despite a 0.9% jump in house prices in September The share market has enjoyed its best day in nearly a month with the S&amp;P/ASX200 index up 54.5 points, or 0.81%, to 6,742.8 points A quick update on the Australian share market and the dollar via our friends at Australian Associated Press: The Australian share market has enjoyed its best day in nearly a month following the Reserve Bank’s decision to cut the cash rate for a third time this year. The S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Tuesday finished up 54.5 points, or 0.81 per cent, to 6,742.8 points, while the broader All Ordinaries rose 52.4 points, or 0.77 per cent, to 6,853 points CMC Markets chief market strategist Michael McCarthy said that Tuesday’s session had a lacklustre start but then buyers moved off the sidelines once the RBA cut rates mid-afternoon, sending the ASX up 50 points. “A very strong performance, largely built around that rate cut,” he said. Volumes were 10 per cent above average and the market finished at its highs of the day, indicating there could be more gains to come on Wednesday, Mr McCarthy said. The ASX200 is only 2% off the record all-time highs it set in late July. The Aussie dollar meanwhile dipped to a four-week low against its US counterpart, and was close to a 10-and-a-half year low. It was buying 67.02 US cents, from 67.54 US cents on Monday. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive, James Pearson, has urged lenders to pass on the rate cut to “ensure the greatest benefit is gained” by households. He said: “Although we are still to see the full impact of the earlier reductions in the cash rate and personal tax cuts, we believe the timing is right to boost parts of the economy that continue to struggle. “With slowing economic growth and lower consumer confidence, small businesses have been doing it tough over the past year. This has particularly affected discretionary spending in small retail businesses, including cafes and restaurants.” “Weakness in the housing sector has also been a significant drag on the economy over the past year, which has flowed through to consumer confidence and household spending.” “However, there are signs the housing sector has turned the corner recently, with a modest improvement in Sydney and Melbourne house prices. The lower interest rates will help the housing sector to rebuild momentum.” Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has responded to the rate cut by accentuating the positive - that the RBA has pointed to “a gentle turning point in the domestic economy”. He said the RBA had noticed the “positive benefits that have been gained by the economy from the interest rate cuts, from the tax cuts, from extra spending on infrastructure from the stabilisation of the housing market and for the uptick in mining investment”. Frydenberg flew right past all the RBA comments on low wages growth, suggesting that the “significant challenges” the economy faces are “internationally with the global trade tensions between China and the US but they are also domestically, particularly with the punishing impact of the drought and floods”. And of course no rate cut announcement would be complete without putting the hard word on lenders to pass it on: It is the government’s expectation that the banks will pass on this 25 basis point rate cut in full. What this means for an Australian family with a mortgage of $400,000 is $720 less a year in interest payments. That’s a significant benefit to an Australian family. It is completely reckless for the Labor Party to be talking down the Australian economy.” Asked why the government isn’t spending more money to stimulate the economy and how many rate cuts it will take before it will get involved, Frydenberg continued to point to existing policies including the 10-year $100bn infrastructure package. He even claimed that “the Labor Party opposed our tax cuts which are now delivering billions of dollars into the pockets of hard-working Australians” despite Labor voting for the tax cuts in the parliament. Asked if the government is concerned the cuts will lead to house price rises, Frydenberg responded: We have welcomed the stabilisation in the housing market and this is important because it plays into confidence for households and household consumption is around 60% of GDP. We also know that for most Australians owning their own home is not only their dream, it is their biggest asset. They want to see its value appreciate over time, which has been the history in our country. In terms of the clearance rates, they have gone up and in terms of prices they are now starting to go up. So the interest rate cuts have contributed to a stabilisation in the housing market which we welcome.” Whoah. The Reserve Bank’s race to the bottom continued today with its third reduction in the cash rate in five months. It takes the benchmark borrowing rate in Australia to yet another record low of 0.75%. it’s more good news for borrowers and house prices. But bad news for savers and – if you think that the sight of a central bank slashing rates to a record low is something to worry about – it’s also bad news for the economy because it surely means the RBA expects things to get worse.. Anyway, here are the main points: The RBA has cut the cash rate by 0.25% to a record low of 0.75%. It’s the third cut this year ; Governor Philip Lowe said the economy was at a turning point but the prospect of slower jobs growth and low inflation convinced him of the need to act; The Aussie dollar dipped 0.4% to US67.22c; Some economists were predicting further rate cuts this year; Comparison website Mozo said it will put more pressure on the big banks to pass on the cut to mortgage holders; Labor’s Jim Chalmers has criticised the Coalition’s economic management, as did the Greens The cut comes despite a 0.9% jump in house prices in September Labor’s shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers put the cut on the coalition government’s lack of action to stimulate the economy. “If the Liberals were doing a good job managing the economy the RBA wouldn’t have needed to cut interest rates to another new record low today,” Chalmers tweeted. BIS Oxford Economics are getting ahead of the curve, looking for the next big thing. They say we shouldn’t expect a rate RISE until 2021. Chief economist Sarah Hunter says the board highlighted “downside risks to the global economic outlook, and the persistent headwinds facing the domestic economy”. It expected jobs growth to “slow significantly over the near term as the economy absorbs the residential construction downturn and sluggish retail environment”. The bank is also projecting inflation to remain around 2% through to 2021, “which suggests there will not be a rate rise until the end of 2021 at the earliest”. Savers, read it and weep ... Capital Economics says the rate cut today was widely expected but says that the RBA’s prediction of a slowdown in jobs growth (the aforementioned construction slump is a key factor here) points to another cut “by the end of the year”. The bank argued that forward-looking indicators of labour demand point to a slowdown in employment growth. Indeed, employment surveys suggest that jobs growth will slow from around 2.5% now to around 2.0% around the turn of the year. It’s possible that the recent surge in the participation rate fizzles out at the same time, but we consider it more likely that unemployment will climb a bit further. Our forecast is that the unemployment rate will reach a peak at 5.5% in the first half of that year. Meanwhile, we think that global growth won’t accelerate anytime soon. Business confidence will therefore remain muted and investment will probably keep falling. We reiterate our forecast that rates will fall to 0.5% before the end of the year. The comparison site Mozo.com says the rate cut could start a mortgage rate war after the online lenders Athena and Homestar said they would pass on the 0.25% cut to their customers in full. Such a move would put pressure on the big four banks to cut rates and give some more relief to Australia’s debt burdened households. Here’s Mozo director Kirsty Lamont: Online lenders are reacting to today’s RBA cut with lightning speed. They’re turning the screws on the big banks knowing the banks are in an unwinnable position, with the unenviable choice of having to either pass through today’s cut in full to mortgage customers and take a hit to their net profit margins, or hold back part of the cut and risk losing even more borrowers to their cheaper rivals. The Greens say that the RBA has been railroaded into cutting rates because the government has refused to do its bit for the economy by increasing spending. This lack of so-called fiscal stimulus – as opposed to monetary stimulus from the RBA – has irritated senator Peter Whish-Wilson: Without government borrowing to fund an increase in infrastructure spending, record low interest rates are re-inflating the housing market and going towards other unproductive and speculative investments. This is diluting the effectiveness of monetary policy and is railroading the RBA towards QE. Instead of being concerned about this trend, the treasurer actually seems to be cheering it along. Just last week, Josh Frydenberg was spruiking the virtue of further increases in house prices, and encouraged banks to push the limits of responsible lending barely eight months since Commissioner Hayne handed down his report.” The dollar spiked to US67.57c on the news of the RBA cut but has fallen back again in the last few minutes to US67.29c as traders digest the statement from Philip Lowe. In it he clearly lays out the prospect of more cuts – or even perhaps some less conventional policy such as money-printing or quantitative easing. Here’s what the conclusion of the statement says (my emphasis in bold): It is reasonable to expect that an extended period of low interest rates will be required in Australia to reach full employment and achieve the inflation target. The board will continue to monitor developments, including in the labour market, and is prepared to ease monetary policy further if needed to support sustainable growth in the economy, full employment and the achievement of the inflation target over time. Here’s some reaction to the news: Philip Lowe says in his statement that: the bank acted to boost jobs and incomes lower rates overseas have played a factor and more monetary easing – ie more cuts – are still on the table growth is weaker than expected but has reached a “gentle turning point” household spending still weak and wage growth subdued further signs of turnaround in housing market This is governor Philip Lowe’s full statement after his board cut rates to yet another record low. It’s the third cut this year and reflects the bank’s concern that growth is still too sluggish to reduce unemployment and boost inflation. The RBA has cut rates to 0.75% Seconds to go ... Just a few minutes to go before we get the proverbial puff of white smoke from above Martin Place. But in the meantime some interesting commentary from the banking team at UBS. They have taken a fairly bearish view of Australia’s big banks in the last couple of years and they are continuing their sceptical outlook. They say that although the housing credit downturn may be bottoming out, it’s still hard yards ahead for the banks because low interest rates = low profits. The UBS team says that bank shares – the bedrock of all our super accounts – look too high: While the pick-up in lending is positive, bank fundamentals are increasingly challenged with ultra-low interest rates... With ongoing revenue pressure, we expect further dividend cuts and banks to rebase target [return of equity] to more realistic levels for an ultra-low rate environment. Following the re-rating, banks look expensive on 15.6x and 1.7x book with a falling EPS profile over the medium term. Across the ditch, a plunge in business confidence is continuing to hurt the New Zealand dollar. It has fallen below US62.49c, the lowest since September 2015. The RBNZ caught markets off guard in August when it cut rates by 0.5% to 1%. There were also encouraging numbers today from the Australian Industry Group (AiGroup) manufacturing index, which rose from 53.1 points to 54.7 points in September. However, another closely watched snapshot of the economy, the CBA/IHS Markit manufacturing purchasing managers’ index, fell from 50.9 points to 50.3 points. Any reading over 50 indicates expansion so the numbers tend to suggest the economy is travelling OK. Not every Liberal in Canberra is hoping for a rate cut. My colleague Paul Karp has this: Liberal MP Tim Wilson, the chair of the House of Representatives economics committee, has told Guardian Australia that he hopes the RBA leaves interest rates on hold to give savers a break. My hope is that the RBA leaves interest rates alone. There’s not sufficient evidence that there’s pass through from the last two rate cuts to stimulate the economy but there is evidence it is fuelling house price rises and ultimately higher debt. Wilson has challenged the RBA to justify the effectiveness of monetary policy prompting a lengthy response from the central bank arguing - yes - rate cuts still work. The RBA said: In aggregate, Australian households benefit from the effect of lower interest rates. While the income of households with deposits is lower than if rates had not been reduced, the household sector as a whole has around twice as much debt as deposits. The CoreLogic house price index was not the only piece of data released today. On the other side of the ledger, the number of housing approvals fell again in August, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics this morning. Forecasters said the numbers showed that the construction downturn is not yet over. Approvals were down 1.1% in August and private house approvals dropped by 2.4%. Approvals are now at their lowest level since January 2013 and 44% below their November 2017 peak. Approvals dipped in every state and territory, with ACT (27.7%), the Northern Territory (8.7%) and NSW (5.4%) the hardest hit, in trend terms. Economists at JP Morgan said the figures would be a “meaningful drag” on economic growth going forward. The approvals are “terrible news for construction” and point to a cut by the RBA in half an hour ... So more on the mega data dump this morning. The most eye-catching was the 0.9% rise in the average national house price for September, largely driven by a strong rebound in the Sydney and Melbourne markets. Values in the two biggest cities were up 1.7% over the month, according to the CoreLogic September home value index. Prices have been boosted by increased investor activity amid lower rates and an easing of lending requirements by the banks since the May election. Australia’s two largest cities have recorded a rapid bounce-back in home values over the past two months, with Sydney up a cumulative 3.3% and Melbourne up 3.2% in August and September. Brisbane and Canberra were the only other capital cities to record a rise in dwelling values over the month, rising 0.1% and 1.0% respectively. Values held in Adelaide but fell 0.4% in Hobart and continued their long run of losses in Perth (down 0.8%) and Darwin (down 0.2%). Combined regional dwelling prices increased by 0.1 per cent, compared to a 1.1 per cent rise for combined capital city prices. The question will still be whether to take the plunge or not. You can read more on that here The ASX200 has risen ahead of today’s rates decision. The benchmark index is up 17.30 points this lunchtime to 6,705.60, a rise of 0.26%. The Aussie dollar is under more pressure though. It’s down 0.16% to US67.4c. Good afternoon and welcome to the live blog on the Reserve Bank’s interest rate decision. The bank’s board members are tipped by a majority of economists to cut the cash rate by 25 basis points to 0.75% this afternoon. The chief factors driving the move are continued sluggish economic growth and the need for the RBA to meet its inflation rate of between 2-3%. Any cut will be welcomed in Canberra where Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have gamed the economy by opting for tax cuts and budget surplus rather than the large increase in government spending that some say would be better for the country than another rate cut. However, a rate cut may not be completely cut and dried, especially after the latest monthly house price figures from CoreLogic today showed their biggest rise for more than two years. The numbers suggest that the property downturn could be over and that further rate cuts – the cash rate is already at an all-time low – could inflate another housing bubble. On the other side of the ledger, building approvals fell again in August, indicating that the construction downturn still has some way to run. More on those figures later but on with the blog ..."

          "headline": "A weekend break on an organic farm in Kent",
          "bodyText": "As dusk fell, firelight spilled from the windows of the farmhouse and the hens trooped single file up a sloping branch to roost in the leafy canopy overhead. They woke me at dawn the next day, landing like ripe pears on the roof of the rickety caravan where I slept under two duvets and in a sleeping bag, hat and gloves. As an unpaid volunteer agricultural worker escaping from my London bubble, it was time to pull on my wellies and yomp across a muddy paddock to feed pigs. That was 6am on a freezing morning 18 months ago, and right from the start I was hooked. Burscombe Cliff Farm lies down a steep muddy lane on the side of a wooded escarpment in the Weald of Kent, at medieval Egerton village, near Ashford, just an hour down the M20 from my home. It has been welcoming “Wwoofers” for nearly 30 years, since the original Working Weekends on Organic Farms movement (now called World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, but still Wwoof) was founded in 1971. People of all ages and nationalities have fed the livestock, dug the veg patch, walked the young bulls and bunked down in the farm’s ancient caravans. Unlike me, most arrive by train or bike. But I got to go home piled high with fresh local produce and bags of compost. Our host is seventysomething former doctor Hilary Jones, who breeds award-winning Blonde d’Aquitaine cattle, gentle creatures the size of small elephants. She has been committed to sustainability since before ecotourism was a thing. A faded sticker – Nuclear Power No Thanks – reveals the remains of an old van once used to get to an Aldermaston march in a heap of brambles beyond her back door. For relaxation, Jones dyes and spins the wool from her sheep – in weld yellow, rose madder pink and indigo blue, and the bright orange she presses from onion skins. Nothing is wasted here. Everything is mended or repurposed. There is wifi, but no TV, just BBC Radio 3 and intelligent engaged chat to the click of knitting needles or the soothing clunk of the spinning wheel. The UK has more than 550 Wwoof hosts, dedicated organic farmers and smallholders promoting awareness of ecological management of our landscapes and wildlife by offering visitors bed, board and hands-on experience in exchange for six hours’ labour a day. There are also around 4,000 registered UK Wwoofers. In the 18 months I have been coming here, I have delivered lambs (“We are a grandmother”), groomed the prize bull, scythed a field, mended the greenhouse and learned to eat pigs whose ears I have scratched. It hasn’t turned me vegetarian, but I treat meat with more respect and buy less of it. Wwoofing this way, with regular return visits, is like walking into The Archers. I get updates on the fight to save the local shop and the library van, and chat to everyone from the artist neighbours in the cottage across the fields to the shepherd managing a large conventional flock on the next farm, the tractor man trying to set up his own decorating business, the veg box grower and passing hikers out enjoying the countryside. There are at least three regular Wwoofers at Burscombe Cliff: a teacher, a writer and a journalist. We could visit other farms and Wwoof in other countries – there are 132 member countries to choose from, and Australia, New Zealand and the US each has several thousand hosts – but we like it here, taking mini-breaks from our city lives, filling our lungs with fresh air and swinging our shoulders. Last week I popped back for a happy afternoon up a ladder in the orchard, picking apples. In the next weeks the cows will start coming in from the fields for calving, and the ram will go out to the ewes on 5 November for lambing in early April. In between, there are fences to mend, medlars to pick, broad beans and onion sets to plant, and above all logs to chop for the hungry Rayburn stove. There’s always plenty to do and winter is coming. • Find out more at wwoof.net. Produce from Burscombe Cliff Farm can be bought at farmers’ markets in London and Kent such as in Peckham, Eltham, Wye and Whitstable Looking for a holiday with a difference?

          "headline": "Boris Johnson groping a woman’s thigh? I can believe that",
          "bodyText": "I believe Charlotte Edwardes had her thigh squeezed by the prime minister because I have been round the block myself. Not his particular block, let me hasten to add, although I have been on press trips with Boris Johnson when he was a “journalist”. Any woman who has reported on politics will have experienced the underhand leg manoeuvre. At one conference dinner, I had it from both sides simultaneously. I pulled their hands together under the table so that they were fondling each other. It was the least I could do. They both twitched slightly, and then everyone carried on discussing the decline of the “proper” family. Johnson denies Edwardes’ allegations, but his sexual incontinence is not news. We know full well how he treats the women around him; how easily he betrays them. He cannot tell us how many children he has. All of this is presumably “priced in” and part of his incomprehensible “charm”. Also accepted, somehow, by broadcasters is his whiff-whaff lies. We now need contemporaneous factchecking. Half of what Johnson said to Andrew Marr on Sunday was demonstrably untrue. Forty new hospitals? Patent rubbish. The belated realisation by his sister and Amber Rudd that his language is an unacceptable incitement to violence rings hollow. Rats leaving a ship that sank low so long ago that it is crumbling with rot. Johnson lives in a world where what he says carries no consequences, whether he is talking about Muslim women or a murdered MP. On he barges, thug life. Does any of this new information matter? We are operating in a world of post-truth mythmaking. Johnson is said to be egged on by his girlfriend, Carrie Symonds, and the unbuttoned freewheeling genius of Dominic Cummings. This bloke is simply a spad who got lucky, and we are in danger of mistaking ruthlessness for genius. Just because he twice saved Michael Gove’s skin, and has rocked up at the right time with the haiku-like wisdom of “Get Brexit done”, doesn’t mean we all have to believe the hype. History is driven by more than such crash-and-burn obsessives. It makes me miss Peter Mandelson. Almost. Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are both said to be surrounded by malevolent advisers who control them. David Cameron has recently been boring on about how Johnson and Gove turned out to be untrustworthy. Oh, you don’t say! Are all our leaders nice guys held hostage by sociopaths? Johnson breaks that narrative. Johnson is a liar who disrespects women; he breaks the rules. We know that this claim to be antiestablishment appeals. We can point out the privilege, but the rightwing media have long groomed the public with millionaires posing as ordinary blokes, from Jeremy Clarkson to Richard Littlejohn. Part of the problem is that remainers don’t acknowledge how establishment many of them are. I was astonished to read the novelist Ian McEwan admitting that he lived in a remainer bubble while also saying: “Let’s stop pretending there are two sides to this [Brexit] argument … There aren’t.” If you think that Brexit is a symptom of a complex and systemic breakdown (as I do), you cannot simply dismiss half the country. This remain arrogance astonishes me not just culturally but tactically. And now an unelected cheat is taking us into uncharted waters – but he is not unknown as a public figure. He has squandered public funds before. Hello, Joanna Lumley and the ludicrous Thames garden bridge. This is a man happy to buddy up to someone accused of sexual assault: Donald Trump. One casualty of these post-truth times is women’s testimony. When is the link between being “antiestablishment” and being serially disrespectful to women in your private life and political life going to be made? Having witnessed the macho posturings at the Labour party conference, this cuts all ways. I believe Edwardes totally, but that will not bring Johnson down. The payments to an American businesswoman may do (although, again, Johnson denies any impropriety). I have long called him Borisconi as none of this was hard to spot. I hope, though, that what Edwardes says is taken seriously, because women matter. All evidence so far suggests they are simply part of another power grab. • Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "We were told capitalism had won. But now workers can take back control",
          "bodyText": "Before the financial crisis of 2008 it was widely assumed class politics was dead. A rising tide, we were told, would lift all boats. In fact, unprecedented levels of credit creation and rising asset prices obscured the growing gap between the 1% and the rest. Now the bubble has burst, it is obvious whose interests are served by our economic model – and the class divides are sharpening once again. In 1992, Francis Fukuyama declared that history had ended, and capitalism was the last man standing. Margaret Thatcher had already stated that “there is no alternative” to the free market. The world fell under the spell of what Mark Fisher termed “capitalist realism” – it had become easier for most people to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. Yet this year, three decades on, the Economist devoted a cover story to an analysis of a concerning new trend: the rise of millennial socialism. All over the world, young people were turning out in droves to vote for politicians who had spent their lives railing against the evils of the free market system. Suddenly, socialism was cool again. What had happened to the end of history? The driving force of historical development under capitalism is conflict between different classes – and for a while class politics seemed to disappear. During the 1990s, sociologists, economists and politicians all claimed the traditional class boundaries had been blurred by the expansion of property ownership and the redistributive state, and the rise of white-collar occupations. Karl Marx, in other words, had been wrong. But class politics has returned with a vengeance since 2008. In 2017, the Economist again conceded: “Marx has a lot to teach today’s politicians.” Decried as populists by many of the liberals who remain rooted in the 90s, politicians who identify the fundamental antagonism that exists between the many and the few – between those who live off work and those who live off wealth – have fared remarkably well in recent years. History did not end along with the fall of the Berlin Wall – a point Fukuyama now concedes – because class politics didn’t end. In fact, the class nature of capitalism was sharpened by the birth of a new model of growth that had its roots in the rise of neoliberalism in the 1980s. Thatcher removed restrictions on capital mobility, deregulated the City, demutualised building societies and privatised the nation’s collective wealth. Deregulated banks issued unprecedented amounts of credit to consumers in the rich world. Firms became obsessed with their share price and their standing in Wall Street and the City. The rise of “shareholder value” led to a decline in wages and long-term investment in favour of mergers and acquisitions, dividend payouts and share buybacks. At the same time an avalanche of cheap credit coupled with a consumer boom driven by a new wave of globalisation helped to blur the increasing divisions between the haves and the have-nots. Rising house prices made many consumers feel wealthier. Rather than attempting to constrain the influence of finance over the rest of the economy, the state actively encouraged these developments. The rise of private financing and public-private partnerships signified the incursion of the logic of finance into the public sector. This inherently unsustainable system collapsed in 2008. The economic malaise we have experienced since the crash – characterised by stagnant wages, falling investment, the growth of international monopolies, rising consumer debt and huge increases in inequality – simply represents a deepening of trends visible before it. Today, the promise of the bubble years has dissipated entirely, and most people are growing accustomed to the fact that their lot is not going to improve. Young people – working longer hours, for lower pay – have lost faith in the system entirely. Millennials are the first generation since 1800 set to be worse off than their parents. The reemergence of class politics is not a fad; it is a response to the material conditions created by the collapse of finance-led growth. After a recession caused by the reckless greed of the few was followed by an austerity programme that sought to impose the clean-up costs on the many, it is more obvious than ever that the wealth and power of the elite comes at the expense of everyone else. Or, to paraphrase Bernie Sanders, there has been a class war in this country for a long time – it’s time the working class won it. In this new political context, economic policy is no longer a question of tinkering around the edges of a stable model: economic policy today is about power. As I argue in my new book, this is the moment for working people to seize back control of our most important institutions and rebalance power away from capital and towards labour. The only way to bring about such a shift is to promote state, worker and community ownership of society’s most important resources. In an economy in which ownership is mediated by the finance sector, this requires a socialist government to take on the banks the way Thatcher took on the unions. Finance-led growth emerged because its advocates used their control over the state to smash the organised power of working people and convince them that capitalism had won, once and for all. As the finance sector became ever more powerful, and the alternatives to capitalism faded further from view, it became extremely difficult to believe that there could be another way to organise the economy. Today, the greatest challenge for the left is to remind people that history isn’t over, that capitalism hasn’t won, and that we still have the power to change the world. • Grace Blakeley is economics commentator at the New Statesman and author of Stolen: How to Save the World From Financialisation"

          "headline": "Ryan Gander and Tony Chambers: how we redesigned the kitchen sink",
          "bodyText": "“I don’t want to over-conceptualise this,” says Ryan Gander, enthusiastically showing me the kitchen sink he has designed, “but the way you deal with this sink cognitively and emotionally is different from the way you deal with a normal kitchen sink. To get 100% out of it, you have to change your perspective on working in the kitchen.” This is not the sort of sales patter you get at Magnet, but then conceptual artist Gander is known for his ability to theorise everything from household goods to classical sculpture, so big ideas about kitchen sinks were to be expected. To be fair, he has a point. As he moves around his creation, sitting in the middle of his studio in the village of Melton in Suffolk, he explains its system of changeable shelves, chopping boards and containers, and you can see how, yes, it would change the way you work in the kitchen. Arrange it right and you can do all your food preparation and washing in one place. If Gander contributes nothing else, he may liberate us from searching for the chopping knife. The sink is the first product released by Otomoto, the “lifestyle venture” Gander recently founded with Tony Chambers, former editor-in-chief of Wallpaper*. “Otomoto” is a Japanese word meaning, loosely, “close at hand” and the idea is that all the company’s wares (“everything and the kitchen sink”, they quip) should be convenient, ergonomic and make ordinary things pleasurable. “It’s about elevating the mundane,” says Chambers, who has also come down to the studio. “And taking pride in the most everyday details.” “Otomoto things should enrich your life,” Gander says. “We’re really into the idea that if you do something boring like washing up, it shouldn’t be boring. It should be joyous.” In the 20 years since Gander graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a degree in interactive art, he has produced work ranging from painting, sculpture and architecture to lectures, customised trainers, typefaces, children’s books and new words. He’s interested in the way objects act as vessels for people’s stories, but he’s just as happy talking about commonplace creativity as art. Art for him is about experimenting with ideas and “trying to make some original contribution to human history and human knowledge, like an explorer”, but he thinks the way people are usually creative “is things like bumper stickers, the clothes we wear, what we serve when friends come round for dinner, or what we post on social media”. Some of his best work, such as his plaster sculptures of his nine-year-old daughter’s dens, takes that sort of creativity and recasts it as something that can be shown in galleries. In a way, Otomoto reverses that process, taking the kind of conceptual thinking you might associate with artists and applying it to everyday stuff. Meanwhile Chambers, a well-connected player in the design world who transformed Wallpaper* from a magazine to a multi-format media brand, has a creative input into the goods, but also knows how to present them as products. The next release, when the company officially launches in February next year (on the second, because the date, 02.02.2020, is symmetrical), is unconfirmed, but likely to be either a poker or a collection of wall hooks. Gander leads us to an office where he retrieves the poker prototype from one of his staff. It is stainless steel, hollow, so you can blow into the fire to stoke it up, and designed with a magnetic clip so it can attach to a base. The second idea (which one assumes would sell somewhat better) developed from Gander’s hobby of collecting hooks. He says he has hundreds – “Hooks from the Pound Shop, hooks from Margiela, hooks that aren’t even seen as hooks” – and would like to offer an Otomoto set comprising 95 readymades and five by artists they would commission. Owners could use them how they want, but Gander and Chambers like the idea of whole walls of hooks, a complete installation of a collection. Gander has a selection of 30 or so hooks installed in the hall of a guest bungalow outside the studio, so he and Chambers take me over for a look. As we stand contemplating them, I wonder aloud if Otomoto is really just a fancy homewares company, but they say no, their things don’t have to be designed for the home, in fact they don’t have to be designed objects at all. An Otomoto product could be a book or talk or an experience they create for people. In other words, as they freely concede, it’s a bit like the old Factory Records practice of giving a catalogue number to everything relevant to the organisation, from record releases to merchandise, a bar and even a cat, to show that everything about the Mancunian company was a creative experiment. The big question is: are we meant to see Otomoto sinks, pokers and hook collections as “art” or “design”? Unsurprisingly, the answer is complicated. The pair don’t like the idea of producing things that would be marketed as “design”, because Gander thinks well-designed, functional objects aren’t made to be art, because they’re not given a meaning by their maker. The mistake people make, he says, is assuming art involves the highest or hardest kind of creativity, when it can in fact be quite easy. “Everyone thinks there’s this creative ladder and that artists are at the top of it. But they’re not, because the highest form of creative ingenuity by far is problem-solving. Being creative is waking up every day and starting with a really difficult problem that needs solving, with a budget and health and safety requirements restricting you. That’s design, and that’s why good designers are way more creative than artists.” He points out that there’s a history of overlooked artists, such as the Austrian-born ecologist Victor Papanek, who had turned from art to the more interesting challenge of solving functional problems in the real world. That tradition inspires Gander and Chambers, if only for the obvious reason that, in 2019, it seems more admirable and creative to make something that helps people than to be “some arrogant, narcissistic artist character that gets pissed on telly, shouts and makes stuff that looks kind of frivolous and wasteful, do you know what I mean?” I do, but I still think punters buying the hooks might like to know whether or not they can say they’ve got an artwork on the wall. “Well, I consider art to be about belief and associated value. Our products are only art objects depending on the belief system you instil in them.” Do he and Chambers instil them with a belief that they’re “art” or “design”? “Well,” Chambers says, in a smooth way that makes you think he must be extremely good at business meetings, “the primary motive for all Otomoto products is for them to be good useful design, and to make rudimentary tasks that bit more pleasurable. So design first and foremost. But we fully understand that they can also be appreciated and relieved of their function, purely for their formal and visceral qualities.” Those qualities will not include a uniform style. Chambers and Gander both groan at the way a lot of modern designers beaver away at a signature look, with similar pieces of work released at regular intervals. “A designer shouldn’t have a style,” Chambers says. “You should be solving a problem that requires a certain material or a certain approach.” He thinks it happens because people want to consciously buy into a defined lifestyle; Gander, on the other hand, blames the internet. “Social media has changed art colossally, and not in a good way. It’s made things more retinal and less cognitive. I think in the next few years, the art world as we know it might split into two worlds. One will be cognitive, and the other will have art that functions well in places like Instagram, such as Kaws or Banksy. You know, people like to see things they recognise, so you have a high ratio of artists who repeat themselves. I don’t think that is creative endeavour, though – I’m more interested in trying stuff out and making all these mistakes. That’s how you get to things that are really good.” Ten miles from the studio, at Gander’s home in Saxmundham, we see his sink in action. He has a stainless steel prototype (the retail version is Silestone) sitting on a wooden frame beside the cooker hob, with paulownia chopping boards at the cooker end and at the other a colander, draining rack and thin gastronorm container for compostable waste. An upper lip holds the boards in place, while a lower lip can hold various containers. The sink also has a really good plug: just a rubber ball on a chain that rolls down the sloping sink-bottom to settle in the plughole on its own. Gander moved to Suffolk from London 10 years ago, when his wife Rebecca was pregnant with their first child, Olive. They bought “for a pittance” a dilapidated Victorian building that had been a B&amp;B and set about remodelling it; a decade later it is almost complete, all airy, cool and restrained, with a few hidden artworks built in ($25 and €30 coins from the future glued to the floor, a bubble-less spirit level embedded in the stairs). The showpiece is the living room fireplace, a replica of one designed in 1955 by Josef and Anni Albers, the German artist couple who taught at the Bauhaus before emigrating to the US in the 30s. The Albers fireplace is something of a cult object. Believing that brickwork could be used as a sculptural element in homes, Josef used off-white firebricks set at different angles to create a geometric relief. He made only two, for private clients in the US, but Ryan asked the Albers Foundation for permission to make a copy, and their granddaughter Lucy agreed, on condition that they could send historians to look at it from time to time. It is the only one in Europe, and has on one side a brass plaque crediting the Albers. A local bricklayer made it: “He really enjoyed doing it,” Gander says. The studio, a former radio factory on a lane behind a tractor dealership, was bought around the same time as the house and is where Gander makes most of his art – or rather has ideas and gets other people to make them. Using a wheelchair means there are some physical tasks he can’t do, but in any case, he says, he isn’t all that good at actually making things – his skill lies in making things happen. The sink was made with the help of Matheson Whiteley, a London architectural studio, and Cosentino, a Spanish materials supplier. For the last few years Gander has been trying to get an art school going for kids who are being pushed out of the system. When he was young, he became interested in art after being taken to Tate Liverpool on school trips, and went off to university in Manchester. “Rich kids weren’t interested in making art then. Now that’s changed, and kids from poorer backgrounds find it harder to go. When I visit art schools, I always sense that the kids from more difficult circumstances want something more – there’s more drive, because there’s nothing to fall back on, it has to work. They’re bolder and they take more risks. Which is good, because risk-taking works really well in the art world.” Gander has had plans drawn up for a shipping container structure that could house the school, but thinks that in a way it already exists, “as a state of permanent optimism, ambition and enthusiasm”. That state is evoked on his website for Fairfield International, as he plans to call it, which consists mostly of a loop of inspirational slogans, such as: “Because art education as it stands kills your buzz,” “Because you don’t have a trust fund or a wealthy spouse” and, “Because you want to make art more than you want to be an artist.” Fairfield International could be anywhere, but it does feel very Suffolk. In some towns here, if you randomly chucked a pencil it would hit an art person – probably one who has moved out of London. Glenn Brown, Maggi Hambling, Sarah Lucas, Sadie Coles, Stuart Shave and Norman Rosenthal, among others, all live here; then there are all the publishers and nature writers trundling off to contemplate the Fens. It was through this creative community, at a children’s birthday party in Saxmundham, that Gander and Chambers ended up talking about Otomoto – Chambers lives in the Barbican in London, but has a holiday home in one of the much-coveted California-style bungalows designed by great British modernist architect John Penn and built in Suffolk in the 60s. Gander thought Chambers, knowing about the design world, might be able to help him sell the sink. Chambers was sceptical because at Wallpaper*, he had people pitching him ideas about conceptual furniture all the time. His first thought was that “there were enough kitchen sinks in the world, to be honest”, then he couldn’t believe that no one in Europe had thought of the close-at-hand idea before, and finally he found himself taken with “the philosophy and approach”. Back at the studio, Gander and Chambers catch up on work, the latter revealing some of the typefaces he’s had made for Otomoto. Both men love them because the faces make the letters perfectly symmetrical (like the launch date), which means, to their font-nerdish delight, that not only is Otomoto a palindrome, but it can also be read in a mirror. While this is happening, Gander’s mother appears. She and his father moved to Suffolk from Chester a year ago and like to help him out; today she is dropping off a denim jacket on to which she has been sewing patches of corporate logos, a prototype for one of his projects. As he examines the patches, he and Chambers discuss whether or not youth style tribes have been supplanted by identity politics (Gander dislikes the latter, and never ticks the disabled box on forms because he doesn’t identify as “someone in a wheelchair”). As they adjust their clothes for the photograph, they talk about the effect they would like Otomoto to have. “It’s not just about commercial success,” Gander says, “It’s also about – I know it sounds cheesy, but inspiring people. When I was a kid, I just buzzed off people who made loads of work that was all really different. I was, like, ‘I want to do what they do! I want to get up and do something completely different every day, and try something out!’ Because that’s what’s great about the world, isn’t it? There’s so much you can do.” • This article was amended on 30 September to clarify that Papanek was born in Austria, not Brazil."

          "headline": "Earthlight wins Middle Park but Frankie Dettori steals the show",
          "bodyText": "Earthlight proved himself a star but the keenly anticipated Middle Park Stakes did not provide the hoped-for battle, one of the key runners, Siskin, having been backed out of the stalls about a second before they opened. There might have been a feeling of deflation had it not been for the bit of vaudeville put on by Frankie Dettori half an hour later as he won the Cambridgeshire on the heavily backed Lord North. It has been a poor year for French racing, with most of its major trophies being boxed up for export over the summer. But the unbeaten Earthlight, trained in Chantilly by André Fabre, is a genuine star and broke the juvenile course record that had been set in the previous race. That the placed horses were Golden Horde and Summer Sands, priced at 16-1 and 100-1, means the race threw up as many questions as answers. Was there a faster strip of ground up the near rail, where those outsiders raced? Is the Mums Tipple bubble burst, since he beat just one rival? Most of all, what happened to Siskin, who reared so alarmingly in the stalls that his jockey jumped off and helped reverse him out? “We’ve got no really good explanation,” said Lord Grimthorpe, spokesman for the colt’s owner, Khalid Abdullah, who also sponsors the race. “He went into the stalls fine. He’s got the most laid-back attitude of almost any horse of Prince Khalid’s. For that suddenly to happen is bizarre, really. We’re as shocked as most people. I don’t know whether it was the wind, there was no obvious trigger. It wasn’t like somebody got kicked or something rattled. He just flipped. This game tames tigers.” Siskin scraped himself but the wounds were thought to be superficial. “It’s a pity but he’s still unbeaten,” said his trainer, Ger Lyons, finding the upside. Earthlight was cut to 8-1 with most firms for the 2,000 Guineas but he carries the same blue colours of Godolphin as the hot favourite, Pinatubo, trained by Charlie Appleby. Does Fabre expect he will be allowed to run his horse in the Classic if Pinatubo is also fit to line up? “It has to be discussed,” the Frenchman said. “But Sheikh Mohammed is a sportsman, he wouldn’t mind running one against his other one.” There might have been an element of wishful thinking to that reply and there was an element of counter revolutionary thinking in Fabre’s response when asked why France has been short of top horses in the past couple of years. “It relies very much on the breeding. When you’ve got the socialist country, you don’t have enough rich people. It’s dead simple.” That was not the only pointed comment made in the winner’s enclosure. Jessie Harrington was delighted to win the Cheveley Park Stakes with Millisle but noted that her filly had not, this time, been subjected to a late blood test by the British Horseracing Authority vet, in contrast to what happened to the filly at Salisbury recently, when she was narrowly beaten. “She was definitely much more relaxed today,” the Irish trainer said. At 16-1, Millisle had few supporters in the stand but there was a lot more cheering when Lord North finally emerged from the pack in the Cambridgeshire after having to weave among tiring rivals. John Gosden’s charge had been backed from 10-1 to 9-2 in less than a day and briefly seemed to have left his challenge too late but quickened so smartly that he was in front with yards to spare. Dettori even had time to give a cheeky look across at Thore Hansen on Beringer before going past. “I was just laughing,” he said. “At my age, you’ve got to enjoy stuff like that.” Many will hope he has time for something similar aboard Enable in next Sunday’s Arc."

Formerly the gardener’s residence, Welbeck Cottage has recently opened to guests, offering out-of-hours access to the estate’s 300 acres of woods and parkland. It’s a magical spot, with winding paths that lead through woods and across bridges to cascades and lakes that reflect the gold and red of the leafy landscape. Inside, the renovated cottage is warm and comfortable, with neutral colours, wooden floors and a twin and double bedroom. Beyond the estate, beautiful Ashdown forest is 15 minutes away for more leaf peeping. • Sleeps four, from £357 for three nights, nationaltrust.org.uk/holidays Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire The second-largest crown forest in England after the New Forest (and once a royal hunting ground), the Forest of Dean has magical expanses of wild, ancient woodland. The Speech House Hotel is a 17th-century hideaway with 35 bedrooms (some with four-posters) and two restaurants. Forest walking trails start on the doorstep, it’s next to the Cyril Hart Arboretum, and the Forest of Dean Sculpture Trail is close by, with art works hidden among the trees. The local tourist board has devised a Leaf Peeping drive guide, listing the hotspots for autumn foliage, while nature lovers can book wildlife “detective” Ed Drewitt for private safaris (up to six people, £100 for two hours or £200 full day). • Doubles from £57 room only, two-night Autumn Leaves Explorer package from £278 for two for half-board plus packed lunch or cream tea, thespeechhouse.co.uk The Lizard, Cornwall Built in 1840, Frenchman’s Creek is a secluded cottage surrounded by dense woods, near the Helford River estuary on the Lizard peninsula. It has been a source of literary inspiration for several former guests, not least Daphne du Maurier, who named one of her novels after the place. Later tenants were Maria Pendragon and Clara Vyvyan: the latter describes the cottage in her book The Helford River. “Often, instead of reading, I would sit gazing out of the window at that wall of trees rising to the sky and feeling the quiet of that place as if it were soft music.” The two-bedroom hideaway can be reached by boat at high tide, or by foot along a path. • Sleeps four, from £439 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk National Forest, East Midlands The 200-square-mile National Forest is the biggest environment-led regeneration project in the country: by this autumn, 9m trees will have been planted in less than 30 years, on land once scarred by mining and industry. The Old Stables B&amp;B (pictured) in the pretty village of Packington, Leicestershire, is a comfortable base that’s ideal for families, as there are two inter-connecting, beamed rooms (one with bunk beds) and a colourful library of books and games.

Treetops is a three-bedroom, contemporary cottage in woods on the banks of the Beaulieu River, with a deck for alfresco dining and a woodburner inside. There are plenty of cycling routes and forest walks on the doorstep. Visit during New Forest Food &amp; Drink Fortnight to try local produce, from pannage pork to beer, at various forest destinations. • Sleeps five, from £731 for three nights, newforestliving.co.uk Mid-Wales Sleep in a tent up in the trees at Red Kite Tree Tents, on a private 81-acre woodland estate next to a swift running stream. Featured on George Clark’s Amazing Spaces, the globe-shaped tree tents (the Dragon’s Egg is the higher of the two) sleep two, are well-insulated, with woodburners and comfortable double beds, and are totally secluded and off-grid. Wooden walkways lead to living platforms with outdoor cooking areas and firepits. Spend the days walking through forests and valleys, or mountain biking through unspoiled hills. • Sleeps two, three nights in Dragon’s Egg from £355, holidaycottages.co.uk Snowdonia The small upland hamlet of Rhiwddolion can only be reached on foot – it’s a 10-minute walk up a forest track, passing large flagstones and ancient oaks. There are three remote properties for rent here (the only remnants of a once-thriving community of slate miners): two cottages, Ty Uchaf and Ty Coch, and the former chapel and school room, Ty Capel. They sit atop a wooded valley above Betws-y-Coed, home of the Snowdonia national park visitor centre. Close by, Fairy Glen gorge will delight children, Swallow Falls are the highest waterfalls in Wales, and there are several circular rambles on the doorstep, plus plenty of hiking throughout the park. • Cottages sleep two, three and four, from £259 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk North Wessex Downs, Hampshire In private woodland on the Hampshire-Berkshire border, Hollington Park Glamping has two vintage-style cabins that are ideal for family campers. It’s a small, dog-friendly site that’s also home to a rabbit, several Indian Runner ducks, chickens, two miniature dachshunds and a great dane, who all enjoy a meet and greet with visitors. The heated cabins have kitchenettes and electricity, plus there’s a shared chill-out space, firepits, and separate showers and composting loos. Beyond the grounds is The Chase, a 143-acre nature reserve next to Woolton Hill village. • Sleeps two plus two children, from £70, hollingtonparkglamping.co.uk Near Ennerdale Water, Lake District Surrounded by fells, ridges and peaks, YHA Ennerdale has wow-factor views across the Lake District from most rooms. It’s a great place for walkers and cyclists, be they solo travellers or large groups. Formerly forestry cottages, the hostel is now an off-grid retreat with hydro-electric power supply and no phone signal or TV.

Built in 1835, it had been engulfed by the forest (only the chimneys could be spotted, poking through the trees) until its recent restoration. The rustic charm remains: it’s off-grid, with no wifi or phone signal, woodburners keep it cosy, water comes from the original spring well, and bathroom facilities are in a wooden out-house. Soak up the sounds of the forest from the hot tub; look out for deer, owls and badgers; and hike on the extensive network of woodland trails around the estate and into the Wye Valley. • Sleeps four in two bedrooms, three-night stays from £615, qualityunearthed.co.uk River Nene, Cambridgeshire Overlooking a Forestry Commission poplar plantation in the grounds of Island House, The Arc is a spacious but cosy cabin surrounded by nature. Red kites can be seen soaring around the woods, which are also home to otters, muntjacs, herons, kingfishers, badgers, swans and more. Kenneth Grahame is said to have stayed in the main house and could well have drawn inspiration for The Wind in The Willows from this peaceful corner near the River Nene. Days spent walking on the Elton-Nassington-Fotheringhay loop or at Ferry Meadows can be followed by nights in the colourful open-plan space, with its vintage furniture, packed bookshelves and games by the woodburner. • Sleeps four, three-night weekend from £450, canopyandstars.co.uk Tamar Valley, Cornwall Steeped in the history of England’s mining industry, Danescombe Mine, near Calstock, was in operation throughout the 19th century, after which it lay abandoned until the 1970s, when it was restored by the Landmark Trust. The converted engine house now has large, light-filled rooms, and there’s a raised outdoor deck to take in the forested valley view and sound of a stream leading to the Tamar River. A short walk away is National Trust-owned Cotehele, a Tudor house and gardens, and Calstock village and viaduct. • Sleeps four, from £353 for three nights, landmarktrust.org.uk Mid-Wales On a wooded slope above a valley, Treetop Cabin sleeps three among a canopy of ancient oak, beech, ash and lime trees, and a 50-metre-high redwood.

Use of the kitchen and showers is shared with Redwood Valley eco-camp, which runs birdwatching and green woodworking courses. Also nearby are nature trails around Norton Brook; the river Lugg for wild swimming; and, this being in a dark-sky site, the Spaceguard Centre observatory for stargazing. • Sleeps three, £260 for two nights, pitchup.com The Highlands In a secluded corner of the wild, mountainous Balblair Woods, overlooking tidal Loch Fleet, the new Birdwatchers’ Cabin is surrounded by a forested nature reserve. Glass patio doors make the most of the views, and there’s plenty of space, with a smart kitchen and comfortable living and sleeping areas. Trails lead through pine, larch and spruce forests, and wildlife ranges from red squirrels to deer and otters (there’s a bird hide close by too). Breakfast baskets are delivered to the door on request. • Sleeps four (one double and a sofa bed), from £160 a night, hostunusual.com Ashdown Forest, East Sussex Ashdown Forest is where AA Milne created Winnie the Pooh while watching his son, Christopher Robin, play as a boy. On the edge of the wood, the Forest Garden glamping site – half ancient forest and half permaculture garden – runs woodland craft courses, including green woodworking and beekeeping. With lots of edible plants onsite, the team practise “wildcrafting”– harvesting fruit and flowers from their natural habitat, for the breakfasts and lunches served in the cafe.

The mill dates from around 1800 and had been empty for 50 years until the Landmark Trust bought it and began restoration in 1990. The mill wheel and grinding stones are still there inside one of the two bedrooms. Next to the River Coquet is a woodland walking loop, and there are lots of other rambling trails nearby, plus Northumbrian castles and beaches just a few miles away. • Sleeps four, from £455 for four nights, landmarktrust.org.uk Galloway Forest Park Galloway Activity Centre sits just outside the UK’s largest forest, Galloway Forest Park, which was also its first designated Dark Sky Park. The centre has a range of accommodation, from dorm beds in the bunkhouse to yurts and small eco-bothies with hot tubs. Activities available in and around Loch Ken include canoeing, windsurfing, climbing and archery. There’s also guided night-time cycling, and mountain bikes can be hired to explore further into the park’s 300 square miles of varied landscapes – keep an eye out for the resident red deer. • Dorm beds from £18.50, yurts sleeping six from £93, eco-bothies sleeping three from £385 for a long weekend, lochken.co.uk Yorkshire Wolds Just outside the village of Sancton, the North Star Club is a modern retreat in 500 acres of Yorkshire Wolds, inspired by the private wilderness retreats of the late 19th century, known as American Great Camps.

          "bodyText": "There are a handful of ingredients that I use on repeat to boost flavour. They have become like reliable old friends: from lemons to smoked paprika, my kitchen is never without them. One less run-of-the-mill kitchen friend is nigella seeds, or kalonji. Their flavour is quite difficult to describe – perhaps closest to the faintest taste of onion, but with a back note of earthy spice. This dal and chutney put the flavour of nigella seeds centre stage, but be bold and use the seeds to perk up simple everyday dishes, too, like fried eggs on toast, rice or baked feta. Nigella seed and lime dal (main picture above) I suggest soaking the lentils overnight, to help reduce the cooking time and to make them easier to digest. If you can’t manage this, a couple of hours will do. Prep 15 min Soak Overnight Cook 1 hr Serves 4 100g red (split) lentils 100g chana dal (split yellow lentils) 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 thumb-size piece fresh ginger, peeled and finely chopped 1 green chilli, finely chopped (deseeded if you like) 1 red onion, peeled and finely chopped 1 tsp cumin seeds 1 tsp coriander seeds 1 × 400ml tin coconut milk 500ml hot vegetable stock 1 bunch fresh coriander, roughly chopped, stalks and all 1 lime, juiced For the nigella seed temper 1 tsp mustard seeds 2 tbsp nigella seeds 2 tbsp ghee To serve Plain yoghurt Plum chutney (see above recipe) Chapatis/roti (optional) Brown basmati rice (optional) Rinse the red lentils, then soak with the dal in cold water, ideally overnight, or for as long as you have – at least two hours. In a large saucepan, fry the garlic, ginger, chilli and red onion in a little oil for about 10 minutes, until soft and sweet. Add the seeds, and cook for a couple of minutes to toast and release their flavours. Drain the lentils and rinse again, then add them to the pan with the coconut milk and stock. Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down and let them bubble away for 40 minutes. Next, make the temper. Put a small frying pan on a high heat, fry the mustard and nigella seeds in a little ghee for two minutes, then pour into the dal and stir. To finish, remove from the heat and stir in half the chopped coriander and lime juice. Pile into bowls and top with a dollop of yoghurt and spoonfuls of plum chutney. Serve with charred chapatis or roti – or, if you’re really hungry, some brown basmati rice, too. Plum and nigella seed chutney This is perfect alongside a curry or in a cheese sandwich. Prep 10 min Cook 15 min Serves 4 1 tsp cumin seeds 4 red plums, stoned and roughly chopped 2 tsp sugar or runny honey 1 tsp nigella seeds 2 tsp grated ginger A splash of red-wine vinegar ½ lime, juiced and zested Toast the cumin in a small saucepan until fragrant, then add all the other ingredients, saving a sprinkle of the nigella seeds for the end. Cook on a medium heat for about 10 minutes, until the plums begin to break down. Leave to cool, then, if you are eating right away, put in a serving bowl and sprinkle over the remaining nigella seeds. To keep for another day, put the chutney in a sterilised jar and store in the fridge."

          "bodyText": "Subscribe now to receive the morning briefing by email. Good morning, I’m Tim Walker with today’s essential stories. Trump describes whistleblower’s source as a ‘spy’ The whistleblower complaint over Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine alleges not only that Trump used a call with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to “solicit interference” in the 2020 election, but that the White House tried to cover up the conversation. The complaint was released in full on Thursday as the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, testified before the House intelligence committee on what he described as a “totally unprecedented” situation. The New York Times is facing a backlash for publishing details about the whistleblower that could reveal their identity. But Trump told US staff members at the UN that he wanted to know the identity of the whistleblower’s source, describing them as “close to a spy” and adding: “You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart with spies and treason, right? We used to handle it a little differently than we do now.” Trump allies. Democrats have called on the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, to answer questions before Congress on his department’s dealings with Ukraine, while Trump’s lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and the attorney general, William Barr, are also implicated in the scandal. Ukrainian view. In Ukraine, the controversy has led many to question whether the US can be viewed as a trustworthy ally in the country’s attempts to reform and resist Russian pressure, as Andrew Roth reports from Kyiv. Fossil fuel industry more influential under Trump The fossil fuel industry’s bottom line has enjoyed a regulatory windfall under the Trump administration, not least the president’s unilateral withdrawal from the Paris climate change accord. That explains why Trump’s fossil fuel backers are already opening their wallets wide to help his 2020 re-election effort, reports Peter Stone. The coal magnate Robert Murray, for example, raised $2.5m for Trump at a single fundraising dinner in West Virginia in July. EPA threat. The Trump administration has ramped up its feud with California by claiming the state’s homeless crisis is causing increased water pollution, and threatening action by the EPA. Climate strike. Another wave of mass climate strikes are taking place around the world on Friday, including in Canada, Morocco, India, Italy and New Zealand. EU could drop nuclear deal over Iranian non-compliance The European Union has privately warned Iran that it will be forced to withdraw from the 2015 nuclear deal if Tehran makes good on a threat to take new steps beyond the boundaries of the agreement. Since the US exited the deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran, Tehran has taken three calibrated steps away from the conditions of the deal. Now it is threatening a fourth in November, at which point the agreement’s three EU signatories – France, Germany and the UK – say they would have to begin withdrawing, too. Tanker released. Stena Impero, the British-flagged oil tanker seized by Iran in July, is preparing to leave the port of Bandar Abbas, a month after the release by UK authorities of an Iranian tanker in the Mediterranean. Cheat sheet The Trump administration has set the cap for refugees allowed into the US over the next fiscal year at 18,000, the lowest number since the US began its refugee program in 1980. More than 350,000 people are expected to seek asylum in that time. The Church of England’s bishops have co-signed a letter saying the language of the Brexit debate has become unacceptable, as the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, refused to retract his controversial comments about the murdered MP Jo Cox. Lawmakers in Mexico’s Oaxaca state have voted to decriminalise abortion, a win for reproductive rights advocates in the staunchly Catholic nation. It is the second jurisdiction in Mexico to scrap its abortion prohibitions; Mexico City did so in 2007. Japan Airlines has unveiled a new tool on its seat reservation system allowing prospective passengers to see where infants aged between eight days and two years are seated – and thus to avoid being stuck next to a crying baby on a longhaul flight. Must-reads Inside the cosy world of ‘bookstagram’ There is a corner of Instagram where book-lovers share stylised photos of their favourite tomes. The “bookstagram” hashtag has been used more than 35m times. Some bookstagrammers have over 100,000 followers. Yet even such an apparently cosy online community has its controversies, as Shelby Pope discovers. The Palestinian entrepreneur bringing power to Gaza When Majd Mashharawi left Gaza to visit Japan in 2017, she tells Saeed Kamali Dehghan, what caught her eye were the working streetlights. Gaza is plagued by regular power-cuts, so on her return Mashharawi launched SunBox, a company that offers affordable, off-grid solar power kits to families. The blockbuster that wasn’t: a $14m Hollywood scam Adam Joiner pitched his movie Legends to foreign investors as a steampunk Avengers, made up of 19th-century American heroes, which had already attracted distribution deals with Netflix and others. Unfortunately for those investors, the project didn’t really exist, as Jake Flanagin reports from Los Angeles. The explosive return of Chris Morris Chris Morris is the British satirist behind Four Lions, whose early TV projects launched the careers of Steve Coogan, Charlie Brooker and others. His latest film was inspired by the FBI’s attempts to manufacture terrorists. “We were a bubble species long before the internet,” he tells Catherine Shoard in a rare interview. Opinion Liberal and conservative centrists are eager to oust Trump so they can return to the power they previously took for granted, argues Samuel Moyn. What’s needed is not simply impeachment, but an entirely new politics. Centrists simply want to return to the status quo interrupted by Trump, their reputations laundered by their courageous opposition to his mercurial reign, and their policies restored to credibility. Sport The Cleveland Browns appeared to have built a formidable team over the past year, including their second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield and a roster full of high draft picks. And yet, so far, this season has been a dud, writes Oliver Connolly. Manchester City face Everton at Goodison Park, site of the worst defeat of Pep Guardiola’s managerial career. Liverpool travel to Bramall Lane, where they have not beaten Sheffield United since 1990. Can England’s top two clubs buck history? Those are two of 10 things to look out for this Premier League weekend. Sign up The US morning briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes every weekday.

          "headline": "Given the hype, the Cleveland Browns' start has been a borderline disaster",
          "bodyText": "No team entered the 2019 season with more hype than the Cleveland Browns. They were supposed to be at the center of the football universe, and entered the year with six games scheduled for primetime, one shy of the maximum. This was the year they would finally break through after years of failure – and America would be watching. And then the football was played. Now, sat at 1-2 – their sole win was against an awful New York Jets team – with an injury-riddled roster, a trip to a resurgent Baltimore on the horizon and a rookie head coach showing all the tell-tale signs of being a, well, rookie head coach, the Browns’ season of promise is in trouble. They have been distinctly average. In the normal course of things in Cleveland, that would be great. But relative to the hype and preseason expectations, they have been a borderline disaster. No one has been as disappointing as second-year quarterback Baker Mayfield. It was Mayfield who changed the whole tenor of the organization, the city. Cleveland’s brand shifted; it was now cool and young and brash and relevant. Whatever went before was gone. This would be a team of style and substance, who spoke big then backed it up. Mayfield stole the city in his rookie year. His play, like most rookies, was promising but inconsistent. And yet the team, with Mayfield on board, immediately leaped several rungs on the NFL ladder. From laughing stock to a bonafide playoff contender in the blink of a Tyrod Taylor injury. The offseason served to solidify the Browns’ new-found status. Dysfunction and disorder were out. These were the new Browns, headed by the bluster and bravado of Mayfield and Freddie Kitchens, the team’s new head coach, and the cunning of John Dorsey, the team’s top decision-maker and a front-office lifer. Dorsey nabbed Odell Beckham, one of the league’s top pass-catchers, in one of the great trade swindles of the decade. The years of doom and gloom were about to pay off. Cleveland had their star quarterback, a roster full of high draft picks, and a smattering of impact veterans who would elevate the team towards a championship. And so far, it’s been a dud. Cleveland’s offense is stuck at 28th in DVOA, a measure of a team’s non-garbage time efficiency. The passing game has been less efficient than the run-game. They have converted just 11 third downs all season. The way the team plays looks different, too. Gone are the motions and shifts and fun and games of last year. Kitchens, who aced his audition as offensive play-caller last year, is bombing in his first leading role. “If you’re looking to blame somebody,” Kitchens said of Cleveland’s early-season struggles. “Blame me. Don’t blame any of our players, don’t blame any of our coaches.” They were the words of a man who had spent the offseason gobbling up books with titles such as “Fault Lines: how to take ownership and succeed” and “Not I or Me: It’s We” and other such generic garbage. Transparent bids at taking accountability ring hollow in locker rooms. Cleveland’s starting tackles are not good enough and the offense has lacked the kind of imagination that sparked 2018’s late-season surge. The players know it. Kitchen’s time and energy have been shifted towards everything in the building, not solely what the Browns will do on first down. The difference is drastic. And yet it’s Mayfield who remains the biggest concern. He sits 31st in DVOA among 37 qualified starters. If you rule out the two starters from the Dolphins, a team intentionally trying to lose, Mayfield would rank as the fifth-worst quarterback in the league by down-to-down efficiency, behind the likes of Jameis Winston and Andy Dalton. Things are even worse in terms of total value (DYAR). There, Mayfield is 34th sitting at minus-118, ahead of only Kyler Murray and the Miami twins. That’s 29 spots below Lamar Jackson, another quarterback in his second year in the league – but one who attracted significantly less hype than Mayfield. Stick on any of Cleveland’s first three games and you notice a worrying trend: Mayfield bailing on plays early. He has happy feet in the pocket and is anticipating and expecting pressure without an iota of trust in his protection. In fairness to Mayfield, that lack of trust has been earned. Mayfield has been pressured by defenders on around a third of his dropbacks in 2019, the eighth-worst mark in the league. The Browns finished with the 11th best pressure rate in the NFL a year ago, three whole percentage points better off per game. Give a quarterback that many more plays unencumbered per season and they will feast. There are other, more nuanced issues. One is the inclusion of Beckham in the offense. Such a star demands defensive attention – which should liberate others to make plays – but he also demands touches. The Browns haven’t figured out how to incorporate him properly into their offense yet, and Mayfield has struggled as a result. A quarterback unable to play his natural game helps no one. When quarterbacks start forcing the ball to their top target and predetermine throws prior to the snap, the rest of the offense sags. That is no knock on Beckham. He has played to his typically great levels. But the way he has been used has been ham-fisted and amateur – a quick screen here, a bubble pass there. When he has broken plays within the structure of the system, Mayfield has looked elsewhere: The other issues: injuries and penalties. The Browns are far-and-away the leaders in penalties this season, with 35 of them, totaling 327 yards – that’s about a game’s worth of offense. Penalties are an amalgamation of bad coaching, a lack of talent and bad luck. Cleveland best hope the calls that have gone against them lean towards the latter, despite evidence pointing to the other two. The injuries are all fluke. Nine starters have missed at least one game this season due to injury or suspension. Few teams could stand that level of talent decay. There remains hope – and, of course, we are only three games into the season. Cleveland’s defense has been Good with a capital G. It is currently eighth in defensive efficiency. The Browns have the potential to have the best unit in the league, and should finish in the top-five once everybody is healthy. And while the defense hasn’t risen to its potential yet, it has provided a good enough platform for the offense to win games. Cleveland face the fifth-easiest remaining schedule, according to the analytics nerds at Football Outsiders. 9-7 may be enough to get them into the playoffs in the AFC, and playoffs are a must. Cleveland or not, the expectations remain high. The pressure is on Mayfield to prove his rookie season was not another false dawn."
