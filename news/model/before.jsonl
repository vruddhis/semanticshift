          "bodyText": "We are closing this blog now. Goodnight and a good New Year’s Eve from London. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, has announced plans to lift Covid containment measures in January that have been in place since March 2020, including reopening schools, bars and nightclubs, citing rising vaccination rates. The country has imposed some of Africa’s toughest restrictions. In September some measures were eased, including allowing the resumption of education for universities and other post-secondary institutions. In a televised speech late on Friday, Museveni said pre-primary, primary and secondary schools would reopen on 10 January. Bars and nightclubs would reopen and a nighttime curfew will be lifted two weeks after schools have resumed, he added. Movie theatres and sporting events would also be allowed to reopen, he said, without giving further details. As of Friday, Uganda had registered about 137,000 confirmed cases and nearly 3,300 deaths. The president urged Ugandans to get vaccinated as the “first solution” to Covid. Here is a quick recap of some of the main developments from today so far: The UK reported another 189,846 Covid cases in the last 24 hours and reported a further 203 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More than 1 million people have tested positive in the last seven days. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England increased to 12,395, up from 11,452 the day before. Experts say the daily case figures do not include reinfections, and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, suggesting the true number of infections is likely to be higher. The full story is here. One in 25 people in England had Covid before Christmas, including one in 15 in London, according to a new estimate from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Story here. The Philippines will impose tighter curbs in the capital region for the next two weeks, an acting presidential spokesperson said, to try to limit infections by the Omicron variant. The region including the capital, Manila, will be placed under the third of a five-scale alert system from 3 to 15 January. Level 3 bans face-to-face classes, contact sports, and closes funfairs and casinos. The government’s coronavirus taskforce will also reduce the operating capacity for social events, tourist attractions, amusement parks, restaurant dine-in services, fitness studios and personal care services. Ireland became the latest EU country to cut the isolation period for many people who contract Covid, as record infection numbers spark fears of crippling staff shortages in essential public services as well as retail and hospitality venues. Spain, Portugal and Greece reduced isolation times this week, others such as Germany and France are considering doing so, and Italy cut its quarantine for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has tested positive. The moves follow a similar decision by the US and reflect early research suggesting Omicron generally causes milder illness than earlier versions of the virus. The World Health Organization has described the decisions to cut isolation and quarantine periods as part of a delicate balancing act between controlling the transmission of the virus and keeping national economies up and running. Story here. Germany’s leading coronavirus expert has expressed optimism that his country could expect a “relatively normal” winter in 2022, after data from other countries firmed up the impression that infections with the Omicron variant could be milder than Delta. Story here. UK regulators approved Pfizer’s “life-saving” antiviral drug Paxlovid, which boasts nearly 90% success in preventing severe illness among vulnerable adults if taken soon after becoming infected with Covid. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) found the oral treatment “to be safe and effective at reducing the risk of hospitalisation and death in people with mild to moderate Covid-19 infection, who are at an increased risk of developing severe disease”. The agency said Paxlovid was most effective when taken during the early stages of a Covid infection, and recommended it was used within five days of a patient’s first symptoms. The approval is for patients aged 18 and over with at least one risk factor for developing severe illness, such as obesity or diabetes, or being over 60. Story here. The number of NHS hospital staff in England absent due to Covid has nearly doubled since the start of the month, new figures show. There were 24,632 staff at NHS hospital trusts ill with coronavirus or having to self-isolate on Boxing Day, up 31% from 18,829 a week earlier and nearly double the 12,508 at the start of the month. Turkey logged 40,786 new coronavirus cases on Friday, its highest since April. The health minister warned that the Omicron variant had become dominant as Turks celebrated New Year’s Eve without restrictions. “Although there are no restrictions, we recommend that you act as if there are,” Fahrettin Koca said on Twitter in what he called a New Year’s “warning”. The minister recommended that in this time of increased risk, people should avoided crowded, poorly ventilated environments. New Covid infections have more than doubled from 18,910 a week ago. Since the first cases of Omicron were reported in the UK just over a month ago it has spread rapidly across the UK, fuelling a surge of infections. But scientists have also been working at speed. Here is an overview of the expanding scientific knowledge of the variant. Greece reported 40,560 Covid cases on Friday, setting a new record high for the fourth successive day following a surge of cases of the Omicron variant. Health authorities said 76 deaths had been reported on Friday. Greece introduced new restrictions this week, ordering bars, restaurants and nightclubs to close at midnight, with no standing customers and no music. An exception is New Year’s Eve, when establishments can close at 2am. The country of 11 million people has reported 1,210,853 infections since the first case was detected in February 2020 and 20,790 Covid-related deaths. Italy reported a record 144,243 Covid cases on Friday, following 126,888 the day before, the health ministry said, while the number of deaths fell slightly to 155 from 156. Italy has officially registered 137,402 deaths linked to coronavirus since February 2020, and reported 6.125 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid - not including those in intensive care - stood at 11,150 on Friday, up from 10,866 a day earlier. There were 119 new admissions to intensive care units, down from 134 on Thursday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,260 from a previous 1,226. A record 1.22 million tests for Covid were carried out in the last day, compared with 1.15 million the previous day, the health ministry said. Here’s a bit more context on those latest case numbers in the UK: The number of confirmed Covid cases in the UK continued to rise on the last day of 2021, with 189,846 reported in the previous 24 hours, while the number of people in hospital and the number of deaths also rose. The figures follow two consecutive days when the number of new cases was above 180,000, with a record 189,213 reported on Thursday and 183,037 on Wednesday – although the latter included a backlog in some nations of cases recorded before and during the Christmas period. Friday’s figures reported 203 people having died within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Thursday’s data had 332 recorded deaths, a steep rise from 57 on Wednesday, explained in part by NHS England not reporting hospital deaths since 24 December. The number of Covid patients in hospital in England increased to 12,395 on Friday, from 11,452 the day before. Experts say the daily case figures do not include reinfections and not everyone who is infected has symptoms and takes a test, suggesting the true number of infections is likely to be higher. According to a new estimate on Friday from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), one in 25 people in England had Covid before Christmas, including one in 15 in London. Based on swabs collected from randomly selected households in England, the ONS said an estimated 4% of the community had Covid in the week ending 23 December – equating to about 2,024,700 people. The week before, about one in 35 people were estimated to be infected. The UK has reported another 189,846 new Covid cases in the last 24 hours as over 1m people tested positive in the last seven days. The number is likely to be on the low side thanks to widespread shortages of PCR and lateral flow tests. The official UK Covid dashboard also recorded another 203 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Nearly 2,000 people were admitted to hospital. The world is celebrating New Year’s Eve in spite of the Omicron variant spreading across the globe – and fireworks and parties are making a comeback this year after many events were cancelled in late 202. My colleague Martin Belam is covering the celebrations in our New Year’s Eve live blog: Portugal has reported a new daily record of 30,829 coronavirus cases, up from 28,659 the previous day, with Omicron accounting for an estimated 83% of new cases. The health authority DGS registered 18 fatalities from Covid, up from 16 on Thursday, but that was a fraction of the more than 300 daily deaths recorded in late January when Portugal had just begun its vaccination campaign. The number of patients in intensive care was steady at 145, well below the more than 900 in early 2021. Portugal has one of the world’s highest Covid vaccination rates with about 87% of its 10 million population fully inoculated. In the run-up to New Year’s Eve, the government ordered nightclubs and bars to close, required people to have negative Covid tests to enter hotels, casinos and restaurants, and limited outdoor gatherings to 10 people. Thousands of flights in the US and internationally have been delayed or cancelled on Friday, adding to travel disruption during the holiday week owing to adverse weather and rising Covid cases, Reuters reports. More than 2,600 flights were cancelled globally as of early Friday, including more than 1,200 flights within the US or entering or departing it, according to a running tally on the flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. There were more than 4,600 flight delays in total. The Christmas holidays are typically a peak time for air travel, but the rapid spread of the Omicron variant has led to a sharp increase in Covid infections, forcing airlines to cancel flights as pilots and crew need to be quarantined. On Thursday, for the second day in a row, the US had a record number of new reported cases, with more than 290,000 new infections reported each day, a Reuters tally showed. The state of New York reported more than 74,000 new Covid cases on Thursday, from more than 336,000 tests. New York said last week it would sharply limit the number of people it allows in Times Square for its New Year’s Eve celebration. Some critics have raised concerns over the celebrations going ahead at all. The rise in US Covid cases has caused some companies, particularly in the energy sector, to change course from earlier plans to increase the number of employees working from their offices starting next week. Chevron was to start a full return to office from 3 January but told employees this week it was postponing the plans indefinitely. US airline cabin crew, pilots and support staff are reluctant to work overtime during the holiday travel season despite offers of hefty financial incentives. Many workers fear contracting Covid and do not welcome the prospect of dealing with unruly passengers, some airline unions have said. In the months preceding the holidays, airlines were wooing employees to ensure solid staffing, after furloughing or laying off thousands over the past 18 months. It’s been more than two years since China first notified the rest of the world of a new virus sweeping through its population. Since then the hunt for Covid’s origins has been mired in controversy and accompanied by political tensions. Our China affairs correspondent Vincent Ni has taken another look at efforts to trace Sars-CoV-2’s origins: Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane medical school in Louisiana, got a call from his university management telling him that agents from the FBI and CIA had requested a chat about his research into the origins of Covid-19. Garry agreed and on 30 July three agents flew down to Louisiana to talk to him in person. The meeting, held at a university conference room, began at 9am and ended at about 5pm. “I presented my evidence to the agents, who were properly trained scientists themselves. They asked all the right questions,” Garry told the Guardian. “I told them: there is no way this virus could have been a manufactured weapon. There is also no evidence to suggest it was a lab leak. But I’m also conscious there are people out there who will always disagree.” Their conversation came two months after Joe Biden ordered US intelligence to investigate how the pandemic began. In normal circumstances, investigating an emerging infectious disease outbreak is a purely scientific inquiry, as was the case with Sars in 2003 and with Mers a decade later. But the search for the origin of the Covid pandemic has come in the middle of a global controversy that has mixed public health, domestic politics and international diplomacy. Local authorities in England are drawing up contingency plans to deal with staff shortages being made worse by Covid that could leave them unable to empty bins or provide other council services. The Local Government Association said: As cases of Covid-19 rise in light of the Omicron variant, councils are concerned that existing staffing issues may get worse, potentially impacting on service delivery in some areas and they are putting in place contingency plans to address this. We want to work with government to address these issues to ensure councils can be resilient in supporting their communities through this wave of the Omicron variant and that they can continue to deliver the services people rely upon. The Philippines will impose tighter curbs in the capital region for the next two weeks, the acting presidential spokesperson said on Friday, to try to limit infections by the Omicron variant. The health ministry on Friday recorded 2,961 new coronavirus infections, a two-month high, and reported a positivity rate of 10.3%. “In the coming days, we might see an increase in active cases,” acting presidential spokesperson Karlo Nograles said in a televised announcement. The region including the capital Manila is an urban sprawl of 16 cities that is home to more than 13 million people. It will be placed under the third of a five-scale alert system from 3 to 15 January, Nograles said. Level 3 bans face-to-face classes, contact sports, funfairs, and casinos. The government’s coronavirus task force will also reduce the operating capacity for social events, tourist attractions, amusement parks, restaurant dine-in services, fitness studios, and personal care services. With roughly 2.84 million total confirmed cases and 51,504 casualties, the Philippines has the second highest number of Covid cases and deaths in southeast Asia, after Indonesia. The Philippines has so far detected 10 Omicron cases, three of which three were domestic infections and the rest were from overseas travellers. The country’s genome sequencing capacity is limited. “It is prudent to assume that Omicron is already in circulation, or is already in the community,” the health secretary, Francisco Duque, said at a news conference on Friday. Ireland has become the latest EU country to cut the isolation period for many people who contract Covid, as record infection numbers spark fears of crippling staff shortages in essential public services, as well as retail and hospitality venues. Spain, Portugal and Greece reduced isolation times this week while others, such as Germany and France, are considering doing so and Italy cut its quarantine for fully vaccinated people who come into contact with someone who has tested positive. The moves follow a similar decision by the US and reflect early research suggesting the highly transmissible Omicron variant fuelling the pandemic’s latest surge generally causes milder illness than earlier versions of the virus. However, the sheer number of people becoming infected – and thus having to self-isolate if they contract the virus, or quarantine if they are a contact of someone who tests positive – threatens to cause chaos in hospitals and on public transport. “Many Omicron cases are going to be asymptomatic,” Rochelle Walensky, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Monday after halving the recommended isolation time for asymptomatic people to five from 10 days. We want to make sure there is a mechanism by which we can safely continue to keep society functioning, while following the science. The UK’s Health Security Agency (UKHSA) on Wednesday cut the 10-day self-isolation period for vaccinated and unvaccinated people in England who have tested positive for coronavirus from 10 days to seven if they get the all-clear from lateral flow tests. The World Health Organization has described the decisions to cut isolation and quarantine periods as part of a delicate balancing act between controlling the transmission of the virus and keeping national economies up and running. “It is a trade-off between the science and being absolutely perfect in what you try to do, but then having the minimal disruption you can possibly have,” Michael Ryan, the WHO emergencies director, said. “Governments are struggling to find that balance.” Read the full story here: EU countries cut Covid isolation periods in Omicron balancing act Germany’s leading coronavirus expert has expressed optimism that his country could expect a “relatively normal” winter in 2022, after data from other countries firmed up the impression that infections with the Omicron variant could be milder than Delta. Christian Drosten, who heads up the institute of virology at Berlin’s Charité hospital, told public broadcaster ZDF that Omicron had the potential to take the pandemic into an “endemic situation”, where the virus that has brought the world to a standstill could be more comparable to a common cold or flu virus. Of course, it is a good situation if you have a virus that no longer makes you ill but transmits easily so that it can seek out and find all of the immunity gaps among the population and still trigger regular updates in immunity. Nonetheless, the coronavirus expert said he expected indoor mask-wearing mandates and an updated top-up dose of a vaccine to be necessary to protect vulnerable people over the course of the coming year. Germany was at a particular disadvantage because it had a higher percentage than other European countries of people who had neither attained immunity through vaccination or infection with the virus, Drosten said. We have too many unvaccinated people in Germany, especially over 60. And those are of course seriously at risk. More on this story here: Germany buoyed by data from abroad amid Omicron spread Almost one in five frontline ambulance staff in Wales are off sick or isolating with the numbers expected to continue to grow over the next week or so. Jason Killens, the chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust, said that 322 people were off because of Covid – around 12% of frontline staff. Adding in “normal” sickness absenteeism, the number off work rises to around 17%. Killens told the Guardian: We are starting to feel the pinch because of the absence rate. We are expecting that to grow over the next 10 days. More armed services personnel are joining the ambulance service in January, bringing the number driving on the frontline up to around 250, with more doing backroom roles. Killens said the service had its most numbers of referrals from the NHS 111 service on Monday and Tuesday. The pressure is also still being increased by delays in patients being admitted, leading to queues of ambulances at hospital A&amp;E departments. We expect it to get very challenging in the next 10-14 days. Some patients are waiting much longer than we would like. One in 25 people in England had Covid last week, rising to one in 15 in London, official figures have revealed. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, based on swabs collected from randomly selected households, an estimated 4% of people in the community in England had Covid in the week ending 23 December – about 2,024,700 people. The week before, about one in 35 people in England were estimated to have had Covid. The study revealed infections have increased across all regions of the UK as the Omicron variant continues to fuel record numbers. “The highest rates of infections were seen in London, where one in 15 would have tested positive, and the lowest in the north-east of England, where one in 45 would have tested positive for Covid-19,” the report notes. Infection levels also rose in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in the most recent week, with the latest estimates suggesting that for all three countries about one in 40 people had Covid in the week ending 23 December. The study also reveals that Omicron is now the dominant variant in England and Scotland. “Infection levels have continued to increase across the UK, with England’s increase driven largely by London, which has the highest rate of infection seen in this survey,” said Sarah Crofts, the head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 Infection Survey. “Omicron is now the dominant variant in both England and Scotland, and has been growing rapidly in Northern Ireland and Wales,” she added. “We’ve also seen infections rise in all age groups, with school-aged children and young adults seeing the highest rates.” Boris Johnson must be ready to restrict social mixing to stop hospitals being overwhelmed by an Omicron-driven surge in Covid cases, a senior NHS leader has said. The rapid spread of the new variant means the prime minister may have to introduce “tighter restrictions, at real speed” to reduce the number of people falling ill with Covid. But any new curbs would take two weeks to cut the number of people needing hospital treatment, added Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers. His comments came as a leading scientist predicted that the sharp increase in Covid infections seen in recent days means that the NHS will be overwhelmed “quite quickly”. Prof Peter Openshaw, a member of the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), warned exposure to only “a whiff of infected breath” could lead to catching the Omicron variant. He also said that mingling during new year celebrations may well lead to a further increase in those testing positive. Read the full story here: UK must be poised to introduce swift Covid curbs, says NHS leader The UK has become “one of the first in the world” to approve the use of Pfizer’s Covid-19 antiviral after it was found to help prevent the virus from multiplying in at-risk sufferers, PA reports. A potentially “life-saving” treatment called Paxlovid has been approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for use among adults who could be vulnerable to coronavirus due to age, weight or a prior chronic illness. The decision comes after the regulator found the drug - which can be taken at home - was safe and effective at reducing the risks of being admitted to hospital and death in people with mild to moderate coronavirus infection and who are also at an increased risk of developing severe disease. In a clinical trial in high-risk adults with symptomatic coronavirus infection, it was found to reduce the risk of being admitted to hospital and of death by almost 90%. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said: The UK has been a world leader at finding and rolling out Covid-19 treatments to patients. This is further proved by the MHRA being one of the first in the world to approve this life-saving antiviral. The booster campaign, testing and antiviral defences ensure our country is in the strongest possible position to deal with the threat posed by Omicron as we head into the new year. Developed by Pfizer, Paxlovid is an antiviral medicine with a combination of active ingredients, PF-07321332 and ritonavir, that works by inhibiting a protease required for virus replication. This prevents it from multiplying, keeping virus levels low and helping the body to overcome the viral infection. The two active substances of Paxlovid come as separate tablets that are packaged together and taken together, twice a day by mouth for five days. Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said: Today we have given our regulatory approval for Paxlovid, a Covid-19 treatment found to cut Covid-19 related hospitalisations and deaths by 89% when taken within three days of the start of symptoms. We now have a further antiviral medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 that can be taken by mouth rather than administered intravenously. This means it can be administered outside a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage. I hope the announcement today gives reassurance to those particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, for whom this treatment has been approved. For these individuals, this treatment could be life-saving. Based on the clinical trial data, MHRA said it had found Paxlovid is most effective when taken during the early stages of infection and so recommends its use as soon as possible and within five days of the start of symptoms. It has been authorised for use in people aged 18 and above who have mild to moderate Covid-19 infection and at least one risk factor for developing severe illness. Such risk factors include obesity, being over 60, diabetes mellitus, or heart disease. Ben Osborn, country manager at Pfizer UK, said: This milestone is an important moment in our continued fight against Covid-19, offering the NHS another possible treatment option as cases continue to rise. This at-home therapy, shown in clinical trials to reduce hospitalisations and save lives, has the potential to lessen the devastating impact of a virus that has now taken over five million lives globally. Almost forgot to say, good morning from New Orleans! I’m Lucy Campbell, I’ll be bringing you all the latest global developments on the coronavirus pandemic for the next eight hours. Please feel free to get in touch with me as I work if you have a story or tips to share - your thoughts are always welcome. Email: lucy.campbell@theguardian.com Twitter: @lucy_campbell_ The number of NHS hospital staff in England absent due to Covid has nearly doubled since the start of the month, new figures show. PA reports that some 24,632 staff at NHS hospital trusts were ill with coronavirus or having to self-isolate on Boxing Day, up 31% from 18,829 a week earlier and nearly double the 12,508 at the start of the month. The new NHS England data comes after separate figures showed that the number of Covid patients in hospital in England had climbed to 11,452 on Thursday, the highest level since 26 February. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said the NHS is facing a “perfect storm” of rising Covid hospital admissions and illness alongside increasing numbers of frontline workers being off sick. The NHS is putting in plans to step up once again for patients with the new Nightingale surge hubs, extra support from community services and virtual wards, but there is no doubt the whole system is running hot. While the government seems determined not to increase restrictions in England, it is vital we all behave in ways that will not exacerbate an already dangerous situation. NHS England national medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the health service is “on a war footing” and minimising absences on the frontline would be “essential” in the coming weeks. We don’t yet know the full scale of rising Omicron cases and how this will affect people needing NHS treatment but, having hit a 10-month high for the number of patients in hospital with Covid while wrestling with sharply increasing staff absences, we are doing everything possible to free up beds and get people home to their loved ones - and in the last week hundreds more beds were freed up each day compared to the week before. The NHS is on a war footing, and, while staff remain braced for the worst, with Covid absence for NHS staff almost doubling in the past fortnight, keeping as many colleagues as possible at work on the front line and minimising absence, will be essential in the next few weeks. Meanwhile, ministers have been warned they must be ready to apply restrictions “at pace” as the NHS puts itself on an emergency footing to deal with a possible surge in patients with Covid. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said trust leaders recognise that the UK government’s threshold for introducing extra measures in England “hasn’t been crossed yet” but that additional capacity is being created in case hospital pressures increase. Even if extra restrictions are put in place to control the Omicron variant, it will take two weeks to reduce the hospital admission rate, he said. Hopson told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: It is the government who sets the rules on restrictions, not the NHS, and we know that the government has set a high threshold on introducing new restrictions. So, on that basis, trust leaders can see why the government is arguing that, in the absence of a surge of seriously ill older patients coming into hospital, that threshold hasn’t yet been crossed. But we still don’t know if a surge will come, and indeed we are exactly talking about the preparations we are making for that surge right now. So, in terms of restrictions, I think we are in exactly the same place we’ve been for the past fortnight, which is the government needs to be ready to introduce tighter restrictions at real speed should they be needed. So-called Nightingale hubs are being established at some hospitals to deal with a “super-surge” in patients with Covid in a move that Hopson said would require the NHS to “go into an emergency mode” amid staff shortages, partly due to high coronavirus infections. He said recently retired health workers and volunteers would be asked to staff the hubs, which would be used for patients “who are effectively over the worst” and being readied for discharge. It came as a leading scientist said it is likely that the NHS will be overwhelmed by the spread of Omicron. Prof Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), told BBC Breakfast: I think we haven’t quite reached the threshold that was set by government in terms of the NHS being overwhelmed, but it looks like that will be reached quite quickly. What I’m very concerned about is our NHS staff, my dear colleagues who have worked so, so hard all through the repeated waves of this infection. How are they going to cope? The World Health Organization has issued a message of hope while urging renewed action for the year ahead. WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: “With the curtain closing on 2021, we are faced by a somber milestone, and a stark choice. The power is in our hands to change the course of the Covid-19 crisis once and for all.” South Africa, the first country to report the Omicron variant, says a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, in his new year’s message. The number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is up from 7,166 on Christmas Day, to 11,452. That is the highest figure since February. A huge number of people in England are not turning up for their Covid vaccine appointments, health leaders have said, saying as many as 40% of bookings are missed. Amid a shortage in the UK, National Pharmacy Association chairman Andrew Lane said more lateral flow tests are being distributed to pharmacies but supply is “still very patchy.” Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, has said “In terms of restrictions, I think we are in exactly the same place we’ve been for the past fortnight, which is the government needs to be ready to introduce tighter restrictions at real speed should they be needed. It is worth remembering that it does take about a fortnight for any new restrictions to affect the level of hospital admissions, so the pattern of hospital admissions for the next fortnight has already been set.” Schools and parents across Wales are preparing for some children to return to home and online learning when the new term begins. First minister Mark Drakeford said teacher and staff illness meant some pupils would return to home learning with decisions would be made by individual schools and councils, rather than the Welsh government. Hogmanay in Scotland will be marked for a second consecutive year with restrictions in place on the hospitality sector. Pubs will be able to stay open provided they have table service in place, but there will be no nightclubbing. First minister Nicola Sturgeon has praised healthcare workers in her new year’s address, and said “this is not the Hogmanay we all wanted and hoped for. But I believe that we can still look ahead to 2022 with optimism.” Israel’s health minister Nitzan Horowitz said the country will extend the offer of a fourth vaccine dose to elderly people in care facilities, citing their high exposure and vulnerability to infections. Hong Kong authorities have discovered cases of infection of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the community, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said. It marked the first local cases in about three months. Daily Covid cases in New South Wales, Australia, almost doubled overnight, raising pressure on the state’s health system. The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. A US woman has told how she confined herself to an aeroplane toilet cubicle after testing positive for Covid halfway through a flight from Chicago to Iceland. New Zealand has eased rules on public gatherings in time for New Year’s Eve after a scare over community cases of the new Omicron variant. That is it from me, Martin Belam. I will see you here next week, and in the meantime I wish you all the best for the new year. Lucy Campbell will be here shortly to take you through the rest of the day. A couple of statistics derived from the NHS England figures that have been released this morning. Dan Bloom, a former colleague of mine at the Mirror, points out that the number of patients in hospital with Covid in England is up from 7,166 on Christmas Day, to 11,452. That is the highest figure since February. The Spectator have a slightly different take on this, with their data journalist Michael Simmons highlighting that “a third of Covid positive hospital patients in England are not primarily being treated for Covid.” This is a matter of some contention between those who say Covid cases risk overwhelming the NHS, and those that argue that a significant proportion of those in hospital “with Covid” only have it as a side issue, and it isn’t the primary reason they are occupying an NHS bed. In fact, much earlier this morning on Sky News, Chaand Nagpaul, who is chair of the Council of the British Medical Association, was asked about this. He had said: Whilst the proportion of people who end up in hospital as a result of Omicron is smaller, we’re definitely seeing significant increases. And the trouble is that those increases in hospitalisation mean that other patients – and there are 6 million people are on a waiting list at the moment, it’s a record for the NHS, 312,000 have been waiting more than 12 months – it means that they can’t then be treated in hospital because their beds have been occupied by other patients. You know, 25,000 patients were admitted with Covid in a four week period before Christmas, those are 25,000 beds that could have been available for other patients. He was then asked to clarify whether that was 25,000 people admitted with Covid, or 25,000 people in hospital who now have Covid, which isn’t quite the same thing. Dr Nagpaul said it was a good question, but he didn’t have the data. The argument here boils down to, on the one hand, if you are not in favour of further restrictions or precautions, arguing that incidental cases of Covid caught in hospital mean the numbers being admitted with Covid are over-stated and the NHS isn’t under as much pressure as people claim. On the other hand, the argument runs that these people are still in NHS beds and, presumably, need to be moved into more Covid-secure wards, be treated as Covid-positive, and have the potential to still get seriously ill with the novel coronavirus. Opposition parties in Wales have been calling for the Labour-led Welsh government to publish the advice from scientific advisors it used to introduce the “alert level two” restrictions Wales is living under. It has now published two reports from its Technical Advisory Group (TAG) that show that the advice changed significantly between 15 and 17 December. A TAG report dated 15 December said introducing very strong alert level four restrictions (measures such as staying local and non-essential shops shutting) would have a “material effect” on reducing the peak of cases. It said anything below alert level four would have “some dampening effect” but may not prevent “material harm to NHS and care services” and added it was “not advisable” to start off with “light touch” mitigations. Then a report dated 17 December said no matter what measures were taken peak cases would far exceed previous heights. Significantly, it said the size of the peak would be similar whether Wales moved to alert level two or four for a maximum of two weeks, the only difference being the timing of the peaks. Being in alert level four could delay peak hospitalisations from mid-late January to early February 2022. The report concluded that if restrictions were going to be applied for two weeks only, there may be “negligible benefit” but a “high cost” of imposing stricter rules. However, if bringing in restrictions for four weeks, alert level four “could have a significant impact”. A huge number of people in England are not turning up for their Covid vaccine appointments, health leaders have said, saying as many as 40% of bookings are missed. The revelation comes as the government claimed to have met its coronavirus booster jabs target, and that every adult in England had been offered a top-up shot. The NHS Confederation said it was “encouraging” to see people coming forward and getting their Covid-19 jabs but that it was receiving reports that some sites were only a third full. Matthew Taylor, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said it had been informed by some primary care leaders that people were not showing up to as many as 40% of their scheduled bookings. “It is encouraging to see people still coming forward for their first and second doses, as well as the massive achievement on boosters,” he said. “However, cases of Omicron are rising rapidly … Health leaders are worried about the level of illness and demand that their staff across the NHS could have to respond to in January and so, it is vital that everyone who is eligible takes up the offer of a jab or booster shot.” Read more of Sarah Marsh’s report here: Huge numbers of people in England ‘not turning up for Covid booster jabs’ Schools and parents across Wales are preparing for some children to return to home and online learning when the new term begins. The first minister, Mark Drakeford, said teacher and staff illness meant some pupils would return to home learning with decisions would be made by individualschools and councils, rather than the Welsh government. He told BBC Wales: “We’ve asked schools to prepare for how they can reopen and have children back in the classroom - what level of protections do they need to build in for that? “But in some places, because teachers are ill and other school staff aren’t able to be there, they will have to plan for some period where some children will have to be taught remotely again.” Drakeford has told people thinking of travelling to England from Wales for New Year’s Eve celebrations to “think consciously and carefully,” but is not asking people to remain in Wales, where nightclubs are closed and pubs and restaurants are operating under restrictions. “If you are travelling, make sure you have taken a lateral flow test before you go and think about the people you will be mixing with when you return,” he said. Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra, Australia are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. Among the protesters are Indigenous land rights activists, anti-vaccine groups and so-called sovereign citizens. The latter is a fringe conspiracy group rooted in antisemitism and organised around a haphazard collection of pseudo-legal beliefs broadly grouped around the notion that modern government is an illegitimate corporation. Before the fire on Friday, a piece of paper was taped to a door at Old Parliament House labelled a “notice of acquiescence by default”. It was addressed to, among others, “The Australian Commonwealth de facto Corporate Administration” and contained a garbled set of legalese mirroring sovereign citizen beliefs. Read more of Michael McGowan’s report here: Old Parliament House fire protesters linked to anti-vaccine and conspiracy groups My colleagues Alfie Packham and Rachel Obordo have spoken to three people about their plans for New Year’s Eve, posing the question – is it time to self-isolate or to party? If you were thinking of heading out to celebrate New Year’s Eve tonight, this quote from Nervtag’s Prof Peter Openshaw on BBC Breakfast might give you pause for thought. PA Media quote him saying: Omicron is so infectious. We’re lucky really that it wasn’t this infectious when it first moved into human-to-human transmission. We’ve had several iterations of this virus going through different stages of its evolution. It has ended up being so infectious that it almost needs just a whiff of infected breath and you could get infected. We’re in a relatively good position in countries like the UK but I think you have to remember that in many parts of the world the vaccination rates are only about 5%, and they’re being exposed to this very infectious virus with very little protection. Omicron spread through Europe has sent Spain’s infection rate spiralling to record highs and decimated reservations at restaurants that had pinned their hopes on holiday season trade. Reuters spoke to Juan Lozano, head waiter at the La Querida restaurant in Madrid’s Pozuelo neighbourhood, which was almost fully booked in early December. He said that now just four tables out of La Querida’s two dozen booked on New Year’s Day. “We all thought... we’d be able to make some money and pay off many things that are overdue,” he said. Unlike other Spanish regions, which have imposed capacity limits, mandatory COVID passes and even a curfew in Catalonia, Madrid has not introduced any restrictions on eating out and socialising. But restaurants are still feeling the pinch. “The outlook is horrendously bad,” said Lozano, insisting that the government must give more support to the sector. He complained that state-backed soft loans were not enough. “People say ‘can’t you get a state credit?’ Yes but that’s a debt I have to pay back, isn’t it?” Part of the reason that the airwaves in the UK this morning have featured a lot of chatter that things aren’t so serious with the Omicron variant is because The Times lead their front page today with a story “No need for more Covid curbs, say NHS chiefs”. They opened: NHS chiefs do not believe that the threshold for new Covid-19 restrictions has been crossed despite a surge in hospital admissions. The number of patients with the coronavirus on wards in England rose to 11,452 yesterday, the highest since February and up 61 per cent in a week. While concerned by the increase in admissions, NHS leaders have been reassured by the fact that serious illness among the elderly has not risen significantly. They then quoted Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, saying: Although the numbers are going up and going up increasingly rapidly, the absence of large numbers of seriously ill older people is providing significant reassurance. But they are aware that this may change after the Christmas period. Trust CEOs know that the government has a high threshold to cross before it will introduce extra restrictions and can see why, in the absence of that surge of severely ill older people, that threshold hasn’t been crossed yet. Hopson has been asked about this on the BBC Radio 4 programme this morning, and this is what he said, according to PA Media (with my emphasis on the two key lines): It is the Government who sets the rules on restrictions, not the NHS. We still don’t know if a surge will come, and indeed we are exactly talking about the preparations we are making for that surge right now. So, in terms of restrictions, I think we are in exactly the same place we’ve been for the past fortnight, which is the government needs to be ready to introduce tighter restrictions at real speed should they be needed. And just to make the point that that is somewhat different to a headline that states NHS leaders think there is no need for more curbs - they may be needed at pace if the evidence warrants it. And just one more important point, I think - it is worth remembering that it does take about a fortnight for any new restrictions to affect the level of hospital admissions, so the pattern of hospital admissions for the next fortnight has already been set. Amid a lot of optimistic noises about evidence of the “mildness” of the Omicron variant and the modest rise in hospitalisations compared to cases so far in the UK, Professor Peter Openshaw, who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), has struck a more cautious note this morning on BBC Breakfast. PA Media quote him saying: The latest figures show extraordinary rises in infection rates and this is before we’ve had time to see the full effect of what’s happened over Christmas. The people currently who are very sadly dying of Covid were probably infected on average about 35 days ago, so this was really before Omicron really started to transmit. It’s therefore too early to say what the impact of Omicron is going to be on more severe disease. It’s mostly been circulating in children, in people in contact with children, and it’s now going to spread into older adults at much higher risk of severe disease and those with pre-existing illnesses. I’m very, very glad that a very large majority of those have been triple-vaccinated because that gives you very good levels of protection, admittedly probably not for good but at least for a while. Here’s a little bit more detail from Reuters on the moves in Israel to offer a fourth vaccine shot. Dan Williams reports that health minister Nitzan Horowitz said today the country will extend the offer of a fourth shot to elderly people in care facilities, citing their high exposure and vulnerability to infections. An Israeli hospital administered fourth shots to a test group of health workers on Monday, in what it called the first major study into whether a second round of boosters will help contend with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Results are expected within two weeks. A health ministry expert panel last week recommended that Israel offer a fourth shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer/BioNTech to medical workers and those over 60 or with compromised immune systems. You may recall British prime minister Boris Johnson’s words from 12 December, when he told the UK in a televised address: A fortnight ago I said we would offer every eligible adult a booster by the end of January. Today, in light of this Omicron emergency, I am bringing that target forward by a whole month. Everyone eligible aged 18 and over in England will have the chance to get their booster before the New Year. There then ensued a minor kerfuffle about the exact semantics of that. It certainly seemed to give the impression in some quarters that the prime minister was promising those booster jabs would be administered to everyone who wanted one, not just offered, although as you can see it was very tightly worded. The government’s own Covid dashboard indicates that as of 29 December, 58.3% of those aged 12 and above have had a third booster jab. Bipasha van der Zijde is a marketing and communications adviser at KIT Royal Tropical Institute, and she writes for us today that we can vaccinate 70% of the world against Covid by mid-2022: According to the WHO vaccine strategy, published in October, the goal is to have 70% coverage across the world by June 2022. How can this target be achieved? Will freeing up intellectual property rights, often cited as a possible solution, bridge the widening gap? For a country to start producing vaccines from scratch would be a massive challenge. According to Benjamin Ongeri, a health supply chain specialist with Crown Agents in Kenya: “Countries like Kenya have begun this journey by targeting the final filling of vaccine vials locally which is still quite challenging given the need for state-of-the-art pharmaceutical manufacturing plants that will guarantee safe production with no chance of contamination.” A lot more will be required in terms of technology transfer and building the expertise needed to fully produce vaccines locally, these cannot be achieved in the short to medium term. The answer lies in global funding mechanisms such as Covax – provided they can guarantee a pre-planned availability of vaccines. More equitable distribution of the jabs on a structural basis with longer shelf lives will allow for realistic and efficient planning. Read more here: Bipasha van der Zijde – We can vaccinate 70% of the world against Covid by mid-2022. Here’s how Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers, which represents health trusts, has said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the use of extra capacity hubs at hospitals would be a recognition that there was an “emergency” situation needed to deal with Covid-19 admissions. PA Media quotes him saying: The hubs are there to have super-surge capacity on top of that, so we really would be in an emergency if we were having to use them and therefore we would have to use an emergency staffing model, because we are very clear in the NHS: we don’t have the staff, the existing staff, to be able to staff these beds, so we would have to go into an emergency mode. The important thing to understand is that what we would be using these hubs for - we wouldn’t be using these hubs for the most critically ill patients. What we would be doing is using them for patients who were effectively over the worst, heading towards discharge for home Earlier Dr Azeem Majeed, the head of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, cast some doubt on the ability to staff the hubs that were announced by NHS England yesterday. He told Times Radio: We saw when these hubs were established in March and April last year when the NHS struggled to find the staff to man those hospitals. Hopefully those won’t be needed, but if we do need those extra beds it will be a struggle to find the staff to deal with those patients - I’m not quite sure where those staff will come from given the fact hospitals are struggling now with their current workload. NHS England has said it is creating new small-scale “Nightingale” facilities with up to 100 beds each at eight hospitals across the country. The first sites will be at Preston, Leeds, Birmingham, Leicester, Stevenage, St George’s in London, Ashford and Bristol. In the UK, National Pharmacy Association chairman Andrew Lane said more lateral flow tests are being distributed to pharmacies but supply is “still very patchy”, and he expects the test packs to be picked up “within the first few hours” of them being delivered today. He added that pharmacy staff are facing abuse from patients frustrated by being unable to find a test. PA Media quote him telling BBC Breakfast: I spoke to the managing director of Alliance Healthcare who are our wholesalers that distribute the tests into pharmacies, and she assured me that they are putting out two million a day and we are starting to see that come through. It is still very patchy though, so I will say that not every pharmacy today will have a box but most pharmacies in the country will be having a box so we just ask the public to persevere, and also treat us with respect. We have had a lot of abuse over the last couple of weeks when the tests haven’t been there, but teams are doing their very best to help the public with this. A box will contain, I think, 54 tests and many of our members are reporting that that box is gone within the first couple of hours of arriving within the pharmacy. In December 2019 the World Health Organization was told of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China. My colleagues Ashley Kirk and Pamela Duncan have produced these charts which show how Covid-19 has spread across the world since then. Hong Kong authorities have discovered cases of infection of the Omicron coronavirus variant in the community, Health Secretary Sophia Chan said. It marked the first local cases in about three months. Chan told reporters, including Marius Zaharia of Reuters, that one of four air crew members testing positive after their return to Hong Kong had breached home quarantine rules by going to a restaurant, where he passed the virus to his father and a client sitting at another table. Hong Kong had not recorded any coronavirus cases spread by community transmission since October. Schools in Wales are being asked to prepare for the possibility of reopening in January for remote learning. Yesterday First Minister Mark Drakeford explained in an interview with Wales Online that: The first two days of term are planning days. What the education minister Jeremy Miles has asked schools to do is to plan for two possible futures: the one in which children can still be in the classroom, where there are sufficient staff to be there to be able to provide face-to-face learning, but to maximise the protection that can be put in place inside the classroom to keep students and staff as safe as possible. But we recognise that there will be some schools where, because Omicron is so transmissible, there will be staff who will be ill so it won’t be possible for every child to be in the classroom and therefore that a return for some students for a shorter period of time as possible to online learning may have to be there as well. This morning Cathy Owen reports for Wales Online that Laura Doel, director of head teachers’ union NAHT Cymru, has described remote learning as a “last resort”, and called for tests to be prioritised for schools. She said: The availability of staff is the biggest threat to education in January. Without the workforce fit and well, learners cannot go back to the classroom. If regular LFTs are to be part of the package of mitigations it is vital that schools have a supply ready for reopening. Another doctor, Dr Azeem Majeed, head of primary care and public health at Imperial College London, has also been on the airwaves in the UK this morning to say that NHS workers are struggling to access Covid-19 tests, and the government should prioritise key workers when distributing them. PA Media quote him telling Times Radio: I struggled to get a test recently. I am required to test twice a week as an NHS worker but when I log on to the online site, there’s often none in stock. It’s not just NHS staff but other key workers too, such as social care workers, police, fire service and so on, who need these tests as well so it is worrying that they’re in such short supply at the moment. My view is that people in key groups, whether they’re healthcare workers or other key workers like public transport should be prioritised to ensure our NHS can function, our schools can function, that our society can function well. Testing capability is also making the headlines in Australia. Ben Butler reports for us: The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. Amid a national shortage of the tests, both governments said they were working out how best to distribute tens of millions of kits they have ordered, most of which will not arrive until the end of January. NSW and Victoria have watered down previous commitments to provide free tests after a national cabinet meeting with the federal government on Thursday. Adding to the confusion, on Friday morning the prime minister, Scott Morrison, issued a statement removing a requirement that confirmed Covid cases who are in isolation but don’t have symptoms take a test on the sixth day. This directly contradicted statements, also made on Friday, by the NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, and Victoria’s health minister, Martin Foley, that a day-six rapid test was required. Read more of Ben Butler’s report here: NSW and Victoria unable to explain how Covid rapid antigen tests will be distributed to vulnerable Chaand Nagpaul, who is chair of the Council of the British Medical Association, has been on Sky News this morning in the UK outlining what he sees as one of the significant issues with the lack of availability of lateral flow or PCR tests in the UK at the moment – the knock-on effect for staffing in the NHS. He said: We’ve seen up to about a three times increase in staff absence from either infection or isolation in some London hospitals. Now that’s creating huge pressure on the system, when we already are short-staffed at the busiest time of the year. And to add to that problem, we now have a situation where many staff cannot get their lateral flow tests, or a PCR test, which means they can’t return to work. Because what they need to return to work is to demonstrate a negative lateral flow test on day six and seven, which was specially introduced so that we can shorten the period of isolation. So this is creating enormous problems for us. And for the workforce that remains, they’re having to carry out the work of their absent colleagues. And that’s adding additional strain and stress, and patients are therefore going to suffer as a result. Hogmanay in Scotland will be marked for a second consecutive year with restrictions in place on the hospitality sector. Pubs will be able to stay open provided they have table service in place, but there will be no nightclubbing. In her new year message, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon has praised healthcare workers, saying: Throughout this year, our health and care workers have continued to do an absolutely magnificent job. And those working on our vaccination programme have provided all of us with an incredible service. Thanks to their efforts – and also thanks to the sacrifices of people right across the country – earlier this year businesses were able to reopen. The Omicron variant is a very significant threat. It means that at the moment, we need above all to keep each other safe. We all need to stay at home, far more than we would want to at this time of year. And we have asked that you minimise new year socialising as much as you can. So this is not the Hogmanay we all wanted and hoped for. But I believe that we can still look ahead to 2022 with optimism. Queensland in Australia is due to change travel restrictions into the state despite a surge in fresh Covid cases and criticisms the new requirements are “pointless” in states with large outbreaks. From 11.59pm on Friday 31 December, travellers entering Queensland will be required to return a negative rapid antigen test (RAT) result within 72 hours before travel, rather than a negative PCR test. The change in rules comes as the state recorded 3,118 new cases overnight, with the number of active infections rising to 11,697. Evidence of a negative test result has to be uploaded to the Queensland Health website when applying for a border pass, with applicants making a declaration the information is correct. However, the change raises questions about the accuracy and reliability of test results, as unlike PCR tests, the tests are not performed by trained professionals or analysed by and reported to a central authority. Police commissioner Katarina Carroll said on Wednesday that from January those caught lying about a RAT result on their border declaration would face a heavy fine. Read more of Royce Kurmelovs’ report here: Queensland’s new travel rule labelled ‘pointless’ as state faces fresh Covid surge A lot of the noises coming from politicians and health experts in the UK seems cautiously optimistic across much of the media this morning. One concern though is the continued shortage of Covid tests, which may impact people’s ability to test themselves before going out tonight. To give you an idea of the availability issue, one web developer Russ Garrett has been monitoring the situation on the government’s own booking website, and the picture looks pretty grim from the last few days. Hello, it is Martin Belam here in London taking over from Samantha Lock. Here’s a recap of the latest Covid figures for the UK. Over the last seven days there have been nearly 1 million new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK – 984,147. Cases have increased by 45.1% week-on-week. There have been 701 deaths recorded in the last week. Deaths have decreased by 10.6% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have increased by 32.3% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 11,898 people in hospital in total, of whom 868 are in ventilation beds. There’s some considerable caveats over those numbers though, due to data collection issues over the holiday period. With the constraint on the availability of tests, that record number of new cases may be an undercount. Nevertheless, the large number of cases is yet to translate into a significant increase in deaths or hospitalisations, which many will see as a positive sign and a vindication of the decision in England not to impose significant new Covid restrictions. The World Health Organization has issued a message of hope while urging renewed action for the year ahead. WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: With the curtain closing on 2021, we are faced by a somber milestone, and a stark choice. The power is in our hands to change the course of the Covid-19 crisis once and for all.” In a statement titled ‘My hope for ending the Covid-19 pandemic’ Tedros outlined a series of resolutions including a global target of vaccinating 70% of people in all countries by the middle of 2022, building a stronger global framework for global health security and investing in stronger primary health care. I believe that if we can make progress on these goals, we will be gathering again, at the end of 2022, not to mark the end of a third year of pandemic, but to celebrate a return to pre-Covid norms, when we gathered with our families and communities to celebrate together and cherish each other’s company and love.” In series of video messages shared to Twitter, he added: If we end inequity, we end the pandemic, and end the global nightmare we have all lived through. This will be the year we end it [the pandemic] … When health is at risk everything is at risk.” If you’ve just joined us here’s a quick rundown of the latest developments: UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, in his new year’s message. South Africa, the first country to report the Omicron variant, says a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. Daily Covid cases in New South Wales, Australia, almost doubled overnight, raising pressure on the state’s health system. Israel has approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable and immunocompromised people, becoming one of the first countries to do so. China is set to impose new import restrictions over virus contamination fears in a move that has worried foreign businesses providing goods to the world’s largest market for food and drink. South Korea said on Friday it will extend stricter social distancing rules for two weeks until 16 January. The curbs ban gatherings of over four fully vaccinated people, and require restaurants, cafes and bars to close by 9pm and movie theatres and internet cafes by 10pm. A US woman has told how she confined herself to an aeroplane toilet cubicle after testing positive for Covid halfway through a flight from Chicago to Iceland. New Zealand has eased rules on public gatherings in time for New Year’s Eve after a scare over community cases of the new Omicron variant. New York City will go ahead with New Year’s Eve celebrations in Times Square as planned despite record numbers of Covid-19 infections. Foreign revellers on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali have been warned they could be deported if they are caught violating Covid-19 health rules during New Year celebrations. US health experts are urging Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks due to the rising wave of Covid cases led by the Omicron variant. Hello and thanks for joining us for our final Covid blog of 2021. I’m Samantha Lock and I’m certainly hoping for a more promising new year ahead and end to the pandemic. UK prime minister Boris Johnson claims Britain is in an “incomparably better” position in the fight against Covid than it was at the end of 2020, in his new year’s message. “We can say one thing with certainty - our position this December the 31st is incomparably better than last year,” Johnson said, while admitting there was still anxiety about the Omicron variant and growing numbers of hospital admissions. However, he hailed the success of the government’s vaccine programme as the “one overriding reason” that tougher restrictions were not needed in the face of daily case numbers hitting record levels. “Precisely because of that huge national effort that we can celebrate tonight at all,” he said. More promising news has also emerged from South Africa, the first country to report the Omicron variant. Health officials say a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. “All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level,” a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said. New cases detected in the week ending 25 December fell 29.7% compared to the previous week, government data showed. Daily Covid cases in New South Wales, Australia, almost doubled overnight, raising pressure on the state’s health system. Cases have likely exceeded 25,000 a day, a month earlier than the government was predicting a fortnight ago, an acceleration likely to bring forward the strains on the health system, experts say. The NSW government reported 21,151 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, almost a 90% jump on the previous day’s tally. Kerry Chant, the state’s chief health officer, said in a video briefing it’s “likely” the increase is higher than reported. Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University said tests were probably catching about 80% of actual cases, meaning NSW will already be at the 25,000 cases a day rate flagged by health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December. Read the full story here. The World Health Organization has shared an optimistic message ahead of the New Year. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, infectious disease epidemiologist and WHO Covid-19 Technical Lead, said: We can take the death out of Covid-19 and we can also reduce the spread. It will end. This pandemic will end. I’m incredibly hopeful for 2022 in the fact that we can regain control over this.” Germany is reporting a daily rise of 41,240 confirmed coronavirus cases and 323 deaths, according to recently released data from the Robert Koch Institute. China will impose new import restrictions from Saturday in a move that has worried foreign businesses providing goods to the world’s largest market for food and drink. Under laws set to kick in on 1 January, all producers of food shipped to China will have to register with the customs authority. The extra hurdle was previously required only for products posing potential health risks, such as seafood. But now coffee, alcohol, honey, olive oil, chocolate and several other products will also be scrutinised, Agence France-Presse reports. On New Year’s Day, “the import curtain will fall”, Alban Renaud, a China-based lawyer with the firm Adaltys, told AFP. Food companies and importers have already been battered by control measures included in Beijing’s strict zero-Covid strategy, with China linking the virus to food ever since a Beijing outbreak last year was blamed on imported salmon. Products entering China are now subject to extra screening and repeated disinfection, with products often banned when a Covid outbreak is discovered at the point of packing overseas. The World Health Organization has said the chances of Covid-19 being transported in food are slim. South Korea said on Friday it will extend stricter social distancing rules for two weeks amid a persistent surge in serious coronavirus infections and concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant. The government reinstated the curbs on 18 December, six weeks after easing them under a “living with Covid-19” scheme, as record-breaking numbers of new infections and serious cases put a huge strain on the country’s medical system. The extension is also aimed at bracing for a further spread of Omicron cases by using the time to secure more hospital beds and encourage a booster vaccine shot campaign, Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said. “We should reserve sufficient beds that can cover some 10,000 cases a day, and we should also speed up booster shots and children’s vaccinations,” he told an intra-agency meeting. The curbs, which will be effective until 16 January ban gatherings of over four fully vaccinated people, and require restaurants, cafes and bars to close by 9 pm and movie theatres and internet cafes by 10pm. Unvaccinated people can only dine out alone, or use takeout or delivery services. South Korea also cancelled its traditional midnight bell-ringing ceremony. A US woman has told how she confined herself to an aeroplane toilet cubicle after testing positive for Covid halfway through a flight from Chicago to Iceland. Marisa Fotieo, a teacher from Michigan, said her throat began to hurt halfway through the trip so she went to the bathroom to perform a rapid Covid test which confirmed she was infected. “I just took my rapid test and I brought it into the bathroom, and within what felt like two seconds there were two lines [indicating a positive test],” Fotieo told NBC News. Sharing the news over TikTok, Fotieo posted a short video from inside the cramped quarters, writing: “POV you test positive for Covid while over the Atlantic Ocean.” Read the full story here. Stock markets in Asia are looking mixed today with the Nikkei, Australia’s ASX200 index and Kospi in Seoul all down. This is despite the Nikkei finishing at its highest point since 1989 – just before its bubble burst – in Thursday’s session. It was more positive in China and Hong Kong where all the induces were up helped by positive figures about China’s giant manufacturing sector and an easing of commodity prices. New Zealand has eased rules on public gatherings in time for New Year’s Eve after a scare over community cases of the new Omicron variant. The country is set to lead the world’s celebrations of the new year at midnight on Friday and crowds will be allowed to gather in Auckland for the first time since August to join in the party after the city’s Covid traffic-light settings were moved from red to orange. New Zealand is traditionally one of the first countries to bring in the new year before time differences usher in midnight elsewhere but the festivities had been threatened by tight coronavirus restrictions in place for months. Under orange settings, the bars, restaurants and cafes that enforce vaccine pass requirements can remove crowd size limits and the requirement to sit down, allowing people to dance the night away. Read the full story here. New York City will go ahead with New Year’s Eve celebrations in Times Square as planned despite record numbers of Covid-19 infections. Mayor Bill de Blasio confirmed the news on Thursday, saying the city’s high Covid-19 vaccination rate makes it feasible to welcome masked, socially distanced crowds to watch the ball drop in Times Square. We want to show that we’re moving forward, and we want to show the world that New York City is fighting our way through this. We’ve got to send a message to the world. New York City is open.” City officials previously announced plans for a scaled-back New Year’s bash with smaller crowds and vaccinations required. Other US cities such as Atlanta have cancelled New Year’s Eve celebrations, New York City reported a record number of new, confirmed coronavirus cases — almost 44,000 — on Wednesday, according to New York state figures. Foreign revellers on Indonesia’s resort island of Bali have been warned they could be deported if they are caught violating Covid-19 health rules during New Year celebrations, authorities warned on Thursday. Bali immigration office head Jamaruli Manihuruk warned that health rules must be observed in an interview with AFP. Get ready to be kicked out.” Bali’s governor has barred carnivals, fireworks and gatherings of more than 50 people over the Christmas and New Year period. Malls, restaurants and cafes must shut by 10pm, and only operate at 75% capacity. Bali has taken a tough stance on tourists who violate Covid-19 protocols. Almost 200 tourists were deported from Bali in 2021, Manihuruk said, with seven booted out for violating health protocols. Indonesia has been seriously hit by the coronavirus pandemic. As of Wednesday, it had reported more than 4.2 million confirmed Covid-19 cases, and more than 144,000 deaths. Bali alone reported more than 110,000 confirmed cases with over 4,000 deaths. Vaccination rates remain relatively low and country is vulnerable to new outbreaks. US health experts are urging Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks due to the rising wave of Covid cases led by the Omicron variant. Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told MSNBC: We are going to see the number of cases in this country rise so dramatically, we are going to have a hard time keeping everyday life operating. The next month is going to be a viral blizzard,” he added. “All of society is going to be pressured by this.” Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, also warned cases will likely rise throughout January. The governor of Louisiana, where hospitalisations have more than tripled in the past two weeks, said January would be “very challenging”. “We are still at the very beginning of this current surge,” John Bel Edwards told a news conference on Thursday. “January is going to be very, very challenging.” The warning comes as the United States reached a record high in Covid-19 cases for the second day in a row. South Africa has lifted a nighttime curfew on people’s movement with immediate effect, believing the country has passed the peak of its fourth coronavirus wave driven by the Omicron variant. The government removed the midnight-to-4am curfew based on the trajectory of the pandemic, vaccination levels and available capacity in the health sector, the government said on Thursday. A statement from a special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said: All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level. While the Omicron variant is highly transmissible, there has been lower rates of hospitalisation than in previous waves.” Data from the Department of Health showed a 29.7% weekly decrease in new cases detected in the week ending 25 December, the government said. Hospital admissions have declined in eight of South Africa’s nine provinces. South Africa, with close to 3.5 million infections and 91,000 deaths, has been the worst-hit country in Africa during the pandemic on both counts, and was where the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was first detected last month. The country is at the lowest of its five-stage Covid-19 alert levels. Israel has approved a fourth vaccine shot for vulnerable and immunocompromised people, becoming one of the first countries to do so, amid a surge in Covid in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The country also received its first shipment of Pfizer’s anti-Covid pills. Health ministry director-general Nachman Ash told reporters: Today I approved giving the fourth vaccine for immunocompromised people. I did this in light of studies that show the benefit of the vaccine, including the fourth vaccine, to this population, and in light of the fear they are more vulnerable in this outbreak of Omicron.” Health authorities reported on Thursday more than 4,000 new cases, a high not seen since September. Health Minister Nitzan Horowitz said Israel was in “a fifth wave”, with most cases probably related to the Omicron variant. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said Israel, which was among the first countries in the world to offer a third shot to the general public, would be a trailblazer for the fourth jab. “Israel will lead the way in administering a fourth vaccine to the Israeli people,” he said. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as we count down the final hours until 2022. Regions across the world are battling to stem a surge in Covid infections driven largely by the Omicron variant. However South Africa, the first country to report the variant, appears to be bucking the trend. Health officials say a dip in infections in the past week indicates the peak of the current wave has passed. “All indicators suggest the country may have passed the peak of the fourth wave at a national level,” a statement from the special cabinet meeting held earlier on Thursday said. New cases detected in the week ending 25 December fell 29.7% compared to the previous week, government data showed. Meanwhile in the United States, health experts are urging Americans to prepare for severe disruptions in coming weeks due to the rising wave of Covid cases led by the Omicron variant. “We are going to see the number of cases in this country rise so dramatically, we are going to have a hard time keeping everyday life operating,” Dr Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, told MSNBC. “The next month is going to be a viral blizzard,” he added. “All of society is going to be pressured by this.” Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, also warned cases will likely rise throughout January. Here’s a quick summary of the latest Covid developments: The number of people to die from Covid in Eastern Europe has reached 1 million, as Russia climbed above Brazil to become the country with the second-highest deaths behind the US. South Africa said the country had passed its Omicron peak without a major death surge, offering hope to countries hit hard by the mutated variant. France reported 206,243 new confirmed Covid cases, a tally above 200,000 for the second day running. The UK reported 189,213 new Covid cases, smashing Wednesday’s record-breaking tally of 183,037 positive tests. The UK is dogged by a shortage of tests, as Wales assists England with 4m tests amid fears of New Year’s Eve celebrations turning into breeding grounds for the virus. Scotland’s first minister urged people to avoid household mixing after a record high of nearly 17,000 cases. India fears it is entering a new wave after cases surge, as confirmed Omicron cases also climb. Portugal cuts Covid isolation from ten days to seven, after the World Health Organization said on Wednesday slashing isolation was a trade-off between transmission and economic concerns. Germany will drop quarantine demands for UK travellers from 4 January after seeing its own Omicron cases jump above 3,000 recently. Malaysia detected 3,997 positive Covid cases, with the number among survivors of its recently deadly floods rising to 442 in total. Japan recorded over 500 new infections for the first time in two months. Five Bulgarian regions moved from yellow to red zones as the country recorded 3,449 new infections, a 139% jump on two weeks ago. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said all people should avoid cruises, following a rise in onboard Covid cases in a major blow to the industry."

          "headline": "Maxwell conviction increases scrutiny of other women who worked for Epstein",
          "bodyText": "The conviction of Ghislaine Maxwell on sex-trafficking charges this week has increased the scrutiny of others who worked for or socialized with disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein for years, and their knowledge of the pair’s activities. Attention has largely focused on prominent male associates of Epstein, including Prince Andrew, who faces a civil suit brought by Virginia Roberts Giuffre. Giuffre alleges the Queen’s son had sex with her on three occasions two decades ago when, aged 17, she had been sexually trafficked by Jeffrey Epstein, allegations Andrew vehemently denies. Four Epstein employees and assistants were described in a 2007 non-prosecution agreement as “potential co-conspirators” when Epstein pleaded guilty to solicitation in Florida in return for a lenient sentence. Giuffre has said she hopes Maxwell’s conviction “is not the end but rather another step in justice being served. Maxwell did not act alone. Others must be held accountable.” After Epstein’s arrest and suicide in 2019, the US attorney’s office said that it was not bound by the Florida agreement that named the four women – Sarah Kellen, Lesley Groff, Adriana Ross and Nada Marcinkova – and said they could be subject to criminal charges. All have denied involvement or knowledge of the Epstein-Maxwell abuses. Maxwell, 60, who was found guilty on Wednesday of facilitating the abuse of underage girls for Epstein, had argued she was covered by the non-prosecution agreement, but her argument was rejected by presiding judge Alison Nathan. Kellen, 41, who is now married to an American race car driver, is the most prominent of the four women, but has claimed she was also a victim of Epstein. Kellen was accused by lawyers in legal filings years ago of “bringing girls to Epstein’s mansion to be abused”. Kellen’s name came up in witness testimony during the prosecution phase of Maxwell’s trial, when the government’s key witness, known as “Carolyn”, alleged that Kellen scheduled her sexualized massages with Epstein and paid her $500 to pose for a naked photograph when she was 14 or 15 years old. Kellen, who has changed her name, was not called to testify, suggesting she was not cooperating with government prosecutors. Maxwell’s defense team contended that Kellen was among several potential witnesses “who the government could have charged, criminally, based on the testimony we heard”. Groff was Epstein’s New York-based assistant for 20 years. Earlier in December, a civil case against Groff brought by Jennifer Araoz, who had accused Epstein of sexually abusing her at his mansion in New York City in 2001 and 2002, was dropped. According to Groff’s attorneys, Michael Bachner and Jon Whitcomb, federal prosecutors have no plans to bring charges against her at this time. “After a more than two-year investigation by the Department of Justice into Jeffrey Epstein’s conduct, which included lengthy interviews of witnesses and a thorough review of relevant communications, we have been informed that no criminal charges will be brought against Lesley Groff,” Bachner and Whitcomb said in a statement provided to the Guardian. Groff’s attorneys added that their client had “never witnessed anything improper or illegal”. Groff’s lawyers said that she worked from the Madison Avenue offices, and never stepped foot in Epstein’s personal home. Her duties, they said, included making appointments for Epstein, taking his messages, and setting up high-level meetings with “CEOs, business executives, scientists, politicians, celebrities, charitable organizations and universities” and had “no knowledge and no participation in any of these horrific crimes”. Groff “remains heartbroken for Jennifer and all of the victims,” Whitcomb said. Ross, a former model from Poland who moved to Florida in 2002, was hired to work at the financier’s mansion. Ross, also known as Adriana Mucinska, often flew on the financier’s private jet, according to flight records. Asked during civil litigation about how the Epstein conspiracy operated – and if Prince Andrew had ever been involved with under-age women, Ross repeatedly invoked her fifth amendment rights against self-incrimination. Marcinkova is now a pilot and has changed her name. According to police records reported by the Guardian in 2015, one alleged victim claimed that she was told Marcinkova had been bought from her parents in eastern Europe by Epstein when she was 15. One alleged that she was made to have sex with Marcinkova and to watch her have sex with Epstein. Marcinkova has since changed her last name. Bennett Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University in New York, told the Guardian that he has doubts the government plans to prosecute others. “Yes, there are potential new defendants and the government knows that. It’s at the prosecutor’s discretion whether to go forward to prosecute further or whether they feel having convicted Maxwell that’s going to close the book on the prosecution of Epstein and the things Epstein and Maxwell did together.” Information and support for anyone affected by rape or sexual abuse issues is available from the following organisations.

          "headline": "NSW hospitals resort to flying nurses in from overseas as staff are begged to take extra shifts amid Covid crisis",
          "bodyText": "Critically understaffed public hospitals in New South Wales are planning to fly in nurses from overseas, a leaked memo reveals, as managers beg staff to cancel leave and take on extra shifts amid surging Covid cases. It comes as a state health policy change will allow health workers who are close contacts to be recalled to their jobs, the Guardian understands, before completing their seven-day isolation period, if they are considered essential. More than 2,000 health workers are currently isolating due to Covid exposure. At St George hospital in Sydney’s south, the burden of increased hospital presentations and isolation orders was laid bare in a grim end-of-year email sent to all nursing staff, pleading for them to cancel leave. The internal email, obtained by Guardian Australia, warns the hospital “can’t seem to keep up with the exposures and positive staff”, despite concerted efforts to source nurses. “We have commenced the process for overseas recruitment,” the email stated. The last resort had been taken after managers approached more than seven local nursing and midwifery labour agencies, an effort which yielded just one additional registered nurse. Additionally, the hospital had approached private hospitals for workers and pulled back secondments, but had not been able to staff its wards sufficiently. “Across the facility, the patients numbers in the departments are unprecedented,” the email stated, noting the hospital had been forced to reopen its second Covid ward again. “It doesn’t really seem quite right to be wishing a happy new year,” the email said. The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary, Brett Holmes, said hospitals were going to “extraordinary lengths” and managers were “turning themselves inside out trying to find staff”. “Overseas recruitment is a glimmer of hope right now,” he said. At St Vincent’s hospital in Sydney’s east, the facility’s executive director, Kevin Luong, was reported to have sent an email to staff on Thursday, warning the hospital was in an “extremely vulnerable” position. “Whilst we are trying our best to work around this, we are beginning to run out of options to maintain safe nursing staffing levels,” the email said, according to the ABC. Guardian Australia has seen an email sent to St Vincent’s staff pleading for nurses to work shifts on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day, offering a $250 bonus on top of usual penalties as an incentive to work. The offer was extended for nurses in admin roles. “Our current staffing vacancies in nursing is unprecedented and at crisis level,” the email said. The internal email also explained the hospital was “changing our model of care” to focus on emergency department presentations and ICU patients in the first instance. The email urged any nurses who had patients who could be suitable for discharge to do so as soon as possible. Guardian Australia has also been told of concerning staffing ratios in the emergency department at the Royal Prince Alfred hospital in inner-Sydney, as well as at various hospitals across the city. On Friday, NSW’s Covid outbreak became one of the fastest growing in the world, with daily cases almost doubling to 21,151 on New Year’s Eve. Six people died with Covid. Hospitalisations in NSW grew to 832 on Friday, having more than doubled in the week since 382 were in hospitals the previous Friday. Intensive care hospitalisations were rising steadily, with 69 people in ICU beds – 39 of whom were unvaccinated. A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Sydney local health district confirmed it had “approached several nursing agencies to recruit additional staff to join our healthcare team”, and that it was “standard practice” for an LHD to organise its own staffing, including choosing to recruit internationally. Earlier, the premier, Dominic Perrottet, claimed his state’s health system “remains strong”, and said the national close contact definition changes agreed to on Thursday would “put downward pressure in that space”. “We have the best health system in the country, arguably the best in the world, and that is because of years of investment,” he said. “We’ve seen a significant increase in case numbers, but what is pleasing is that our health system remains strong,” Perrottet said. However, Holmes said union members were “copping abuse” because patients were presenting to hospital expecting a smoother experience because of how Perrottet was describing hospital pressure. “Patients and family members are presenting to hospital expecting a robust, high-functioning health system and become extremely agitated when they experience the widespread staffing crisis first-hand,” he said. “Our members want the NSW premier and health minister to admit the current situation in our hospitals is dire and call on the public not to abuse health staff as the system struggles under increased demand,” Holmes said. When asked by Guardian Australia how current pressures in NSW hospitals compared with the worst of the Delta outbreak, Holmes said “I think it’s there now”, noting that during lockdown, presentations for illnesses from car accidents and other life events diminished, but were occurring now. “We’re now fully open, all of those normal everyday presentations are still occurring, and yet we’re still seeing large numbers of patients coming into the health system with Covid – as a result of this government’s decision to let it rip,” Holmes said. Holmes said the current issues in hospitals were a combination of a surge in Covid cases, combined with Covid exposures forcing staff into isolation. “Our members are going above and beyond, shift after shift. Despite everything that is being thrown their way. Enough is enough. The government cannot continue piling more upon nurses and midwives and ignore the conditions they are dealing with.” The chief health officer, Kerry Chant, noted that while hospitalisations had more than doubled in a week, some of those recorded in the hospitalisation figure were in hospital for other reasons, and that this phenomenon was occurring given the extent of the spread of Omicron. The NSW Ambulance commissioner, Dominic Morgan, also appeared at the premier’s Covid update on Friday and warned residents, even those who are Covid-positive, to reserve calling 000 for serious symptoms and illness. He said one in three people who called ambulances currently were not deemed high enough priority for transport to hospital, and said people calling for PCR results and other non-emergencies “tie up our emergency medical call takers and divert us away from the cardiac arrests, the chokings, the drownings”.

          "headline": "The pandemic has allowed us to see so much. What will we do with our newfound clarity?",
          "bodyText": "A retreating ocean is often the first sign of a tsunami. The water along the shoreline is dragged back dramatically, exposing parts of the shore and seabed that are normally underwater. It’s helpful to frame the first two years of the pandemic in similar terms to this ocean drawback. Detaching from our own specific circumstances, and our own specific pandemic pain, we have a unique opportunity to actually see the metaphorical seafloor of the world. Exposed by the pandemic were the often invisible systems that organise our society. These systems are comprised of everything from the expectations of ongoing and unlimited growth via the systems of capitalism and globalisation, to the systems of class, systemic racism and patriarchy, to the more localised systems of government and public service, to the social systems of the nuclear family and individuals, and how our communities, cities, households and green spaces are organised. Also exposed in the drawback of two pandemic years has been our internal seafloor – that of our own psyches. We got to see what we are made of, with previously unimaginable circumstances creating a chance to really test ourselves, see where we fracture and where we are strong. Just like a tsunami, we can expect further devastation to come. But this exposure of our systems could also show us how to rebuild stronger. So what did we see when the virus exposed what’s underpinning our lives and our very selves? And what will we do with this newfound clarity? Economics writer George Megalogenis wrote that the “wicked genius” of Covid was to seek out where the holes and gaps were in our open economic model. In his Quarterly Essay titled Exit strategy: politics after the pandemic, Megalogenis identified that the weak points in Australia’s pandemic response were in the areas that the government had privatised. “Covid says ‘You’ve left me a gap in your safety net – I’ll start killing’,” he told Richard Fidler’s Conversations in 2021. “Australian privatisation was where the weak points were. The commonwealth contracts everything out in aged care” and “the damage done last year in Victoria was when the virus got out of hotel quarantine – also staffed by contract workers including security guards and cleaners who were under trained, underpaid and unaccountable.” But at least until Omicron came along in the final weeks of 2021 – apart from a few notable exceptions including the slow vaccine rollout, the privatisation of aged care and hotel quarantine and lack of support for the university sector and the arts – Australia’s government systems turned out to be robust enough to largely protect the population and the economy. Australia suffered a relatively low death and infection rate compared with the rest of the world, due to border closures and a high level of compliance with lockdowns. And the economy was spared the worst, largely due to the Jobkeeper and Jobseeker schemes. The approach of the federal government (and its NSW counterpart) has changed in response to the rapid emergence of the Omicron variant, stressing the “personal responsibility” of citizens and dramatically changing requirements for testing and isolation – with as yet unknown consequences. But in the initial waves of infection in 2020, according to the ABS, if “Australia had experienced the same crude case and death rates as three comparable countries – Canada, Sweden and the United Kingdom – there would have been between 680,000 and 2 million cases instead of the 28,500 that did occur, and between 15 and 46 times the number of deaths”. Still, the pain was not evenly distributed. While wealthier, white-collar workers were able to work from home (and during lockdown have access to more green spaces and beaches), the brunt of exposure to the virus was found in more working-class jobs such as manufacturing, in insecure work such as food delivery and the gig economy, and in migrant and female-dominated care work, especially in the so-called “LGAs of concern”. Healthcare staff have been quitting in record numbers – due to illness, stress and burnout – and the majority of them are women. According to the Grattan Institute, women also bore the brunt of the economic and psychological impact of the virus, and their lifetime economic disadvantage will be compounded. According to a report by Australian Unions, “government responses have not adequately addressed the way the Covid-19 crisis is reproducing and deepening existing structural inequality faced by women, and intensifying work and family pressures. In many ways, government policies have made it worse.” Then there is the looming “shadow pandemic” of worsening mental health outcomes. During lockdowns, suicide rates were down but self-harm increased, particularly in young people. This does not bode well for a mental health system that was already under pressure. Two years in, despite this mess at the crossroads of capitalism, gender, class, intergenerational disadvantage, race and work, we have not moved to fix the systems that underpin inequality. Character test On a more personal level, the pandemic revealed the limitations of the nuclear family – and the need for a “village”. Healthy families need other people around to help – friends, aunts and uncles, teachers, grandparents and neighbours. Part of what was exposed on the seabed was the necessity of communities and personal support systems to stay connected to families, and acknowledgment in a person’s workplace of the whole load an employee might be carrying in their life – not just in their work. Work bled deeply into domestic life and domestic spaces, much more work fell to women, parents found it impossible to work and supervise schooling at the same time, and many families felt overwhelmed and marooned without access to the village. And then there’s the even more personal reckoning – a glimpse at our own psyches. Were we resilient? Calm? Kind? Or fearful and fretful? The great Stoic philosopher Epictetus said: “Circumstances don’t make the man, they only reveal him to himself.” And so it was here. The past two years have shown us what we are made of – and provided to us the sort of character test that only usually comes round with world wars and depressions. While countries such as America are experiencing high levels of public rage and anger, over everything from mask mandates to slow service in restaurants, in Australia the rage hasn’t been as marked, although it has been there in anti-lockdown protests and in our shops. Australia’s low level of mortality and relatively high level of compliance with lockdown rules – particularly in 2020 – are probably connected. There was the sense of caring for the stranger and not wanting to do something to endanger people in your community. This sense of cohesion bodes well for a healthy society – it’s something hopeful to hang on to. So what will we do with our newfound clarity? Seeing the truth of one’s own lives laid bare by the pandemic will no doubt prompt some to reorganise. And there’s a certain amount we can reorganise in our own lives. Maybe you have already started remaking things that were revealed during the pandemic to be broken. Friendships that were revealed to be too one-sided or unfulfilling may have been jettisoned, marriages and relationships ended, jobs quit, fitness regimes embarked on, cities swapped for the coast or country. Maybe the pandemic accelerated what was always going to happen. Or maybe it gave you a nudge of the carpe diem kind, or maybe the unique pressures of lockdowns broke the back of things that would otherwise have drifted along for decades to come – intact mostly, but never really stress-tested. Changing these elements that make up our lives – our friends, our partner, our job, family, our health and fitness, the place where we live – seems big. It’s remaking our lives. Swapping Larry for Barry, Bondi for Berry, making sales for making soap, while enormous within the unit of one life, is not grand stuff that alters the course of human history. What’s needed are systemic shifts that lead to a reorganisation of society that can better absorb large shocks – and to support each other through those shockwaves. It’s ground-up stuff. The pandemic began in Australia in March 2020 – but for me, it will be forever linked with something that started earlier. November 2019 and the skies were red and full of ash. We all wore masks that summer … just a different sort. The past two years and the things we’ve seen have given us a taste of the radical planetary reorganisation that will need to occur when the climate crisis really bares its teeth. Like all painful experiences, once this chapter of the pandemic is over, we will want to forget. With all our lovely distractions back – bars and restaurants and gyms and hairdressers – we can paste over the issues all of us have with our set-ups and our systems. We think a move to the country – our own personal revolution – is change enough. But of course it is not. We have seen the bottom of the seafloor in all its ugliness, beauty and degradation. Such clarity is a dark gift. The real work is ahead."

          "bodyText": "Two years after Boris Johnson made “levelling up” the lodestar of his new administration, the public still struggles to understand what the prime minister means by it. A new YouGov poll has found that half of those questioned either had no idea what the phrase signifies, or were not completely sure. The government’s flagship domestic policy resembles a ghost vessel drifting in a mist of Whitehall obfuscation and procrastination. After a torrid period, Mr Johnson badly needs this to change in the new year. However fuzzy the follow-through, the political logic of his original pledge to level up England remains crystal clear: as it seeks to hold together the new electoral coalition forged in the 2019 “Brexit election”, improving the situation and prospects of voters in the north and Midlands is fundamental to the government’s hopes of re-election. The pots of money distributed piecemeal via the various levelling-up funds – described as a “drop in the ocean” by the Centre for Cities thinktank – will not cut it. Having promised to restore pride, regenerate places and deliver economic growth in the “red wall”, a convincing plan is urgently required to demonstrate how this will be done. The indications are that this will not be forthcoming, partly for fear of antagonising voters in the more prosperous south. The twice-delayed levelling-up white paper is now expected by the end of January, and briefings suggest its emphasis will be on devolution and the reform of local government throughout the country. The mayoral model is likely to be promoted beyond the city regions, and Cameron-era local enterprise partnerships may be targeted for replacement by more democratically accountable bodies. Given that the secretary of state for levelling up, Michael Gove, has been told by the Treasury that no more money is on offer, proposing to redistribute power instead carries an obvious attraction: it allows high-minded talk about community spirit and “trusting the people”, but comes without an expensive price tag. Sadly for Mr Gove and the prime minister, real empowerment cannot be delivered on the cheap. Levelling up regions and places that have been neglected for decades – and which bore the brunt of post-crash austerity – requires significant long-term investment in public services, improved infrastructure and a costly revolution in vocational education and adult retraining. Greater devolution is a praiseworthy goal in an overcentralised country where all roads (and high-speed rail lines) lead to London; but without the necessary resources, and significantly expanded local revenue-raising powers, it will amount to an abdication of strategic responsibility by the state. One recent study observed that the slashing of government grants to local authorities since 2010 hit “urban areas with a legacy of industrial job loss especially hard”. A proliferation of elected mayors across the country looks more like a distraction than a solution to the problems of postindustrial England. In a speech last summer, Mr Johnson took inspiration from the example of Germany’s efforts to narrow its east-west economic divide after reunification. But successive German governments spent €2tn reducing the gap, whereas Rishi Sunak has effectively capped the government’s main levelling-up fund at £4.8bn for this parliament. If the government will not draw the appropriate lessons from the German experience, the Labour party should spell them out: this amorphous agenda may have become an object of mockery, but what it does and does not deliver from now on will be crucial in deciding the outcome of the next election."

          "bodyText": "The crisis engulfing the Chinese property sector appears certain to intensify in 2022 as companies face debt repayments in the new year that are double those of the final months of 2021, risking what one China expert calls a systemic crisis for the world’s second-biggest economy. Although concerns about the stricken giant China Evergrande have receded in recent weeks behind a massive state-led restructuring operation, it missed a bond repayment of $255m (£190m) on Thursday and the debt problems that have pushed the second biggest developer in the country into default are blighting many other firms. In total, China’s developers owe $19.8bn in dollar-denominated offshore debt in the first three months of 2022, analysts at Nomura said. That is almost twice as much as the $10.2bn they were faced with in the final quarter of 2021 – a burden that caused default at Evergrande and the threat of default at several other developers such as Kaisa. Nor is there any respite in the second quarter of 2022, when they must find another $18.5bn. The bond repayment burden threatens to worsen the crisis for developers, who have ridden a 30-year boom in the Chinese housing market on a business model based on cheap credit and never-ending demand from the country’s huge, upwardly mobile population. But Xi Jinping’s anger at the sector’s excesses and his pursuit of “common prosperity” led to a crackdown that removed access to unlimited funding, and now key metrics are spelling the end of the good times. Prices fell 0.3% in November, the biggest fall since 2015, while the value of home sales plunged by 16.31% and new construction starts as measured by floor area fell 21.03%. Crucially, China’s population is shrinking with the number of marriages – and therefore demand for new properties from young couples – down 31% in the six years to 2019. ‘Everyone made the same bet’ Michael Pettis, professor of finance at Peking University, says the situation could morph into a systemic crisis that undermines the whole debt-ridden economy – the stuff of nightmares for Beijing’s political class, who are desperate to prevent contagion from the property crisis hurting ordinary Chinese. “Everyone made the same bet on inexorably rising property prices, especially the developers, who levered to the hilt, overpaid for land at auctions, and scooped up as much real estate risk as they could take on,” he said. “The problem of course is if property prices ever stop rising, because everyone has made the same bet everyone’s balance sheet starts unravelling at the same time, and it immediately becomes a systemic problem. That is what has happened in China.” Debt to foreign investors are not the only problem. Developers owe billions of yuan to Chinese bondholders but, in addition, Nomura says they must also find 1.1tn yuan ($172bn) in backdated pay owed to construction workers before the lunar new year starts at the beginning of February. There were also reports that workers at subsidiaries of Evergrande in states such as Guangxi and Shanxi have gone on strike over unpaid wages. “Failing to pay deferred wages could be severely punished by both the central government and related local governments,” the Nomura analysts said. “There is tremendous reputational risk for those developers and constructors that could not pay deferred wages in a timely manner, especially if social protests are triggered.” Evergrande’s woes become apparent in September when it admitted it could not meet the most pressing of its mammoth $300bn debts or even complete the 1.6m homes it had already taken payment for. After much brinkmanship, it made some of its payments but eventually slipped into default in early December – later confirmed by rating agency downgrades. The prospect of civil unrest over unpaid wages, unfinished houses, and uncertain return from wealth management products set up by developers is front and centre in Beijing’s battle to contain the fallout from the property sector’s problems. ‘This is a test case for China’ Although the Evergrande chairman and founder, Xu Jiayin, pledged this week that the company was going “full steam ahead” to finish homes that customers had paid for, Shasha Dai, managing editor at credit intelligence, data and analytics provider Reorg in New York, said the Chinese government was “deeply involved” in Evergrande’s restructuring and that the number one priority was to maintain “social stability”. The government was “putting a mould around Evergrande” to make sure its troubles didn’t spill over to other developers, she said. The goal was for someone “reputable” to come in with access to finance, complete the buildings Evergrande has not finished, and get people into homes that they have paid for. “Maintaining social stability is the government’s number one priority. They can’t have protests with people going round to offices demanding money back – it’s a bad image. Homebuyers have to get what they paid for.” However, the spiralling nature of the problem might make it impossible even for Beijing, with all its levers of control, to contain given that so many developers could run into trouble. A report in October by S&amp;P, for example, said that one-third of China’s listed developers could experience liquidity problems in the next 12 months. As Prof Pettis says, the crisis has deep-seated roots and will not be easily solved. “This isn’t about ‘bad apples’ or even bad policies,” he says, “so it cannot be fixed by firing the right people, putting some in jail and improving policy responses.” The impact will be felt far and wide if the contagion spreads, not least to China’s reputation for sound economic management. Tim Symes, a partner at the international law firm Stewarts in London and a specialist in insolvency and asset recovery, said the Evergrande restructuring could go on for years. But the wider question for China was important. “This is a test case for China and could shape risk appetite globally, affecting inward investment. “This is going to run and run and the fear is that China may favour its local creditors. Offshore bondholders will feel the loss and that will ripple through the world. It brings home the risks in lending to China.”"

          "bodyText": "It was never my intention to hide in the toilet. There was lots going on outside: highbrow small talk and top-tier networking; free drinks, air kisses, and cold canapés that – I’d quickly discovered, following glances – were very much, like my fellow attenders, there only for show. The gallery was filled, I’d been assured, with fashion figures and media leaders. I was lucky to have been invited to this salon, one of the hosts had informed me, generously. Exactly what a “salon” is, I’m still unsure. Deep down, I just didn’t want to be there. Only 90 minutes previously I’d been watching Gogglebox and scoffing Pringles in bed. But I went along out of some sense of duty. Perhaps a desire to broaden my horizons, or a compulsion to step outside my comfort zone, where I had become too safe and snug. Now here I was, sitting in a locked cubicle counting down the minutes before I could leave without seeming rude. All too often I’d go through this same, stupid motion. Preoccupied by getting older, and worrying that I was wasting my finite time on Earth lying on the sofa, I’d panic that before I knew it, I’d be staring down death, full of regret. Put bluntly, I’d get a serious case of Fomo (fear of missing out). This feeling tends to peak in Januarys when, rather than hibernate, as would be eminently sensible, I cajole myself into believing exposure therapy will somehow improve me. I say yes to park jogs, parties and once, a ceilidh. But this year, I’m refusing to be sucked in again – I’m determined to embrace saying yes to saying no to things I simply don’t want to do. For most of my young adult life, I latched on to the idea that – generally speaking – I was quite boring, fairly lazy, a healthy dose of dull. I’d be mortified if anyone gave me those labels; after all, I’m pretty good value at weddings, funerals and barmitzvahs (and I do attend most of the ones I’m invited to) – but I still had a growing feeling that I wasn’t making enough of life’s precious moments. When did the Fomo start? At school, reports often featured the words “must try harder” – and I suppose the idea stuck. There’d been a relationship, my first of substance, where circumstances meant I internalised the idea that I was dreary and unexciting. Friends would flock to underground parties and dance until mid-morning and I’d drag myself out to join them, moving miserably around the darkness until I was too exhausted to continue, or too drunk to care. It’s not that there were rules over what I did or didn’t enjoy; it’s more that I’d force myself to go out, and stay out – whether or not I actually wanted to – out of obligation to my future, dying self. In short, a pattern developed. Life was punctuated by me doing things I didn’t really want to, because otherwise I’d berate myself for doing just enough, sometimes too little, and almost never too much. That’s precisely how I’d ended up at this art show. Arriving alone, I started talking, reluctantly, to a serious man named Simon. He told me his opinions; we stared at some art. As soon as was not unkind, I excused myself, and beelined to the bathrooms. I sat there for a while, staring at the wall. Maybe 10 minutes later, I returned to the action. There was a discussion about poetry, or was it pottery? The bar ran out of white wine. It felt like everyone was there for the same reason as me – because they felt as if they should be. I’m sure I wasn’t the only one having a godawful time. Recently, I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about that evening. I’m coming to realise, slowly but surely, that I’d like to reimagine how I spend my time. All sorts of things have contributed to this contrition: dead grandparents; new nephews; approaching 30. Growing a little older has made me less inclined to do anything that feels void of all pleasure and joy. Then there are the complications of Covid. I’m lucky to be fit and healthy, but now each event – birthday, work breakfast, day trip – comes with a complex new set of calculations related to my health and safety: is it worth the risk? I’m trying to apply the same thinking to whether I’ll actually enjoy something, too. That means accepting invitations, but also politely declining – and making these decisions based on what I want to do, not what I feel I should. I’m still open to new experiences, people and places. Only now I admit defeat calmly, rather than feeling shameful if I throw in the towel. I might not always know what I’ll love or what will feel soul-destroying. But I’m trying to ignore the pressure to be proactive, and instead listen to my gut. It’s harder than it sounds. In his 2012 book Missing Out, psychoanalyst Adam Phillips questions what it means to consider the life unlived. “The myth of our potential,” he writes, “can make of our lives a perpetual falling-short … Now someone is asking us not only to survive but to flourish, not simply or solely to be good but to make the most of our lives.” The premise of Phillips’ position has never been truer. Ours is a society consumed and fixated by the effective use of time. Social media platforms often face blame for turning their users into sad, anxious scrollers, and for good reason. But the fact these sites also demand that we are constantly productive is often overlooked. Instagram insists we have something to show; Twitter requires us to always think something. We live in the “experience economy”, where value is derived from doing. The pandemic has taught us that we don’t know what’s around the corner; to make the most of now. It feels as if some teenagers plough more effort into their TikToks than I have into my entire career. It feels something of an obsession, to be efficient not only in our work, but with our leisure time, too. Because Yolo, far from being a harmless catchphrase, – made famous by Drake in 2011’s The Motto – is actually an insidious idiom; another iteration of the toxic “do one thing that scares you” and “make every moment count” nonsense which has slowly come to poison our daily lives. I’m by no means advocating for total abstinence from ambition. Climb mountains! Learn languages! Tell me your fascinating stories about doing so over wine. It’s just that maybe making the most of every moment can also come from giving up rather than grinning and bearing it. It’s all well and good to try new things, but I’m trying to regularly remind myself that MasterChef is pretty great (as is watching YouTube compilations in my pants and scrolling through Scottish homes on Rightmove). It’s early days, but I’ve already noticed I’m feeling calmer, more comfortable. Of course, this is all a reflection of the stage of life I find myself at: with no kids or caring responsibilities. No doubt there will come a day when I would make a deal with the devil to once again have the chance to pay £8 for a can of Red Stripe to drink while bopping about on sticky floors. But for now, at least, I’m free to make this opting-out choice. One weekend late last year, my friends, my boyfriend and I rented a place by the seaside. On the Friday, we merrily trotted between quaint country pubs. Our Saturday, it had been mutually agreed by all attending, was to be spent walking. A proper hike. Through battering winds, we’d march for six to seven hours across the coastal cliffs of Sussex. Ninety minutes later, we’d barely made a dent in our proposed path and I was exhausted. I checked my phone, and realised that 30 minutes inland we’d get to a bus stop which would take us home. Usually, I’d have marched on, metaphorically sat in that toilet. Instead, I announced I quite fancied taking the bus. A look of relief spread across everyone’s faces. Turns out we all wanted to throw in the towel. And so we did."

          "bodyText": "If you get a bad taste in your mouth when you hear the name Joe Manchin – the fossil fuel industry-backed senator from West Virginia who torpedoed his own party’s “Build Back Better” bill just before Christmas – you might want to reach for a glass of something to wash it away. Given that it’s New Year’s Eve, there’s a reasonable chance you’re guzzling a glass of prosecco, which now accounts for just under half of all bubbly drunk globally. While this may take the taste away momentarily, there’s also an odd thing about prosecco I want you to consider. How that glass of Italian bubbly came to be in your hand gives us a window into understanding how a Democratic senator can derail a multitrillion dollar climate-focused national programme that promised huge amounts of money for his own state. No, really. Stay with me here. The stories of prosecco wine and West Virginia coal are classic examples of a regional “growth model”. Growth models describe the “how we make money” bit of an economy, plus the political and electoral coalition that supports it. Think of all the social, political and regulatory structures that build up over time around making and selling a certain good, and all the folks whose jobs and incomes depend upon it. Think of Germany and car exports. From workers to unions to production hubs, to supply chains, to institutional investors, there is an entire ecosystem that supports this way of making a living and the identities and interest it supports. When that is challenged, those who benefit from the model do not sit idly by. Now think of Treviso, Italy, where they make prosecco. Last year a sociologist called Stefano Ponte unpacked the growth model behind prosecco. Prosecco was first bottled in 1924, but it was not until the early 2000s that anglo-millennials got a taste for the stuff and global demand blew up. Prosecco was defined at the time by the grape used to make it, glera, and not by its place of origin (like how all “real” champagne must come from Champagne), which meant that the brand was not protected. In fact, the actual village of Prosecco was about 150km away from the main growing areas and had never grown the grape that makes the drink. Some enterprising British importers wanted to stick as much prosecco as they could into bottles, which would have taken control (and value) away from local producers. Rising to defend the “prosecco miracle” as it was called, the then minister of agriculture, Luca Zaia, a member of the rightwing La Lega party, expanded the “denominazione d’origine controllata DOC” to cover the distant village of Prosecco, which gave this rather generic product a claim to geographical exclusivity. That in turn paved the way for a successful Unesco world heritage claim a few years later, further cementing the region’s claim to the product. The result was a major expansion of production, and prosecco hit €500m in sales in 2019. In short, those who benefited from the growth model rose to defend it. But there were other challenges to this success. This massive expansion of production brought challenges from environmentalists – wine is essentially an agribusiness – and from local residents. But those who benefited from the growth model again leapt to defend it, this time by painting the industry as an example of small-scale, pastoral sustainability – part of a high-end wine-making tradition going back centuries. In fact, as the historian Brian Griffith details, this pastoral and authentically local framing of Italian wine was originally a project of the fascist period. After the first world war, Italy was saddled with vast overproduction of low-quality domestic wines and enmeshed in a moral panic over working-class drunkenness. Wine industry interests close to the government of Mussolini sought to make Italian wines articles of middle-class consumption and a source of national unity. And they used state-backed mythmaking to do so. Medical authorities stressed “the advantages of responsible … wine consumption”. National exhibitions of regional wines were sponsored by the state. Indeed, the whole idea of “gastro-tourism” in Italy was invented in the 1930s by the wine lobby. As Griffith puts it, “the roots of today’s … Italian wines stretch back not to antiquity … but … to the interwar years”. The result was the development of an agribusiness growth model. The prosecco story a century later was just one more turn of this wheel. Now what does all that tell us about Manchin and West Virginia? The Democratic party story on Manchin and West Virginia was that coal was a dying industry, it employed few people and Build Back Better provided a way out. It was simply a question of giving Manchin enough “sweeteners” and it would eventually pass. But Manchin first vetoed the “clean electricity” provisions of the bill and then ran down the clock long enough to kill it. Why did he do this? Because his job is to defend the growth model against challengers, just as it was for the folks in Treviso. As Adam Tooze has noted, by some estimates “nearly one-third of [West Virginian] GDP in 2019 can be attributed to fossil fuels [which] makes decarbonisation a mortal threat”. Now add to this the fact that West Virginia has the lowest labour force participation rate in the US and huge healthcare issues stemming from chronic illness and opioid abuse, and you end up with a fiscal nightmare kept afloat by current growth model. Given this, the notion that the best-paid jobs in the state ($77,000 a year) will be traded away by the state’s leading elected official for some promises on “retraining” and a “Green New Deal” is simply not credible. Growth models are hard to change. Those who profit from them fight to defend them. From Alaska to the Dakotas, to Texas and Louisiana, the core of the GOP electoral coalition, all these states have carbon-heavy growth models. Like the Italian wine industry, they are a creation of the state in the 20th century. They are embodied with myths and are supported by powerful coalitions. Few in Treviso are keen to dismantle the prosecco growth model. Why should West Virginia, and with it the other carbon states of the US, be any different?

Here we meet the stars of the year’s most exciting new shows, from Danny Boyle’s Sex Pistols biopic to the UK version of Call My Agent and the Steve Coogan-led #MeToo comedy Chivalry. By the year’s end, these four new faces may well feel like old friends. ‘I don’t even know who Alan Partridge is’ Adjani Salmon Growing up in Jamaica, Adjani Salmon wasn’t familiar with the British obsession with Doctor Who. In fact, he only realised the full extent of it in the middle of filming an episode. One of his first acting jobs was Eve of the Daleks (which broadcasts on 1 January), in which Salmon’s Nick gets tangled up with the Whoniverse baddies, alongside his crush Sarah (Aisling Bea). Fans turned up to the Bristol set, and the crew told him they needed to “‘get the umbrellas, because we don’t want to give away who’s in the special’. And I’m like: ‘Oh shit, this is a big thing!’” he laughs from the garden of his family home in Kingston, where he is for Christmas – a coconut tree-dotted idyll that seems to exist in a different universe to grey UK skies. Salmon started out as an editor in Jamaica’s reality-dominated TV industry – mainly on Mission Catwalk, the Caribbean edition of Project Runway – before moving to London to follow his film-making ambitions. Once again he found himself studying in the capital (he’d already done an architecture degree at the University of East London), and was soon making his own web series, Dreaming Whilst Black, which was adapted last year into a charming BBC pilot. In it, he plays a frustrated movie-maker toiling in an office job. But Salmon only cast himself to avoid paying a proper actor – and he’s still conflicted about his inadvertent career shift. “You’re so exposed – there’s a level of vulnerability I don’t like. But I do think acting has made me a better director.” The exposure is about to get much greater. Later this year, the 32-year-old will co-star in Steve Coogan and Sarah Solemani’s #MeToo comedy Chivalry. He plays the husband of Bobby, Solemani’s up-and-coming film-maker who has been tasked with rescuing a flailing project helmed by Coogan’s problematic producer. (Wanda Sykes, Sienna Miller and Lolly Adefope complete the starry cast.) It has hit written all over it – but initially Salmon wasn’t even sure if he should audition. “I thought it’s either going to be really cutting-edge … or really bad,” he says of the #MeToo angle. Thankfully, his Who co-star Bea encouraged him to, even offering up practical tips for making an audition tape (blu-tack is invaluable, apparently). Part of his reluctance was that, again, he didn’t understand Coogan’s significance: Partridge-mania had passed him by. “I’d tell someone I was doing this show and they’d say: ‘Bro, do you not know what Alan Partridge is?’ And I was like, no.” His cluelessness did wonders for his nerves. “It’s so interesting meeting people who are almost icons – they’re beyond humanisation – and being like: you’re cool as people. It was great.” Salmon is planning a return to his directing roots this year, too; he’s also hoping there’ll be a series of Dreaming Whilst Black this year. “I have plans, however it has not been commissioned yet,” he says carefully and emphatically, giving the impression of a man bound up in bureaucratic limbo. Even if it never materialises, you imagine Salmon’s 2022 won’t be a quiet one – at the very least, there’ll probably be an encounter with an unfamiliar British institution somewhere along the way. ‘At school all I got to play was leopard No 2 – no lines’ Emma Appleton Like many millennial women, Emma Appleton devoured Dolly Alderton’s 2018 memoir Everything I Know About Love, a potently relatable coming-of-age tale peppered with 00s nostalgia. “On the second page it’s talking about messaging boys on MSN – it’s a flashback for all of us,” enthuses the 30-year-old. But unlike her fellow fans, Appleton would do more than identify with the author – she’d actually become her. This year, the actor stars in the BBC adaptation of the book, about two childhood friends – Appleton’s Maggie (based on Alderton) and Birdy (played by Bel Powley) – navigating the peaks and troughs of their 20s in a London house-share. Appleton presumed playing a character “so similar to me on paper” would be a breeze – but, in fact, the opposite was true. “It is the hardest job I’ve ever done because when someone’s written in such a complex and nuanced way, it’s a lot harder to portray that in the right tone. I so desperately wanted to get it right and do it justice for Dolly. It felt quite precious.” Just before Everything I Know About Love, Appleton was trying to do another real, but significantly less relatable, person justice. In Danny Boyle’s upcoming Sex Pistols series, Pistol, she plays Sid Vicious’s girlfriend Nancy Spungen. Before filming, Appleton had been aware of Spungen as a semi-mythical rock figure, and heard that “no one liked her and she was a nightmare. Which is true but she’s also incredibly complex,” something she learned reading Spungen’s mother’s book, And I Don’t Want to Live This Life, written after her 20-year-old daughter’s violent, unexplained death by stabbing at Chelsea Savoy Hotel in New York. Despite the troubling source material, the shoot itself was “a dream come true” thanks to Boyle. “Growing up watching his work then being able to step on set with him was great!” For a while, acting was just a dream. She never got the main parts in plays at her Oxfordshire school – “I’d always audition and it would be: ‘OK, you can be leopard No 2, no lines’” – and so instead she became a model. But when Appleton’s agency offered her a short film casting, she won the part, and it all happened very quickly: a lead role in BBC teen drama Clique and 1940s-set spy series Traitors soon followed. Not long after, she was cast as the vengeful Renfri in the sensationally popular Netflix series The Witcher, a role that required her to master a whole new skill set. “I just wanted to get my sword-fighting right and try not to blind Henry Cavill, which I was successful at,” she smiles. “It took about a month of training, six days a week, six hours a day. It was a lot!” ‘Elton John gave me a huge hug’ Kit Connor He may only be 17, but Kit Connor has already endured one of the most daunting moments in any actor’s life: playing a real person in a film, then watching the finished product right beside them. Not any old member of Joe Public, either: that person was Elton John, and that film was Rocketman. “We were sitting with him in Cannes and he was getting a bit emotional,” recalls Connor from his Croydon family home. In a good way, clearly: during a photocall at the festival John made a beeline for the teenager to give him a huge hug. “I think it might have been the best day of my life,” he grins. It was his 2019 performance as the musical wunderkind that introduced Connor as a very promising young actor – but it’s his next project that’s destined to make him a household name. He plays Nick, a “popular rugby boy” who falls in love with Charlie, a boy in the year below at school, in the new Netflix adaptation of Alice Oseman’s beloved graphic novel, Heartstopper. It’s a particularly contemporary gay love story: homophobia doesn’t really seem to enter the equation. “It’s a very optimistic, hopeful portrayal – looking at the world through rose-tinted spectacles,” explains Connor. “The show is a ball of sunshine.” Connor hadn’t read Heartstopper before he got cast as Nick, but he was immediately made aware of the book’s fervent fanbase after an outpouring of love and support on social media. Did he feel the weight of expectation? “Nick is a 6ft 2in, big, built lad and I was very skinny – I don’t know how I got the role to be honest. I was thinking, OK, do I get on a pogo stick?! But I managed to gain some weight and did a lot of rugby training.” Like other Netflix schools – namely, Sex Education – the setting of Heartstopper is a joyful, technicolour place, says Connor. (Unlike the transatlantic hinterland of that show, however, there is a decidedly British vibe to this: “We played it very apologetic. Everyone saying sorry all the time!”) After filming, his real school felt “very drab” – and a lot more stressful. Having spent his childhood juggling education with acting jobs – at 10 he starred in comedy caper Get Santa, and later lent his voice to the BBC adaptation of His Dark Materials (he played Lyra’s dæmon Pan) – the fact he was 17 on Heartstopper’s set meant he was treated like an adult, with no time to study during the day. “I was working 12 hours a day and thinking: ‘I could go home and do my homework right now, but I need to sleep for tomorrow.’ I got back to school thinking this is going to be hell!” It doesn’t seem to have put him off, though. Connor’s already primed for more Heartstopper: “I can’t wait for it to come out – hopefully people like it and we’ll be called back for another instalment.” As teenage dreams go, it doesn’t seem particularly outlandish. ‘I asked Helena Bonham Carter for a selfie on set’ Fola Evans-Akingbola In the British version of the cross-Channel hit Call My Agent, Fola Evans-Akingbola has been plunged into a cast swimming in national treasures. When Helena Bonham Carter came on set, the 27-year-old “didn’t even attempt to play it cool, I was so embarrassingly like: can I take a selfie with you?!” She plays Zoe in the showbiz satire, the equivalent of the original’s Sofia, the talent agency receptionist who is desperate to become an actor. She initially struggled to capture Zoe’s pushiness, but identified strongly with her character’s battle between ambition and “crippling self-doubt.” That self-doubt stems from the fact Evans-Akingbola decided to become an actor relatively late in life. “I envy people who knew they wanted to do it since they were five – I didn’t, so I’ve always felt some insecurity about that.” She was a sports scholar at her school in Dulwich, south-east London, and did no performing arts. “People from my school would be like: ‘What? Fola’s an actor?!’” After deciding not to take a place at university to study philosophy, her mother encouraged her to find some hobbies. She wound up at acting classes, which led to a stint at the Identity School of Acting (other alumni include John Boyega and Letitia Wright). The student body was far more racially diverse than her school, which changed her sense of what was possible. “It was the first time in a classroom with all sorts of different skin tones,” says Evans-Akingbola, whose father, Sola, is a Nigerian-born percussionist who plays with Jamiroquai. “That awakened something for me.” She consulted her uncle, the actor Jimmy Akingbola (soon to star as Geoffrey in the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air reboot), who urged her on. The milestones of British acting both old (“got to get Holby City on the CV!”) and new (Black Mirror) quickly racked up. A big US show soon followed: between 2017 and 2020, she spent six months of the year living in Canada, filming the mermaid-themed series Siren. Despite such a swift rise, she is still eager to pick up acting tips – and the set of Call My Agent was the perfect place to do it. “It’s been so exciting to watch these amazing actors do their thing,” she says of her castmates, who include Dominic West, Jack Davenport, Maggie Steed, and Phoebe Dynevor. If the success of the original is anything to go by, it surely won’t be long before Evans-Akingbola joins their ranks. Doctor Who: Eve of the Daleks is on 1 January, 7pm, BBC One"

          "bodyText": "The popular compendium of correspondence from history is brilliant in book form, but it takes on a whole new dimension in audio. An eclectic treasure trove of letters written by musicians, actors, poets, writers, explorers, dictators and more, this year’s updated edition is read by a host of actors including Noma Dumezweni, Toby Jones, Juliet Stevenson, Gillian Anderson, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Colin Salmon and Stephen Fry. The letters are variously life-affirming, devastating, wilfully mundane, subtly acidic and sometimes downright creepy. Listeners can hear Olivia Colman reviving her cut-glass accent from The Crown as she reads the Queen’s recipe for drop scones that she sent to the US president Dwight D Eisenhower, as promised during his visit to Balmoral, and Alan Cumming hamming up Jack the Ripper’s famous “From Hell” dispatch to George Lusk, chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. The letter was sent in 1888 with a preserved human kidney. Among the new additions is a letter, read by Benedict Cumberbatch, from one Thomas J Hanks to George Roy Hill, director of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, in which the young actor, still in high school, puts forward his case to be “discovered”. “I know what you are thinking: ‘Who’s this kid?’ and I can understand your apprehensions,” Hanks wrote. “But I figure if people will pay to see certain films, they will pay to see me.” And Ferdinand Kingsley reads Tennessee miner Jacob Vowell’s heartbreaking missive to his wife, Sarah Ellen, written as he sat trapped underground with their 14-year-old son, Elbert, in May 1902. “O God for one more breath,” he wrote. Sadly, rescue came too late. • Letters of Note is available from Canongate, 11hr, 31min. Further listening Henry “Chips” Channon: The Diaries 1938-43 Edited by Simon Heffer, Penguin Audio, 48hr, 28min Tom Ward reads the second volume of the American socialite’s uproarious diaries chronicling his years mingling with the British aristocracy.

          "bodyText": "So, you’ve been roused from your festive food coma and are ready to hurl yourself headlong into 2022. But what can you expect from the world of popular culture over the next 12 months? I’ve pulled together some notable releases from the world of film, TV and music that I’m personally excited about, or at the very least intrigued by. I’ve largely avoided sequels, prequels and returning series in favour of new stuff (though I have included some long-awaited returns in the world of music). This is by no means an exhaustive list. If there’s nothing here that floats your boat, fortunately the Guardian’s culture desk has a far more extensive rundown of 2022 highlights across film, music, TV, stage, art and more coming next week. Keep an eye on theguardian.com for more. Film 1. Licorice Pizza Any film by Paul Thomas Anderson is a must-watch, but a film by Paul Thomas Anderson set in his spiritual and actual home, California’s San Fernando valley, is a must-must-must watch. His latest, an antic, meandering 70s coming-of-age tale starring Alana Haim and Philip Seymour Hoffman’s son Cooper, is a total delight and quite possibly the funniest film PTA has made. Watch out for some dynamite cameos from Sean Penn, Bradley Cooper and Tom Waits. UK – out 1 January; US and Aus – out now 2. Everything Everywhere All at Once The great Michelle Yeoh stars in a goofy sci-fi about a middle-aged woman who gets dragged into a multidimensional quest while trying to complete her taxes, as you do. It’s from directorial duo Daniels (AKA Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert), whom you might remember from their film Swiss Army Man, in which another Daniel – Daniel Radcliffe – played a flatulent corpse. Everything Everywhere …, which premieres at SXSW festival in March, looks as if it will top that film in the strangeness stakes, going by its truly mind-frazzling trailer. UK, US, Aus – all TBC 3. The Northman Another dizzying trailer, this one for Robert Eggers’s follow-up to his utterly bonkers 19th-century horror The Lighthouse. The Northman delves further into the past, as we head to medieval Iceland for a Viking revenge epic. The cast is as stacked as they come, with Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke and Björk clambering on board the longship. UK and US – out 22 April; Aus – TBC 4. Nope Little is known about Jordan Peele’s next film, beyond the fact that it stars Daniel Kaluuya, Keke Palmer and Steven Yeun, and that it features a storm cloud trailing some bunting on its poster. Is that enough to be going on for us to put Nope on a list of the year’s most anticipated films? Given the terrifying one-two punch of his previous hits, Get Out and Us, I’d argue that it is. US – out 22 July; UK and Aus – TBC 5. Killers of the Flower Moon The elegiac and extremely long The Irishman felt like something of an extended goodbye from Martin Scorsese, but here he is with another feature film, his 26th. Killers of the Flower Moon sees him reunite with two of his regulars – Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro – in an adaptation of David Grann’s relentlessly readable book about the real-life murders of wealthy Osage nation people in 20s Oklahoma. UK, US, Aus – TBC Music 1. Mitski – Laurel Hell Four years after the brilliant Be the Cowboy, the Japanese-American singer-songwriter returns with an album which, she says, explores the grey area she occupies, not a “role model” but also “not a bad person”. There’s always been a compellingly gothic tinge to her indie torch songs, and Laurel Hell looks set to push that element further than ever before: its title refers to dense thickets of laurel bushes that produce beautiful flowers and can be impossible to escape from. “I liked the notion of being stuck inside this explosion of flowers and perhaps even dying within one of them,” she says. Out 4 February 2. 100 Gecs – 10000 Gecs Genuinely groundbreaking music, or infantile, nosebleed-inducing noise? Wherever you land on hyperpop duo 100 Gecs (think Sum 41, Aphex Twin and a 1998 Ministry of Sound compilation trapped together in a tumble dryer), it’s hard to argue against their originality. Their second album, 10000 Gecs – so named because it’s “10 times as good” as their debut 1000 Gecs – promises a bigger, stadium-friendly sound but the same “extremely online”, meme culture-embracing humour and blend of EDM, pop-punk and experimental noise. TBC 3. Rosalía – Motomami How to better El Mal Querer, 2018’s chart-demolishing, critic-seducing slice of flamenco-pop futurism which has already lodged itself into Rolling Stone’s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time? Well, if you’re Spanish superstar Rosalía, the answer seems to be to recruit the Weeknd, Frank Ocean and the Neptunes and promise your most “confessional” album to date. Nina Simone, Bach, reggaeton and Andrei Tarkovsky have all been cited as influences for what will surely be one of the year’s biggest releases. TBC 4. Kendrick Lamar – TBC Unlike film and TV, with their fixed production schedules and concrete releasedates, music releases tend be far harder to predict, governed by the whims and circumstances of bands and artists. So we don’t know that Kendrick Lamar’s long-awaited follow-up to Damn will arrive in 2022 but, given the hints that something is on the horizon, we’re entitled to be optimistic. With his track record, that’s very exciting news indeed. Release date TBC 5. My Bloody Valentine – TBC OK, now I’m getting a little greedy. Kevin Shields’s shoegaze pioneers have never exactly stuck to a timetable (their last album, 2013’s mbv, was released 22 years after their previous one, the gamechanging Loveless). But, rumblings have been afoot: the band signed to Domino last year, and Shields promised the Guardian’s Alexis Petridis that a new album – a double album, in fact – was “imminent”. What exactly imminent means in MBV-speak is unclear, but here’s hoping! Release date TBC TV 1. Station Eleven A drama about the aftermath of a deadly pandemic, released in the middle bit of a deadly pandemic, you say? Station Eleven has an awful lot going against it but – as anyone who has read the Emily St John Mandel novel this series is adapted from will know – you’re unlikely to see a more sneakily optimistic portrayal of the post-apocalypse anywhere. UK – 30 January, Starzplay; US – out now, HBO Max; Aus – out now, Stan 2. The Afterparty Phil Lord and Chris Miller, kings of smart, mainstream, big-screen comedy (the Jump Street films, The Lego Movie, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse), enter the world of streaming with a murder-mystery comedy series for Apple TV+. Fittingly, they’ve brought a murderer’s row of comic talent along for the ride, including Tiffany Haddish, Sam Richardson, Ilana Glazer and, crossing over from north London letting agencies to Hollywood, Jamie Demetriou. 28 January, Apple TV+ 3. House of the Dragon/Lord of the Rings It’s hard to pick one of these two mammoth fantasy franchises over the other. House of the Dragon is the Targaryen-focused prequel to a little show called Game of Thrones and, judging by its teaser trailer, promises the same mix of ultraviolence and spectacular blond wigs. We’ve still not seen a second of footage of Amazon’s TV Tolkien adaptation – which is so under wraps that the entrance to its writers’ room was fitted with a fingerprint scanner – but like House of the Dragon it’s a prequel, set thousands of years before The Hobbit. Lord of the Rings launches 2 September, Amazon Prime Video; House of the Dragon TBC, Sky Atlantic/Now/HBO Max 4. The Curse A comic coming together of the creators of two of the funniest British series of recent years, The Curse pairs Murder in Successville’s Tom Davis with Steve Stamp, Allan Mustafa and Hugo Chegwin of People Just Do Nothing. Unlike those supremely silly series, this at least has a veneer of something approaching social commentary: it’s set during the free-market boom of the 80s, as a group of hapless crooks attempt their own impromptu form of wealth redistribution. UK – TBC, Channel 4; international distribution TBC 5. Inside Man Not the slightly daft mid-00s Spike Lee heist movie, but instead a new drama from Sherlock creator Steven Moffat. Its premise has some of Moffat’s old show’s narrative sleight of hand, following three very different people – a vicar (David Tennant), a US death row inmate (Stanley Tucci) and a maths teacher trapped in a cellar – whose paths cross unexpectedly. Lydia West, who delivered a standout turn as Jill in It’s a Sin, also stars. UK – TBC, BBC One; rest of the world – TBC, Netflix If you want to read the complete version of this newsletter please subscribe to receive The Guide in your inbox every Friday."

          "headline": "Floods, fires, freezes: how 2021 made Joe Biden a climate crisis president",
          "bodyText": "In September, Joe Biden stood in a ravaged area of Manville, New Jersey, after Hurricane Ida brought hundred-year flooding. He motioned at the water marks that reached as high as the first-story windows on some of the homes on the block. “Literally over your head, that’s pretty amazing,” the president reportedly said, while consoling a family whose home was destroyed by a fire that began alongside the flooding. “Well, thank God you’re safe.” A presidential disaster tour is a play that has been performed thousands of times, in gentle words and resolute shows of strength to build again, against Mother Nature’s fury. It used to fall mostly to vice-presidents to make visits to disaster areas, but in the last 20 years, Americans expect presidents themselves to turn up – and some of that shift can be traced to George W Bush’s decision not to visit New Orleans in the immediate aftermath of Katrina. But 2021 has pushed climate disasters to the forefront, and Biden has made at least five disaster tours in the past year, visiting with victims of hurricanes and extreme storms on the Gulf coast and in the New York area, and with victims of wildfires in the west. At the same time, his administration has tried to pass sweeping climate policies, with only mixed success. The 18 weather disasters that hit the United States in 2021 together cost more than $100bn, according to the most recent estimates. According to Noaa, the last five years of climate and weather disaster events have comprised nearly one-third of the disaster cost total of the last 42 years. And 2021 is on pace to be the costliest disaster year of all time. The climate disaster year began in January, when northern California experienced flash flooding and severe winter storms as a “bomb cyclone” and an “atmospheric river” hit the Sierra Nevadas and surrounding areas. The storm unloaded 16in of rain in a few days and delivered blockbuster snow along with 100mph winds in the middle of the state. Atmospheric rivers are like fast-moving, airborne conveyor belts that shuttle moisture from the Pacific to the west coast about a dozen times a year, and much of the west’s water comes from them. Texas went into a deep freeze in February – a phenomenon that scientists say is linked to a changing polar vortex. But some scientists believe that the warming of the Arctic has disrupted the winds that encircle the pole, unleashing giant blobs of frigid air into lower latitudes. At least 210 people died during the storm’s aftermath, where the underprepared power grid gave out and more than 4m households lost power. Travel was nearly impossible, as many areas were covered in snow and ice. Biden visited the Houston area in late February, where he was briefed by emergency officials and thanked workers for doing “God’s work”. He promised the federal government will be there for Texans as they try to recover. In June, a heat dome pummeled the pacific northwest, pushing temperatures into the triple digits in Seattle and Portland. An analysis conducted by the World Weather Attribution group, which specializes in using computer modeling to examine the links between ongoing weather events and climate change, finds that the extreme heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” without human influence. July brought the most destructive wildfire of the year on the west coast, about 100 miles north of Sacramento. After a horrible 2020 wildfire season, experts feared extreme summer heat – and that’s exactly what happened in creating the Dixie fire. It became California’s second-largest fire ever, burning nearly 1m acres in the Lassen national forest and destroying the town of Greenville before it was finally doused in late October. In an airport hangar in Sacramento county, Biden reflected on the realities of climate change on weather events across the United States. “These fires are blinking code red for our nation,” said Biden, who used the occasion to promote two bills pending in Congress that would fund forest management and more resilient infrastructure as well as combat global warming. The country couldn’t “ignore the reality that these wildfires are being supercharged by climate change.” After Hurricane Ida, a category 4 storm, caused $65bn in damages in Louisiana, Biden visited the area in September, reminding locals that the storm was another reminder to be prepared for the next one. “And superstorms are going to come, and they’re going to come more frequently and more ferociously,” he said. “I’ve been working closely with the governor and our colleagues in Congress in both parties on my Build Back Better plan that will modernize our roads, our bridges, sewers and drainage systems and power grids and transmission lines to make sure they’re more resilient.” And this month, Biden flew to Kentucky to survey the damage after a series of tornadoes tore a 200-mile swath through the state, killing scores of people and leaving more than 1,000 families homeless or with severe damage to repair. Biden pledged to do “whatever it takes, as long as it takes” to help Kentucky and other states after a series of deadly tornadoes that he said left a trail of unimaginable devastation. “You will recover and rebuild,” he said. In the halls of government, it has been a mixed year on changing the course on this country’s response to the climate crisis. There was a general disappointment with the outcome of the global Cop26 climate summit. Wealthy nations refused to agree to reparations for poorer countries to compensate for climate-related harms. And while many countries did agree to increase their climate action pledges, scientists say the world is still on track to warm significantly. And Biden’s plans to pass a historic social spending bill, which includes $550bn worth of climate and energy provisions – and the president’s climate agenda – have been halted by West Virginia senator Joe Manchin’s pledge to vote no. But there were also some big wins for climate this year. Biden revoked permits for the long-disputed Keystone XL pipeline, shuttering the project for good. In addition, Biden signed an executive order called Justice40, which promised that at least 40% of all benefits from federal investments in clean energy and climate adaptation will go to “disadvantaged communities.” That has already taken effect, and the bipartisan infrastructure bill signed in November includes $240bn for environmental justice projects–the largest such investment in US history. Climate disasters disproportionately impact communities of color, so investing to keep them safe is an important step in minimizing harm. Biden also had a climate win at the end of the year, with his administration raising vehicle mileage standards to significantly reduce emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gasses. A final rule being issued Monday would raise mileage standards starting in the 2023 model year, reaching a projected industry-wide target of 40 miles a gallon by 2026. The rule will prevent an estimated 3.1bn tons of carbon dioxide emissions over the next three decades, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates, which is equal to shutting down more than 700 coal plants for a year. And perhaps the biggest climate action this year came in the minds of the American public, as they watched these disasters unfolding month after month. An October poll by Pew Research Trust found that more than two-thirds of Americans are perceiving a rise in extreme weather. Another survey showed nearly eight in 10 Americans are more concerned about climate change as a result of severe weather. And for the first time, more than half of Americans say that they have personally experienced the impacts of climate change. “Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, our economy, and the threat is here,” Biden said as he toured a neighborhood in Queens, New York, after Hurricane Ida in early September. “It’s not going to get any better. The question is: can it get worse?”"

          "bodyText": "Well, that is it for the blog for today – and for the year! It’s been a big one, and I know I speak for the whole Guardian Australia staff when I say thank you so much for being here with us throughout 2021. From the insurrection in the US, to mice plagues, Cop26 and now Omicron. Through lockdowns and Australia’s political #MeToo movement, we are so thankful you have walked with us. To every one of our readers, I want to say you are what makes us, why we do what we do and why we go into the new year with hope. Before we go, let me recap the big stories today: NSW recorded 21,151 new Covid cases and six deaths, Victoria 5,919 cases and seven deaths, Tasmania 137 cases and Queensland 3,118, South Australia 2,093 cases and four deaths, Western Australia one new case and the ACT 462. Queensland police asked revellers: Don’t party too hard tonight. Testing sites in South Australia and Victoria closed due to extreme heat. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee said changes to testing, tracing, isolating and quarantining were “pragmatic”. The NSW chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said actual case numbers were likely to be higher than reported. Cricket Australia confirmed Travis Head had tested positive to Covid, ruling him out of the Sydney Ashes Test. The Victorian health minister, Martin Foley, said a third of cases in Victoria were Omicron and there was a national shortage of rapid antigen tests. South Australia said it would drop entry testing requirements for domestic travellers. The NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, maintained the state was in a “strong position” despite rising case numbers. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, announced a change to isolation time – there will be no day six rapid antigen test for confirmed cases in isolation. The Northern Territory introduced indoor masks after recording 60 Covid cases. The Greens senator Lidia Thorpe was rebuked for appearing to back protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra. Two Tasmanian jumping castle victims were farewelled at funerals. And with that, there is a drink with my name on it, so I am putting this blog to bed. Stay safe, don’t make your resolutions too hard – we’ll see you tomorrow! Leaders of a group of protesters who set fire to the facade of Old Parliament House in Canberra are closely linked to a complex network of anti-vaccination and conspiracy groups which have been accused of spreading misinformation in Indigenous communities during the Covid-19 pandemic. The fire, which broke out during a protest at the entrance to the building on Thursday, caused extensive damage to the doors and portico. There have been a series of demonstrations by Indigenous groups as well as elements of the anti-vaccination movement and sovereign citizen groups at Old Parliament House over the past days. Read the full story here: The Victorian and New South Wales governments are scrambling to organise the distribution of rapid antigen tests to vulnerable people amid short supply, confusion over who should use them and skyrocketing Covid case numbers. Amid a national shortage of the tests, both governments said they were working out how best to distribute tens of millions of kits they have ordered, most of which will not arrive until the end of January. NSW and Victoria have watered down previous commitments to provide free tests after a national cabinet meeting with the federal government on Thursday. Read more here: Police have confirmed one man is dead after part of the cliff at Victoria’s Bells beach collapsed earlier today. The victim is aged in his 20s and was part of a group of six that got stuck after the 30-metre cliff face gave way at about 2.15pm. A man and a woman also sustained non-life-threatening arm injuries and were taken to hospital in Geelong. Emergency crews originally said four people were injured but the number was revised. The beach is an internationally renowned surf spot, which up until the Covid pandemic held the annual Rip Curl Pro competition. With Australian Associated Press. Further breakthrough Covid cases have been detected in the Frozen The Musical company at Her Majesty’s Theatre in Melbourne. As a result, all performances are cancelled up to and including 2 January. The show is expected to return on 5 January. All ticket holders will receive an automatic refund. From AAP: Coronavirus cases have been recorded on remote King and Flinders Islands off Tasmania as the state registers another record daily infection tally. The state registered 137 new cases on Friday, bringing its number of active infections to 520. “Confirmed cases of Covid-19 have been identified on King and Flinders Islands,” acting public health director Julie Graham said. “Both cases are interstate travellers who received positive test results after arriving. They are both in isolation.” The two islands, which are situated in Bass Strait, have a combined population of about 2,500 people. Public Health is conducting tracing and will notify anyone who has been a close contact. Dr Graham said it was an important reminder that people should check-in at locations and wear a mask indoors as part of public health orders. In facts that just hit you in the face, one of our data journalists Josh Nicholas just sent me this tweet. He added a note: “NSW is less than double the NZ pop.” Cool cool cool. The New Year’s Eve matinee of Moulin Rouge! The Musical came to an abrupt mid-show halt today when one member of the company received a positive test result for Covid during the show. The curtain was rung down in Act II. An announcement was made to the audience that the show could not proceed and that everyone should leave the theatre immediately. Contacted for clarification, a spokesperson for Global Creatures, the show’s producer said: “Due to an abundance of caution, we made the decision to discontinue this afternoon’s performance of Moulin Rouge! The Musical after a positive Covid-19 test result within the wider company was made known to us.” Moulin Rouge cast and crew are tested regularly. There will be an update regarding future performances as soon as possible, the statement said. Cast member Ryan Gonzalez, who plays Santiago, has also posted on Instagram that he is at home isolating. NSW health authorities are working to contain the outbreak of Covid in aged care facilities. Of about 70 such centres in western Sydney alone, almost 50 have reported positive cases or have staff who have tested positive, a senior health official tells the Guardian Australia. Some are easier to contain where there is no transmission. A committee convenes to decide which centres will be locked down to limit the spread. The state’s residual contact tracing operations are targeted at high-risk places such as aged and disability care and Indigenous communities, as we reported earlier this week. Prior to 5pm, authorities had already counted more than 11,400 cases since midnight in NSW, and will likely exceed 20,000 today, the official said. The total may double that to 40,000 before peaking. (The midnight to midnight rate was more than 22,000 compared with the 21,151 number reported by NSW Health today that counts 8pm to 8pm.) Eastern suburbs of Sydney were among the biggest clusters of new cases. In recent days, though, the highest rate of positives to tests has been in the Hunter Valley of the state, reaching as much as 40% of those being tested. How much of an impact on the health system will follow this surge remains unclear, of course, with authorities hoping the lower severity of Omicron compared with the Delta variant will limit the numbers requiring intensive care or ventilators. The AFP has announced it will lead a joint investigation with ACT to identify who was responsible for the protest at Old Parliament House yesterday. Those who break the law will be arrested and charged. The taskforce will use the AFP’s world-leading forensics and technological capability to identify and locate those responsible for damaging commonwealth property, which carries a penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment. The statement says they have interviewed a number of people and will have an increased presence there in the coming weeks. Sending my thoughts to the good people of Avalon – you do a lot of good in this country and you do not need this NYE nightmare. Work colleagues of confirmed cases, not just people who live together, may be classed as close contacts if a significant transmission event occurs, according to expert health advice cited by Scott Morrison to overhaul Covid-19 rules in Australia. Newly published advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee also went beyond health factors to justify the “pragmatic” changes to testing and isolation rules. It said it was a response to fast-increasing case numbers and “the living with Covid policy approach”. The expert advisory panel – which brings together all state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly – said the changes would support “public health sustainability, social cohesion and economic recovery”. Yesterday someone was telling me how Australians are obsessed with the weather. But when you have a cyclone (about to hit) at one end and a total fire ban at the other, I think that obsession is more than warranted. Australian Christian minister Bill Crews tweeted this earlier. It’s a toasty end to 2021 for many parts of southern and inland regions of Australia. So far, the hottest place in Australia on 31 January is in Jervois, about 350km north-east of Alice Springs in the Northern Territory. The mercury there topped 42.2 degrees. The populations bearing the brunt of the heat are mostly in Victoria, with Melbourne reaching 37.4C and the state’s top temperature so far touching 40 degrees at Avalon, to the city’s west. South Australia also nudged 42 degrees, with the state capital Adelaide exceeding 38C. Sydney was a mild 28.1 degrees at its top while Brisbane’s top so far of 25.8 degrees came soon after 8.20am, local time. WA, which has a bit more of the day to go, recently reached 41.1C at the attractively named Mount Magnet. While 2021’s year-end warmth is impressive, much of the country was relatively damp over the year and that typically meant temperatures on the cool side. Here are some of the year’s highlights: The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has issued the following New Year message: 2021 has been a really tough year where people have been isolated, often for long periods of time, from their loved ones and their friends. So let’s hope 2022 brings health and happiness for all and a much easier time. Have a happy new year and I wish you all the best for 2022. Scott Morrison has issued the following message for the New Year: Happy New Year, Australia! Despite the tough times we’ve been through these past few years, we can always be thankful in Australia that we live in what we know is the best country in the world. And it’s not just the physical beauty of Australia, it’s who we are as a people. It’s the care we show for each other that has been so richly on display during the many trials we have been through this past year. It’s our freedom and our preparedness to stand up for that freedom when it counts. It’s our unique sense of the fair go and the responsibility and obligations we know we have to each other and our country, that’s part of the fair go. We’re a quietly confident people with an optimistic spirit. That is why, despite the pandemic, despite the floods, the fires, continuing drought in some areas, the cyclones, the lockdowns, even mice plagues, Australia is stronger today than we were a year ago. And we’re safer. We have one of the lowest death rates and the highest vaccination rates from Covid anywhere in the world. And we have one of the strongest advanced economies in the world to come through Covid – there’s more people in work, more apprentices in training, a secure credit rating and businesses investing in their future with confidence. That gives us confidence to face what lies ahead. Our work in 2022 is to continue to keep our economy strong, to keep Australians safe, to care for our country and work even harder to keep Australians together. Our plans are to ensure Australians grow together, not apart. To ensure that especially rural and regional parts of our country share in the same benefits and opportunities as in our cities. This summer you can play your part in keeping Australians safe by going out there and getting your booster shot and ensuring that children aged five to 11 go and get their vaccinations as well. In 2022 we are looking forward. It’s like the kangaroo and the emu on our Coat of Arms – they never take a backwards step. Now as we keep supporting each other, Australia, we will be even stronger, even safer and always together. There’s a lot to do in 2022. Happy New Year, Australia! There are reports audience members at this afternoon’s performance of the musical Moulin Rouge in Melbourne were asked to leave midway. We’ll find out what is going on and update you. Testing sites in Victoria are closing due to severe heat. From AAP: Two 11-year-old Tasmanian jumping castle victims have been farewelled on New Year’s Eve at separate funeral services in the state’s north-west. The lives of Addison Stewart and Chace Harrison were celebrated in Devonport on Friday. They were among six children who died while enjoying end-of-year celebrations at Hillcrest primary school on 16 December. Addison has been remembered as a “mother hen” and best friend to her brother and sister, who loved singing and dancing, dogs and food. Her favourite treat, Nutella, was placed prominently on a table at the service. Her father, Nathan, also made sure she shared his sporting passions – AFL club Essendon and Supercars team Dick Johnson Racing. “I was on a mission to turn her into my little tomboy,” said her father, who placed a tiny Bombers AFL guernsey on the lectern. Her small coffin was in aqua, with mourners also wearing her favourite colour. “Farewell our beautiful baby Bomber,” her father said. Addison I want to let you know that my children’s book that you had some input in, I will try my hardest to get that finished and published to honour your memory. Earlier at the same Devonport venue, Chace was farewelled with family and friends encouraged to wear Western Bulldogs or Golden State Warriors colours to celebrate his life. He passed away in hospital three days after the 16 December tragedy, the last of the children to die after a freak gust of wind picked up the castle and several inflatable zorb balls. Chace has been remembered in funeral notices as a much-loved big brother and son with a “cheeky grin” who was often involved in “fun-loving antics”. His parents, Teresa and Craig, wrote: Our hearts are broken. Our world has changed forever. Our love for you will always remain the same. The new infection in Western Australia is a close contact of a recent case and is in hotel quarantine. New South Wales daily cases have likely exceeded 25,000 a day, a month earlier than the government was predicting a fortnight ago, an acceleration likely to bring forward the strains on the health system, experts say. The NSW government reported 21,151 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, almost a 90% jump on the previous day’s tally. Kerry Chant, the state’s chief health officer, said in a video briefing it’s “likely” the increase is higher than reported. Michael Lydeamore, an infectious disease modeller at Monash University, said tests were probably catching about 80% of actual cases, meaning NSW will already be at the 25,000 cases a day rate flagged by health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December. From AAP: Greens senator Lidia Thorpe has been met with a sea of criticism after appearing to endorse a protest at Old Parliament House in which the doors of the historic building were set on fire. The blaze burnt the front doors of Canberra’s heritage-listed building, causing “tragic” and potentially irreparable damage, according to Museum of Australian Democracy director Daryl Karp. The fire broke out amid a protest at the entrance and also caused extensive damage to the portico. Police confirmed officials had agreed a small smoking ceremony could take place as part of a peaceful protest but said it got “a little bit out of hand”. Senator Thorpe retweeted footage of the fire and wrote: “Seems like the colonial system is burning down. Happy New Year everyone.” The tweet has since been deleted. Deputy Nationals leader David Littleproud said her reaction was “disgraceful”. For politicians to sit there and encourage this, it is not responsible, it is disgraceful, and they should consider their position in the Australian parliament. Aboriginal Tent Embassy activists distanced themselves from the protest, saying a smoking ceremony that took place did not have knowledge or consent from the embassy council. Aged and Community Services Australia is calling on the federal government to model how the new testing requirements will impact the aged care workforce. In a statement, ACSA chief executive Paul Sadler said the aged care workforce was already experiencing a shortfall and was now approaching crisis, given the pressures of two years of the Covid pandemic. The new year is bringing unprecedented challenges for the aged care system, and the lesson of the past two years is the government must minimise the risk by planning now. National cabinet yesterday moved to ease the strain on the overburdened state and territory testing systems but it must now ensure the stretched aged care system isn’t unintentionally pushed to the brink. The reality of the current greater circulation of Covid in the community is that it’s already resulting in an increase in staff who become Covid-positive or must isolate at home in states and territories with high community transmission. Providers must have adequate government support to maintain a workforce that can continue providing high-quality care and services and help protect residents, their families and staff, while furloughing Covid-affected staff. Chris Minns, the NSW Labor leader, did a doorstop earlier. Here a few things he had to say: The truth of the matter is, we do need to live with Covid, but that doesn’t mean that we live without government. There’s an important role for the New South Wales government to run at the moment, in terms of policy development and action. Now, I think that it’s clear that the government’s decision to scrap QR codes and mask mandates midway through December was the wrong decision. It’s led to a situation where Christmas has been cancelled. It’s had a big impact on the New South Wales economy. You’ve got a situation where pregnant women are waiting five and six hours to get PCR tests, and it’s clear the government was not prepared for the large increase in numbers over the last six or seven days. We’re at a delicate point – we’re calling on the NSW premier to be clear with the people of the state; clearly articulate what the plan is. Recognise there’s a role for government in advising the people of the state what decisions need to be made, what their obligations are and what the government’s next moves are. Seven players from the Melbourne Stars Big Bash League team have tested positive. Gunner says there is no end date yet for the mask mandate. It will apply for high schools but not primary schools. Gunner says 24 people currently in hospital are these none are in ICU. There are 2787 tests done in the NT yesterday. That is down a third on yesterday. But the cases are up by more than 60%, so 33% reduction in tests but a 60% increase in cases. There are currently 536 close contacts; 471 have been contacted and [are] isolating; 273 of these have returned a negative test. Gunner tells people to “mask up” tonight. We want you to go out. We want to have as much fun as you can. But we need you to do this as safely as possible. That’s why you need to check in. That’s why we need you to wear a mask at all times while you’re indoors, except when eating, drinking, [and] one-and-a-half metres away from all others. The Northern Territory will introduce an indoor mask mandate after recording 60 new Covid cases. The NT chief minister, Michael Gunner, is speaking now: There are 11 cases that we believe are community transmission. There are 15 cases which are still under investigation for cases [in] the area we believe one of these people was infectious, but all in the community. Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly. A big thanks to Mostafa for taking us through the morning. I will be sending off 2021 with you – what a wild, weird year it has been! First up, the official statement from NSW on ditching the day six PCR test for confirmed cases: And with that I will hand over the blog to the ever-capable Cait Kelly. Thanks for reading, and have a happy new year. Prof Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist from the University of South Australia, has been on ABC News discussing the surge in case numbers, saying that “things are getting out of hand.” Prof Esteman said the easing of restrictions in NSW likely sparked the surge, and hoped case numbers would peak before coming down in January. In NSW we are not seeing it going anywhere near the peak yet. So numbers will keep going up at an exponential rate unless something else happens. Modelling, as least for South Australia, has put the likely hospitalisation rate at 5%. Now, when you are starting to get 20,000 cases a day, that’s an awful lot of people going into hospital every single day. And taking up beds that other patients need. So I think states and territories are going to struggle ...Yes, Omicron is much, much milder which is a wonderful thing, but with sufficient numbers of cases then you will start getting hospitalisations going up. And the other thing that no one mentions is the elephant in the room – long Covid. And we have our politicians saying oh, look it doesn’t matter if cases go up because hospitalisations aren’t. I’m sorry, but it does matter if cases go up because there will be a reasonable proportion of those cases ending up with long-term health problems. It appears the ABC’s 7.30 will be gearing back up in 2022 earlier than expected, most likely due to the surge in Covid case numbers: The Antipoverty Centre has urged the government to reverse its decision to adopt changes to testing and isolation with regards to close contacts. It says the changes throw society’s most vulnerable communities under the bus and weren’t made in the name of public health, but for economic reasons. Jay Coonan of the Antipoverty Centre called the National Cabinet’s decision “heartless” and said it meant the poor will die at “even higher rates than we did last year”: During soaring cases and rolling lockdowns in 2021 those without paid work were excluded from any financial support. People in the lowest-paid jobs were confronted with the choice to starve or go to work and risk their own and their loved ones’ health. The results spoke for themselves: people in the poorest parts of the country were nearly four times [more] likely to die of Covid than those in wealthy areas. With the complete rejection of public health measures to help keep the virus at bay, our governments have unanimously decided that business and industry lobby groups’ concerns are more important than our lives. Back to NSW, with Perrottet again urging people not to line up for PCR tests unless a RAT test returns a positive result or people are directed to get tested by NSW Health. Capacity and wait times have been a key issue this week, and Perrottet has doubled down in asking people to avoid queuing up unless absolutely necessary. So my message today for people across our state is: if you are not required to be tested with a PCR test, don’t line up, because you will be taking the place of somebody who is required by NSW Health to receive that PCR test. I understand that’s a change and that will take some time to adjust ... The direction we provided as a government in the circumstances of an unvaccinated population [was] to go out there and get tested. But today, as we move through this next phase in line with the position of the national cabinet, if you do not need a test, if you are not required to by NSW Health, please do not line up. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has just issued the following statement – a “national cabinet update”: Further to National Cabinet on 30 December 2021, and following further consultation with the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Health Officers, leaders have also agreed to remove the requirement for a Day 6 RAT for confirmed cases in isolation. If confirmed cases remain symptomatic, they should remain in isolation. Anyone with symptoms will continue to seek a PCR test. NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has stepped up for his presser, and has repeated that he thinks the state is in a “strong position” considering its high vaccination rate. Perrottet says NSW will get through this outbreak on the back of the “effort and spirit of the people of our state”. (Not government policy, apparently.) I know and understand that many people across our state today are anxious. But just like the challenges of the last two years, we will get through this challenge as well and come out stronger the other side. And we’ll do that because of the effort and the spirit of the people of our state. We have made enormous sacrifices over the last two years, enormous sacrifices over this year as well, with many people not being able to say goodbye to their loved ones. It has been an incredibly challenging year, but we stand here today in an incredibly strong position as we head into 2022 because of the efforts and the sacrifices and the great spirit of the people of New South Wales. Marshall has addressed why his state is adopting a different definition of close contacts to the rest of the country (except for WA). He says South Australia is a “different phase of the overall disease”. So, in South Australia now, you’re a close contact if you’re a household or intimate partner, or those two exceptional circumstances in South Australia: if it is related to a vulnerable cohort – for example, an aged care facility [or] Aboriginal community, where there’s no logic in narrowing that down, because those two communities are more likely [to develop] higher-level illness. And the other one, of course, is where we do have an identified transmission site. South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, has announced the state has dropped any testing requirements for people looking to enter the state. He also announced that travellers will no longer need to use the EntryCheck SA app, as well as no longer needing a rapid antigen test before entry. It was not a good use of our resources at the moment, and so the EntryCheck requirement has been removed. The rapid antigen test requirement has been removed. But we are asking all of those people coming from interstate into South Australia to observe exactly the same situation that we require of all South Australians, and that is to monitor their symptoms and to take action should they develop any symptoms. South Australia has reported another record daily increase in case numbers, reporting 2,093 new cases overnight. Sadly, four deaths were reported. There are now 44 people in hospital with the virus, with four in ICU. South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said the jump in case numbers was “in line with the very steep increases we’re seeing across the country”. It is a further increase on yesterday, and obviously this would seem to be linked to activities that occurred on or around Christmas Day. This is one of the reasons why we had to move very, very quickly on Boxing Day to try to slow the growth, the exponential growth, of positive cases here in our state because we know that many of those people ultimately end up in hospital and in ICU. Foley has continued, saying that RATs should be widely available and free, and seemingly taking a swipe at the federal government for refusing to do anything about the shortage: We prioritise those that are most at risk in the community, and we’ll work though those that are most at risk in the economy, the healthcare system. ... $10, $15, $20, sometimes $25 a pop is prohibitive for many families. And we think there’s a really important role for government to lead and to partner with the wider community in the provision of the tests. We think they should be free. We think they should be widely available. Foley has addressed the discussions around rapid antigen tests today, acknowledging there is a “national shortage” of the tests, and that they are hard to get, regardless of government procurement. The Victorian health minister is being peppered with questions about the tests, saying he feels for those trying to get their hands on the tests. He says free and accessible tests are important in a pandemic response. I know the private sector is equally procuring record amounts, and we’ll work closely with all parts of the community to get those rapid antigen tests out as a pillar of our testing system heading into the future. Victorians have come to I think rightly see testing as a key part of ongoing public health response. Free testing is a critical part of that. But at the moment we are really facing some challenges right across the country. And we’ll work through those challenges as quickly as we can whilst acknowledging the frustrations that that is creating for families and Victorians for a while. Queensland has seen a huge jump in case numbers, reporting 3,118 new cases overnight. A man in his 50s is in the ICU with the Delta variant. There are now 11,697 active cases in the state. Victoria’s Covid-19 commander, Jeroen Weimar, has warned that the severe heat Melbourne is facing today and tomorrow will affect health staff taking PCR tests, and has asked people to avoid getting tested if possible. He said authorities are doing a “site by site assessment” in light of the forecast heatwave, with temperatures in Melbourne looking to peak at 38C today. We’re expecting to peak temperatures of 38 degrees in Melbourne and in other parts of the state. As a result of course, we are doing a site by site assessment of our testing system where we particularly have outdoor testing facilities. We are closing some of those sites as the temperature in those parts starts to rise. You’ll appreciate of course that our staff have been out there for weeks and months on end ... in full PPE, and the temperature in our outdoor testing tents is increasingly 10 degrees above the ambient temperature outside. Equally we do not want to see people waiting for long hours in cars in exceptionally hot weather. So please, you only need to get a PCR if you have symptoms or if you have tested positive on a rapid antigen test. Cricket Australia has released a statement which outlines that batter Travis Head will remain in Melbourne, and that he will not be available for the fourth test: Australian batsman Travis Head has tested positive to Covid-19 following a routine PCR test. Head is asymptomatic and will remain in Melbourne and isolate with his partner for seven days in line with Victorian Government Health requirements. He will be unavailable for selection for the fourth Vodafone men’s Ashes Test, starting at the SCG on January 5. The remainder of the Australian squad, their families and the support staff have undergone PCR and RAT tests this morning. Both the Australian and England squads are expected to separately travel to Sydney as planned today. As a precautionary measure Mitchell Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have joined the Australian squad as additional cover. Victorian health minister Martin Foley has stepped up for the daily Covid update, and has said that roughly a third of new cases in the state have contracted the Omicron variant. He says he expects the new variant will become the vast majority of cases in the “near future”. The minister also confirmed that the state had adopted the new close contact definition set out after national cabinet yesterday. Building on the below reports, Cricket Australia have confirmed that batter Travis Head has tested positive. Mitch Marsh, Nic Maddinson and Josh Inglis have been added to the squad in the interim. In a statement, CA have said Head is asymptomatic and that they hope he will be available for the fifth test: As part of our testing procedures, we are PCR testing players, their families and our support staff daily. Unfortunately, Travis returned a positive Covid-19 result earlier today. Thankfully, he is asymptomatic at this stage. We anticipate that he will be available to play in the fifth Vodafone men’s Ashes Test in Hobart. We are grateful to our exceptional medical staff for all the work they have done throughout this series and we will continue to work with and support the players, their families and staff from both teams. Reports are emerging of an Australian batter testing positive, meaning the virus has now infected both Ashes camps in the lead up to game four. The Australian is reporting the Australian side have delayed their flight to Sydney amid reports of the diagnosis. The flight was due at 12.35pm, but has been delayed as authorities scramble to work out if other players have been infected. The English side has already seen seven positive cases among their camp. It comes after reports of 14 cases among the Melbourne Stars team. NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant has given a video update, and said that while case numbers are currently very high, it is “likely” actual case numbers are higher: Whilst we’re reporting 21,151 cases in the community, it is likely that the case numbers are higher than that. There is a lot of transmission of Covid occurring in our community and so the risk of transmission and acquiring Covid is high. NSW Health has deleted and re-uploaded their Covid figures this morning, changing the number of people in hospital. The initial figure had it at 763 in hospital, which represented a small jump over yesterday’s numbers. But the updated number is 832, a significant jump in hospitalisations. The number of hospitalisations yesterday was 747, which means there were 85 new hospitalisations overnight, not the initially reported 16. NSW Health has tweeted the latest figure without providing any comment on the issue, so it is unclear where the mixup comes from. Lastly, this is what the AHPPC recommended about isolation and quarantine requirements “in a high case-load environment”: In a high case-load environment, there is a need for a modified, risk-based approach to quarantine and isolation settings. AHPPC advises that the isolation period for Covid-19 cases should be standardised regardless of vaccination status to a length of 7 days. Household contacts or those identified as being at risk of significant transmission should quarantine for 7 days after last exposure to a case regardless of vaccination status and then, subject to a negative test on day 6, monitor for symptoms for a further 7 days and repeat testing if these occur. Other contacts who have been potentially exposed to a case but who are at lower risk of infection should monitor for symptoms and have RAT or PCR test if these occur. All contacts should wear a mask when outside home, monitor symptoms and avoid visiting high risk settings for 14 days following exposure to reduce their risk of transmission to others. If RAT tests are positive, these should be followed by a positive PCR test to confirm the diagnosis. You can read the full statement here. The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) says the existing settings for testing were “placing considerable pressure on available laboratory resources”. Its statement says: In a higher caseload environment where resources are strained, public health resources and clinical vigilance need to be directed to identification of cases most at risk of infection and/or severe disease, and settings where there are people at risk of severe disease. And here’s what the AHPPC says about the management of contacts of Covid-19 cases (note it goes beyond household contacts to allow for possibility of workplace contacts if there’s a high transmission event): Detailed follow up of individual cases and identification of all individuals with whom they have been in contact is not possible with high caseloads. Given significant levels of population exposure and consequent disruption to social and business functioning, it is also not desirable if large numbers of contacts are quarantined. Therefore, household or household-like contacts are the key group who should be required to quarantine as these individuals are the most likely to develop disease. These will be defined, except in exceptional circumstances, as those who usually live with or who have stayed in the same household as a case during their infectious period ... In addition, where a significant transmission event has been documented those who were at this site or venue may be determined to be close contacts. This may include worksites. The advice further adds: There is still risk of transmission based on the nature of exposure for other contacts (such as in social, educational or workplace settings) who have had less extensive exposure to a case ... This group will not be required to quarantine, except in exceptional circumstances, and may be required to undertake other behaviours to decrease their risk of transmission to others. The AHPPC also says that for the effective control of outbreaks, “different management approaches will be needed for contacts in closed, high-transmission settings”, particularly where vulnerable individuals are concerned, such as residential aged care facilities and remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The health advice that went to national cabinet yesterday argues the changes to testing and close contact definitions are “pragmatic” in “a high case environment and the living with Covid policy approach”. A statement by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) - which brings together all state and territory chief health officers and is chaired by Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly - was published overnight. It includes a lot more nuance than Morrison’s comments at the post-national cabinet press conference. It is also interesting how the expert health panel justifies the changes, pointing to issues with community adherence and economic recovery. The AHPPC notes “current and expected future high caseloads necessitate a change in public health actions including policies and processes for test, trace, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) to support public health sustainability, social cohesion and economic recovery”. The advice says the effectiveness of TTIQ declines as case numbers in Australia increase: The AHPPC acknowledges that public health efforts may not identify considerable numbers of cases and may not manage a significant proportion of the transmission risk. Public health efforts will be required to focus on highest risk and rely on individuals and workplaces to manage their own risk. Consequently, the AHPPC stresses that the proposed changes will likely limit the ability of TTIQ to suppress transmission of COVID-19 at a population level but taking a focused outbreak approach can reduce the impact on the most vulnerable in our community. Welfare recipients should get free access to rapid antigen tests, according to the Australian Council of Social Service, which has branded the federal government’s failure so far to adopt such a measure as “irresponsible and callous”. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said yesterday the government would not be making the rapid tests free, though he said “concessional” arrangements for those on low incomes and pensioners were being worked on. He did not give further details. The Acoss president Peter McNamara said on Friday: We are very concerned that people relying on income support payments just can’t afford $70 for a rapid antigen test kit, leaving them unable to assess their risk from Covid-19 for themselves, their families and the community. It is irresponsible and callous of the federal government to fail to make provision for up to three million people already struggling to survive below the poverty line. Especially when we have evidence that people living in the lowest socioeconomic group have experienced almost four times as many Covid-19 deaths as people in the highest income group. We know that the hardest hit by Covid-19 and all variants are people who are homeless, people with disabilities, First Nations people, especially those who live remotely, the elderly [and] single parent households. McNamara also called for “greater clarity of information from the NSW and Victorian governments” on how people in these states can access free rapid antigen tests. Those states initially said they would provide rapid tests for free, but were contradicted by Morrison’s announcement yesterday that no such policy would be adopted. The Omicron variant has “created a significant speed bump for the economy” due to problems with testing and staff shortages, BIS Oxford Economics’ chief economist for Australia, Sarah Hunter, says. But she says the rollout of vaccines and boosters means health outcomes are a lot better than last year and the chances of a return to hard lockdowns has been reduced. “The reintroduction of some rules and restrictions will weigh on consumer spending,” Hunter said. The challenges around test results and travel is a very tangible example of this, and some people may not feel comfortable going to settings that are likely to be crowded. We’re also starting to see the impact on some businesses, where staff shortages are being created because individuals are having to go into isolation due to contracting Covid or being a close contact. She said similar effects have been felt in the UK and Europe, where countries have been forced to relax isolation rules to keep essential services including healthcare and the food supply operating. Despite soaring case numbers globally, very few countries have had to revert to a hard lockdown to protect their healthcare system, and so the drag on the economy will be much less pronounced than earlier in the pandemic. ... The vaccine is also a key reason why consumers and businesses feel more confident about the outlook. The protection it provides gives people confidence to at least start to return to normal, through increased travel, spending on services etc, and this response will also be a critical driver of positive momentum through the first few months of 2022. Sixteen testing sites across South Australia have had to shut down for part of the day today due to severe heat. A number of metropolitan sites will be closed for a majority of the day, opening between 6.30am and 10.30am, and then again between 5.30pm and 8.30pm. These hours are expected to remain the same on Saturday as the heat persists. The temperature is forecast to hit 39C on Friday and 37C on Saturday. With the state maintaining its reliance on PCR tests, these reduced hours will no doubt affect wait times at testing sites. Tasmania has set a new record for daily cases, reporting 137 new infections overnight. There are currently 520 active cases in the state, with zero patients currently in ICU with the virus. Health program director at Grattan Institute, Stephen Duckett, was on Sky News this morning, and labelled the federal government’s move to redefine a close contact as a “political decision”, not a public health decision. Duckett said the changes had “nothing” to do with transmissibility, and everything to do with “managing PCR testing facilities”: The reason they chose to change the definition of a close contact was nothing to do with transmissibility. In fact it’s the reverse of what should have been done if you’re worried about transmission. Omicron is more transmissible, not less transmissible, it’s more transmissible than Delta. What it was about was managing the PCR testing facilities; in my case I waited in line longer than I had been exposed. So it was entirely about managing the testing. Nothing about the risk to the whole population. China’s foreign ministry has responded to reports that the Australian Department of Defence has not recommended scrapping a Chinese company’s long-term lease over the Port of Darwin. Earlier this week, the Australian newspaper reported that a Defence review had found there were no national security grounds sufficient to recommend a government intervention to overturn the 99-year lease to Chinese company Landbridge. The newspaper reported the cabinet’s national security committee had not yet taken any action, because there was no formal recommendation from Defence for a national security intervention, but the Morrison government was still reviewing the matter. The Australian government has yet to formally confirm the outcome. But when asked about the report, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, told a regular press conference in Beijing overnight: “The economic and trade cooperation between China and Australia is mutually beneficial and win-win in nature. The Chinese government encourages Chinese enterprises to conduct investment cooperation overseas in line with market principles, international rules and local laws. “Australia should stop overstretching the concept of national security and provide a fair and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises operating in the country.” In response to another question about closer cooperation between Australia and Japan, including over China’s growing military pressure against Taiwan, Zhao told the press conference: “What we need in the Pacific is the joint efforts of countries in the region to uphold peace, not attempts to drum up the so-called ‘threat’ theories or stir up trouble. All moves against the tide are doomed to fail.” Talk about party poopers. Queensland police acting chief superintendent Chris Stream was on the Today show on Channel 9 this morning, urging NYE revellers to go easy tonight. “Don’t party too much – it’s been a hard year for many people,” he said, paradoxically. Plan ahead. Watch your alcohol consumption in relation to the Covid-safe deployments. We ask you to maintain masks and physical distancing. If you’re going to areas and it’s crowded and you can’t physically distance, look for another area. Yesterday, NSW police took a similar stance, saying they will be launching their usual crowd control operation, and will be monitoring “responsible activity on the road”. NSW police minister Paul Toole yesterday said police would be “out in force”: Police will be out in force on our roads and at events, not just in Sydney, but right across the state to make sure everyone rings in the new year safely. In some perhaps mildly positive news, the South African government has announced overnight that the country has “passed its Omicron peak”. The New York Times is reporting the South African Medical Research Council saying the peak of cases took four weeks, and began declining in two weeks. Fareed Abdullah, from the council, said its speed was “staggering”. The speed with which the Omicron-driven fourth wave rose, peaked and then declined has been staggering. Peak in four weeks and precipitous decline in another two. This Omicron wave is over in the city of Tshwane. It was a flash flood more than a wave. He said the rise in deaths over that period was small, and in the last week was “marginal”. Now obviously, there are many, many caveats to add to this, including differences in vaccine uptake, infectious spread, government policy and so on, but there is at least some light somewhere in the world. It is also worth pointing out that the Omicron variant’s spread in South Africa preceded Australia’s, peaking at more than 23,000 cases a day in mid-December. But cases have been falling for two weeks, currently averaging 11,500 cases a day. I would like to break up the pretty bad news with someone pulling a wheelie at a press conference yesterday: I have to agree, more wheelies at press conferences please. Adding to those numbers, I wanted to list here the hospitalisations. NSW reported another 16 hospitalisations overnight, with 69 people currently in the ICU. Victoria reported 32 hospitalisations overnight, with 54 people still in ICU. Victoria has also reported an increase in case numbers, this time reporting 5,919 new cases – up from 5,137 yesterday. Sadly, seven people died overnight. Another daily record for NSW, and another significant jump in Covid cases, with 21,151 locally acquired infections overnight. There was also a jump in deaths, with six people sadly losing their lives. So, it appears South Australia will resist the changes to the definition of close contact the national cabinet agreed to yesterday. In a Facebook post earlier this morning, the premier, Steven Marshall, lays out his government’s definition of close contacts. Marshall says a close contact will be a: Household and household-like contacts and intimate partners. Those who have been in a setting where there has been significant transmission of Covid-19 (and there has been greater than 15 minutes face-to-face contact). Those in high-risk communities/settings/workplaces where someone has tested positive to Covid-19 (and there has been greater than 15 minutes of face-to-face contact). That is different to the definition introduced by Morrison, under which a close contact is someone who lives with or has been in a “household-like” situation with a confirmed Covid-19 case for at least four hours. Marshall also refused to drop the reliance on PCR tests, saying close contacts will still need to get an “initial” PCR test and another one on day 6, or “immediately if symptoms develop”. Yesterday, Morrison had said a RAT was enough for close contacts to be able to tell if they were still positive or not. South Australia joins Western Australia as seemingly the only two states refusing to adopt the new changes. So, I wanted to just zero in on the conversations surrounding rapid antigen tests this morning. Chief executive of Pathology Technology Australia, Dean Whiting, told the Guardian all providers want is clarity. It doesn’t matter to us whether they’re free, subsidised or other some other thing. What we as an industry have been more concerned about is having a clear role for rapid testing in managing infections, in keeping the economy going and in keeping people safe. In a sense I don’t think we really care if they are free or not in terms of supply of the tests, as long as there is a clear position from governments on the role of the tests. The industry doesn’t have a position because we sell to the government for market price and we don’t care if they are free or not. I am on the record saying that if they were free it would improve access and equity in testing and access to tests. But that isn’t a point about market supply. President of the Pharmacy Guild, Trent Twomey, also told the Guardian they had not been lobbying: So our representation to them [the federal government] has always been that there needs to be a hybrid system, because it may only be $10 or $15 a test and yes, that may be a lot cheaper than a PCR test. But $10 or $15 per person per household twice in a seven-day period is still not affordable for some low-income earners. This, of course, all comes after Scott Morrison told reporters yesterday the reason RATs aren’t free is due to suppliers’ “concerns.” You can read more on this with reporting from Michael McGowan, Ben Butler and Luke Henriques-Gomes at the link below: Good morning and happy New Year’s Eve to all. Mostafa Rachwani here with you to take you through the morning’s news. We begin with the prime minister Scott Morrison, who yesterday announced changes to the definition of close contacts after a national cabinet meeting. The changes include shortening isolation periods for positive cases and restricting close contacts to someone who has been with a confirmed case in a home-like setting for more than four hours. The changes became active from midnight last night, with thousands now free to leave isolation. The new definition comes with a new standard for testing so that close contacts need to only get a rapid antigen test, with the hopes this will ease congestion on PCR testing sites. It comes after Morrison refused to provide rapid antigen tests for free to the general public, citing concerns by suppliers. But industry groups have denied pressuring federal and state authorities to abandon a commitment to provide free kits. More than 21,300 new Covid cases were reported yesterday across Australia, a new daily record for the country, with multiple states reporting record numbers. Meanwhile, New Year’s Eve plans appear to be going ahead in major cities, with some authorities in Melbourne and Sydney encouraging revellers to come out for the occasion, in spite of surging case numbers."

          "headline": "Chess: 17-year-old shocks Carlsen and becomes youngest world rapid winner",
          "bodyText": "A little-known 17-year-old from Uzbekistan made a clean sweep of Magnus Carlsen and the global chess elite on Tuesday, incidentally setting a world age record. Nodirbek Abdusattorov won the World Rapid championship in Warsaw, claiming en route the scalps of Magnus Carlsen and the No 1’s last two challengers, Fabiano Caruana and Ian Nepomniachtchi. In rapid chess each player has 15 minutes for all moves, plus a 10 second per move increment. After 21 rounds of three-minute games on Wednesday and Thursday, France’s Maxime Vachier-Lagrave defeated Poland’s Jan-Krzysztof Duda in a tie-break to win the World Blitz title. The 18-year-old world No 2, Alireza Firouzja, was third but Carlsen was well adrift in 12th place. He said: “Some days you just don’t have it. I was nowhere near close to the level I needed to be today.” At 17 years three months Abdusattorov becomes the youngest ever world champion in open competition, surpassing Ruslan Ponomariov at 18 in the Fide version of the then disputed classical crown in 2001 and Carlsen, also at 18, in the 2009 World Blitz. The next youngest were 22 – Garry Kasparov, in his first victory over Anatoly Karpov in 1985, and Daniil Dubov and Sergey Karjakin when winning speed titles. The world women’s championship has a younger record holder, as Hou Yifan won it in 2010 aged 16, after being the defeated finalist two years earlier. Earlier in the teen from Tashkent’s blossoming career he had won the world under-eight championship, defeated two grandmasters at nine and been singled out in this column when he narrowly missed becoming the youngest ever GM at 12. Abdusattorov had his share of good fortune at Warsaw, surviving three lost positions, but he also played a very strong field where Levon Aronian and Boris Gelfand were among his other victims. After 13 rounds he was in a quadruple tie on 9.5 points with Carlsen, Caruana and Nepomniachtchi, but the regulations excluded Carlsen and Caruana from the play-off due to their inferior tie-breaks. An angry Carlsen denounced the rules as “idiotic. Either all players on the same amount of points join the play-off or no one does.” It was balancing luck for Nepomniachtchi, who in this same event and under the same rules in 2017 was excluded from the play-off, but the Russian was outgunned in the tie-break games. Abdusattorov easily drew with Black, then won the second game despite twice missing mate in two near the end. Abdusattorov is the second player from Generation Z, defined as people born from 1995 to 2010, to break through to the chess top. Firouzja, whose victories in Latvia and Slovenia last month made him No 2 behind Carlsen in the global rankings, was out of form in Warsaw in the rapid but finished strongly in the three-minute blitz to take the bronze medal and narrowly miss out on the Vachier-Lagrave v Duda play-off. Yet another Gen Z player surged into the limelight when Bibisara Assaubayeva, 17, captured the world women’s rapid championship silver medal with 8.5/11, half a point behind Russia’s “chess Queen” Alexandra Kosteniuk. The teen from Kazakhstan did even better in the women’s blitz, reversing the result to take gold to Kosteniuk’s silver. Uzbekistan has long punched far above its weight in world chess. Four of its teenagers did well in last month’s Grand Swiss at Riga while Javokhir Sindarov, 16, finished in eighth place in the blitz at Warsaw ahead of many of the world elite. Long ago the old USSR set the standard for young talent with a golden generation including David Bronstein, Tigran Petrosian, Ewfim Geller and Mark Taimanov. England in the 1970s followed the Soviet model with Jon Speelman, Nigel Short, Michael Adams and later Luke McShane, Gawain Jones and David Howell. India and the US are doing best now with super-squads,but Uzbekistan is showing what can be achieved even by a small nation with the right approach to developing an elite. Fide has announced that the eight-player 2022 Candidates will be staged in Madrid in June-July 2022, with patronage from the Scheinberg family, who have previously backed opens in the Isle of Man and whose fortune comes from the sale of PokerStars for nearly $5bn. So far the qualifiers are Nepomniachtchi (loser of the 2021 title match), Caruana and Firouzja (Riga Grand Swiss), Sergey Karjakin and Jan-Krzysztof Duda (World Cup), Teimour Radjabov (Fide nominee), with the remaining two to come from the Fide Grand Prix at Berlin and Belgrade in February-March 2022. The Candidates and its winner have become even more significant than usual after Carlsen’s announcement that he will only defend his title if the challenger is from the new generation, so raising the stakes for the top two Candidates who could end up playing between them for the supreme crown. 3796: 1 Rc1! Qxa6 2 Rxc4! bxc4 3 Qh3! and White makes a second queen. The trap is 1 Rd8?? Qxa6 2 c8=Q Qa1+ 3 Kg2 Qf1 mate."

Tesla has recalled close to half a million vehicles in the US to fix rearview camera and trunk issues that the regulators said could increase the risk of crashes. The electric vehicle manufacturer is recalling 356,309 of its 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues and 119,009 of its Model S vehicles due to front hood problems. Opening and closing the trunk could damage the cables attaching the rearview mirror on the Model 3, according to filings issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model S recall relates to concerns about latches securing the vehicle’s front trunk (known as the frunk). The NHTSA said: “Unavailability of the rearview camera display may affect the driver’s rear view and increase the risk of a collision.” Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the issues with the recalled vehicles, the NHTSA said, and the company estimates that only 1% of the Model 3 vehicles will display the defect, compared to 14% of the recalled Model S vehicles.

The carrier had previously temporarily suspended services to Hong Kong at the end of November after one employee tested positive for Covid-19 and staff were sent into quarantine. On Wednesday, Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airways said it will make “significant” changes to its flight schedule from now through the first quarter of 2022, and only operate a skeletal service in January. A spokesman for BA said. “Like other airlines, due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic we are operating a reduced and dynamic schedule. We apologize to customers whose travel plans are disrupted.” More here. Back on Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index has hit a new record high. The US stock index has had a very strong year, ralling by 28% during 2021 thanks to America’s economic recovery, solid corporate profits, and economic and fiscal stimulus. Victoria Beckham’s fashion and beauty business remained lossmaking in 2020, as the former pop star, her husband David and other shareholders pumped in millions of pounds to keep it afloat during the pandemic. Sales fell 6% compared with a year earlier to £36m, according to accounts filed for Victoria Beckham Holdings (VBH), which owns the former Spice Girls member’s fashion business, as well as the majority stake in her beauty range, which launched in 2019. However, the company’s £6.8m pre-tax loss was less than half the £15.6m loss for 2019, which the company attributed to better management of its supply chain, and a new business model whereby the brand sold more of its goods directly to consumers.

The Dow Jones industrial average of 30 large US companies has jumped by 140 points, or 0.4%, to 36,628 points, as stocks end a strong year with fresh gains. Chemicals company Dow Inc (+1%) is the top riser, followed by American Express (0.9%), JP Morgan (0.8%) and Walt Disney (0.8%). Inflation has accelerated in Spain, with prices rising at the fastest pace in around 30 years. Spanish consumer prices in December rose 6.7% from the same month last year, flash data from the National Statistics Institute (INE) showed this morning. That’s up from 5.5% in November, and rather higher than the 5.7% rate expected by economists. Prices rose by 1.3% in December alone. Electricity fees drove the annual price index, as Europe’s energy crisis hit families, with the price of food also rising significantly in 2021. The drop in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits (see last post) is more evidence that the US job market remains strong in the aftermath of last year’s coronavirus recession, says Associated Press: The weekly claims numbers, a proxy for layoffs, have fallen steadily most of the year. Employers are reluctant to let workers go at a time when it’s so tough to find replacements. The United States had a near-record 11 million job openings in October, and 4.2 million Americans quit their jobs — just off September’s record 4.4 million — because there are so many opportunities. The job market has bounced back from last year’s brief but intense coronavirus recession. When COVID hit, governments ordered lockdowns, consumers hunkered down at home and many businesses closed or cut back hours. Employers slashed more than 22 million jobs in March and April 2020, and the unemployment rate rocketed to 14.8%. But massive government spending — and eventually the rollout of vaccines — brought the economy back. Employers have added 18.5 million jobs since April 2020, still leaving the U.S. still 3.9 million jobs short of what it had before the pandemic. The December jobs report, out next week, is expected to show that the economy generated another 374,000 jobs this month. Just in: The US jobs market remains strong, despite the rise in omicron cases. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefit fell to 198,000 last week, down from 206,000 the week before. That’s a little lower than forecast, and below the number of jobless claims before Covid. Quite a change compared with early in the pandemic, when the initial claims total hit 6 million. The number of Americans receiving at least two weeks of unemployment support returned to pre-pandemic levels too. The ‘insured unemployment’ total fell by 140,000 to 1,716,000 people, the lowest since March 7, 2020, just before the first lockdowns. The biggest shake-up to the insurance industry for decades takes place on Saturday, when insurers will be banned from quoting policyholders a higher price to renew their home or motor insurance than they would offer a new customer. After years of complaints that customers who regularly switched insurer were paying significantly lower premiums than those who renewed, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has said they must be offered the same price. The move is expected to be bad news for households that chase the lowest new-customer premiums annually. However, the FCA expects it to result in lower renewals for loyal customers who renew automatically, typically saving them £120 a year each... Elon Musk has rejected criticisms that his SpaceX company is taking up too much room in space, by dominating radio frequencies and orbital slots. In an interview published by the Financial Times, Musk insisted that SpaceX’s network of tens of thousands of low-orbiting “Starlink” satellites wasn’t crowding out other operators, saying: “Space is just extremely enormous, and satellites are very tiny. This is not some situation where we’re effectively blocking others in any way. We’ve not blocked anyone from doing anything, nor do we expect to.” Josef Aschbacher, head of the European Space Agency, said earlier this month that Musk was “making the rules” in space. Aschbacher called for coordinated action from the EU and other countries to ensure that SpaceX’s constellation did not prevent other countries or companies from launching their own satellites. Musk compared the number of satellites with the 2bn vehicles on the Earth’s surface, suggesting there was room for “tens of billions” of satellites. The FT cited an astrophysicist disputing that claim on the grounds that satellites need large gaps to be able to safely avoid collisions.

The city of 13m people is under lockdown, while multiple rounds of tests have been carried out, with over 100 new Covid-19 cases reported today. All non-essential businesses in Xi’an have been closed, while residents are barred from leaving their houses except to buy living necessities every other day or for emergencies. Samsung Electronics and Micron Technology, two of the world’s largest memory chip makers, have said their chip manufacturing bases in the area will be affected, potentially adding to the existing semiconductor shortages. Samsung says it will “temporarily adjust operations” at its Xian manufacturing facilities which produces NAND flash memory chips, used for data storage in data centres, smartphones and other tech gadgets. It pledged to take all necessary steps to ensure customers are not affected. Micron said it was also looking to source memory chips from other sources: “We are tapping our global supply chain, including our subcontractor partners, to help service our customers for these DRAM products. “We project that these efforts will allow us to meet most of our customer demand, however there may be some near-term delays as we activate our network,” Christmas is a time for giving. But Santander has taken the festive spirit too far. The high street bank is scrambling to recover £130m it accidentally paid out to tens of thousands of people and businesses on Christmas Day, in a remarkable blunder. Patrick Hosking of The Times has the details: About 75,000 people and companies in receipt of normal one-off or regular payments from 2,000 businesses with accounts at Santander were inadvertently paid a second time. Those finding an unexpected Christmas bonus in their accounts included employees of the businesses and their suppliers. The second payment was made from Santander’s own reserves, leaving the bank significantly out of pocket, but its own customers unaffected. Recovering the money will not be simple because it has gone to the accounts of customers of dozens of other banks, which are now being asked to retrieve the money on Santander’s behalf. A Santander spokesman says that: “We’re sorry that, due to a technical issue, some payments from our corporate clients were incorrectly duplicated on the recipients’ accounts. “None of our clients were at any point left out of pocket as a result and we will be working hard with many banks across the UK to recover the duplicated transactions over the coming days.” Account holders at Barclays, HSBC NatWest, Co-operative Bank and Virgin Money are among those affected, The Times says. The banks can retrieve the cash... but some are said to be worried that it may already have been spent, so clawing it back could push customers into overdrafts. Japan’s Topix index, which covers a broader range of companies than the benchmark Nikkei, had a strong year too. The Topix jumped by 10.4% this year, and also finished at its highest year-end close since 1989. Back in the markets, Japan’s Nikkei share index has recorded its highest year-end closing level in 32 years. Today was the final trading session in Tokyo, where the Nikkei 225 posted a 4.91% rise for 2021. After a small dip today, it closed at 28,791.71 points, the best finish to a year since 1989, late in Japan’s stock market bubble. The Nikkei was lifted by fiscal and monetary stimulus, and optimism for a post-pandemic economic recovery which drove global stocks to record highs in 2021. Back in September, the Nikkei hit a 31-year high of 30,670.10. Analysts expect the Nikkei to keep rising next year, Reuters reports: “The backdrop for stocks looks good next year,” said Masahiro Ichikawa, chief market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management, predicting the Nikkei will top 30,000 by end-March. “Omicron looks like it won’t result in a big shock for markets (and) investors don’t seem concerned about the prospect of two or three rate hikes by the Federal Reserve next year.” However, the Nikkei is still shy of its record high of 38,957 points set in 1989, before the market crashed: Pulling together a deposit is the biggest challenge for many new housebuyers, Nationwide’s report shows. A 20% deposit in London is now nearly £88,000 (based on the average first time buyer house price) -- that’s 183% of average annual gross income in the capital. That’s up from 130% of income a decade ago, and works out at an extra £36,000 -- a high hurdle, especially as most buyers will be paying rent. While all regions have seen an increase in their deposit requirements, the rises are much more pronounced for the South and Midlands, Nationwide adds. The Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global has reported widening losses and a decline in third-quarter revenue, after its domestic business took a hit from a regulatory crackdown by Beijing. The company said operating losses hit $6.3bn (£4.68bn) in the nine months to the end of September, while revenue fell nearly 2% in its third quarter. Chinese authorities have come down hard on Didi since its New York Stock exchange listing in June, demanding that it take down its software from mobile app stores while the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) investigated its handling of customer data. The restriction came as a blow for Didi – co-founded in 2012 by former Alibaba employee Will Wei Cheng and backed by SoftBank Group – which was the dominant ride-hailing company in China. The company now faces stiff competition from ride-hailing services by automakers Geely and SAIC Motor. Retailers are likely to increase their prices early next year, intensifying the cost of living squeeze on households. The trend is already underway, with the UK branch of IKEA announcing price increases; due to higher costs across the supply chain, including raw materials, transport and logistics. More will follow in 2022, as analysts at Saxo Bank explain: Most companies cannot absorb the costs anymore and will pass them on to consumers. In the case of the United Kingdom, the situation is even worse due to post-Brexit supply chain disruptions. In these circumstances, it is unlikely that inflation will significantly move downward in the short term, at least. The London-based think tank the Resolution Foundation estimates that UK households will face a £1,200 hit to their budget on average in 2022 due to higher inflation, soaring energy prices and big tax rise to come in April. Supply chain disruptions will also remain. The president of the UK Food and Drink Federation, Ian Wright, indicated that it is likely UK consumers will not find the great variety of products they used to in supermarkets in the post-Brexit era. British workers facing soaring costs of living in 2022 need a bigger pay rise after a “lost decade” of wage growth under Conservative-led governments, the head of the Trades Union Congress has said. In her new year’s message, Frances O’Grady urged ministers to take immediate steps to encourage faster pay growth across the British economy amid soaring energy bills and other costs. Issuing a challenge to Boris Johnson, O’Grady warned his government could not “sit this wages crisis out” after cutting benefits and announcing plans for a tax raid on workers next year, saying: “After decades of real wage cuts and falling living standards, no one can seriously say working people don’t deserve a pay rise.” More here: In the City, stocks have dipped back from their highest levels in 22 months. The FTSE 100 is down 10 points at 7410, in another quiet session with many investors having downed tools until the new year. Airline group IAG (-2%) is the top faller, as Omicron case numbers continue to surge globally. Gambling groups Flutter (-1.4%) and Entain (-1%), and telecome group BT (-1.6%) are also lower. The more domestically-focused FTSE 250 index is flat, with budget airline Wizz Air (-1.5%) and transport group National Express (-1.2%) lower. Pent-up demand could keep house prices high in 2022, argues Gareth Lewis, commercial director of property lender MT Finance: “Covid focused the minds of buyers like nothing else, persuading people to move further out of urban centres in the search for more space, aided by remarkably low mortgage rates. Unsurprisingly, house prices performed most strongly in Wales, the north of England and the south-west as working patterns changed. However, affordability in London remains incredibly stretched, making it very difficult for a young workforce to buy in the capital. Although many people have made their move, there is still plenty of pent-up demand, which will keep property prices high. An easing of stamp duty for downsizers looks increasingly necessary in order to encourage them to move, free up larger family homes and keep property price growth at a more manageable level.” North London estate agent Jeremy Leaf reports that activity slowed this month. Potential buyers digested the rise in UK interest rates, while the Omicron variant deterred some homeowners from putting their homes on the market: ’The Nationwide survey not only demonstrates the underlying strength of the market after the withdrawal of the stamp duty holiday and furlough but gives a broad hint of the direction of travel for 2022. ‘We are seeing much the same at the sharp end, too, including in the run up to Christmas with rising Omicron cases, inflation and interest rates resulting in reduced activity but not a significant correction. ‘Further Covid restrictions will only lead to a build-up of more pent-up demand. But momentum will continue to be compromised by lack of supply as we have found sellers tend to be more put off than buyers because they are concerned about having people in their homes for viewings.’ Getting on the housing ladder has become even harder in the last decade. Housing affordability has worsened in most UK regions since 2011, meaning new buyers need to stretch themselves even more to buy their first house, Nationwide’s house price report shows. Nationwide calculated affordability by working out where in the income distribution a prospective purchaser would sit if they were purchasing the typical first-time buyer property in each region, with a 20% deposit and borrowing four times their income. In East Anglia and the East Midlands the typical buyer has moved from the 50th percentile to the 70th percentile. Those in the South East and South West now need to be in the top 80th, from the 60th a decade ago, while hypothetical first-time buyers in London need to be in the 90th percentile. This means even more people are priced out of the market, or need to borrow a greater multiple of their income to buy a home - putting them at greater risk if interest rates rise, or their incomes fall. Or, they could get a helping hand from family (which may not be an option for those from less wealthy backgrounds). Wales was the strongest performing region in 2021, with prices up 15.8% year-on-year as the pandemic and the rise in home working encouraged people to leave large cities and move to more rural areas. This is the first time since Nationwide’s regional series began in 1973 that Wales has ended the year as the top performing region. London was the weakest-performing region, with prices up 4.2% in the year. Prices rose by 12.1% in Northern Ireland, by 10.1% in Scotland, and by 9.0% in England. Nationwide says: “The South West was the strongest performing English region, with annual price growth of 11.5%, the largest calendar year increase in the region since 2004. This was closely followed by the Outer South East, which saw annual price growth increase to 11.3%, from 9.8% the previous quarter. The Outer South East, which includes cities such as Brighton, Southampton and Oxford, was also one of the strongest English regions in 2021. London was again the weakest performer, with annual growth remaining at 4.2%. London was the only UK region to see lower annual price growth in 2021 than in 2020, as shown in the table below. The North West saw the strongest growth of the regions in northern England, with annual price growth of 11.2%, similar to the previous quarter. After such a strong year, house price growth is likely to slow in 2022, Nationwide says. House prices affordability has worsened since the pandemic began - with the stamp duty holiday having boosted prices over the last year, before it ended in September. Prices could also weaken if unemployment rises - with omicron already hurting hospitality businesses badly over the crucial Christmas break. But the outlook is uncertain, as chief economist Robert Gardner explains: “It appears likely that the housing market will slow next year, since the stamp duty holiday encouraged many to bring forward their house purchase in order to avoid additional tax. The Omicron variant could reinforce the slowdown if it leads to a weaker labour market. Even if wider economic conditions remain resilient, higher interest rates are likely to exert a cooling influence. Indeed, house price growth has outpaced income growth by a significant margin over the past 18 months and, as a result, housing affordability is already less favourable than before the pandemic struck. However, the outlook remains extremely uncertain. The strength of the market surprised in 2021 and could do so again in the year ahead. The market still has significant momentum and shifts in housing preferences as a result of the pandemic could continue to support activity and price growth. Indeed, the Omicron variant could serve to reinforce the shift in preferences in the near term. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK house prices have posted their strongest year since 2006, thanks to high demand, the stamp duty tax break, and a shortage of homes on the market. Lender Nationwide has reported that annual house price growth increased to 10.4% in December, up from 10.0% in November. That’s the fastest growth in a calendar year since 2006. Prices jumped by 1% in December. The price of a typical UK home has now hit £254,822 for the first time on Nationwide’s index. That’s an increase of nearly £24,000 over the year; the largest rise seen in a single year, in cash terms. Prices are now 16% higher than before the pandemic struck in early 2020, says Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist. “Demand has remained strong in recent months, despite the end of the stamp duty holiday at the end of September. Mortgage approvals for house purchase have continued to run above pre-pandemic levels, despite the surge in activity seen earlier in the year. Indeed, in the first 11 months of 2021 the total number of property transactions was almost 30% higher than over the same period of 2019. At the same time, the stock of homes on the market has remained extremely low throughout the year, which has contributed to the robust pace of price growth. Separate data from Halifax overnight has shown that the “race for space” between homebuyers has pushed up prices in some UK towns by about a fifth this year, with Taunton topping a list of areas with the biggest increases. Also coming up today European stock markets are set for a subdued start, as the surge in Omicron cases weighs on investors’ minds. Yesterday, the UK’s FTSE 100 hit a 22-month high, finally returning to its levels before the crash in February 2020 as trading resumed after the Christmas break. On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 index hit its 70th record close of 2021, as the traditional Santa Rally lifted stocks. Naeem Aslam of Avatrade says: Futures in the United States are trading flat, while those in Europe are down, and major stock market indices are on track to end the year on a high note. Investors are pleased that Santa Claus blessed the markets this year, allowing the Dow and S&amp;P 500 to close yesterday’s session at all-time highs. Overall, investors are overjoyed that we are ending 2021 on a high note after a brutal 2020. Although the appearance of the Omicron variant initially alarmed investors, the situation is now likely under control thanks to breakthrough COVID-19 vaccinations and a better understanding of the virus. However, the Federal Reserve’s aggressive tapering of quantitative easing measures to keep inflation in check could be a major factor driving volatility in stock markets in 2022.

          "bodyText": "Tesla has recalled close to half a million vehicles in the US to fix rear-view camera and trunk issues that the regulators said could increase the risk of crashes. The electric vehicle manufacturer is recalling 356,309 of its 2017-2020 Model 3 vehicles to address rearview camera issues and 119,009 of its Model S vehicles due to front hood problems. Opening and closing the trunk could damage the cables attaching the rearview mirror on the Model 3, according to filings issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model S recall relates to concerns about latches securing the vehicle’s front trunk (known as the frunk). “Unavailability of the rearview camera display may affect the driver’s rear view and increase the risk of a collision,” the NHTSA said. Tesla is not aware of any crashes, injuries, or deaths related to the issues with the recalled vehicles, the NHTSA said, and the company estimates that only 1% of the Model 3 vehicles will display the defect, compared to 14% of the recalled Model S vehicles. The recall is Tesla’s second run-in with NHTSA this month. The regulator announced before Christmas that it is investigating a report that Tesla vehicles allow people to play video games while driving. The issue was reported by Tesla vehicle owner Vince Patton, a 59-year-old retired broadcast journalist, who saw a YouTube video of a Tesla owner playing a video game on his touch-screen while the vehicle was moving. Patton replicated the video in an empty community college parking lot, activating the games Sky Force Reloaded and Solitaire. “I was just dumbfounded that, yes, sure enough, this sophisticated video game came up,” said Patton. “Somebody’s going to get killed,” he said. “It’s absolutely insane.” Tesla’s share price dropped close to 2% on the news.

          "bodyText": "Victoria Beckham’s fashion and beauty business remained lossmaking in 2020, as the former pop star, her husband David and other shareholders pumped in millions of pounds to keep it afloat during the pandemic. Sales fell 6% compared with a year earlier to £36m, according to accounts filed for Victoria Beckham Holdings (VBH), which owns the former Spice Girls member’s fashion business, as well as the majority stake in her beauty range, which launched in 2019. However, the company’s £6.8m pre-tax loss was less than half the £15.6m loss for 2019, which the company attributed to better management of its supply chain, and a new business model whereby the brand sold more of its goods directly to consumers. Sales of its high-end clothing slumped when UK Covid restrictions closed stores for several months of 2020, combined with a sharp fall in the number of international visitors to Britain. As a result, Beckham announced in July 2020 she was cutting about a fifth of staff at her fashion label, and was slashing by one-third the number of garments produced for each collection. Beckham faced criticism in 2020 for using public funds to furlough 30 staff at the start of the first Covid lockdown, despite her estimated net worth of £335m, a decision that was later reversed. VBH employed an average of 130 people during 2020, with annual staff costs reaching £9.3m. The highest-paid director earned £120,000 during the year after taking an 80% cut to their salary compared with a year earlier. During the 12 months to 31 December 2020, the company’s shareholders – which include the Beckhams and the private equity firm Neo Investment Partners – were required to provide £9.2m in loans to keep the business going during the early months of the pandemic, as well as repaying a bank loan from HSBC. Shareholders provided a further £600,000 in 2021. VBH forecast it would continue to rely on shareholders for financial support, amid continued economic uncertainty and a change in strategy, leading the firm’s auditors to express uncertainty over its ability to continue as a going concern. However, the group’s directors said they expected the Beckhams and other shareholders to carry on funding the company. The group reported the Victoria Beckham Beauty brand performed well during its first full year of trading, reaching £7.3m of sales in 2020 of its skincare and makeup range, including Posh Lipstick, which nods to Beckham’s nickname in the Spice Girls. During the past six months, Beckham’s fashion label has cut the price of its dresses by as much as 40%, using fewer embellished fabrics and simpler designs, in an attempt to widen its appeal."

          "headline": "How the pandemic transformed the world of work in 2021",
          "bodyText": "Of all the predictions on your 2021 bingo card, who had employees being fined for going into the office? Workers in Wales now face that threat since the tightening of Covid regulations amid the spread of the Omicron variant, with a possible £60 penalty for failing to work from home. That is just one of many examples of how the pandemic has transformed the world of work this year – and perhaps for ever – for city centre employers, their staff and the service industry that depends on them for trade. Out of office Most white-collar workers are ending 2021 back where they began – hunched over laptops on kitchen tables, in spare rooms or even garden sheds. Yet this deja vu obscures a big change: it has been demonstrated to many employers that staff can do productive work from home, a hotel room or even a poolside lounger in another country, and don’t necessarily need to be in a city centre office. As lockdown restrictions eased during the spring, many companies started to trial a hybrid model, permitting staff to split their time between the office and another location. Across a range of sectors, many of the UK’s largest office occupiers have shifted to this middle-way working pattern, from the big four accountancy firms to major tech companies. Deloitte’s 20,000 UK employees were told in June they could decide “when, where and how they work” following the success of remote working during Covid. Very few large corporates now expect staff to return to their desks for five days a week, with the exception of some major investment banks, who have been the loudest proponents of the return-to-office mantra. The end of the space race Remote working in 2021 also offered companies a chance to downsize their offices and slash their rent bills. Capita, one of the major providers of outsourced services to the UK government, announced in the spring it would close more of its offices to make bigger cost savings. Sir Martin Sorrell’s advertising and marketing firm, S4 Capital, told investors in the summer it had “terminated a number of office leases”, adding it was developing its hybrid office model to suit its workers, who it described as “digital natives”. Meanwhile NatWest said it expects just 13% of its 64,000 staff to work full time in its offices in future. A third of the bank’s employees will be allowed to live and work anywhere in the UK and will only have to attend a NatWest building twice a month. Winners and losers Working parents, people with caring responsibilities, and some disabled workers are among those who have welcomed the widespread shift to flexible working, which they have long demanded. However, employment experts warn that, without proper monitoring, the switch could worsen workplace gender inequality. Traditionally, more women have requested flexible working than men, and analysts caution that employers will have to ensure that those who attend the office less frequently do not miss out on opportunities for promotion. A fifth (22%) of workers worry home working could affect their promotion prospects, according to a recent survey for stockbroker AJ Bell. The poll also found the burden of childcare among home workers still falls disproportionately on mothers, with more than a third (36%) of women with children under 16 reporting they do the lion’s share of childcare during work hours, compared with 19% of men. There is also concern about the effect on pay. Evie, an executive assistant from Essex who did not want to give her surname, has enjoyed working from home, but said she was being offered lower salaries by prospective employers than before the pandemic. “It’s been said to me in an interview [the salary was lower] because I’d be working from home and wouldn’t have to commute,” she said. “It’s definitely a game a few employers are playing. They’ll get you to sign the contract, but when restrictions change and we go back to the office, I know they won’t put the money up.” The working week Once the slow and steady return to the office began in the spring, it became clear that workers were ditching their commute on Mondays and Fridays. In a national trend, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday became the busiest days of the week for office visits, according to regular analysis during 2021 by real estate consultancy Remit Consulting. “The pattern so far during the pandemic has been for Thursdays to be as busy as Wednesdays, and sometimes busier,” said Lorna Landells of Remit Consulting, adding that Friday was slipping behind as an office day. If this change becomes permanent, it will have lasting implications for transport companies and the city-centre service businesses – from sandwich shops and coffee bars to hairdressers and dry-cleaners – who depend on passing trade. Some companies and some countries – including the governments of Spain and Scotland – are considering going further, and taking a fresh look at four-day week through pilot schemes. Durham-based online bank Atom is one of the few employers which has taken the leap. It moved all of its 400 staff to a four-day week, with no change in salary, at the start of November. The company said its operations and customer service have not been impacted by the change, although it had seen a 500% surge in job applications. “Our adoption of a four-day working week has been a huge success, and we are proud of how well our employees have adapted,” said Anne-Marie Lister, Atom’s chief people officer. “We firmly believe that a four-day week is the future of work for many.” Staff walkout For some, the future of work means handing in their notice. In what has been termed “the great resignation”, more than a quarter of workers reported they were actively planning to change jobs in the coming months. Having stayed in posts where they were unhappy during the height of the pandemic, employees have begun to look for new roles, according to a survey of 6,000 workers by the recruitment firm Randstad UK. Others have been spurred on to look for a new employer by high levels of job vacancies and higher pay offers from those desperate to recruit. For now, power looks to be in the hands of employees – not their employers – and they know what they want: more flexibility about where and when they work. Many will benefit from a better work-life balance, but the repercussions for city centres and society will be felt for some time to come."

          "bodyText": "And with that, we are going to end Thursday’s blog. Before we go, let’s recap the big stories from today: NSW recorded 12,226 new Covid cases and one death, Victoria 5,137 cases and 13 deaths, Tasmania 92 cases, Queensland 2,222, the ACT 253, South Australia 1,374, the Northern Territory 37 and Western Australia one. The national total was 21,343 new cases. A child under two who was Covid-positive died in South Australia. Ghislaine Maxwell was found guilty after sex-trafficking trial in New York. The federal health minister, Greg Hunt, told people to “avoid the mosh pit” this New Year’s Eve amid rising cases. The independent expert group OzSage released a set of Covid policy recommendations, saying it was “deeply concerned” by the spike in case numbers. The federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, took aim at the prime minister, Scott Morrison, over the shortage of rapid antigen tests. Old Parliament House was set alight by protests linked to “sovereign citizen” groups. The prime minister said Omicron was a “game changer” after national cabinet met. National cabinet agreed on a new definition of “close contact” and said Covid testing centres would provide rapid antigen tests. The PM also said free rapid antigen tests will only be provided for those who meet “close contact” criteria. More than 50% of eligible people have had their booster shot. Tasmania announced it would drop PCR tests for interstate arrivals. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, said WA agreed “in principle” to national cabinet’s new definition of close contact. Another act pulled out of Sydney festival over Israeli embassy sponsorship. And that is it! We will see you tomorrow for the last blog on the last day of the year. And we have a statement from the prime minister, Scott Morrison, about the national cabinet meeting. Here are some lines from it: Omicron case numbers continue to increase in Australia and globally. Omicron continues to show greater infectivity than the Delta variant, but with less severity. Prof Kelly noted that a recent study from South Africa has confirmed a 73% reduction in severity of disease with Omicron compared with Delta. Total active cases in Australia have reached over 110,000 cases. However, hospitalisation, ICU and ventilation case numbers remain low and within anticipated capacity. There were 1,481 cases in hospital, 122 cases in ICU with 51 of those requiring ventilation. These numbers are remaining relatively constant. National cabinet has agreed to Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) advice to reset TTIQ in the context of high case numbers and the Omicron variant, so that Australians can continue to live with Covid-19. The revised approach is complementary to the importance of vaccinations including boosters and existing public health and social measures. Specifically, national cabinet agreed to revised definitions for who is a close contact, how they are isolated and testing arrangements. The Australian Medical Association has released a statement following the national cabinet decision to adopt a new definition of who is a close contact. The AMA president, Dr Omar Khorshid, said narrowing the definition to household contacts will lock in very high transmission rates and accelerate the outbreak of Omicron. “We will miss so many more cases with this new, more narrow definition of a close contact,” Khorshid said. “Anyone catching Omicron in a restaurant or pub for example and who are asymptomatic won’t know they’re infected and could pass the virus on to more vulnerable people. “The change will help to preserve testing capacity and should limit the number of furloughed health workers, but it will come at the cost of accelerating the outbreak.” Khorshid said hospitalisations would rise in the coming weeks because of the high case numbers. The AMA called for the release of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee’s (AHPPC) advice and modelling that supports the national cabinet decision. “Without the release of AHPPC’s advice, it is very difficult for us to share the prime minister’s confidence that this move will assist in keeping Australians safe and healthy.” Cricket referee David Boon will be out of action for the Sydney Test after testing positive for Covid. In a statement, Cricket Australia announced Boon was in hotel quarantine: The ICC match referee for the Vodafone men’s Ashes series, David Boon, has tested positive to Covid-19 following a PCR test,” the statement read. Steve Bernard, a member of the International Panel of ICC Referees and based in NSW, will take over as match referee for the fourth Ashes Test match, starting on January 5 at the SCG. It is anticipated that David Boon will return to the role for the fifth Test in Hobart, starting on January 14. He is asymptomatic and fully vaccinated, including having a booster. Boon will remain in Melbourne and in line with Victorian state government health guidelines will continue quarantining for 10 days. Opera Australia’s much-loved New Year’s Eve performance of La Bohème is cancelled due to a Covid outbreak. In a statement, CEO Fiona Allan said: Enormous thanks to everyone at the company who have worked tirelessly, trying everything possible to get us back on stage but I don’t think any of us could have foreseen just how fast Omicron would spread and the effects it would have on the industry. As disappointing as this news is, both for our performers and for our audiences who we know were very much looking forward to attending NYE, we must now turn our full attention to opening the summer season on Tuesday 4 January. Opera Australia is contacting New Year’s Eve ticket holders, who have paid upwards of $269 a seat, to offer credit vouchers and full refunds. On Wednesday, Guardian Australia learned there were more than 20 positive Covid cases at Opera Australia across the performing company. Opera Australia is scheduled to present full seasons of La Bohème, Turandot, Otello, The Marriage of Figaro and La Juive from 4 January-26 March. Here’s yesterday’s story: More sporting fixtures have fallen victim to the surge in Covid infections, the latest being Thursday’s Big Bash League meeting of the Perth Scorchers and the Melbourne Stars in Melbourne, because of a positive case in the Stars camp. Saturday’s A-League Men’s game between Western Sydney Wanderers and Western United has also been called off, as has the A-League Women’s match between Melbourne City and Newcastle Jets, scheduled for Sunday. The A-Leagues said in a statement an unspecified number of City players had tested positive but were not feeling unwell, while the cases causing the men’s postponement were in the Western United squad. Despite a rash of cancellations the governing body continues to insist the season will continue. When’s a good time to release some bad data... how about the eve of New Year’s Eve? So today, the Queensland government has published the delayed Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) that covers land clearing for the 2018-19 year. During those 12 months, landholders cleared 680,688 hectares. It’s a bit tricky to compare with previous years – such as the 392,000 hectares reported cleared in 2017-18 – as the remote technology has been improved. Still, it appears that Queensland is clearing a lot of land. The 2018-19 tally amounts to about 3,800 times the size of Melbourne’s CBD, or more than 2,400 times Sydney’s. “This report is a carbon bomb that threatens to blow up the commitments to net zero emissions by 2050 made by the Queensland and Australian governments,” Dr Stuart Blanch, WWF-Australia conservation scientist, said in a statement. “It shows clearing has likely been significantly under-reported in previous reports. The latest SLATS data was compiled using satellite images that are three times more accurate than the previous imagery and cover much more of the state. The data provides a new national best-practice standard that all governments and industry should adopt,” Blanch said. To give the amount some context, Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory estimated landclearing in the 2018 calendar year was about 370,000 hectares nationwide. In that year, the commonwealth government also claimed the land sector was a net sink in the order of more than 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide. As Guardian Australia reported a couple of months ago, there is good reason to think Australia’s statistics underestimate the amount of landclearing that is going on. Today’s figures from Queensland are only going to add to those concerns. Another act has withdrawn from the 2022 Sydney festival in protest against Israeli embassy sponsorship. Today the intercultural dance company Marrugeku pulled its performance of Jurrungu Ngan-ga [Straight Talk] out of the festival program. The company put out the following statement: We took this decision in light of Sydney festival’s actions to seek and retain funding from the state of Israel. It is our responsibility to ensure that the strong voices within Jurrungu Ngan-ga: First Nations Australians, people seeking asylum alongside allied settler artists from diverse backgrounds, can perform with clear liyan (spirit and wellbeing). It is critical that the dancers will be heard, particularly in these circumstances as Jurrungu Ngan-ga embodies the essence of solidarity. The company added: With that in mind we respectfully ask that the festival review their decision to return the funding for the sake of community harmony, the cultural safety of artists and the benefit of our audiences. The show will still run at Carriageworks from 26-29 January, just not under the umbrella of the festival. Tickets issued through festival will be cancelled and refunded by the festival, and punters can secure new tickets here. As Guardian Australia has previously reported, a number of acts have pulled out of Sydney festival over the $20,000 sponsorship deal with the Israeli embassy to stage a production of the Israeli choreographer Ohad Naharin’s Decadance by the Sydney Dance Company. The protests have been backed by a coalition of Arab and pro-Palestinian organisations (including the Arab Australian Federation, Greens for Palestine, Independent Australian Jewish Voices, Jews against the Occupation Sydney, the Sydney representative for BDS and United Australian Palestinian Workers) and assorted artists and academics. Yesterday Karla Dickens pulled her work Return To Sender out of the festival. Other artists to have withdrawn include Blake prize-winning artist Khaled Sabsabi, Malyangapa and Barkindji rapper Barkaa, South Asian dance company Bindi Bosses, the Arab Theatre Studio, the Bankstown poetry slam and journalist Amy McQuire. Here is a breakdown of all the new cases today: NSW recorded 12,226 cases Victoria recorded 5,137 cases Queensland recorded 2,222 new cases South Australia recorded 1374 new cases Tasmania recorded 94 new cases The ACT recorded 252 new cases The Northern Territory recorded 37 new cases Western Australia recorded one new case The national total for Thursday: 21,343 new cases. ACT chief minister Andrew Barr has released a statement after nat cab. Here are a few lines about rapid antigen tests from it: NSW will provide around 1 million RATs at cost to the ACT from 17 January 2022. We have more RATs on order to respond to the evolution of testing arrangements in the context of higher case numbers and community transmission. National cabinet has also agreed to work on a concessional RAT supply arrangement to provided highly subsidised tests to low-income households. Further details will be provided in the coming weeks. Victoria has closed some testing sites because of the heat. McGowan is asked if WA will adopt the new close contact definition before 5 February. He says: In this morning’s meeting there is wide acceptance, in particular from the prime minister, that Western Australia is different. And we don’t have large numbers of cases. In fact, we have one case today. NSW had 11,000. So we are in a very, very different position to the other states. Which is why our testing, tracing isolation and quarantines ystems are all still working. Overthere, they have all collapsed. So that’s why we are able to hopefully eliminate this, because our systems are still working. And so we will adopt those rules around close contacts at some point in time in the future when necessary, if we get to high caseloads. So that’s the agreement of the meeting this morning. Obviously it wouldn’t be, in my view, it wouldn’t be before February 5. McGowan says the positive case in now in hotel quarantine. He is a 27-year-old male backpacker. He’s a close contact of an existing case. He shared a bathroom with that person. He is not vaccinated. It’s believed he was infectious in the community. So therefore there is a range of exposure sites we have published already, and probably more will be published shortly. McGowan: Looking forward, if we keep getting vaccinated, getting our third doses, if we learn the lessons from other jurisdictions that have allowed the virus to spread, it means we will be in the best possible position to safely reconnect with the rest of the world. Everyone wants to move forward and move forward safely. If we stick together do the right thing by each other, by checking in, getting vaccinated, following the public health advice, we will all get through this. McGowan: At a point in the future if we need to move to the national settings, that is what we will do. But like I have always said, WA is in the best possible position because we can monitor the situation in other states, learn from it, and ensure WA is best placed to transition and ease border controls at the right time. It’s a concerning time right now around the country. Everyone is ready – sorry, everyone is ready for this pandemic to be over. But it’s showing no signs of slowing down. We have asked a lot from the public over the past two years in order to rise to the challenge in terms of behaviour, vaccination and, frankly, patience. And I can understand why some would be tired, especially after the boiling hot week that we’ve had. But there is light at the end of the tunnel. If we can eliminate this outbreak, we can get back to the way of life we have enjoyed without any public health restrictions for the rest of the school holidays, hopefully – something I think we would all enjoy. McGowan is now talking about national cabinet. Today’s meeting addressed a range of issues, specifically an updated definition of close contacts and the future use of rapid antigen tests. It was widely acknowledged at the meeting that Western Australia is in a very different position compared to other states and territories. That becomes more and more obvious each and every day. While WA has agreed in principle with the changes to testing and close contacts, these new settings will only be implemented in Western Australia at a later stage. To be clear, the settings agreed at national cabinet today are for jurisdictions with a high-caseload environment, with thousands of daily cases. Western Australia is not in that position. McGowan is announcing an assistance package for businesses and artists impacted. Firstly small businesses impacted by the public health measures will soon be able to apply for a grant of up to $12,500. Sole traders will also be eligible for a grant up to $4,400. Those one-off grants are open to eligible businesses, including creative and performing arts, catering, rental and hiring services, and other hospitality businesses. These businesses will need to demonstrate a reduction in turnover of at least 30% compared to the same 11-day period from last year. Nightclubs that have been forced to close are eligible for a one-off $20,000 grant. McGowan says 26,696 vaccines were administered yesterday. This was pushed by a spike in visitors to state-run clinics, particularly for third doses. Which we know is very important in the fight against Omicron. Yesterday’s surge in vaccinations means 92% of our population aged 12 or above have now had their third dose. And 84% have had two doses over 12. These numbers are very encouraging. Remember as soon as you were eligible for your third dose you should immediately get it done. McGowan: Yesterday we did 5,181 Covid tests. As of this morning, 720 close contacts in total have been identified, 40 of whom are yet to be tested. Of the 40 yet to be tested, 31 were patrons from the Perth mess hall event. As I said yesterday, a number of attendees will not be able to be located by WA police, due to false or misleading contact information provided. In addition, 488 casual contacts have now been identified, with 328 yet to be tested. If you have been identified as a close or casual contact or if you have been to an exposure site, especially the Perth mess hall event, we need you to come forward immediately. We need you to do the right thing and get tested now. Premier Mark McGowan: I can advise that overnight WA has recorded one new local case of Covid-19. That case is a 27-year-old male backpacker. So far we know he was a close contact of an existing case. He shared a bathroom with that person. That man is not vaccinated. It is believed he has been infectious in the community, so therefore there are further exposure sites. These are Dominos pizza East Fremantle on December 28. BP on Queen Victoria Street, in Fremantle on December 28. Portside Boulders climbing gym in O’Connor on December 27. And farmer Jack Spearwood on December 26. Specific times and further exposure sites will be released publicly as soon as possible. We are now jumping over to WA. Visitors to Tasmania will no longer need a PCR test to enter the state from January 1 onwards. Travellers will have to return a negative RAT test 24 hours prior to travel to Tasmania. Fyles: There is two more cases associated with a birthday party event in Darwin on December 23. So yesterday I reported on a nine-year-old girl that had tested positive. And so these two other cases attended that same event in Darwin on December 23. There is four more cases where I don’t have the details. The contact tracing is under way. They are today’s cases and I want to reiterate we saw a significant increase in the test number – 3,600 versus 1,600 yesterday. We have 37 cases in the NorthernTerritory reported in the last 24 hours. So it is disappointing to have 37 cases but the good news is that that rate of spread is still low in terms of those positive cases. Fyles: Eight cases are household contacts of a case that we reported from Christmas Day in Katherine. All of those contacts I understand were in isolation. One of the cases is a known household contact from Tennant Creek – a female in her 20s. So those cases are the eight and the one from Tennant Creek are linked to our ‘regional cluster’ that we’re referring to it as, and that takes the total number for that cluster to 163 cases. Additionally, we have a number of cases. I will provide some details on them to Territorians. One of them is a worker in the centre for national resilience. But they are the contact of an interstate traveller. So a household contact has recently returned from interstate and the cause of that transmission is under investigation. One of them is a nurse at Royal Darwin Hospital and we have contact tracing under way for that case. Two of them are US marines that recently arrived at Robertson barracks from Queensland. Additionally we have a worker that is at the Groote Eylandt mine that arrived into the Territory yesterday. I understand and we have been able to identify the close contacts in that case. There is eight other cases which are interstate arrivals into the Northern Territory. And there is a further nine cases which are household contacts of recent interstate arrivals. We are just jumping to the Northern Territory, where health minister Natasha Fyles says there are 37 new cases. Before I go to the details around those cases, I need to notify Territorians we have seen a significant increase in testing in the last 24 hours. We saw 3,625 tests conducted in the territory. Yesterday’s figures were reported against around 1,600 tests. So we have seen more than double the tests and that accounts for this increase in cases. Some big changes ahead. To recap: Leaders at nat cab have agreed to revise the definition of a close contact. So that is now someone who has been more than four hours with a confirmed positive case in a house, accommodation or care-facility setting. The states can determine exceptional circumstances where more people have to isolate - so, suspected super-spreader events. Positive cases have to isolate for seven days, with a test on day six. Close contacts have to isolate for seven days and have a PCR test if they are symptomatic. A close contact who is asymptomatic must have a rapid antigen test. Lastly, the PM was asked if he had a response to the protests this morning and the damage to Old Parliament House. I am disgusted and appalled by behaviour that would see Australians come and set fire to such a symbol of democracy in this country. I just think it is appalling and I think it is disgraceful, and I think that the authorities should act swiftly in accordance to the law and people should face consequences of their actions. This is not justified. This is not how Australia works. We have a rule of law in this country and people should obey it. And as we come into this New Year and as we reflect on many things of the past 12 months, it has been a tough year for so many Australians, and we still think of the six families in Tasmania. It has been really tough, but we live in one of the greatest countries in the world. We enjoy freedoms here. We enjoy a healthcare system. We enjoy freedoms that few countries enjoy to the same extent that we do and have over such a long period of time. So, while Australia has had a tough year, there is still a lot to celebrate by the simple fact that we are Australians and we live in Australia. Frewen reminds people that the booster eligibility has been brought forward. We went from six months to five months and that brought a number of million extra people back in, and as I have said, on the first of January we go from 4.1 million to 7.6 million. That is a large amount of people in a very short space of time, but the numbers are progressing well, and we will ramp up to January. Both New South Wales and Victoria, have committed to getting their clinics back up to 300,000 doses a week, which is where we were at the height of the rollout. So once we get nationally back up to the high levels ... we will get through people. Reporter: 43% of those eligible for boosters have not had their boosters yet? Morrison: The rate of dosage for boosters is running at six times the rate of first doses when we started, and at around twice the rate of second doses, so the booster rate is actually running significantly faster than we have seen in the last two doses of the vaccination program. I also make this point: that when someone becomes eligible, that does not mean that they are overdue, OK? I would encourage people to do it as soon as hey can, but by the end of January, general, we will have close to 16 million people. You can’t vaccinate 16 million people on one day, but there is no shortage of vaccines. There is 20 million vaccines here in Australia. That is enough to boost 80% of the Australian population, and more coming over the course of the first half of this year, so there is no shortage of supply. This is why we, again, stressed today the need to get the state clinics up and running and that is exactly what they are doing, and to get ourselves off at the world record rates we had in October – when we were running at 300,000 a day on some occasions – that is where we want to get back to. But to do that you need all cylinders firing. General John Frewen is asked by Guardian Australia’s Daniel Hurst about the booster rollout in aged care facilities. Frewen says: We have been focused on aged care facilities, and of the slightly over 2,500 aged care facilities at the moment, we have done already a visit to about 1,500 of those. The eligibility has shifted, of course, so more have become due this year. Some of them are scheduled in January. We are now trying to move them to 1 January. The remainder will fall in the second half of January and we are well engaged with the vaccine providers to get them all scheduled in the second half... Hurst: Does that mean 1,000 aged care facilities have not been visited for boosters yet? Frewen: They had not been eligible so they are becoming eligible now and we have plans in place to visit them as soon as possible. Kelly is asked if these changes will accelerate the outbreak. We will have more cases. There is no doubt about that. This is a way of coping with that last caseload. It is about using the resources we have wisely, and I will leave others to their own opinion. Morrison is asked if he can ensure these changes won’t result in more lives lost. He says: I am confident that this is the best way to manage the Omicron pandemic. That is what I am confident about. Reporter: What personal responsibility will you take? Morrison: It is the same that I have taken all through this pandemic as prime minister. Every single day, when I first stood before you here, and Australia was one of the first countries in the world to call it the pandemic – two weeks before the World Health Organisation. Each and every day I have focused on this pandemic to ensure that we have got the best possible settings that we can have, so I do take responsibility for the decisions we have taken I do take responsibility for the fact that Australia has one of the lowest death rates in the world, that we have one of the strongest economies coming through the pandemic, and we, indeed, have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world. These are all of my responsibilities. Morrison is asked about people struggling to get a rapid antigen test. If you are not symptomatic and not a close contact, then go home. That is the first way. That is the first way to be able to ensure that we keep those queues down. In terms of the supplies in the private market, in pharmacies and shops, supermarkets and places like that, what is important is they have the certainty that they know that governments aren’t all of a sudden going to go round and start providing these free to anybody and everybody. We will be providing them only where it is recommended to us that they need to be provided... for our aged care workers or in those high-risk settings, or indeed what we hope to arrange for schooling when we go back to school next year. Otherwise, people can go get those in the private market. Morrison is asked about NYE. The prime minister says: What I would like people to do tomorrow night is enjoy the evening. I would like them to be looking forward into 2022 and looking forward confidently. Because Australia’s feature is bright. What I would like people to do tomorrow night is exercise common sense and follow all the normal precautions that we have been talking about. We have been living with this virus now and the virus has been around us now for two years. And we understand a lot more about it than we previously did and we understand how it is transferred. I would expect people to show appropriate caution, commonsense, treat each other with a sort of respect for their health, as well in terms of how they are engaging with them, and enjoy a beautiful, hopefully, summer evening all around the country as we move from 2021 into 2022. Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly says that “the booster program is absolutely crucial” to fighting the virus. The second one is public health and social measures. Wearing masks, as you all are today, that is very important, one of the other things that are in place and are a matter for the states and territories. The third one is tests, trace, isolate and quarantine ... And make sure that those people that are the closest contacts are getting rapidly diagnosed, rapidly isolating and therefore protecting the rest of the community. That is the absolute key piece. Morrison is asked what pressure these changes might put on the hospital system. He says: What we’re dealing with is a different variant that has a high volume with lower severity illness. And we have done endless rounds of modelling over the last many months about the impacts on the hospital system. And so it really does become an issue of the proportion of total number of cases that end up in serious illnes, that put pressure on hospital system. And these are the issues that of course are being worked through the medical expert panel and the chief medical officer. What I want to make very clear today is the definition we have adopted today has actually come forward from the chief medical officer, which I strongly agree with. It is a practical definition to deal with the circumstances of the new period and maximise the resources we have available to deal with a pandemic. We have significant resources to do that, more than most countries around the world. Hence why we have one of the best responses and outcomes from Covid anywhere in the world. Morrison is asked about the Therapeutic Goods Administration approving rapid antigen tests. He says: As I said yesterday, that we have current applicants who have had their products withdrawn by the FDA in the United States. There will be some who will be out there selling their wares. The only way they will have anything approved by the TGA is if they comply with the requirements of the TGA, they provide the data that the TGA insists on providing. There are a number of applicants who haven’t provided that. And of course you wouldn’t expect them to be approved in those circumstances. Morrison is back up: What is in South Australia, I want to stress, while they are adopting the definition of close contact from midnight tonight, they are continuing with a 10-day rule in South Australia. Nothing is further changing on the isolation arrangement in South Australia, but the definition of a close contact is, as I have said today. In relation, something Lieutenant General Frewen just mentioned, just because someone becomes eligible for a booster does not mean that if they have not had a booster by that day they are overdue. That is something that has been pedalled out there which is not accurate, it is not true. You become eligible from a particular date. And from that date, we encourage people to go and have the booster. Frewen says there are 16 million doses of mRNA vaccines sitting in storage. There will of course be areas where demand outstrips the immediate ordering. And we continue to work with all of the providers to get either urgent deliveries to them or work local redistribution. We urge any [one] who is running low on supply, please contact the vaccine operation centre and we will make sure we get additional vaccine to you as quickly as we can. January will be a big month. General John Frewen is up: As of yesterday, 2.3 million of the 3.9 million eligible people have had their boosters, which represents around 57%. There were 149,000 vaccines administered yesterday ... Pleasingly, 60,000 of those vaccines were delivered through pharmacies, which is a record for pharmacies – the first day that pharmacists have delivered more than GPs. Kelly says the good news is that the virus is less severe: The other key element of this is we need to protect our PCR testing for where the best bang for buck is. We have seen over the last week an increase in the positivity rate from around 1%, which is what we have seen throughout the pandemic, to almost 5%, and even higher in some states. That demonstrates to me that we are not getting to the people that we need to get to, in terms of PCR testing, hence that risk-based approach for who we want to come forward for PCR testing. Chief medical officer Prof Paul Kelly: It is a different virus, very different from previous versions of the virus we have seen over the last two years. What is the difference? We know it is very transmissible – it is at least as transmissible as Delta. And is transmitting fast in the community, as we have seen – 110,000 active cases now in Australia, and that is continuing to rise. I expect will continue to rise ... It is less severe. I think that is becoming very clear now. We have had good news overnight, there was a paper that I read from South Africa, which is a different country to us in various ways, but they have had the longest and most extensive experience of this particular form of the Covid-19 virus, the Omicron variant. They are seeing a 73% decrease in severity. And that is becoming very clear now, in terms of their measures of severity with this virus. That is similar to what we’re seeing in Australia. Morrison says nat cab is trying to get the balance right. That is with Omicron, we cannot have hundreds of thousands of Australians or more taken out of circulation based on rules that were set for the Delta variant. We need rules for the Omicron variant, so that we can keep our economy working and get people in jobs, we can keep Australia open, and we can focus the resources that we have on the tasks that are most urgent. At the end of the day, get your booster, monitor your symptoms, check in where you are going and use common sense to manage your health responsibly and that of your family. Morrison says there are some changes to isolation requirements for healthcare workers at next week’s national cabinet meeting. In addition, we will be looking at the issue of concessional access in the private market to rapid antigen tests, working with the states and territories on that issue. They are responsible for the rapid antigen test that are being distributed in their testing centres; the commonwealth looks after aged care and a number of high-risk settings. We will continue to do that. Specific orders are in place and stocks are on the way here to a number of the states, including the federal government. Morrison says some vulnerable groups will still be able to access them. Where possible, particularly for vulnerable groups, we would seek to do those through the pharmacy network and through the private network, and that would bedone through a registration system similar to how we manage things like the PBS and things of that nature which pharmacy is very used to dealing with. But for all other casual uses, you would just like to get a test or something like that, well, that is what the private market is for. Morrison says the RATs will be free only if you meet the criteria. Anyone else who would like to get a rapid antigen test, well, go to your pharmacy or the supermarket or the warehouse, big suppliers, where, we believe – as a result of making this change and being very clear about who is being provided with a public test and who is not, all the private industry who gave us that advice this week – they can go now. They can book their supplies, they can get them on the shelves and not have any concern that, somehow, a new policy will come in and tests will be handed out to anyone who wants one. It was agreed today that will not be the policy in Australia. Rapid antigen tests will be provided publicly at those testing centres for those who require one according to the rules that I have set down, and we have taken out of national cabinet today. Morrison says he knows this is a big change to how we have rolled the last two years. I know this is a bit different to what you have been hearing over the last couple of years. That is the gearchange. That is the reset. That is what we need people to really understand, and I know it is a change from what has been said, but dealing with Delta is very different to dealing with a Omicron, and to ensure that our public health systems work as effectively to keep as many people are safe as possible, that is why we need to make this change. Morrison says this will reduce the pressure on testing centres. Which means we will be able to increase the turnaround time of these tests, getting results back to those who need to take them. In addition to that, it will also free up, we hope, a lot more workforce that is currently being focused on these tests to be able to be supporting the other priorities for managing the pandemic. In particular, the boosting clinics and centres or administering the vaccine. Morrison says RATs will be provided at testing centres. We will transfer over the next few weeks from PCR to these rapid antigen tests with, at the state testing centres, over the next couple of weeks. Some large states will be moving to get those rapid antigen tests to those testing centres as soon as they can and that will happen over the next few days and the next few weeks. If you are eligible for a rapid antigen test and there is one stay at that time, you will be given one. You will go home, take it and follow those rules. If that is not a rapid antigen test there then we will still give you a PCR test in the transition. Morrison says if that’s not you - do not go and get tested. If you don’t fulfil this definition of a close contact then there is no need for you to be in that line. You should go home. Goto the beach, go and do what you want to do. Read a book in the park. Follow all the normal, common sense things that you would do, monitor your symptoms, follow the Covid-safe practices, make sure you have booked for your booster, do all of those sorts of things but there is no need for you to be in that line. Morrison: So, to summarise, if you are a confirmed case, seven days. On the sixth day, you have a rapid antigen test and if that is [negative] after seven days, you can go back into the community. If you are a close contact, you get a rapid antigen test. If that returns a negative, you still remain in isolation for those seven days and you have a rapid antigen test again on day six. If you are a close contact and you are symptomatic, go and get a PCR test. If you are a close contact that returns a positive rights test, go and get a PCR test. Morrison: So, if you are symptomatic, and that goes for anyone who is symptomatic, by the way, if you are symptomatic, then at the right test is a PCR test. A close contact who is asymptomatic does not have symptoms, must have a rapid antigen test, and if positive, they must then have a PCR test. In that case, they become a confirmed case and the rules that apply to confirmed cases apply to them. Now, close contacts that return a negative test, they must remain isolated for those seven days because symptoms and other things can present later. And that is seven days from their date of exposure to the person who is a confirmed case, and they also will have a rapid antigen test on day six. Morrison: Now, a confirmed case would isolate for seven days from the date. So someone who actually has Covid, from the date that they took the test, they would have to isolate for seven days and have a negative rapid test, a rapid antigen test, on day six, prior to being able to leave isolation after seven days. A close contact that is symptomatic must have a PCR test, still. The definition is as follows: Similar to what I said to you yesterday -except in exceptional circumstances, a close contact is a household contact, or household like, of a confirmed case only. A household contact is someone who lives with a case or hasn’t spent more than four hours with them in our house, accommodation or care facility setting. So, you are only a close contact if you are, effectively, living with someone or have been in an accommodation setting with someone for more than four hours with someone who has actually got Covid - is not someone who is in contact with someone who has had Covid. Nat cab has agreed on a new definition for close contact with some states chnaging that now while others will follow. It will come into effect in New Wales, Victoria, Queensland, SouthAustralia and here in the ACT. Tasmania will follow on the 1 January, and the Northern Territory and Western Australia will be making announcements, particularly the Northern Territory, in the next few days to confirm how they will be moving to these new definitions. Morrison says national cabinet has agreed on “very practical way forward” that recognises that states and territories are in different stages. There is increasing evidence of reduced severity of overgrown, which is welcome news. Today there are 122 people in ICU and there are 51 people on ventilators, actually less than the number I mentioned to you yesterday. We are saying that the severity of this illness, the impact, particularly on those in hospital, in the most extreme illness situations, is remaining relatively constant, and that is an experience we are seeing in other countries as well. When’s a good time to release some bad data? How about the eve of New Year’s Eve? So today the Queensland government has published the delayed statewide landcover and trees study (SLATS) that covers land clearing for the 2018-19 year. During those 12 months, landholders cleared 680,688 hectares. It’s a bit tricky to compare with previous years – such as the 392,000 hectares reportedly cleared in 2017-18 – as the remote technology has been improved. Still, it appears that Queensland is clearing a lot of land. The 2018-19 tally amounts to about 3800 times the size of Melbourne’s CBD, or more than 2,400 times Sydney’s. “This report is a carbon bomb that threatens to blow up the commitments to net zero emissions by 2050 made by the Queensland and Australian governments,” Dr Stuart Blanch, a WWF-Australia conservation scientist, said in a statement. It shows clearing has likely been significantly under-reported in previous reports. The latest SLATS data was compiled using satellite images that are three times more accurate than the previous imagery and cover much more of the state. The data provides a new national best-practice standard that all governments and industry should adopt. To give the amount some context, Australia’s national greenhouse gas inventory estimated land clearing in 2018 calendar year was about 370,000 hectares nationwide. In that year, the commonwealth government also claimed the land sector was a net sink in the order of more than 20m tonnes of carbon dioxide. As Guardian Australia reported a couple of months ago, there is good reason to think Australia’s statistics underestimate the amount of land clearing that is going on. Today’s figures from Queensland are only going to add to those concerns. Scott Morrison says: Omicron is a game changer. It has been in the country for just over a month. We have taken the care to ensure that we are understanding it as best we can, examining the impact on our hospital system to ensure we are recalibrating in the right way so Australia can continue to live with this virus. OK we are jumping to the PM now. Finally, Marshall says there was a “large discussion” at national cabinet regarding the use of rapid antigen tests. All states agreed to transition away from PCR tests and towards rapid antigen tests: It is fair to say that there are increasing numbers now coming into Australia. No state will be giving these away free of charge. This is completely against public health advice, except in circumstances with particularly vulnerable communities. Some states spoke about there might be a particularly vulnerable cohort that they want to administer these to in a reasonably rapid period of time. But we all agreed that we will be making a transition to more people using the rapid antigen tests and getting out of the lineups for a PCR test. Marshall says two-thirds of all the people lining up for PCR tests in South Australia are asymptomatic. These people, really, quite frankly, should not be in the line unless they were close contacts of somebody who was a positive case. We really do want to free-up our capacity for testing for those people who have symptoms and over the next 24-48 hours we will look at putting new directions in place to make it very clear to every single person in South Australia that we really want to test people that have symptoms or are close contacts of those people that have symptoms. So just a bit of advance warning that we will be significantly tightening up on that. Marshall says the national cabinet also discussed the time close contacts and positive cases should isolate. As of the next 24-48 hours, South Australia will move to 10 days for people who are Covid-positive and seven days for those people who are close contacts. If they are unvaccinated, it will remain at 14 days. Marshall turns to the national cabinet. He says three critical things were discussed - the first being the standard definition of what a close contact is: Now, you might recall if we go back several months ago, we were very, very keen to get everybody that was a close contact or a casual contact into isolation to stop the spread. We were pursuing, at that point, an elimination strategy so that we did not put our state into lockdown, like we saw in New South Wales, in Victoria and the ACT. We have a completely different strategy [now]. It is completely different variants, and we are in a very, very different stage at the moment, so we are looking to suppress the transmission of this disease, and take the appropriate action for this stage of this particular variant. Today, we agreed that we would, very significantly, narrow the definition of a close contact. This will, essentially, [mean] the people who are a household or intimate contact with a positive case. And also, each state will look at exceptions, or exceptional circumstances, in their state. South Australia has recorded 1,374 new cases overnight. There are still 37 people being treated in hospital. Marshall says numbers are likely to “bob around” for some time. South Australian premier Steven Marshall is speaking now following national cabinet. He says a Covid-positive child aged under two has died: A Covid-positive child under the age of two has, sadly, passed away. This is still being determined as the cause of death. Obviously, we will refer this to the coroner. It is similar to the 95-, 94-year-old woman that we reported the other day,[where] we knew that she passed away with Covid but not necessarily of Covid, so we will need to do that investigation. But very sad news that a child under the age of two, Covid-positive, has passed away. Perrottet is asked what the point of QR codes is now that the system of contact tracing is changing and more and more people are becoming infected. He says: Obviously there was a lot of debate and discussion as we opened up, we planned to remove QR codes in low-risk settings, we kept them and mandated them at high-risk settings to allow ... our health teams to track and trace those cases. There was concern, and hearing from public feedback that was very comfortable with the QR settings we brought them back in a limited way ... As we learn to live alongside the virus, the utility of those QR codes over time will completely dissipate. Mike Bowers, photographer at large for Guardian Australia, has been down at Old Parliament House surveying the damage. He says traditional owners at the tent embassy are frustrated and attempting to keep media from the site. Perrottet says the “substantial investment” the state has placed into its health system gives him confidence NSW will be able to cope with rising case numbers. Which, keep in mind, jumped by more than 100 hospitalisations in the past 24 hours: We always said as we open up case numbers would increase and we’ll expect that continue to occur as we live along the virus. What’s incredibly pleasing is we still have capacity in our health system ... that is the measure of success as the key metric for us, not the case number itself. Please expect as we open up, case numbers will increase. New South Wales premier Dominic Perrottet is speaking now on 2GB. He says restricting the definition of close contacts is a “more balanced approach” that “suits the circumstances” we are currently facing. The government has released a response condemning the fire at Old Parliament House on behalf of the minister assisting the prime minister and cabinet, Ben Morton. Read it in full here: Criminal damage has no place in our democracy. Australia is one of the leading democracies in the world and the Museum of Australian Democracy at Old Parliament House has become a physical symbol of the strength and success of our Australian democratic system. We have led the world in the development of our Australian democratic system. Our democratic success is based on the principles of freedom, respect, fairness and equality of opportunity. Millions across the world can only but dream to live in and have the opportunities afforded to them that come with living in a liberal democracy like Australia. No system of government is perfect. In our democracy the freedom to peaceful protest is one that we can and should celebrate. Today’s actions at Old Parliament House were not peaceful. The resulting damage undermines the message that peaceful protesters seek to deliver. As minister responsible for Old Parliament House I was reassured by the chair of Old Parliament House that at the last board meeting, the board was fully briefed by management on planning and preparations for these protests and the board was satisfied with the planning and preparations. The protection of the building is paramount and given the live operational issues, management have made decisions based on advice from security agencies. Disappointingly, but necessarily, visitor access has been restricted at times. It is the government’s expectation that all illegal activity should be dealt with by the police and the courts to the full extent possible. I thank the first responders. They should not have to put themselves in harm’s way to deal with the fire. The damage to the building will be fully restored back to its original condition. Before we hear from the prime minister, it’s Caitlin Cassidy back with you for the next little while. Caits coming in from all angles today. Scott Morrison is due to address reporters at Parliament House in Canberra at 3.10pm AEDT. This has not been independently verified by Guardian Australia but there are a lot of reports the protesters today are a “sovereign citizen” group. From AAP: The ACT has reported 253 new cases of Covid-19, beating its previous high – set two days earlier – by a single case. There are six people in hospital, with no one in intensive care or requiring ventilation. The new cases bring the territory’s tally of active cases up to 1,134. The infections were picked up alongside almost 4,000 negative tests returned. The Tasmanian premier, Peter Gutwein, is expected to address the media at 3pm after Nat-Cab. We are not sure what time the PM is speaking yet. ACT police have released a statement into the fire at Old Parliament House. Here it is in full: There has been ongoing protest activity at the front of Old Parliament House throughout the past fortnight. Old Parliament House was evacuated earlier today after protestors started a fire at the front doors of the building - this was quickly extinguished by ACT Fire &amp; Rescue. A police investigation into the cause of the fire has commenced. Old Parliament House will remain closed until further notice. Australians may have to receive two or even three Covid jabs each year to maintain defences against the virus if early results on the efficacy of booster shots turn out to be a useful guide. Weekly data published just before Christmas by the UK’s Health Security Agency shows the effectiveness of both the Pfizer and Moderna boosters against symptomatic diseases is lower for the Omicron than the Delta variant across all periods after the injection. The analysis included 147,597 Delta and 68,489 Omicron cases in the UK. The agency stressed the “results should be interpreted with caution due to the low counts and the possible biases related to the populations with highest exposure to Omicron (including travellers and their close contacts) which cannot fully be accounted for”. This is a thread from Twitter user Isabelle AI who says healthcare workers in Sydney are exhausted, and begs the PM and premier to visit the front line. ACT police are expected to hold a press conference about the fire at Old Parliament House soon. I want to point out again – we don’t know what’s happened today or why the fire started. Huge queues for booster shots in Sydney. Protesters on the scene say the police approached the smoking ceremony, spraying pepper spray which then resulted in the fire. I really want to stress that we haven’t yet been able to confirm any of the claims. We are getting more information for you and have put these accusations to ACT police. To be clear - we are not sure exactly what has happened at Old Parliament House this morning, or what the context for the protest is. We are chasing the information and will bring you more detail when we have it. The federal opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, also called for caution regarding the push to narrow the definition of a close contact. When asked about the federal government proposal to narrow the definition, Albanese said it would make sense to have national consistency, and a “commonsense approach” should be taken. But in order to achieve that, as well, we do need to deal with people’s anxieties. When we had a lifting, for example, of the QR codes, and people not being notified, what occurred was that a range of people just chose to then not go about their normal way of life and to withdraw from activity. So we need to be cautious about this. Albanese said the national cabinet should review the matter thoroughly, “and we want to see the states bring their public health advice”. All we’ve heard so far is Scott Morrison’s view about this. We want to hear the approach that state governments think should be taken to this. But what we do urge is there needs to be consistency, there needs to be clarity and certainty and common sense, because businesses and the Australian people in individual states and across the country are really struggling with this hodgepodge of constantly changing rules and definitions. Albanese pivoted to a broader critique of Morrison (with an election due by May), declaring that the Prime Minister “can’t continue to just come up with a new slogan in order to get the headline every week”. This prime minister needs to do something other than go to a focus group this morning and get a definition about ‘shake and bake’ ... This prime minister speaks about personal responsibility. This is the guy who won’t take responsibility for his job, whose most common phrase is ‘it’s not my job’ when asked about things that clearly are the job of the Australian prime minister. OK, we can confirm the fire at Old Parliament House is now out. ACT Fire and Rescue were called at 11.45am, and the crew found the two front doors alight. The building was evacuated and fire crews put the blaze out. ACT Police are now handling the incident. We know that a large number of protesters had been at the site just before the blaze. More to come on this as we have it. From AAP: Tens of thousands of revellers are still expected to flood Melbourne for New Year’s Eve celebrations, despite record Covid-19 infections. Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp said it was undeniable celebrations have taken a hit from the pandemic - normally hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city and an entertainment drawcard has been cancelled. However, she assured those who have tickets to four event zones in the city, open to the double-vaccinated only, that there was still plenty to enjoy. “Within the celebration zones, there is family-friendly entertainment, more than 115 artists will be dazzling and delighting the crowds, there is a 9.30pm fireworks show, particularly for families and children,” she told reporters. Streets will be closed for outdoor dining, families can bring a picnic and there will be alcohol-free zones. “Post the 9.30pm show, we move more into glitter balls, DJs and dancing as people look forward to heralding the end of 2021 with a midnight firework show across those four celebration zones,” she said. However, the pandemic’s ongoing impact on freight, logistics and workplaces’ ability to train staff also means the city of Melbourne has cancelled its drone swarm at Docklands as part of its New Year’s Eve celebrations. It is hoping the drone event provider, Celestial, can deliver the spectacle in January. We know emergency services are now at Old Parliament House. Videos are being shared online – we will bring you more information as we have it. Several journalists on Twitter are reporting that Old Parliament House in Canberra is on fire. We are trying to find out more for you now and will keep you updated. Hello everyone, this is Cait Kelly. I’ll be taking you through the second half of the day. Here’s some weather for you first up. It’s going to be hot, hot, hot over the next few days. The Queensland press conference has just ended, and with that, I will pass the blog on to Cait Kelly. She will bring you all the latest developments, including what comes out of national cabinet, due to meet at midday. Back to Queensland, and Gerrard says this is “the best time” for the state to be experiencing a pandemic. The weather is warm, Queenslanders have had the opportunity to get vaccinated, and school is off for summer: This is the first time Queenslanders will experience the true pandemic ... if we are going to experience the pandemic, then January is probably the best time to be experiencing it, because it’s warm ... and schools are on holidays. This is the time to be having a pandemic. Over in South Australia, Steven Marshall will have more to say later in the day after national cabinet meets. Gerrard says the “vast majority” of people who acquire Covid while fully vaccinated will experience a relatively mild illness. But “even if only a tiny proportion of a large number of people needs to go to hospital ... that’s still a large number”. Gerrard says “certainly” tens of thousands of cases will be detected in the state, and the definition of close contacts needs to change or “the country won’t function”. If we continue to use our current settings, then all of us will be in quarantine, and the state won’t function. Turning to the Torres Strait, Gerrard says there are 11 cases in Thursday Island and one case in the rural town of Cherbourg overnight. Lockdowns are not being considered at this point but the community will be consulted. He says “we are not going to stop the Omicron virus” but there are some things that can slow its spread – like mask-wearing and working from home if you can. Gerrard says there are five things to do if you test positive to Covid-19: Self isolate and tell those you live with to self isolate and get tested. Answer health care questions you are asked when called by a health worker. Tell the people you’ve been in contact with to get tested and quarantine. Ensure you have supplies of food and medications for a fortnight. Look after yourself and keep a symptom diary. To hospitalisations in Queensland, and there are 1,809 cases receiving care in their homes, and 103 cases in hospital. But it’s difficult to work out what proportion are there for treatment and symptoms and what proportion are there for other reasons. There are at least 29 people receiving treatment for Covid in hospitals. Gerrard says: Even if you’re vaccinated there is a significant chance you will acquire this illness in the coming weeks. Queensland’s chief health minister Dr John Gerrard is up, breaking down today’s figures. He says case numbers will continue to rise, but vaccines work, and will hopefully keep intensive care admissions low: Trying to relay this message in a balanced manner is quite difficult ... if I can just take you back and compare what’s happening now with 2020. To the end of June 2020 in Australia there were 8,566 Covid cases diagnosed, so about the same number as we’ve seen in Queensland since the borders opened just over two weeks ago. Associated with that 8,566 cases last year were 204 intensive care admissions and 30 deaths. In Queensland so far since this latest wave, we have seen no intensive care admissions and there have been no deaths reported. It is likely in the coming days there will be intensive care admissions ... the really big issue though in trying to balance this message is we’re not going to be talking about 8,000 cases in a few weeks, we’re going to be talking about tens of thousands of cases ... but the good thing is the vaccines are working and they’ve been clearly demonstrated to work. Grace has announced Queensland’s numbers. There were a record 2,222 Covid cases detected in some 30 local government areas, a slight jump on yesterday’s record figure. There are now 8,586 active cases in the state. The good news is there is nobody being treated in intensive care. Further north, Queensland education minister Grace Grace is speaking in Brisbane now to provide a Covid update while also announcing funding for kindergarten services in the state. Tasmania has reported 92 new Covid cases overnight – almost a doubling of cases in one day – as well as new hospitalisations for the first time since the borders reopened to hotspots. Three people are now in hospital, with one admitted for an unrelated medical reason. There are now 386 active cases in the state. Back to politics, and Daniel Hurst has brought us some more of federal Labor leader, Anthony Albanese’s comments this morning. Albanese says people are “crying out for clarity and certainty” and says the prime minister, Scott Morrison, should stop passing the buck. Albanese used a media conference in Adelaide this morning to demand outcomes from today’s national cabinet meeting (which is due to begin at midday AEDT). Albanese said: The truth is that there’s so much uncertainty out there. What we need out of today’s meeting is some clarity. Because people are anxious. People are worried, people are voting with their feet by not going out, by not going to restaurants, by not undertaking activity that they normally would in the lead-up, particularly, to New Year’s Eve. What we need from today is some national leadership that has been sorely lacking. We need national leadership when it comes to the rollout of the booster. Too many people still can’t get an appointment for their booster. The prime minister needs to explain why it is that it’s four months in between the second shot and the booster shot in a week’s time, but that is reduced to three months down the track at the end of January. Is that just because of capacity constraints? Albanese called for certainty regarding the rollout of boosters to people in aged and disability care. He also took aim at Morrison over shortages of rapid antigen tests: What we’ve seen is state government step up into the void, like the Andrews government, because of the failure of leadership from the Morrison government. Once again, Scott Morrison yesterday, when he appeared at a media conference, spoke about it not being his job. Well, it is his job, and he should do it. As prime minister of the country, we need certainty when it comes to the testing regimes as well and certainty when it comes to the need for isolation. That is what business is crying out for, clarity and certainty. And that is what the population is crying out for as well. But from a prime minister, who’s always playing catch up, always waits until an issue becomes a crisis before there’s any movement whatsoever, and then always is looking for someone else to blame. There is a wait time of between eight and nine hours at Victoria Park to get a Covid test: In lighter news, eBay has revealed some shocking statistics on unwanted Christmas gifts this year. Some 108 pre-loved items were listed every minute on Boxing Day, apparently (do not trust this information). I’m not sure how they knew specifically what was being listed was an unwanted gift, but either way, this year, eBay data shows that people in NSW and VIC were the most likely to flip their unwanted gifts to make some cash. (As our lifestyle editor Alyx Gorman wisely pointed out, if they were unwanted gifts they would also be listed as “new”, not “pre-loved”.) Three of the top five postcodes for selling pre-loved items on Boxing Day on eBay belong to Victoria, namely to Werribee, Melbourne CBD and Dandenong, while Sydneysiders in Baulkham Hills/Bella Vista and Ryde/Putney/Denistone East round off the top five. The top five unwanted gifts were women’s clothing (never buy clothes for your partner), books, trading cards, DVDs and Blu-Rays and coins (coins?). Two coins were listed every minute on Boxing Day, which seems insane. OzSage says our health system was stretched before Covid, and has now had its capacity eroded by staff resignations and a blowout in waiting lists. The impact of the “sheer number” of Omicron cases at this time of year could be “enormous”: The rapid rise in Omicron cases may mean we are only days away from seeing higher hospitalisation and ICU admissions than during the peak of Delta ... NSW recognises the overload of the hospital system and is already warning the community not to expect access to hospital care. One week ago, NSW Health advised people under 50 years to care for themselves at home, without access to Hospital in The Home. This week, they have revised the age cut off to anyone under 65 years. This is the ultimate in “personal responsibility” – where citizens are left without access to healthcare and to sort out their own Covid care, as well as do their own contact tracing whilst sick with Covid-19. Consideration should be given to support for people found Covid-19 positive who are in caring roles. The consequence of this policy is that people may die at home when their lives could have been saved by proper timely healthcare. Without the safety net of regular contact from medical services the unintended consequences are likely to be more ambulance callouts and emergency department presentations. OzSAGE ... found that there were a disturbingly high number of deaths of relatively young people with COVID-19 at home between July and October 2021. ... We remain deeply concerned that people with preventable and treatable complications of Covid-19 may die at home in NSW, without access to even the support of Hospital in The Home. OzSage says the messaging that we are “all going to get Omicron” that has been coming out of NSW also ignores the vulnerable in our society, who remain at increased risk of severe illness: The “let it rip” strategy and defeatist narrative that “we are all going to get it” ignores the stark lived reality of the vulnerable of our society. Despite three doses of vaccine, some patients with cancer and other immunosuppressed people have substantially reduced protection against Omicron. Similarly, people with co-existing health conditions (estimated to be 50% of the adult population) are at increased risk of illness. The impacts of a fragmented testing system and disrupted health system will be felt most by our elderly, lower socio-economic groups, First Nations people, people with disability and regional populations ... A fatalistic approach will be fatal for some people. On the limiting of close contacts, OzSage says they have previously outlined the ongoing importance of contact tracing and QR codes, particularly as nightclubs and restaurants can be the sites of super-spreading events, which we have seen with Omicron: The proposed change to the definition of a close contact is to reduce testing and resources and is not based on sound public health principles. Close contact definitions need to be based on risk. Risk is related to the amount of exposure to virus-laden aerosols. Risk is not limited to arbitrary four-hour time frames within households. ... The rhetoric that case numbers ‘do not matter’ is incorrect - particularly in the face of the Omicron variant. Daily case numbers are now 10 times higher than during the Delta wave and may be 100 times higher in January. Even if hospitalisation rates are lower with Omicron compared to Delta, a halving of hospitalisation rates with a 10-fold or 100-fold increase in cases will still translate to a high burden on the health system. So even though hospitalisation rates are lower with Omicron than the previous Delta wave, hospitalisations and ICU occupancy are still on a “steeply rising trend”, which we saw today in NSW when hospitalisations jumped by more than 100 overnight. The trajectory of observed data suggest that hospitalisation and ICU occupancy are on a steeply rising trend and anticipated to exceed earlier peaks quite soon. In other words, optimistic assumptions about the impact of the Omicron variant on hospital admissions are unrealistic. Introducing a narrower close contact definition when the test positivity rate is currently 13% in NSW is unlikely to improve the burden on the health care system and will instead fuel the outbreak. Limiting the amount of testing reduces pressure on the test and trace system in the short term but will worsen the health system burden, because it will result in chains of transmission that could otherwise have been stopped. Back to the document released by OzSage today, and they’ve detailed some lengthy criticisms about testing in NSW, the risk of Omicron spreading and redefining close contacts. OzSage says testing in NSW is “failing”, with many people turned away after waiting hours in queues, and testing centres shutting at a time we should be testing more, not less: There are unacceptable delays in testing results being sent. Worse, there have been &gt;1000 infected people who were sent a negative test result by mistake, and this problem has not been addressed in a transparent fashion. Rather than investing in expanded testing capacity, the response of government is to restrict access to testing by changing the definition of close contacts and allowing PCR test to only family contacts, health workers and a few other groups. This will reduce our surveillance capacity for new variants and give falsely low case numbers. In addition, the test positive rate is 13% in NSW compared to &lt; 2% during the Delta wave – telling us we need more, not less testing. OzSAGE says rapid antigen tests are “unaffordable” for low-income people and families, given the need to test multiple times and the severe shortage nationwide: RATs ... cannot serve as the backbone of the public health test and control system. The results are not reported to the government, so people who test themselves and self-manage their Covid-19 will not be counted in official case numbers. There is unknown reliability of individual RAT brands with the Omicron variant, as a nasal swab (the usual method) is less likely to be positive than a throat swab. There has been no messaging to advise people on swabbing both the nose and throat when doing a RAT. There should still be a requirement for a PCR testing after a positive RAT. We are disturbed by the repeated messaging that only symptomatic people should get tested, when 40-45% of transmissions are asymptomatic, and even in people who develop symptoms, the peak of infectiousness is in the two days before symptoms begin. The false reassurance of the messaging will result in more cases of viral transmission that otherwise would have been prevented. China has labelled prime minister Scott Morrison joining social media app TikTok as a double standard, AAP’s Alex Mitchell reports. Morrison has previously warned Australians about the Chinese-owned app and said it “connects right back to China”, but he joined on Christmas Eve. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Morrison’s choice of social media apps was “his own business”, but added Australia should not discriminate against Chinese companies: I need to reiterate that the Australian side should follow the principle of openness and market rules, stop abusing the concept of “national security” or applying double standard to serve its interests, and provide a fair, open and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese companies. Australia banned Chinese-owned tech giant Huawei in 2018 and has also cancelled a number of infrastructure deals citing security issues in China. The prime minister posted two TikTok videos on Christmas Eve and has amassed more than 33,000 followers. On the criticisms the AMA has raised regarding the proposal to narrow the definition of a close contact, Hunt says he respects “there are many views”. This is what the president Dr Omar Khorshid said yesterday evening: Back to Hunt – he says his motives after the next election are “to be a dad”. He also responds to criticism of the government’s handling of rapid antigen tests, saying the TGA wasn’t too slow to approve the tests. Prior to national cabinet, the advisory group OzSage has released a series of recommendations on Covid policies. It says it remains “deeply concerned” about rising Covid numbers in NSW, arguing the decision to remove restrictions as Omicron surged has “cost us dearly”: We now have over 12,000 cases a day in NSW, a testing system that cannot keep up with demand and a health system so burdened that citizens are being told they may not be able to access healthcare. Staff stand downs will continue to escalate and effect more and more people. That includes supply chains, logistics and every part of civil society. All models to date assumed good testing capacity and adequate contact tracing. Without these, case numbers will blow out further. At this point in time there is no publicly available modelling to support a National Plan that is based on public health principles which will protect our hospital systems from collapse. OzSage, a group of experts in epidemiology, health and economics, recommends: A transparent and open investigation into why a private pathology provider issued falsely negative test results to infected people and provide a solution to prevent this happening again. Procuring commonwealth RAT supplies, making them free or subsidising the cost as well as a national notification system for positive RATs. Disseminate information to labs and community about the need for nose and throat swabs for detection of Omicron, as nasal swabbing alone is less accurate. Avoid misleading messaging that tells asymptomatic people they do not need to test. Anyone who has been in close contact should test, regardless of symptoms or location of the contact. Prepare surge health workforce capacity. A fit-for-purpose hospital in the home model and a palliative care plan, and stronger delivery of booster doses at facilities and greater oxygen supplies. Medical advice and current modelling that forms the basis of a state or national Covid-19 response should be publicly available. Transparent reporting of infected people self-caring at home. Deaths at home should be monitored and reported weekly. Isolation times should be no less than seven to 10 days depending on the risk balance for the workforce. Education to overturn the “we are all going to get it” messaging and enable the public and businesses to use simple prevention measures. Hunt says “immense progress” has been made on isolation requirements for close contacts. “Practical ways to ensure we don’t have large numbers of workforce on furlough”. A reminder, the Australian Medical Association and others have raised concerns at the proposed reduction of who is defined a “close contact”, arguing we should instead be expanding PCR tests and it will allow the virus to spread. Turning to New Year’s, Hunt’s sage advice is to “avoid the mosh pit”. We’re back on Covid, and Hunt says the commonwealth will deliver 5m Covid-19 vaccines and boosters between now and the end of January. He says it may take the workforce “a little more time”, because state-run facilities need to boost capacity. The reduction between vaccine intervals is due to be reduced from 4 January. The health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now, and it isn’t Covid related. Instead, Hunt is announcing a new bowel cancer treatment on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. From the new year, the medication Braftovi (encorafenib) will be available for patients with severe colorectal cancer. Interrupting Covid transmission briefly to bring you quite an extraordinary claim about the 2032 Olympic Games from federal government frontbencher Stuart Robert: In an interview last night on Sky News Australia, Robert suggested people should vote for the Coalition to protect the Summer Olympics in Brisbane and south-east Queensland. The Olympics have bipartisan support and were strongly backed by the Queensland Labor government. Speaking to Gary Hardgrave, Robert invoked the spectre of the Greens: In terms of the Olympics in the south-east corner, the way we protect it, the way we ensure that Queensland is ready for it, is to ensure we’ve got a Coalition government. The organisation committee, if you like, the corporate structures of 50/50 with the state and the commonwealth, that will go very well. As long as that good balance is there between the state and the commonwealth, simple answer, Gary, don’t vote in a Labor-Green government. It will not fare well, like it didn’t fare well last time. Wait times for Covid tests in the ACT have reduced since the Christmas rush. As of this morning, the Garran and Kambah testing clinics had a one hour wait time, Nicholls had a 35 minute wait time while the Mitchell drive-through testing clinic had a wait time of 1.5 hours. The Garran testing centre has been prioritising tests for close and casual contacts, and people with symptoms. Greg Hunt will be up in the next 15 minutes. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese spoke in Adelaide this morning ahead of this afternoon’s national cabinet meeting: The prime minister says he is changing gears, but the truth is he has stalled the recovery. The truth is that there is so much uncertainty out there stop what we need out of today’s meeting is some clarity. Over in New York, the jury in the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell has reached a verdict and found her guilty on five of six counts. Read more on the verdict here: And you can follow our live blog on the case here: Also concerning is the testing positivity rate. Some 12.58% of tests in NSW came back positive in the latest reporting period. In Victoria, 6.33% of tests returned positive results. Turning to hospitalisations, there have been more than 100 people hospitalised with Covid overnight in New South Wales. There are 395 people in hospital with Covid in Victoria, including 55 in ICU, which is staying relatively stable. But there’s been quite a significant jump in NSW. There are now 746 people being treated in hospital, and 63 in ICU. Yesterday there were 625 hospitalised. Victoria’s case numbers have also come in and 5,137 new Covid-19 infections have been detected. That’s quite a jump from 3,767 yesterday. Sadly, 13 lives have been lost overnight. New South Wales case numbers are in – and it’s another daily record. There have been 12,226 new Covid cases recorded in the state, and one death. AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid has echoed Nancy Baxter’s concerns that redefining a close contact to someone who has spent four hours in a household with a case will accelerate the outbreak. He says resources would be better spent improving PCR availability. We also have confirmation the national cabinet meeting is due to start at midday. Chris Silverwood, head coach of the English cricket team, will miss the fourth Ashes test. It’s shaping up to be a hot New Years Eve across Victoria, with severe heatwave conditions in place across the state. If you’re gathering outdoors be sure to find some shade. Health minister Greg Hunt will be speaking at the Mount Martha Lifesaving Club at 9.45am this morning. Meanwhile, Darwin has been rocked by a large earthquake that hit near Timor-Leste and Indonesia early this morning. The Bureau of Meteorology says there’s there’s no tsunami threat to Australia. Read the full report here: I wish I had more good news for you today, but unfortunately an endangered pygmy hippo calf has died at Sydney’s Taronga Zoo just a month after her entry into the world. She was found unresponsive on Christmas Eve, while preliminary findings indicated a potential heart defect. The hippo was known as a “little watermelon on legs”, and may she rest in peace. Here’s some more comments from Nancy Baxter this morning, who expressed concern at the proposed changes to the definition of a close contact. Good morning, We are limping towards the finish line of the year – just one more day to go. Caitlin Cassidy here to guide you through this morning’s news – and all eyes are on the national cabinet who will be holding a snap emergency meeting today to grapple with rapidly rising Covid cases across the country. New South Wales recorded a dramatic jump in Covid cases yesterday, detecting 11,201 infections and three deaths, while Victoria recorded 3,767 cases and five deaths. It was the first time cases have jumped beyond 10,000 in a single state and a national record for Covid infections. There are predictions daily case numbers could rise beyond 100,000 in the coming weeks. The prime minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday announced the national cabinet meeting, which will focus primarily upon settling a uniform national definition of close contacts. Under the proposed definition, a close contact will be dramatically changed to be someone who has spent four hours or more with a confirmed case in a household or household-like setting. Prof Nancy Baxter, the head of the University of Melbourne’s school of population and global health, told ABC radio this morning the definition wasn’t fair and would overwhelm our healthcare systems. It comes with testing centres overwhelmed amid shortages of rapid antigen tests, which have doubling in price in some stores amid concerns of price gouging. Let’s get stuck in."

          "headline": "English cricket is in disarray – and it’s a metaphor for the whole country",
          "bodyText": "It has been years since football surged past cricket to become England’s favourite sport. Even so, more than a century after cricket’s “golden age”, an Ashes Test series between England and Australia remains one of the most resonant contests in the sporting calendar. This week, after the latest ignominious England defeat in Australia, it seems sensible to ask two questions. How come? And for how much longer? For some of us, cricket is still the most wonderful of all sports, uniquely balancing individual skill, collective effort and the need for time and strategy. But why are England now playing it so badly? The Ashes contest is uniquely deep-rooted in national legend. The Bradmans and Bothams cast long shadows. But why has this inspired Australians to heroic feats, while reducing England to nervous wrecks? It was predictable that the latest humiliating defeat of Joe Root and his team would trigger a bout of cricket soul-searching. The finger of blame has been pointed at inadequate preparation, defective batting technique, dropped catches, poor spin bowling, and lacklustre coaching and captaincy. All these are relevant. But they don’t get at a deeper underlying “why?” The BBC’s Jonathan Agnew is among those who cast the net more widely. He points to enduring structural defects within English cricket itself. These include the marginalisation of the long form of cricket, of which Test matches are the pinnacle, in favour of the limited over “white ball” short forms that TV companies, advertisers and many supporters prefer. Not that this clash of codes seems to have troubled the Australians much. Few have yet tried to take a larger view. One who has is my Guardian colleague Jonathan Liew. He identifies a basic cultural difference between the Australian and English approaches. “To play Test cricket for Australia in 2021 still essentially means something,” Liew wrote this week, citing the match-winning performance of Scott Boland, only the second cricketer of Indigenous Australian heritage to wear the trademark baggy green cap. By contrast, Liew points out, “the very point of the England Test team has become somehow blunted, dissolved, obscured”. Again, one asks – why? The question would have been grist to the mill of arguably the 20th century’s most original writer on English cricket. It is half a century now since Rowland Bowen wrote what is still, for all its flaws and quirkiness, the single best cricket book of its era. But Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development Throughout the World, published in 1970, stands the test of time. On the face of it, Bowen was a character out of English cricket central casting. A retired Indian army officer and perhaps a former spy, he was one of that tribe of white, private school, upper-middle-class men whose fanaticism about cricket still forms a significant stratum of the English game’s support. To call him an eccentric would be an understatement. This was a man who, believe it or not, amputated his own right leg in his bathroom in 1968 to prove it could be done. His book, though, was another matter. Its central argument was that cricket’s rise reflected the flourishing of the industrial and imperial ages, and that English cricket was becoming unsustainable as industrial and imperial Britain came to an end. Bowen also thought cricket’s decline was intertwined with English racism – he pointedly chose the great Caribbean cricket writer and Marxist CLR James to write the introduction to his book – and he believed that most of the agonies of English cricket were caused by the wishes of those who controlled the game to preserve something that was historically doomed. As misguided determinists do, Bowen sometimes let his vision of epochal decline get the better of him. Fifty years on, cricket has not been reduced to “rough and ready” status, metal bats have not replaced wooden ones, Wisden still comes out each year and the counties continue to provide the basis of the English game. Cricket’s adaptability has been greater and more successful than Bowen expected. The shift in power over world cricket from England to India was not something he foresaw either. Even so, Bowen would have had a pretty clear understanding of why England get beaten in the Ashes so often. He would have put cricket’s problems in a larger social context. He would have said the pathways to cricket’s renewal and growth have been cut off, closed and neglected, making the game increasingly unsustainable at the grassroots, especially in state schools which have either had to sell their playing fields or never had them in the first place. He would have said cricket suffers because it is no longer even visible, either in the flesh or on terrestrial TV. He would have said this is because the game has become overprofessionalised, existing too exclusively for the benefit of those who play, administer, promote and make money out of cricket for a living rather than being encouraged to grow more organically and in new ways within English society as it is now. He would have looked to the popularity of cricket in the subcontinent as a striking alternative model. And he would have said cricket has not come to terms with its own racism. English cricket has a long, bad record on race, embodied by its support for apartheid-era South Africa. You know something is structurally wrong by comparing Gareth Southgate’s England football team, which often has five or more minority ethnic players and which is comfortable in its diversity, with Root’s side, which had just one player of non-European heritage this week. England footballers take the knee. Its cricketers do not. As Michael Holding powerfully says, cricket is simply not serious enough. By far the most important thing that happened in English cricket this year was not the Ashes defeat but the exposure of the game’s institutionalised racism. A third of recreational cricket players in England are of south Asian heritage; that dwindles to just 4% at the elite county level. The complaints made by the former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq have at last blown a hole in the culpable complacency of his former county. But Yorkshire – of which I am a member – is not the only club that needs to start again from scratch. It requires particularly powerful blinkers not to see links between these factors and England’s Ashes defeats. England cricket – and its overindulged Barmy Army of supporters – is too complacent, not very good and spends too much time in a bubble of Anglosphere exceptionalism. It is at risk of becoming a metaphor for Brexit, deluded about its abilities and achievements, promoting itself as the envy of the world when it is not, and resentful of its critics. The world has moved on. Perhaps cricket lovers should do so too. Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and columnist"

          "headline": "Australia’s daily Covid cases could rise to 100,000 within weeks, expert predicts",
          "bodyText": "Australia could see daily Covid case numbers of more than 100,000 within weeks – lasting for about a month – before new mask and density rules flatten the curve. The prediction, made by Dr Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University infectious diseases modeller who is part of the Doherty Institute modelling consortium that advises Australia’s national cabinet, came as states and territories reported more than 18,000 cases on Wednesday – a pandemic record. “A month of six figure cases is certainly not outside the realms of possibility across Australia,” Lydeamore said, stressing that modelling is based on “broad and crude assumptions”. He said we could have a month of six-figure infection rates before the outbreak peaks, most likely just after February. Recent models had predicted Covid cases would peak in just over a month’s time. A preliminary University of New South Wales model mentioned by the NSW health minister Brad Hazzard on 15 December predicted up to 25,000 cases a day in that state alone by the end of January. Last Tuesday, there were reports that the Doherty Institute was predicting Australia could have 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January or early February under a “worst-case scenario”, if no health settings were tightened. However the reintroduction of indoor mask mandates and density limits in various states in recent days means that worst-case scenario models for daily cases are less likely to be reached, Lydeamore said. Instead, infections will be spread further throughout the year with the peak delayed and less severe. “The numbers we are seeing, such as the 11,201 in NSW today, are not in the realm of very high. It can feel very high compared with what we’re used to but it’s a far cry from what it could be soon,” Lydeamore said. He also noted “the restriction levels really mess that up”. “The more restrictions that come in, the later and flatter the curve will be. If absolutely nothing had been done, you would have been thinking January or February as the peak, but we know some restrictions have already come.” Lydeamore said the speed that cases will reach the peak is unclear, but that the fewer restrictions in place, the more that the rate of case decrease after the peak will mirror the rate of increase. “We’re not going to get back down to single digit cases for a very long time. The endemic level of cases will probably be lower than the current level of daily cases we’re seeing now.” Lydeamore also said it was difficult for modellers to factor in how Australians’ attitude to gathering could become more cautious as case numbers surge. Additionally, the speed of the booster rollout and uptake and the effects of natural immunity on reinfection, are variables that could dramatically shape the speed and intensity that the current wave of Covid spreads through the community. On Wednesday, as NSW Dominic Perrottet defended his management of Covid restrictions and health minister Brad Hazzard reiterated that “we’ll all get” Covid, the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, warned the local spread of Omicron could be different to other countries’. “What we know from South Africa is that it’s been quite a massive uptick and then a drop down but there is some science behind that because when you get a certain proportion of the population exposed, you actually boost their immunity and then it almost acts as if you’re boosted with a vaccine through that natural protection. It’s always difficult to draw direct comparisons,” Chant said. Lydeamore also warned that the overwhelmed state of testing systems meant that daily numbers reported this week are likely to be just 80% of actual infections. “The actual number of daily infections in NSW [on Wednesday] is probably closer to 14,000 or 15,000.” “As the testing is stressed, that fraction of cases we detected is likely to drop down, as we just won’t be able to keep testing everyone when you’ve got thousands upon thousands of cases. It’s expensive and time consuming, and you can miss a few hundred and things won’t change much.” Lydeamore said that as cases grow, the number of undetected cases increases, and Covid becomes endemic, modelling in Australia “will pivot to the short term and to situation awareness ”, similar to the way weather forecasts are only made for coming days before accuracy deteriorates and predictions become less useful. Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW and adviser to the World Health Organization, said she believes the prediction of a peak of six figure case numbers every day for a month could hinge on how governments deal with testing, detection and isolation of Covid from now on. “Factoring in testing times, and if rapid antigen tests are given out for free, could change how you get to the six figure a day for a month prediction,” she said. She noted Lydeamore’s prediction was broad and an estimate, but said that while most modelling provides a worst-case scenario, some predictions can also be the best case because some inputs for the model can change."

          "headline": "Air travel in and out of UK slumps by 71% in 2021 amid pandemic",
          "bodyText": "Air travel in and out of the UK slumped by 71% in 2021 as the second year of the Covid-19 crisis took its toll on international flying, according to a report. Just over 406,000 international flights operated from the UK up to 22 December this year compared with almost 1.4m in 2019 before the pandemic struck and travel restrictions were imposed, the aviation analytics firm Cirium said. UK domestic flights were found to have declined by almost 60%. International travel has been slow to recover because of testing and quarantine requirements, which have changed throughout the year, and fears of countries being added to the UK’s red list which involve mandatory hotel quarantine for 10 days. The budget carrier Ryanair remained the largest airline in the UK, Cirium said, operating more than 100,000 UK flights in 2021, followed by easyJet, with more than 82,000 flights, while British Airways was third with 77,460 flights. The busiest international route was between London’s Heathrow and New York’s JFK, even though the US only reopened its borders to UK travellers in November. Travellers from the US had been able to fly to the UK since 28 July. BA, Virgin Atlantic, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and JetBlue operated a total of 2,410 flights on the route. Short-haul flights were the most popular, though, with eight out of the 10 busiest routes to mainland Europe. They included London Heathrow to Amsterdam, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Frankfurt. The UK’s busiest domestic route was the 31-mile flight between Land’s End in Cornwall to St Mary’s on the Isles of Scilly, with 2,330 flights recorded this year. With new Covid infections soaring across Europe and the US, and hitting record highs in the UK amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, the outlook for next year remains uncertain. Thousands of flights have been cancelled over the past few days because of staff testing positive for Covid-19, and bad weather in parts of the US. By Wednesday morning, a further 2,100 flights had been cancelled globally, after 3,000 cancellations on Tuesday, including 1,300 into or out of the US, according to the tracking website FlightAware. Globally, airlines cancelled more than 6,000 flights between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, normally the busiest time of the year. One in eight UK travel and tourism jobs – 205,000 roles – will be unfilled at the beginning of 2022, according to the London-based World Travel and Tourism Council. The staff shortage could have an “enormous impact” on the UK’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the WTTC said. It called for a series of measures to tackle the issue, such as more support for remote working, reskilling workers and increasing the number of apprenticeships. “If we cannot fill these vacancies, it could threaten the survival of travel and tourism businesses up and down the UK,” said the council’s chief executive, Julia Simpson. Separately, Indonesia has lifted the ban on the Boeing 737 Max, more than three years after a Lion Air plane flying from Jakarta crashed in October 2018, killing 189 people. In March 2019, there was a second disaster involving the 737 Max model when an Ethiopian Airlines plane crashed soon after takeoff from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Boeing’s bestselling aircraft was then grounded globally. On Monday, Ethiopian Airlines said it would resume 737 Max flights in February."

          "bodyText": "Tributes have been paid to the “true trailblazer” transgender activist April Ashley, who has died aged 86. One of the first Britons to undergo gender assignment surgery, the model and actor was made an MBE in 2012 for her campaigning work for the transgender community. Born to a working-class family in Liverpool in 1935, Ashley joined the merchant navy as a teenager. After repeated suicide attempts and a stint in a psychiatric unit, she moved to London in 1955 and then to Paris. In Paris, she performed at the Le Carrousel nightclub, which was famous for its drag acts, where she was able to save up money for her gender assignment procedure. In 1960, Ashley became only the second Briton to undergo male to female transition surgery when she had the operation in Casablanca, Morocco. She said in later interviews the procedure made her the happiest she had ever been. Back in England, she obtained a national insurance card, passport and driving licence that identified her as female. She went on to have a successful modelling career and was photographed for Vogue magazine and appeared in films including Road to Hong Kong with Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and Joan Collins. Her career was abruptly cut short in 1961 when the Sunday People outed her as transgender. In 1963, she married aristocrat Arthur Cameron Corbett in Gibraltar. Their divorce in 1970 marked a landmark legal ruling when the judge ruled it was not possible to legally change sex, and that the marriage was therefore invalid. Left with nothing, Ashley emigrated to the US west coast to escape the prejudice and discrimination she faced at home. She returned to Britain in 2005, when she was legally recognised as female thanks to the Gender Recognition Act. The singer Boy George tweeted: “R.I.P April Ashley! A force of nature and transgender high priestess!” Peter Tatchell, the LGBTQ+ rights campaigner, called her “the GREAT trans trailblazer for decades” and “hero”. “I was so honoured to know &amp; support her in a past era when she was reviled after being outed as trans,” he said. Trans activist and actor Jake Graf wrote: “A true trailblazer of the trans community has left us. April Ashley MBE was the definition of grace and humility, despite having fought hard throughout her life for her place in society. “A true queen. Gone, but never forgotten. Rest in power.”"

          "bodyText": "“It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.” So opens Charles Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities. Set in London and Paris during the late 1700s and the lead-up to the French Revolution, the novel was a warning about what happens when wealth funnels upwards while the masses stagnate. Nowhere do the best and worst of times collide with more geopolitical force than in Africa. African writers swept the board for literature awards from the Nobel to the Booker, while seven out of eight children in the continent’s sub-Saharan region are unable to read by the age of 10. This year the continent was home to the slowest internet speeds on the planet, as African judges granted the world’s first patent given to a robot inventor. About 50 million Africans are expected to fall into extreme poverty in 2021, when the continent’s richest billionaires have seen their wealth increase by a fifth. Globalisation has polarised societies, an effect that has been supercharged during the pandemic. This pattern is not unusual in other nations, but to apply it to Africa suggests that it possesses a unity beyond the mere geographic. African nations have huddled together in the face of climate and Covid storms – with good reason. Instead of rewarding African scientists for identifying the threat of Omicron, the west imposed travel bans on the continent. The suspicion is that had the Sars-CoV-2 virus been found in Africa, it would have been cut off. The pandemic has made visible a world being shaped to Africa’s disadvantage. Low vaccination rates are a reason for the emergence of dangerous coronavirus variants, so why let just 8% of 1.3 billion Africans be fully vaccinated? The industrialised world won’t issue Africa a vaccine patent waiver, and foreign aid is just 2% of the continent’s GDP. So African nations can’t manufacture their own cheap medicines and lack the foreign exchange to cushion distribution costs. Climate cost Despite having played a negligible role in creating the climate crisis, African countries already find themselves paying a heavy price for it. The EU plans to introduce greenhouse gas taxes on imports that will pull a carbon curtain across the Mediterranean. Carlos Lopes of the University of Cape Town says African train projects built by Chinese companies are not using the low-carbon technology rolled out at home. The performance of Africa has been described as the worst economic tragedy of the 20th century. Commonplace explanations don’t bear much scrutiny. Statistics can show that the closer a country is to the equator, the poorer it is. Yet no one would argue that slow growth caused a country to get closer to the equator. Africa has been destabilised by conflict, but that has, says Prof Lopes, not stopped Thailand developing an export base. One controversial argument is that too few, not too many, colonisers were the problem. The theory goes that higher levels of European settlement led to more productive institutions. However, the historian Morten Jerven, in his book The Wealth and Poverty of African States, says that real wages stagnated in the settler economies of South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, whereas in the peasant economies of Uganda and Ghana, real wages rose. Africa was not colonised because it was poor. European powers occupied and divided up the continent in the 19th century because it was rich. Africa was once a breadbasket; how did it earn a reputation for being a basket case? One reason is an extractive economic model that promotes African development via foreign direct investment, export-led growth and financial liberalisation. This web, according to Tunisian economist Fadhel Kaboub, drains nearly $2tn annually from the developing world. Today, African economies export low-value-added goods relative to their imports. Instead of growing their own food to feed their people, countries import foodstuffs. While some nations export crude hydrocarbons, many more import refined petrochemicals such as gasoline. The right to bring in these essentials is handed over to a politically connected business “rentier” class that has a vested interest in the status quo. There is a demand for jobs, a hunger for education and a desperate need for health in Africa. Yet leaders are caught in a dilemma: if they create money to spend on social cohesion, they risk increasing food, energy and capital goods imports, and increasing their trade deficit. That puts downward pressure on the national currency. A weak exchange rate means that imports of basic necessities will be more expensive. History is littered with examples of violent revolutions preceded by price spikes. An alternative strategy Economic orthodoxy has no answer. Its textbooks would have African governments instructing central banks to borrow US dollars to prop up the local currency and prioritising foreign creditors with austerity. Africa’s stunted development demonstrates that poor states continue to be impoverished by being integrated into the world system through a relationship of unequal economic exchange with wealthy states. An alternative African strategy would see governments spending on public services and on increasing food and renewable energy sovereignty, while cracking down on corruption. This provides a way out of the current development trap. In their book Africa’s Last Colonial Currency, Fanny Pigeaud and Ndongo Samba Sylla suggest that, instead of importing food and burning through foreign reserves, African states should produce food at home, as land, work and knowhow are abundant. “If they financed the development of their agriculture, they wouldn’t reduce their foreign exchange reserves; on the contrary, they would save money.” State-owned enterprises and a competitive domestic private sector would help Africa evade activities demanded by the global north. As African countries become increasingly digital, data will be power in economic governance – and local entities must be its custodian, not transnational corporations. Trade agreements between countries of similar income levels are more beneficial for them compared with the World Trade Organization’s framework. The African Continental Free Trade Area, created by 54 of the 55 AU nations, is a good start. African economies would benefit by producing green industrial goods that rich countries take for granted, but whose mass production has not reached the continent. It would be in Europe’s interest to help – as more Africans would be able to find jobs at home, pressure to migrate would ease. Africa is caught between history and geography. Understanding how and why it got to where it is today will help the continent move forward in the future."

          "bodyText": "After taking a drag on a cigarette thought to be laced with spice, Gyula Remes collapsed in the freezing underpass at Westminster tube station, three years ago last week, just across the road from the Houses of Parliament. The Hungarian national’s lips went blue, and he stopped breathing. He had come here for a better life but was soon being rushed a few hundred yards across Westminster Bridge to St Thomas’ hospital, where he died, aged 43. Remes was one of 726 people estimated to have died homeless in England and Wales in 2018, and his death could so easily have been prevented. A week before he died, Remes had applied to the Connection at St Martin-in-the-Fields, a highly regarded homeless night shelter that benefits from the Radio 4 Christmas appeal every year. The Connection said it was unable to let Remes access its night shelter because, in its words, he did not have a “realistic and sustainable route off the streets”. Kafka would have been hard pressed to come up with a more dystopian scenario. Ironically, it emerged later that Remes was doing part-time kitchen work and had just been offered full-time work. His death (the second in 10 months in the same underpass) sparked outrage in parliament. The next day, the then secretary of state for housing, communities and local government James Brokenshire, who died in October this year, told parliament: “Every death of someone sleeping rough on our streets is one too many. Each is a tragedy, each a life cut short. We have a moral duty to act.” However well-intentioned Brokenshire’s words, the government reneged on this duty. In 2019, the number of deaths among homeless people in England and Wales rose for the fifth year in a row to a record high of 778. Meanwhile, the number of people who were entirely homeless or living in temporary accommodation and hostels in England soared to 280,000 in 2019 from a low of 40,000 in 2009 and 2010. While the government failed to tackle homelessness, many members of the public continued to do the same thing they had always done to address the issue – donate to charity. Over the Christmas appeals of 2017 and 2018, Radio 4 listeners raised more than £5m to support the Connection at St Martin-in-the-Fields and another charity. Then the pandemic came along and proved what many of us have always known: by and large, eradicating street homelessness can be done (though some people will inevitably return to the streets), and it’s the responsibility of government, rather than charities, to do this. Under the policy introduced at the beginning of the first lockdown called Everyone In, the government found £105m to get England’s homeless people off the streets and into emergency accommodation to keep them safe from Covid-19. The idea behind Everyone In was to provide rough sleepers with accommodation; hopefully support, tailored to individual needs, would follow. But there is already a name for a policy that combines immediate housing with the crucial “wrap-around support” that should follow it: Housing First. In Britain, Housing First is still regarded as a radical model to end homelessness, but it shouldn’t be. It’s common sense. You house people, then address their complex needs, rather than tell them that if they manage to address behaviours such as addiction, they will qualify for housing. Housing First was developed in New York in the early 1990s, and has virtually ended rough sleeping in some states – Utah, for example, has reduced chronic homelessness by 91%. Meanwhile, in Finland Housing First has been an unqualified success since being introduced in 2007. Rough sleeping has been all but eradicated in the capital, Helsinki, where there remains only one night shelter, of 50 beds. In Britain we cannot measure the effectiveness of Housing First because we have been neither brave nor humane enough to trial it on a national level. But we can look at how successful our impromptu version of it was, and the fact is, we managed to get most of Britain’s rough sleepers housed within days. According to one study, the scheme saved an estimated 266 people from death in the first lockdown. Boris Johnson had won a huge majority only three months earlier and was terrified of his popular support being eroded by the prospect of homeless people dying on the streets in large numbers. But the concern over street homelessness did not last long. By June 2020 only 16 of the 46,687 deaths registered as Covid-related in England and Wales were identified as people who were homeless. The government reverted to type, and the homelessness crisis once again became a low priority. In February 2021, according to Shelter, 77% of the 37,430 people helped under the Everyone In banner were not living in settled accommodation (somewhere they could stay for at least six months); and almost one in four were no longer being accommodated at all. As for wraparound support (the second, vital, part of Housing First), the project did not last long enough and was insufficiently resourced (understandable in those chaotic days). This was a real opportunity to transform homelessness and British society. Johnson had a chance to steal a huge head start on his promise to eradicate street homelessness by May 2024, and he blew it. But as he’s shown throughout his career, he’s never given a tuppenny toss for his own pledges. Promises are simply there to be broken. As London mayor in 2009, he promised to “end rough sleeping in the capital by 2012”. By the time he left office, the number of homeless people on the street had more than doubled, from 3,673 to 7,500. As early as January 2021, Citizens Advice was already reporting that half a million people had gone into rent arrears during the pandemic, while a study by the debt charity StepChange in September showed that 225,000 people feared losing their homes. The ending of the £20 uplift in universal credit, and rocketing energy prices, make it even more likely that people will be turfed out of their homes. In summer, the Big Issue launched a Stop Mass Homelessness campaign, and last month it estimated that if the government pays off the £360m rent arrears accrued over the pandemic it could save £2.6bn in the long term by preventing homelessness. Last Tuesday the government announced that Everyone In would be reintroduced for rough sleepers this winter, as well as funding of £310m for councils to prevent vulnerable people from becoming homeless. At first glance, it looks great. But the reality is, it’s little more than a repeat of emergency pandemic measures. The risk is that it becomes another temporary fix, which falls off the priority list as soon as winter passes. Everyone In has already proved how simple it is to tackle rough sleeping. Now the government needs to go further. The countrywide introduction of Housing First (funded by central government) is in the interests of homeless people, the economy, society at large and Johnson himself. All Johnson has to do is put his money where his mouth is to show that he is capable of keeping a promise, and he will create a legacy worthy of Remes and the thousands who have died needlessly on our streets, as well as for Brokenshire – and, dare we say it, even for himself. • This article was amended on 29 January 2022 to clarify that the money raised by Radio 4 listeners for the Christmas appeals of 2017 and 2018 was donated to two different homeless charities, not just the Connection.

          "headline": "From economic miracle to mirage – will China’s GDP ever overtake the US? ",
          "bodyText": "“The east is rising, the west is declining”, according to the narrative propagated by the Chinese Communist party (CCP). Many outside China take its “inevitable rise” as read. On the way to becoming a “modern socialist country” by 2035, and rich, powerful, and dominant by 2049, the centenary of the People’s Republic, China wants to claim bragging rights as its GDP surpasses the United States, and project its power based on its expanding economic heft. There is, however, a critical flaw in this narrative. China’s economy may fail to overtake the US as it succumbs to the proverbial middle-income trap. This is where the relative development progress of countries in relation to richer nations stalls, and is normally characterised by difficult economic adjustment and often by unpredictable political consequences. Historically, China’s growth miracle has been remarkable. In the 30 years to 1990, the money GDP (the market value of goods and services produced in an economy) for China and the US in American dollar terms grew more or less in tandem at just over 6% and 8% per annum, respectively. . But in the next three decades, China’s GDP growth doubled to more than 13%, while the US’s halved to 4.5%. That pushed China’s GDP up from 5% of American GDP to 66%. Yet, China’s growth spurt is now over, and the huge disparity in GDP growth has been eliminated. In the last few quarters, China’s GDP has been growing at half the rate of the US. Although that discrepancy is probably unsustainable, the US’s estimated $7tn GDP margin over China in 2021 means that comparable rates of GDP growth in the future will sustain and even widen the margin. A Japanese thinktank has recently extended the date when it expects China to overtake the US, from 2029 to 2033. Deferrals like this are now a feature, and there will be more. The issue though is less about the maths and more about why China is at a turning point. Remember we have been here before. In the 1930s, Germany was going to dominate Europe, if not the world. In the 1960s and the 1980s, the Soviet Union – which had already stolen a march on the US in space technology – and later Japan, which was the rising economic force on the planet, would within 10 to 20 years overtake the United States to become the dominant economic and technological power. History was not kind to the consensus. There is a serial tendency going back to the 1920s to underestimate the self-rectifying capacity of American institutions and enterprise. Equally, the Soviet Union and Japan both pursued similar development models, based around distortions that emphasised unsustainably and excessively high savings, high investment, and eventually high debt. Their development models cracked with spectacular consequences attributable to chronic failures of institutions and governance. China is our 21st-century version of this phenomenon. Its investment rate is a good 10 percentage points of GDP higher than it was at the peak in the USSR and Japan, and strongly associated with misallocation and inefficiency of capital, and widespread debt servicing problems. Its zero-Covid policy could keep barriers in place between China and the world economy until 2023 or even beyond, but this aside, a protracted slowing in trend growth, exacerbated by over-indebtedness and the tipping point now in real estate, as illustrated by the crumbling development giant Evergrande, is already under way. China’s $60tn real estate sector is four times GDP and accounts for a quarter to a third of annual growth. It faces years of awkward adjustment, not least as developers cut debt, the first-time buyer age cohort contracts, and probably as real estate prices decline. China’s economic structure, moreover, is unbalanced. It has income per head that is the equivalent of Mexico, but consumption per head that is no higher than Peru. Consumer spending accounts for about 37% of GDP, little higher than it was in 2010, and much lower than in 2000. Productivity growth, closely associated with liberalising reform, has stalled. China’s development model urgently needs a makeover to avoid the middle-income trap. The longer it is delayed, the bigger the costs. China’s leaders recognise that change is necessary, and Xi Jinping recently revived the slogan of “common prosperity” to mobilise the Communist party and citizens around a strategy to reduce income and regional inequality, and improve living standards. Yet these political goals require precisely the kind of liberalising, progressive and redistributive reforms to the economy to which Xi Jinping is opposed. He has pursued an increasingly ideological and totalitarian governance style in which the already dominant position of the party and state in the economy has been strengthened further. Perversely, he has created a contradiction in which even the CCP’s expertise in dialectical argument may be of little help. The recent blizzard of new laws and regulations aimed at private firms and entrepreneurs, for example, is designed to nail down the party’s control and bring the private sector to political heel. This is hardly compatible with the productivity growth and innovation on which China’s lofty economic ambition depends. Overtaking the United States is going to need a lot more than narrative. It requires policies to which Xi’s China is opposed, and might just remain a mirage. The consequences for China and the rest of the world have not been properly thought about. • George Magnus is a research associate at Oxford University’s China Centre and at Soas. He is the author of Red Flags: Why Xi’s China is in Jeopardy. • This article was amended on 29 December 2021 because an earlier version cited “the US’s $9tn GDP margin over China”. In fact the figure is estimated to be $7tn."

          "bodyText": "China has accused the US of ignoring international treaty obligations and engaging in irresponsible and unsafe conduct in outer space after two near misses between the Chinese space station and satellites operated by Elon Musk’s SpaceX company. Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesperson, said on Tuesday that China “urges the US to act responsibly” after incidents involving SpaceX’s Starlink satellites, which he said had posed a serious threat to the lives and safety of astronauts. In a note to the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space earlier this month, China said Tiangong, its new space station, had to manoeuvre to avoid one Starlink satellite in July and another in October. Tiangong had to take “preventive collision avoidance control” during the two “close encounters” after the Starlink satellites had moved into orbits that obliged Tiangong’s operators to change its course, the document said. “The manoeuvre strategy was unknown and orbital errors were hard to assess,” Beijing said of the satellite involved in the October incident, adding that it took action to “ensure the safety and lives of in-orbit astronauts”. The note said the incidents “constituted dangers to the life or health of astronauts onboard the China space station” and asked the UN secretary general “to circulate the above mentioned information to all states parties to the outer space treaty”. Starlink, a division of Musk’s private company SpaceX, has launched more than 1,600 satellites. It has permission from US authorities to launch a total of up to 12,000 in a programme aiming to provide internet access to most of the planet. China’s note to the UN space agency in Vienna said state parties to the outer space treaty, which is the foundation of international space law, “bear international responsibility” for activities carried out by both government and non-governmental bodies in space. Evasive manoeuvres to reduce the risk of collisions in space were becoming more frequent owing to the number and speed at which satellites were being launched, said Jonathan McDowell, of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. “Starlink is a big part of that,” McDowell said, adding that it was “highly unusual” for a country to lodge a complaint through an “informational bulletin”. Any collision would be likely to “completely demolish” the Chinese space station, he said. McDowell added that China was also a big contributor to space junk. The International Space Station “has several times over the past 10 years had to dodge pieces from the Chinese military anti-satellite test of 2007”, he said. “It’s not like the Chinese had a clean record here. The biggest debris event ever was the Chinese anti-satellite test.” He said the incidents were a reminder the world had entered a new era in space. “There’s more debris and there’s more active satellites. Things are just getting a lot busier and a lot more crowded up there. It’s a commercially dominated space age … where we’re stressing the space environment for the first time.” The core module of China’s station Tiangong – whose name means “heavenly palace” – entered orbit this year and is expected to become fully operational in 2022. Beijing’s complaint prompted heavy criticism on Chinese social media of Musk, whose electric car firm Tesla sells tens of thousands of vehicles in China each month. Musk is widely admired in China, although Tesla’s reputation has been tarnished after a rash of recent crashes and scandals. One hashtag on the Weibo social networking platform recorded 90m views on Tuesday. “How ironic that Chinese people buy Tesla, contributing large sums of money so Musk can launch Starlink, and then he (nearly) crashes into China’s space station,” one user said. “Prepare to boycott Tesla,” said another Weibo user, echoing a common response in China to foreign brands perceived to be acting contrary to national interests. Some speculated that Washington would have imposed sanctions if the roles were reversed. “Why don’t we just do what they do?” one wrote. California-based SpaceX did not immediately respond to a request for comment. • This article was amended on 28 December 2021 because a reference to “the US space station” should have been to the International Space Station."

          "bodyText": "Against the backdrop of Dunkirk’s busy port with its cranes and smoke, a collapsed, grey rubber dinghy lies on the shore, abandoned and washed in by the tide. It is one of the many haunting signs of the thousands of desperate people who have attempted to cross the Channel from northern France. Nearby lies a red lifejacket and a shoe, half-filled with sand. The vessel bears the name MaRe Boote, a German firm based in the small western Rhineland town of Werne, about 400 miles from Calais. According to German police, at least 24 MaRe boats have been used by migrants to make the perilous journey. In a compound in Dover, where boats seized after being used to carry people from France are stored, there are dozens of dinghies of the same or similar model. According to British and French authorities, smugglers buy them in Germany, ship them to France, then transport them to the beach a few hours before departure. The Guardian has traced the journey of a number of different types of dinghies used by the people smugglers, most of which are produced thousands of miles from Dover in China, where they are generally ordered by smugglers over the internet to be delivered to the main migration routes to Europe. “Most of the dinghies, about 11 metres long, are designed to carry safely a maximum of 15 people. The smugglers push them into the vastness of the ocean even with 50 people on board,” said Salvatore Vella, chief prosecutor of Agrigento, Sicily, who has led the majority of investigations against smugglers operating in Libya. “The risk for passengers aboard these rafts is very high,” Vella added. “They are among the main causes of death at sea for asylum seekers, because it is difficult for these boats to reach their destination if they are not rescued. To cut costs, smugglers buy low-quality, inflatable boats, with prices ranging between $500 [£377] and $2,000.” A MaRe Boote dinghy, of the type found at Dunkirk, can be bought for about £2,000. There is no suggestion that the Mare Boats are substandard for normal use, or that they market their boats to people smugglers. In the past, crossings were attempted in old fishing boats, barges and wooden and glass fibre boats, which smugglers had bought from Libyan, Turkish, Tunisian and Egyptian fishers. However, since the peak of the migrant crisis in 2015, the European military missions to combat illegal immigration have begun to destroy these boats, with the aim of preventing them from being reused for people-smuggling. As a result, across the main sea routes, from the central Mediterranean to Turkey and from the Canaries to the coast of Dover, the inflatable dinghy has become the most-used type of vessel to reach Europe. Some dinghies, built with poor materials, are prone to deflate after just a few hours of navigation. Gradually, all their air chambers can collapse, even when the boat is stationary in a calm sea. Even the more expensive and better made German-sold models are unsuited to a Channel crossing when overloaded with dozens of people. Although the Channel route may seem more accessible than the Mediterranean, in reality it is one of the most lethal passages. At its narrowest point – about 21 miles across – the Channel is one of the busiest seaways in the world, with a constant traffic of cargo and fishing vessels, passenger ferries, yachts and coastguard boats. Carrying no lights and no technology to broadcast their own location or monitor the positions of other vessels, the rafts grope in the dark, virtually invisible to other ships. Onboard for emergencies, passengers only have a bike pump in case of deflation, and plastic bottles for bailing out water. Last month 27 people, most of them Iraqi Kurds, died when their boat sank in darkness in the Channel. The two survivors said the dinghy began to deflate about three-and-a-half hours after they set off from a beach near Dunkirk. Those onboard tried to keep the dinghy afloat but their pump broke, the survivors said, and the dinghy eventually flipped over. The survivors claim they had reached British waters by this point and rang the UK calling for help – unsuccessfully. Eleven hours later, French fishers spotted bodies in the water. “Costs for traffickers have dropped significantly with the use of rubber boats,” Vella said. “They can also be navigated by inexperienced men, chosen from among the migrants themselves. Plus, they’re easy to find. They can even be ordered on the web, in Asian markets.” For many years the Chinese online shopping platform Alibaba.com offered inflatable boats for sale under the tag “refugee boat” or “migrant boat”. A sales advert offered buyers a “high-quality refugee boat” for $800 to $1,100, for vessels made of plywood, aluminium and PVC that could carry up to 30 passengers and with lifejackets as “optional equipment”. “The boat has a good anti-sinking capacity. When it is loaded to capacity (even if the boat is fully filled with water), it can still float,” read one of the ads seen by the Guardian. After complaints from the EU, Alibaba.com said it would no longer “tolerate” sellers using its platform for this purpose. Since then, it says, most references to “refugee boats” and “migrant boats” have been removed from its platform. But a few weeks ago the Guardian found that links that contain “refugee boat”, “high quality refugee boat” and “inflatable migrant boat” were still valid on the e-commerce giant’s English-language website, even though most of the products listed under those pages no longer call themselves as such. There was at least one advertisement that reads: “GTS800 15 People, Inflatable Migrant Boat, 6.5 metres long, with a 60cm diameter tube”. The supplier is a Qingdao-based company called Goethe. A sales representative contacted by the Guardian said that 70% to 80% of the company’s sales had been to Europe this year – mostly to Germany and Greece. She said she was aware a Turkish customer had bought a boat for refugees a few years ago, but insisted this was “no longer happening” because of a Turkish government crackdown. “We manufacture thousands of boats every year, with some 100 different models,” she said. “Inside China, [these] boats are made mainly in the Shandong and Guangdong provinces.” But when asked about the “migrant boat” advertised on Alibaba.com, she said: “This is only a gimmick. It doesn’t mean very much.” She refused to disclose any details of Goethe’s clients, citing “corporate secret”. Alibaba has since removed the pages found by the Guardian. The Hangzhou-based company insists that it “will not tolerate those who seek to profit from this crisis”. “We are constantly engaged in efforts to ensure sellers on our platforms list products in an appropriate manner and in compliance with our policies,” it says in a statement to the Guardian. A leaked EU-restricted document, written in 2016 by the officers of Operation Sophia, the EU’s mission to crack down on illegal people-smuggling routes across the Mediterranean, confirmed that Libya-based smugglers were buying dinghies made in China and shipping them to north Africa via Malta. The document cited an interception of about 20 packaged rubber boats “imported from China and transported to Malta and Turkey, in a container destined for Misrata, Libya”. As there were no legal grounds for holding such shipments, the boats were released. Vella said vessels used to take people to Greece are delivered to Turkey. Those that set off from Libya are sent to Malta or Turkish ports, from where they are shipped as cargo to Libya. The inflatables that cross the Channel are delivered to the heart of Europe, he said. A report last month from the PAF border police (Police aux Frontières) found that “boats that come from China and are able to carry up to 60 migrants are stocked abroad, mainly in Germany”. Marvin Reuter, the owner of MaRe Boote, the German firm whose logo has repeatedly appeared on some rubber dinghies attempting to cross the Channel, agreed to speak to the Guardian. The firm’s website says: “We build exceptional inflatables. High quality, individual, sporty, fast and uncompromisingly good.” Reuter said he felt “frustrated” after German police informed him that his inflatable boats, which cost about £2,000 each, were used by migrants to attempt the crossing from France to the UK. “I feel horrible about what these bad guys do with my boats,” he said. Reuter said the customers who bought the inflatables, which are manufactured in China, did so “legally”, and took them away in a car, like everyone else. Like other dinghy firms in Europe, Reuter said he was not able to determine if customers intended to use the vessels to transport people. “The problem is that customers who bought these vessels may have sold them to the bad guys.” Some smuggling gangs appear to be continuing to buy direct from China. Olivier Cahn, professor of criminal law at CY Cergy Paris University, said these included a well-organised criminal gang made up of Iraqi Kurds and operating from Calais. The gang was partially dismantled in November, with several arrests, after 27 people drowned. The smugglers used dinghies ordered in China and shipped to Turkey, Cahn said. The vessels were then transported via the Balkans to Germany, where they were “unbundled” and handed over to teams of smugglers operating in Nord-Pas-de-Calais and Normandy. Refugees the Guardian spoke to last month in a freezing camp on the outskirts of Dunkirk said smugglers charged €3,000 (£2,500) per person for the Channel crossing. In 2019, crossings intercepted by law enforcement agencies included an average of 12 individuals per boat; in 2021, this number rose to 27. As the fees charged by criminal organisations are high, small “self-employed” groups are trying their luck, Cahn said. They expose themselves to the dangers of the sea on board makeshift dinghies, reinforced with sections of PVC attached with marine duct tape, or sheets of plywood fixed with screws. Several large distribution companies in northern France, such as the sport equipment retailer Decathlon, no longer sell dinghies or canoes, to prevent migrants from attempting to use them to cross to England. The rubber boats – after a journey of 6,000 miles, passing from the containers of cargo ships to the hubs of international airports, to the warehouses of European shops, from the hands of smugglers who fill them with people – end up on the beaches of northern France and southern England, along with shoes and clothing. The footwear and garments belong to men, women and children, whose fates, much of the time, remain unknown."

Featuring more than 15 works, can this really be the first ever show dedicated to his self-portraits, from every stage of his career? AS • Courtauld Gallery, London, 3 February-8 May The World of Stonehenge One of the most mysterious wonders of archaeology gets the blockbuster treatment. From the medieval myth that Merlin imported it from Ireland by magic to great artistic images by Blake and Constable, to the arrest of Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles at the stones, this ancient place haunts British culture. JJ • British Museum, London, 17 February-17 July A Century of the Artist’s Studio: 1920-2020 The studio as workshop, factory, sanctuary and theatre, and both subject and artwork in its own right. Taking us from Francis Bacon’s photogenic chaos to a Louise Bourgeois cell, from collective, collaborative spaces to places where creativity has run out, this exhibition reveals a century of art-making and aeons of frittered time. AS • Whitechapel Gallery, London, 17 February-29 May Carlo Crivelli: Shadows on the Sky It has long been Ikon director Jonathan Watkins’s dream to stage a show of Italian Renaissance painter Carlo Crivelli (1435-95), who was both a conservative figure and, Watkins says, “as radical as Magritte”. Susan Sontag saw Crivelli as “camp”. Curiosity piqued at Crivelli’s undoubted weirdness, I can’t wait. AS • Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 23 February-29 May Surrealism Beyond Borders The surrealist belief that beauty comes from the unconscious was born in Paris but kindled dreams around the globe. In Prague, it unleashed the visions of novelist Bohumil Hraba and animator Jan Švankmajer. In Mexico it inspired Frida Kahlo. Follow its flame to these and many more surreal breeding grounds. JJ • Tate Modern, London, 24 February-29 August Robert Indiana: Sculpture 1958-2018 All you need is love, and in the case of this pop artist who died in 2018 that’s all a lot of us know about him. Indiana’s defining work Love is a public sculpture that swept the world, but how did he develop? Here’s a chance to see him whole. JJ • Yorkshire Sculpture Park, 12 March-8 January 2023 Kyōsai: The Israel Goldman Collection The 19th-century painter Kawanabe Kyōsai brought Japanese art into modern times. He lived in an age of widening encounters for Japan and was a contemporary of the French impressionists, dying in 1889. His ghosts, courtesans and animals are rollicking masterpieces. This show from a great collection reveals a genius. JJ • Royal Academy, London, 19 March-19 June Hew Locke Unpicking British colonial history is key to the work of the Guyanese-British artist, whose Armada, a flotilla of 45 votive boats, will be suspended from the ceiling of Tate Liverpool in February. Locke’s forthcoming commission for Tate Britain’s Duveen Galleries combines the themes and material that have informed his earlier work: expect trophies from the junkyard of empire, remnants and flotsam and flowers. AS • Tate Britain, London, 22 March-23 October Sheila Hicks: Off Grid The Hepworth’s delayed show by the Paris-based American artist, who has used weaving as the basis of her work for more than 50 years, finally arrives. Drawing on wildly different weaving traditions, and working on both small woven drawings and large-scale installations that respond to the architecture of the gallery, the exhibition promises to be ravishing. A perfect venue for her art. AS • Hepworth Wakefield, 7 April-25 September The Vasseur Baltic Artists’ award 2022 A great premise – get three leading artists to each nominate a younger colleague, who gets £25,000 and a show at Baltic. Culture and nature, cosmological thinking and the political and material formation of taste inform the work of Ima-Abasi Okon, Laleh Khorramian and Fernando García-Dory, selected by Otobong Nkanga, Mika Rottenberg and Hito Steyerl. AS • Baltic Gateshead, 9 April-2 October Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster Gonzalez-Foerster is an enigmatic creator of rooms, situations and beguiling surprises. Speculative, literary, haunting and strange, the French artist’s work is often as autobiographical as it is a kind of sci-fi of the self and our place in the universe. The Serpentine tells us to expect “an immersive, supernatural and sensory environment”: I haven’t a clue what to expect. AS • Serpentine Gallery, London, 13 April-4 September (Dates TBC) Cornelia Parker Surrealism still lives in the transformations Parker performs on everyday stuff. Her often comical, accidental-on-purpose catastrophes, from blowing up a shed to crushing musical instruments to flattening the silverware, have helped make contemporary art popular. So this retrospective with all her greatest hits should go down a treat. JJ • Tate Britain, London, 18 May-16 October Picasso Ingres: Face to Face Picasso gobbled up artistic influences from around the world but was also able to take on European classicism. After all, he was trained in it at a 19th-century academy. This should be thrilling as we see how he squared up to the authority of Ingres with great, strange results. JJ • National Gallery, London, 3 June-9 October Vivian Maier Working for more than 40 years as a domestic nanny in suburban Chicago, Vivian Maier had a double life as a street photographer. Her anonymity was her disguise but it was taken to such an extreme that her art remained almost unknown until after her death. Maier saw herself as a sort of spy, recording life in Chicago, New York and wherever her obligations took her. She was brilliant, weird and wonderful. AS • MK Gallery, Milton Keynes, 11 June-25 September Carolee Schneemann: Body Politics The first survey of American artist Carolee Schneemann’s (1939-2019) work in the UK, the show celebrates a radical artist and feminist agent-provocateur. Tracing her development from early paintings and assemblage, to her confrontational performances using her body as primary medium and subject, and her later films and multimedia installations. AS • Barbican Art Gallery, London, 8 September-8 January 2023 Very Private? The recently discovered erotic drawings of Bloomsbury artist Duncan Grant should bring the crowds to this house and gallery that preserves the spirit of the early 20th-century avant garde. Grant’s openly gay sex scenes were made at a time when homosexuality was a crime. They are his masterpieces. JJ • Charleston, Sussex, 17 September -12 March 2023 Lindisfarne Gospels Artists Monster Chetwynd and Ryan Gander are among the stars of a cultural festival across the north-east to celebrate the return of a regional wonder. The illuminated Saxon treasure the Lindisfarne Gospels, created by Northumbrian monks, is one of the most hauntingly beautiful manuscripts on Earth. And it’s coming home. JJ • Laing Art Gallery, Newcastle, 17 September-3 December (plus region-wide events) Lucian Freud: New Perspectives In a year that also includes its much-delayed Raphael blockbuster, the National Gallery dives into the world of a modern great. Freud belongs here. He judged himself against the likes of Titian, Rubens and Corot – and now his paintings can be assessed in their company. A genius takes his place in history. JJ • National Gallery, London, 1 October-22 January 2023 Cézanne Cézanne remains a pivotal figure in the development of modern art. Reclusive, idealistic and curmudgeonly, this new retrospective will contain many works not seen in the UK before, and follow his development from the 1850s to his death in 1906. It’s not all about apples, mountains or the bucolic Provençal good life. Tate last mounted a Cézanne retrospective in 1996. It feels a world away. AS • Tate Modern, London, 6 October-12 March 2023 Architecture House of Hungarian Music A hole-filled slice of Swiss cheese has landed in Budapest’s wooded City Park, forming an undulating canopy above the trees. This is the new House of Hungarian Music, by experimental Japanese architect Sou Fujimoto, designed to host concerts in a glade-like setting, along with a library and exhibitions on musical history. • Budapest, January F51 Concrete bowls bulge from the cafe ceiling of F51 in Folkestone, signalling the presence of the world’s first vertical skatepark. Billed as an “adrenaline building”, this new youth hub will house facilities for skateboarding, BMX, climbing, bouldering, boxing and more – in a building that was originally planned to be a multistorey car park. • Folkestone, early 2022 John Hejduk: Building Worlds The postmodern American architect John Hejduk created stories and characters more than buildings, concocting casts of strange anthropomorphic structures that took on lives of their own. This free installation will see a large-scale model constructed from one of his “masques”, built in collaboration with students from the Royal College of Art. • Royal Academy, London, 22 March Burrell Collection After almost six years, Glasgow’s cherished venue is set to reopen, following a £68m refurbishment by John McAslan. First opened in the city’s Pollok Country Park in 1983 to house the sprawling art collection of shipping magnate Sir William Burrell, the building has been radically upgraded to improve display conditions and allow more to be shown. • Glasgow, March National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design A vast oblong of glowing white marble floats above a greenish-grey stone base near the Oslo waterfront, signalling the arrival of the new £544m National Museum. Designed by German architects Kleihues + Schuwerk, it will display more than 5,000 artworks across 90 galleries, the upper Light Hall containing a colossal 2,400 sq metres space for changing exhibitions. • Oslo, 11 June Objects of Desire: Surrealism and Design 1924-Today From a gigantic red lip-shaped sofa to a coffee table with golden bird’s feet, this exhibition will explore how surrealism has influenced design of the past 100 years, spanning kooky furniture and interiors to graphic design, fashion and photography. Anyone for an iron studded with nails?  • Design Museum, London, 14 October Plastic: Remaking Our World From the 2m plastic bags being used every minute to the microplastics choking sea life in the deepest oceans, the material is everywhere. This exhibition will chart plastic’s 150-year history, explaining how we got here and asking what’s next for tackling one of the world’s most pressing environmental challenges.  • V&amp;A Dundee, 29 October Horror in the Modernist Block What better city to host an exhibition on horror and architecture than Birmingham? Both loved and loathed for its brutalist concrete cityscape, Birmingham is the starting point for an exhibition that explores how modernist architecture – in fiction, film and art – has been used to tap into our deepest fears. • Ikon Gallery, Birmingham, 25 November-19 February 2023 The Factory, Manchester Providing a year-round home for the Manchester International festival, the £186m performance venue is finally due to open at the end of next year, following delays, cost escalations and redesigns. Created as a hangar-like shed, its Dutch architects OMA say it aims to “preserve the city’s rough edge, as a sort of resistance to the pervasive beautification of inner cities”. • December Sydney Modern Project, Art Gallery of New South Wales Designed by Japanese architects Sanaa as a series of white pavilions and canopy-covered sculpture terraces cascading down the hillside site, this £184m extension promises to be a light-flooded addition to Sydney’s main art gallery. It will almost double the current exhibition space, and will include an atmospheric underground gallery in a converted second world war oil tank. • Sydney, December"

          "headline": "No new Covid restrictions in England before new year, Boris Johnson says",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson will not introduce further Covid restrictions in England before 2022, giving mass events the go-ahead and leaving nightclubs open for New Year’s Eve – in contrast with all other UK nations. Scientists criticised the decision, which came as England recorded its highest number of Covid infections. One said it was the moment of “the greatest divergence between scientific advice and legislation” seen since the start of the pandemic. The announcement came after advisers told Johnson that significant NHS pressures were coming from staff absences rather than overcrowded intensive care units. One model has predicted that in London, where Covid rates are highest, up to 40% of staff could be absent because of sickness. Ministers are expected to continue to focus efforts on vaccination – including the booster rollout. Sources say most of the cases behind the rise in hospital admissions are people who are unvaccinated. The decision not to introduce curbs makes England an outlier in the UK, after Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland put limits on social gatherings and mass events. Johnson’s cabinet rejected new measures before Christmas, as cases of the Omicron variant started to rise. Three cabinet ministers who spoke to the Guardian on Monday said they remained deeply sceptical that any further measures were necessary. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, said people should take steps themselves to protect others. “We won’t be taking any further measures. Of course people should remain cautious as we approach new year celebrations and take a lateral flow test if that makes sense, celebrate outdoors if you can, have some ventilation indoors if you can,” he said. The call for caution was reiterated by the prime minister in a series of tweets on Monday night. “We will continue to monitor the data carefully, but there will be no new restrictions introduced in England before the new year,” he said. “However, I would urge everyone to continue to act cautiously given the rising number of Omicron cases. “Most importantly I urge everyone to get their first, second or booster jab without delay to protect yourselves and your loved ones.” England recorded 1,281 people admitted to hospital in England on Christmas Day – the most recent available figure – up from 1,020 the day before. Though it is the highest figure since mid-February, it is well below the highest in the pandemic when admissions reached 4,134 last January. Downing Street has been hopeful that if admissions in London stay below 400 a day, NHS capacity should remain stable. According to the latest data, 364 patients were admitted to hospital with Covid on Christmas Day in London, down slightly from a high of 390 admitted on 23 December. Case rates reached a new high of 113,628 on Christmas Day and fell to 98,515 on Monday, though the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) has previously cautioned that data will be unreliable over the festive period as testing and hospital admission patterns change. Johnson’s decision to rule out further curbs this year came after a crunch summit he chaired online from his Chequers residence, with England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance. Messaging from government will instead put an emphasis on personal responsibility. “Nothing in the data around hospitalisations is showing we need to put our foot on the accelerator,” a Number 10 source said. “It is not accelerating as quickly as it might have done. We just need to keep a close watch.” Javid said the most recent data showed there were disproportionate numbers of unvaccinated people being admitted to hospital and that there were 1.5m vaccination slots available over the next few days. “Can I please say to people, please do come forward,” he said. “Protect yourselves, protect your loved ones and protect your community.” Officials monitoring the data suggested that although there was a climb in hospital admissions, there was a more positive picture emerging when officials examined how long people were staying in hospital and those admitted to intensive care, along with analysis from the UK Health Security Agency suggesting Omicron was milder. One Whitehall source said the data received by NHS Trusts showed a particularly stark disparity between vaccinated and unvaccinated admissions to hospitals. “Those who are in ICUs are unvaccinated. It really brings home that should be the priority.” Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS providers – which represents trusts in England, said there were no reports of large numbers of patients requiring ventilators, and that the main pressure the NHS faced was staffing. “Talking to chief executives this morning, the sense is that admissions are rising but not precipitously so,” Hopson said, adding that a number of asymptomatic patients are being admitted to hospital for other reasons and then testing positive for Covid. “Trusts are not, at the moment, reporting large numbers of patients with Covid-type respiratory problems needing critical care or massively increased use of oxygen, both of which we saw in last January’s Delta variant peak.” Prof Alison Leary, the chair of healthcare and workforce modelling at London South Bank University, said the NHS absence rate in the capital had risen by 30% on normal levels as of Christmas Eve. Leary said one scenario modelled had predicted about 40% of the workforce being absent in London. Though the decision to rule out further restrictions before new year has delighted businesses, the move has divided scientists, several of whom said Johnson was gambling on an unclear picture during a period where data was often unreliable. Simon Clarke, an associate professor in Cellular Microbiology at the University of Reading cautioned that the latest case figures did not include data for samples taken between Christmas Eve and Boxing Day, and that it would only become clear how the virus had moved through the population over the Christmas period in the coming week or so. “While nobody wants to live under tighter controls, the public need to realise that if we end up with a significant problem of hospitalisations and mass sickness, it will be worse than if authorities had acted earlier,” he said. Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London said: “It does feel hard that, at a time when we need to all pull together to maximise all possible mitigations, we seem to have our greatest divergence between expert clinical/scientific advice and legislation.” Wes Streeting, the shadow health secretary, said the government needed to develop a coherent strategy to combat staffing pressures in hospitals and schools. “The government should publish, as a matter of urgency, the very latest data on hospitalisations and NHS staff absence rates, as well as up-to-date advice from Sage, so that the public can be reassured that they are genuinely following the data and scientific advice and that Boris Johnson is not simply capitulating to his own opponents in the Tory party,” he said."

Schools, however, have said high numbers of teacher absences as a result of self-isolation could mean they are forced to send whole year groups home. The education secretary, Nadhim Zahawi, has called on retired teachers and those who have left the profession to help fill the gaps. The general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, Geoff Barton, told the Telegraph that classroom closures could occur if schools had no alternative. “If you have a fixed pool available of those who can teach young people, then the only final resort schools and colleges have is to start thinking about the certain year groups that should be prioritised in the short term,” he said. Government guidance suggests teachers should open external windows and internal doors to improve natural ventilation and schools “should balance the need for increased ventilation while maintaining a comfortable temperature”. Opening windows is likely to be more difficult when schools return in cold January temperatures. The Lib Dem education spokesperson, Munira Wilson, said the government’s advice to use CO2 monitors was less effective because they give information on where more airflow is needed but do not affect the flow itself. Headteachers have also criticised the cost of the government’s preferred supplier for air filters – one of the units, made by Camfil City M, costs £1,170 and a Dyson model costs £424.82. Wilson said schools should not be paying for the units at all. “Failure to act right now will fail our children in the future. The government has a week to solve this, otherwise pupils will be left out in the cold and missing out on vital learning once again,” she said. “Nadhim Zahawi gave a cast-iron guarantee that schools would stay open. Unless he gets a grip on this quickly, he will be adding to the countless broken promises from this Government. Worse still, he will be breaking a promise to all our children.” The German government invested £452m in October 2020 in improving ventilation systems in public buildings, including schools, including upgrading air conditioning systems and air purifiers, described by the then-chancellor Angela Merkel as “one of the cheapest and most effective ways” of tackling Covid spread. New York City has also undertaken extensive ventilation surveys and distributed about 100,000 high efficiency particulate air (Hepa) purifiers."

          "bodyText": "At university we were given a task to explain how the readings we did that week on sexual coercion in the education system were applicable to the contexts we came from. A woman from a low income country went first, and described how “virginity testing” (where fingers are used to test if the hymen is still intact) was part of childhood schooling in her country. It was my turn directly after and I was slightly lost for words. “Uhh … I grew up in a privileged area of Australia so nothing like that happened to me in my schooling … but when I was doing the readings on sexual coercion, I realised I and people I knew experienced the behaviour described pretty much every weekend.” I was met with shock from the rest of the members of the group as I described the ways in which sexual coercion was a fundamental part of being a teenager in Australia. It was hard to comprehend for these people from all parts of the world that this could possibly occur. How could Australia let this happen? It’s such a “developed” country! This and two other pivotal conversations spurred me to ask my Instagram following if they or anyone close to them had been sexually assaulted by someone who went to an all-boys school in Sydney. Over weeks this turned into a national campaign demanding consent education with more than 45,000 signatures. It’s shocking to learn that Australia’s norm is riddled with human rights violations and gender-based violence. It hides under a big banner that screams “Australia is a safe and happy place” but our attitudes toward gender and sexuality have created power imbalances, taboos and widespread violence. I now look back on 2021 and think about the year that Australia said we want better. I admire the more than 6,700 people who named the school that their perpetrator of sexual assault went to. I remember every time a headline emerged about allegations involving people in the highest ranks of our country. I’m grateful that Brittany Higgins had the courage to come forward with her allegation that she was raped inside our very own Parliament House, which triggered the Jenkins report. I’m thankful Grace Tame used her platform to advocate for victims of child abuse in every way feasible. And I reflect in awe about the students across Australia who protested, shared petitions, walked out, stood up, and spoke out. All of this has meant that 2021 will be remembered for some big wins. After decades of women demanding so, and the tireless work of Saxon Mullins, an affirmative model of consent has been passed in New South Wales, and Victoria may soon follow. This reform is groundbreaking beyond the courtroom, because we stop assuming that the default access to a body is a yes, and that “only no means no”, and instead teach the community that without enthusiasm, sex is assault. In NSW parliament, a debate received unanimous, cross-party support for earlier and holistic consent education. It was triggered by 20,000 ordinary citizens who demanded it occurr. Then there were an estimated 110,000 people who attended March 4 Justice rallies nationally, which will go down in history as the biggest uprising against the treatment of women that Australia has seen to date. Outside the public sphere, in a time of reflection, myriads of conversations were held across Australia this year, and incrementally each one has contributed to nurturing a new Australia. This has not come without challenges. For many Australians this year, sexual assault dominating discourse has meant they have had to relive their own experiences, reveal personal details to people around them, or hear heartbreaking stories about loved ones. For some, it’s been a year where behaviours that have seemed normal in the past were suddenly branded as acts of violence. This is something I can say from experience is both confronting and empowering. For too many, these conversations involved finding out that people around them have opinions which have made them feel unsafe and unsupported. Yet, we still did it. We leveraged the work of human rights activists and feminists for generations before us so that those after us can do the same. This year, Australia learned that it can no longer plead ignorance. We have a problem, and it’s a gendered one. Experts have solutions, youth have opinions. Listen to them. I’ve read many news articles this year about Grace, Brittany and myself. While it has been an honour to be in their company in this way, I hope 2022 is the year where we better include and elevate the voices of traditionally marginalised groups of society. This is the only way we can truly turn Australia into a safe and happy place for all. Young Australians don’t care about taboos and we don’t care about expectations. We are making it clear that we want better in 2022 and we will keep marching, keep signing, keep walking out, and keep speaking up until we get it. Listen to us. • Chanel Contos grew up in Sydney, Australia. She has a masters in education, gender and international development from University College London, UK.

          "headline": "Unfinished business: eight things on Scott Morrison’s to-do list as election nears",
          "bodyText": "It’s been a huge political year, dominated again by the Covid-19 pandemic, and a federal election is just around the corner. Scott Morrison will want to go into that contest trumpeting the government’s achievements. But substantial items remain on the prime minister’s to-do list. Here is a selection of unfinished business. Aged care has more funding but deep problems remain It feels like a lifetime ago but a $17.7bn aged care package was the centrepiece of the May budget. That package was the government’s response to the damning findings of the aged care royal commission. Morrison and the health minister, Greg Hunt, adopted a great many, but not all, of the recommendations from the inquiry. One of the central measures was an extra $7.5bn allocated for home care, including $6.5bn to clear the waiting list of an estimated 80,000 people over the next two years, and about $800m to support 1.6 million informal carers, including respite services for 8,400 Australians. The government promised to allocate 40,000 additional home care packages in 2021-22 and the same in 2022-23. In early December the aged care minister, Richard Colbeck, released new quarterly data tracking progress. By the end of September, 10,000 additional places had been released. But as of 30 September, 74,143 people were still waiting for their home care package at their approved level. If you want to fix aged care, you need a workforce strategy. The Grattan Institute noted in December the government had “no clear plan to meet future workforce requirements” and “home care staff are underpaid for what they do”. In a report titled Unfinished Business: Practical Policies For Better Care At Home, the thinktank said 58,000 more carers would be needed just to meet the planned increase in home care places. “To attract and retain home care workers, they should get better pay and conditions,” the report said. The aged care royal commission recommended low wages be increased. The government “noted” that recommendation rather than supporting it. Respect@Work response lacks the central recommendation Back in June 2018, the then minister for women, Kelly O’Dwyer, convinced her cabinet colleagues to fund a new national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces by the sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins. In March 2020, Jenkins handed down 55 recommendations, including a proposal for employers to face an obligation to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation. When the government responded formally to the recommendations in April, it balked at the central proposal, saying it would assess whether the proposed positive duty may “create further complexity, uncertainty or duplication in the overarching legal framework”. In July Jenkins chided the government again on the positive duty, reminding it the problem in workplaces was much larger than “a few bad blokes”. But the central recommendation was omitted from the legislative reform package passed by parliament in late August. The government said it would continue to mull over the proposition. Equivocation about the key recommendation happened in the middle of the furore over the former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins’ allegation of sexual assault, the historic rape allegation against frontbencher Christian Porter, which he stridently denies, staff members sharing lewd pictures in Parliament House, and complaints about the online behaviour (not sexual) of Liberal National MP Andrew Laming towards two female constituents. The legislation omitting the positive duty was also passed immediately before the government’s National Summit on Women’s Safety – prompting the Australian of the Year, sexual assault survivor Grace Tame, to blast the government’s “clear pattern of denial, minimisation, ultimately dismissal of women’s issues”. Related: what will become of the Jenkins review? Higgins’ allegation of sexual assault triggered a reckoning inside federal politics. Jenkins was asked by the government to review parliament’s toxic workplace culture, and her insights about the prevalence of sexual harassment and bullying were bracing to say the least. Jenkins recommended a number of structural and cultural changes, including more normalised human resources processes for parliamentary staff. The report landed on 30 November. The finance minister, Simon Birmingham, says the first two recommendations will be implemented early next year, with changes to the workplace framework legislated before the election. We’ll see if that happens. That would be progress, but it would leave the bulk of the systemic changes to be implemented post-election. Voice to parliament remains voiceless The Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, signalled repeatedly during this term that he wanted to legislate a national voice to parliament. But the process has moved slowly. The government has also balked at enshrining the voice in the constitution, first proposed in the Uluru statement from the heart in 2017. The Uluru statement recommended a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, a Makarrata or truth-telling commission and an eventual treaty between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Just before Christmas Wyatt took the first steps towards a legislated option. Cabinet approved the establishment of 35 regional and local representative groups. Morrison said in August: “Some might want this process to be faster. I want it to be right.” The heroes of net zero? After a climate policy pivot spanning the best part of 12 months, and a torturous five-minutes-to-midnight negotiation with the Nationals, Morrison managed to land a new commitment to achieving net zero by 2050. But the policy underpinning the putative transition was entirely underwhelming. The prime minister also did not manage to persuade colleagues to increase the ambition of Australia’s current 2030 target. The Nationals vetoed that. Morrison will hope the government’s 2050 commitment is sufficient to shore up Liberals under electoral pressure from climate-focused independents in the coming election, but not ambitious enough to cause the Coalition political trouble in regional Queensland. In any case, the story is not over. Morrison will continue to face pressure to do more. Some Liberals are already pushing for a more ambitious target for 2035. Australia also agreed at the end of the Cop26 in Glasgow to re-examine our 2030 target by the end of next year. Aukus: will this ever happen and will the French forgive Australia? We all saw the big announcement – Joe Biden, Boris Johnson and “that fella from down under” unveiling a trilateral security partnership called Aukus. Eight planned nuclear submarines, the first of them unlikely to be in the water until about 2040, and 18 months before we determine precisely how to proceed. Aukus at the substantive level is a plan for a plan. Cost? Unknown, although the Australian Strategic Policy Institute says it could be as high as $171bn. When he signed up for Aukus, Morrison cancelled a $90bn contract with the French-owned Naval Group. Emmanuel Macron retaliated with a mic drop moment on the sidelines of the G20 meeting in November, branding Australia’s prime minister a liar. The former prime minister Paul Keating, concerned about a loss of strategic autonomy, delivered his verdict at the National Press Club. “Eight submarines against China when we get the submarines in 20 years’ time – it’ll be like throwing a handful of toothpicks at the mountain.” Integrity commission: will legislation ever be introduced? It’s long forgotten now, but on 13 December 2018, Morrison said he would proceed with two reforms – a religious discrimination bill (more of that shortly) and a federal integrity commission. The government had begun work to convert the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity into an anti-corruption body before Malcolm Turnbull lost the leadership. Morrison (who had once dismissed a federal body as a “fringe issue”) said in December 2018 the proposed commonwealth integrity commission would have a public sector division and a law enforcement division. He said his federal model would “avoid the serious failings of state-based integrity bodies that on too many occasions have proved to be kangaroo courts falling victim to poor process and being little more than a forum for self-serving mud slinging and the pursuit of personal, corporate and political vendettas”. Experts promptly deemed the proposal deeply suboptimal. The ensuing consultation process was then dragged out for years. The government had a draft of its preferred legislation ready in January 2020, but Porter, the attorney general at the time, didn’t want to flag it “during the holiday period”. He warned the “consultation process will be extensive and will take as long as necessary to ensure the model we deliver has the powers and resources it needs to be effective, while also avoiding the pitfalls that have been seen with similar state-based bodies”. The final legislation threatened to surface in the final two parliamentary sitting weeks of 2021, but it didn’t land in the parliament. Morrison attempted to blame Labor. But his problem was internal. One of his backbenchers crossed the floor in an effort to trigger debate on a stronger model being championed by independent MP Helen Haines. Religious discrimination: introduced but passage is uncertain On that same day in December 2018, Morrison told reporters he was “looking to legislate before the election” a religious discrimination bill. But the proposal would be slow going because of different objectives within the government. Some wanted a law to protect “religious freedom” – giving Australians a positive right to express religious opinions. Morrison had once declared there was “no more fundamental liberty” than freedom of religion. But others had significant reservations. Porter produced a hybrid – an anti-discrimination bill with more assertive religious freedom elements. By July 2019, Morrison told the opening session of the Hillsong annual conference that the religious freedom debate was too rights oriented, and it was “not the laws that make freedom of religion work, it’s the culture that accepts it”. Roll forward to the final parliamentary sitting fortnight of 2021, and the same internal divisions that had made the proposal so difficult to land continued to fester. In an effort to get the bill to parliament, the current attorney general, Michaelia Cash, agreed to drop the divisive “Folau clause”, which would have protected employers from claims of indirect discrimination if they sanctioned employees for misconduct for expressing religious beliefs. But the internal wrangling continues, with the fate of the legislation uncertain. Just before Christmas, Cash appeared to renege on a deal with Liberal moderates on the package. Moderates want immediate changes to protect gay students from discrimination in religious schools."

          "headline": "Are my kids getting carried away in their flights from reality?",
          "bodyText": "Never confuse fantasy and “realty”. It’s a sentence that has floated, jokingly, around my family ever since my father’s colleague uttered the bungle to him years ago. We New Yorkers, of course, never confuse fantasy and realty. But in our house we happily confuse the two all the time. For months last year, when we were making our way through Laura Ingalls Wilder’s Little House on the Prairie series, my kindergartner would stride around the apartment in a full pioneer girl’s getup, complete with bonnet, asking me how best to break the oxen or till the land. She committed, deeply, to the role, cut from the same cloth as Jeremy Strong and other method actors, insisting her pajamas were made of calico and roasting in the dress throughout the summer, even as she pretended a blizzard was swirling outside and she could see her breath in the air. “You want some ice cream?” This, my preschooler asks from various perches as her imaginary ice cream stand roams the living room, the sadistic vendor offering flavors that are, often, suddenly sold out. On rare occasions, she’ll morph into a doctor, offering shots with her scoops, though she’s highly specialized, treating but one ailment: jumping so high on the trampoline that you hurt your arm. It’s some botched version of what happened to her older sister, who fractured her elbow last year after a fall from some monkey bars, but remains seared in her mind as something very bad that can be fixed with a quick injection. And in the last few weeks, her pretend play has gotten even more intense, with nightly demands for trampoline accident– related bedtime stories. “At two and a half, three years old, the fuzziness between reality and fantasy is blurred,” Kathy Hirsh-Pasek told me when I reached her by phone. “And I think fantasy is very powerful for kids – it’s a safe place.” Hirsh-Pasek is a professor of psychology at Temple University, where she studies child development, and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. I called her in the hopes that she could put my children’s amped-up pretend play into the context of our chaotic year. Was it a plea for help, an indication that our new normal, with its constantly moving lines in the sand – you can see Nana and Papa indoors, but with masks, or maybe only outside, but at a distance; here’s a Zoom kit sent home from school before winter break, which we may have to use, but probably not – was taking its toll? When Hirsh-Pasek’s children were in that liminal reality-fantasy age, she told me, there were real monsters in their closet. “So we did a whole ceremony with dream catchers, we turned the mattress around, we grabbed the monsters and threw them down the toilet,” she remembered. “We were letting the kids know that they have the power to control something, even if they don’t. It’s a really powerful message.” And it may be particularly important now, when children, however sheltered from the specifics of this rolling uncertainty, are internalizing more than we know. “They pick up on every little thing we do, they model it, they understand it, they watch us like they are sociologists,” Hirsh-Pasek said. “And we’ve been a wreck.” I may not be wearing a calico dress and doling out shots for hyper-specific trampoline accidents, but haven’t we all been living, a little bit, in fantasy land over the past year and a half? Every time I make and then cancel dinner plans; every time I convince myself that by this or that date, I won’t have to affix a tiny surgical mask on to my pint-sized urban doctor and send her off to preschool; every night I think I’ll forego that handful, or three, of leftover Halloween candy to take the edge off – it’s all fantasy. But, for a few moments, I live in that safe space. Kids just do it for way longer, finding real comfort in their imagination. The kindergartner and I just finished reading The BFG, which I found to be both a particularly enjoyable way to suspend reality, but also a wonderful allegory for parenting during the pandemic. For the four people out there who have not yet read this Roald Dahl classic (spoilers ahead), it’s about a Big Friendly Giant and an orphan, Sophie, who catches sight of him one dark night from the orphanage window, as he’s blowing something into a child’s room across the way. He sees her looking, scoops her up, and whisks her off to Giant Country, where she learns that while the BFG catches dreams and blows them into children’s rooms at night, there are other evil giants who roam the world, snatching people from their beds and eating them. The plot turns when Sophie and the BFG decide to do something about it. In the end, the bad giants get captured, and, as in so much of Dahl’s fiction, the child triumphs. “It’s offering a way to say yeah, there are some monsters out there, but guess what, we have the power to deal with them,” Hirsh-Pasek told me. “Fantasy can make things that are scary not so scary, help kids cope just a little bit better, and show them that with us, they have the power to change anything.” She paused. “Maybe that’s not 1,000% honest. I get that. But I’m down with fantasy.” (She later sent me a study concluding that young children often learn real-world information better if it’s presented in a fantastical story that violates real world paradigms.) The other night, hoping to prolong my nightly escapes with Dahl, I looked up the name on The BFG’s inscription page: Olivia. A quick Google search heaved the moment on its axis, refocusing everything like a Hitchcockian dolly zoom shot. Olivia was Dahl’s daughter, who died suddenly in 1962, at age seven, of encephalitis brought on by the measles. “As the illness took its usual course, I can remember reading to her often in bed and not feeling particularly alarmed about it,” he wrote in a widely distributed open letter urging parents to vaccinate their children, published during a measles outbreak in 1986. “Then one morning, when she was well on the road to recovery, I was sitting on her bed showing her how to fashion little animals out of coloured pipe-cleaners, and when it came to her turn to make one herself, I noticed that her fingers and her mind were not working together … In an hour, she was unconscious. In twelve hours she was dead.” He dedicated James and the Giant Peach to Olivia when she was still alive. Twenty years after her death, he published The BFG with her name at its front. As Dahl knew so well, in fantasy, you can do anything: make rivers of chocolate, fly inside giant peaches, even bring daughters back to life. The conceit of the book, which you learn in the last few pages, is that the BFG actually wrote the thing, and just published it under another name. The night we finished, my kindergartner looked at the cover for a while. “I don’t think that’s actually true,” she said. My heart sank, imagining her passing over that invisible boundary, from fantasy-believer to hardened realist, a transition I feared might be accelerated by the last few years. Then, as she closed her eyes and started to drift off, she mumbled, “I think what actually happened is that Sophie told the story to Roald Dahl, and he wrote it down.” And of course, in a way, she’s right.

          "headline": "This chaotic NFL season augurs the most wide-open playoffs in years",
          "bodyText": "If the NFL was hoping to keep more teams in the playoff hunt longer by expanding the regular season from 17 weeks to 18, well, mission accomplished. Week 16’s slate of games is nearly completed, yet much remains unsettled, particularly in the still wide-open AFC. If there’s one team that’s taken advantage of their situation, it would be the Kansas City Chiefs, who are currently the only team in the conference guaranteed a playoff spot. It feels like ages ago, but it was only late October when the preseason favorites looked to be in serious trouble. After a demoralizing 27-3 loss to the Tennessee Titans, the Chiefs had stumbled from the gate with a perplexing 3-4 record. Since then, however, they have rattled off eight straight victories and look to be in great shape to make their third straight Super Bowl. While previous Chiefs teams were famous for outscoring opponents, this Kansas City team has found a more sustainable model of success, as their Patrick Mahomes-driven offense is now balanced by what has become one of the league’s best defenses. It’s to the point, where the Chiefs easily handled the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday despite being without all-world tight end Travis Kelce, who was on the team’s Covid-19 list. With Sunday’s 36-10 victory over the Steelers, Kansas City became the first team in the AFC to clinch their division, partly thanks to the New England Patriots’ own reversal of fortune over in the East. On top of that, they are one game ahead of the Tennessee Titans for the conference’s top seed. Coincidentally enough, the Chiefs’ Super Bowl LV opponents also clinched their division on Sunday. The 11-4 Tampa Bay Buccaneers have won the NFC South for the first time since 2007. Even before the season began, it felt like a rematch between these two squads was potentially in the cards and it hasn’t looked more possible than it does now. However, given how relatively competitive the NFC has been this year, the Chiefs have a clearer path to a championship than the Bucs. Tampa Bay’s record looks sterling, but they are missing key elements of their offense: running back Leonard Fournette and wide receiver Mike Evans both suffered hamstring strains while receiver Chris Godwin is out for the foreseeable future thanks to a torn ACL. On top of this. linebacker Shaq Barrett strained his MCL during Sunday’s win over the Carolina Panthers. Meanwhile, their competition looms. Despite his recent heel turn, reigning MVP Aaron Rodgers hasn’t forgotten how to play football: he has helped lead the 12-3 Green Bay Packers to the best record in the league. The Los Angeles Rams and the Dallas Cowboys – both of whom also clinched a playoff berth on Sunday – have identical 11-4 records, and LA holds a tiebreaker over Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, right now, the Chiefs are the only AFC team that knows its season will last beyond Week 18. These are, however, only regular-season records. While rewards like a bye week and home-field advantage provide huge dividends come the playoffs, they don’t guarantee anything in a single-game elimination format. Look at the defending world champions, who came into last postseason as a wild-card team and still went on to finagle a victory over extremely talented opponents. This brings us back to the chaos of the 2021 NFL season. At no point has a team looked invulnerable and – with the obvious exception of the season’s bottom-feeders (the Detroit Lions and the Jacksonville Jaguars) – every team has seemed capable of putting together a winning streak. It hasn’t helped that teams have had to piece together pandemic-ravaged active rosters as they continually lose players to Covid-19 and the surrounding protocols. When the postseason comes, it’s not set in stone that previous results will dictate future success or failure. Right now, the Chiefs looked primed to make their third straight Super Bowl appearance, but if there’s one lesson to take away from this year it’s not to read too much into the current NFL landscape. Video of the week Maybe things would be better for the Jets if they just played the Jacksonville Jaguars every game. Not only did the much-maligned Zach Wilson go off on a 54-yard touchdown run, but the Jaguars allowed a 102-yard kickoff return to Braxton Berrios. In any case, it was a rare entertaining win for the Jets, who beat Jacksonville 26-21, which meant it was a day-after-Christmas miracle for the waitress who received Jets tickets from Wilson as a tip. MVP of the week Joe Burrow, QB, Cincinnati Bengals. His 299 passing yards were the most a quarterback picked up in the first half of an NFL game all season. He ended throwing for 525 total yards and four touchdowns, without a single interception. What can you say? The dude really loves playing against the Baltimore Ravens. OK, it didn’t hurt Burrow or his receivers that the Ravens’ defense has been decimated by illness and injuries, but that’s not enough to explain the sophomore signal-caller’s utter dominance. Baltimore’s injuries weren’t just limited to the defensive end of the game, they were without both of its quarterbacks in Lamar Jackson and Taylor Huntley. So, the very well-traveled Josh Johnson ended up starting for Baltimore on Sunday and while he threw two touchdowns himself, it obviously wasn’t enough for the Ravens, who were beaten 41-21. Stat of the week 1940. That was the last time the Pittsburgh Steelers went five straight games without a first-half touchdown. While the Steelers won two of those five games, they are still in great danger of dropping out of the postseason mix after their blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. At this rate, we might see the end of Ben Roethlisberger’s career sooner than we anticipated. Quote of the week “Football aside, sorry, but I’m doing a story about New Year’s resolutions and I was just wondering if you had any you wanted to share with your fans and our readers?” – a reporter to New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick following his team’s 33-21 loss to the Buffalo Bills Infamously, Belichick’s professional demeanor is such that when he uncharacteristically issued an apology for his treatment of the media last week, it was a massive local news story. If there ever was not a time to throw up a softball, human interest question to him, it was not after his team’s most unfortunate loss of the regular season. The 9-6 Patriots have now lost their last two games while the Bills have won their last two and – just like that – things are all tied up on the top of the AFC East. If Buffalo win out, they will win the division that New England could have clinched. Given that he just witnessed Josh Allen absolutely slice through the vaunted Patriots defense, it’s understandable that the coach replied “not right now”. When it comes to football, the entire team’s resolution should be not to fall out of the wild-card standings. In any case, all of this is good news for the 7-7 Miami Dolphins, whose playoff hopes remain alive heading into Monday night’s game against the New Orleans Saints. Elsewhere around the league • The NFL attempted to crowd into the NBA’s gimmick by giving us a pair of Christmas Day games. In the first, the Green Bay Packers faced the Cleveland Browns. Cleveland QB Baker Mayfield threw three interceptions in the first half, each one of which eventually resulted in an Aaron Rodgers touchdown. The Browns made a solid comeback attempt but the game essentially ended on – what else? – a fourth Mayfield interception. The Packers won 24-22 while the Browns are forced to spend another week speculating about Mayfield’s near and long-term future with the franchise. • On Saturday’s second game, the Arizona Cardinals continued their inexplicable late-season slide, falling to the Indianapolis Colts 22-16. In the game, running back Jonathan Taylor failed to record a touchdown but he continued his own MVP campaign by putting together a 108-yard rushing performance in front of a depleted offensive line. • The Detroit Lions kept their losing ways alive with a 20-16 loss to the Atlanta Falcons that dropped their record to 2-12-1. Comically, that one tie continues to be their undoing in their quest for the number one pick in next year’s draft. The Jacksonville Jaguars’ previously discussed loss to the New York Jets dropped their record to 2-13, the league’s overall worst. • The quarterback cavalcade continues in Carolina as Sam Darnold has returned to replace fan favorite Cam Newton, who once again struggled after making an impressive season debut. Instead of picking one, Panthers head coach Matt Rhule decided instead to rotate the pair depending on the in-game situation. As noted earlier, this time around it resulted in a 32-6 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Rhule’s sticking with his platoon strategy, however. “I believe it’s 1000% working,” a defiant Rhule said after the game, “I just know nobody can see it and I apologize. As I tell our team all the time, it took Jay Z seven years.” Jay Z was unavailable for comment. • With their 30-23 win over the Minnesota Vikings, the 11-4 Los Angeles Rams secured a playoff berth despite three interceptions from quarterback Matthew Stafford. As Baker Mayfield could tell you, it’s the fourth INT that really puts a nail in your team’s coffin."

          "headline": "Global financial markets brace for a bumpy ride in 2022 ",
          "bodyText": "Financial markets are poised for a bumpy ride in 2022 in the face of soaring inflationary pressure, rising interest rates and ongoing disruption to international supply chains caused by the Omicron variant of coronavirus, experts have said. Analysts and financial investors said Omicron’s emergence had raised the prospect of a stagflationary start to the new year, with weaker levels of economic growth despite intensifying price pressures in already stretched supply chains. The winter energy crisis will also weigh on Europe’s economies. “Covid vaccines and treatments will take some of the edge off any social disruption we may face, and while many businesses have learned to trade through the stops and starts of the pandemic, a return of substantial winter restrictions [in the UK] and abroad would be a blow for the global economy,” said Laith Khalaf, the head of investment analysis at AJ Bell. If the pandemic does ease in 2022 as hoped, central banks are expected to raise interest rates or cut back on their multitrillion-dollar quantitative easing bond-buying stimulus programmes to try to rein in inflation. The US Federal Reserve said this month that it anticipated raising borrowing costs three times in 2022, which could spook markets and weaken a recovery that is already expected to slow in 2022. “High inflation has central banks feeling the heat, but by late 2022 we see a very different backdrop, with stagnation a bigger risk than stagflation,” said analysts at the Japanese bank Nomura. Victor Golovtchenko, of the online broker Think Markets, said the US Fed was in the unenviable position of choosing between “persistently high inflation numbers, and persistently overvalued financial markets”. Joost Beaumont, a senior fixed income strategist at the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said the coming year would be choppy for markets as a result. “We expect tighter global financial conditions, in particular from Fed rate hikes and rising US rates to again trigger bouts of volatility in markets.” AJ Bell’s Khalaf said the bond market must face a day of reckoning eventually, unless monetary policy never normalises. “It might be a gradual deflation rather than an explosive rupture, but it does look like a question of when, not if. Long dated government bonds would be most in the firing line, so bond investors could seek to protect themselves by looking to shorter dated bonds, higher yielding markets, and strategic funds that employ a flexible approach,” Khalaf said. The Bank of England is also expected to raise interest rates in 2022, perhaps two or three times, having unexpectedly lifted its main interest rate to 0.25% at its December meeting despite concerns over Omicron. “In a very different modus operandi from the last pandemic resurgence, central banks are now on a firm tightening road,” said George Lagarias, the chief economist at Mazars. “We believe that for 2022, investors should at the very least be prepared for more volatility.” Surging energy prices in Europe and Asia drove inflation higher this year, as supplies struggled to meet demand after the easing of lockdown measures over the summer across advanced economies. Inflation is expected to stay elevated in the short term but could then drop back through the year. Bill Blain, a market strategist and the head of alternative assets at Shard Capital, said investors had not priced in the winter energy crisis that is driving up bills and forcing some factories to suspend work. “Markets are vastly underestimating just what higher power prices are going to do to corporate earnings and growth across the globe,” he said. Europe is particularly vulnerable, while power outages and “industrial dislocation” in China could cause fresh supply chain chaos, Blain added. High-growth but low-profitability tech stocks may fare badly in a world of higher inflation and rising interest rates. The share prices of many of those pandemic winners such as Zoom and Peloton have already fallen back from record highs in 2021. Paul Craig, a portfolio manager at Quilter Investors, said extreme growth-oriented stocks may continue to struggle. “We are potentially witnessing the end of the valuation bubble in emerging startups, hyper-growth and companies wearing tech clothing, and it would not be a shock to see more pain going into 2022,” he said. The US economy could stutter if Joe Biden does not get his $1.75tn (£1.31tn) Build Back Better legislation through the Senate, where the Democratic senator Joe Manchin is blocking the package. A slowdown or worse in China could also jolt markets in 2022. “Despite Beijing’s recent shift in policy stance, we expect growth to weaken further in spring 2022 on a worsening property sector, rising costs of the zero-Covid strategy, an export downturn and widespread factory closures before and during the Winter Olympics,” said Nomura, which fears “the worst is yet to come”. “We expect Beijing to take more decisive action to arrest the downward spiral in spring 2022, and growth could bottom out after that,” Nomura added. Weaker growth in the world’s second largest economy could pull commodity prices down. Oxford Economics predict iron ore prices will end 2022 below current levels, while Beijing is expected to press its steel industries to curb greenhouse gas emissions. Higher vaccination rates, particularly in emerging markets, will be crucial to fighting the pandemic and easing supply chain bottlenecks, said Seema Shah, the chief strategist at Principal Global Investors. “In 2022, governments in emerging market [EM] countries accelerating the pace of vaccination should become more tolerant of Covid and ease strict containment policies. This means some Covid-driven activity surges for EM still lie ahead, providing a promising opportunity to extend the reopening trade. It also likely implies less frequent factory and port closures,” Shah said. There is also the risk of geopolitical turmoil on the horizon; with Russian troops massing at the Ukraine border, increased tensions between Taiwan and China, and elections in the US and France. Will Hobbs, the chief investment officer at Barclays Wealth and Investments, said: “The straits of Taiwan have been hotting up, as has Ukraine’s border with Russia. Right now, many will argue that the liberal democratic model is the one that looks a little more rickety. Upcoming elections will continue to be nervy affairs for a while yet – US midterms and French presidential elections are the ones to watch in 2022.” Most Wall Street banks have forecast that equities will keep rising in 2022, adding to strong gains in 2020 and 2021. Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, has a positive outlook on stocks for the start of 2022. “Global economic growth is likely to remain above trend for the first half of 2022, monetary policy is still accommodative, even if emergency support measures are being scaled back, and we expect 10% growth in global corporate earnings in the year ahead,” he said. But strategists at Bank of America predicted a slightly negative year, as “there are too many similarities between today and 1999-2000 to ignore.” The UK still stands out as cheap and unloved compared with other markets, said Alex Wright, the portfolio manager of Fidelity’s special situations fund. That could mean further takeover action in the next 12 months, if overseas predators pounce on undervalued UK companies. “UK equities remain significantly undervalued compared to global markets and reasonably valued in absolute terms. This has been reflected in a meaningful uptick in M&amp;A activity, which has been a key contributor to performance for our funds. We are likely to see more bids if valuation discounts compared to overseas companies do not close,” he said. But dangers abound as the new year approaches. “The three main risks lie in a policy mistake causing financial havoc, a disorderly energy transition seeing a surge in selected commodity prices, and a nasty variant escaping vaccine protection,” analysts at Generali Investments said."

          "bodyText": "Seven years ago, in the year before I met the wonderful man I would fall in love with and go on to marry, I had a short but intense relationship with someone I had known as a friend of friends for some time. I’d suddenly and unexpectedly found myself becoming besotted with him after we suddenly and unexpectedly found ourselves sleeping together. JC was very tall, very handsome and very intelligent. Like me, he was recently out of a long-term relationship, and we were both enjoying the sexual freedom that came from not being committed to anyone. I don’t remember exactly how we ended up in bed together the first time, but I do remember liking it very much and rather hoping that it might happen again, which it did – with some regularity. While he could be very affectionate, he made it clear from the outset that he didn’t consider – or want – us to be anything more than friends with benefits. For much of the time we were carrying on our affair – relationship? Fling? I’m still not sure how to categorise it – I thought I was fine with that. I was certain I didn’t want to be in a committed relationship at that time, with him or anyone else. Yet when we were out together and he went home with somebody else, or when I heard he’d slept with someone after the last time we’d met, I found myself minding more and more, while knowing that I had no right to. It began to make me miserable. Winter came and, along with the cold, something that resembled common sense started to set in. I realised that I was besotted not so much with him, as the idea of him. I was enjoying la douleur exquise of wanting someone so unobtainable., and without even discussing it with him (you can’t really break up with someone you’re not actually going out with), I ended it with JC. Or so I thought. Late one very cold night at a notoriously debauched supper club, I was just getting stuck into my starter when I began receiving text messages from JC that seemed to speak directly to the feelings I’d been experiencing but had not expressed. “You know what you mean to me,” he said. Did I? I wasn’t sure. “You know I want what you want” – well, this was news to me. But my heart raced and my pulse quickened and, rather than sit at the table texting, I went outside and gave him a call. I was bitterly cold outside in just a T-shirt, and then it began to snow. Then JC told me, unprompted and as if reading my mind, that he loved me and didn’t want to be without me, but nor did he want to be in a relationship with me. The snow grew heavier and the wind blew it around in dramatic whorls, but I couldn’t bear to interrupt the moment to go back inside. I needed to hear what was being said, and a blizzard wasn’t going to prevent that. Half an hour later, my very drunk dinner companions having barely registered my absence, I returned to the table red-nosed and blue-faced. My skin was simultaneously freezing and burning, and I’d lost all feeling in my extremities. But I had heard things I’d needed to hear, which made it all worthwhile. I had known love in a cold climate. Shortly afterwards, by mutual agreement this time, JC and I did end things, acknowledging that there was nowhere for us, as a “we”, to go. We remain close friends to this day; although we have both gone on to long-term, more fulfilling relationships, I think he would agree that we had something special, whatever it was. On reflection, I’m not sure it was worth nearly contracting frostbite for. But what is life if we don’t sometimes do foolish things in order to know that we are loved?"

          "headline": "‘I do surfing’: an AI-generated Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook’s bad year",
          "bodyText": "What does Mark Zuckerberg care about? The 37-year-old tech executive has a wife, two kids, $110bn , and near absolute control over a group of companies – Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp – that shape the information, entertainment, and communication of 3 billion people. But in a year that kicked off with those companies playing a major role in fueling a violent and conspiracy-addled riot at the US Capitol on 6 January, and closed with a whistleblower revealing just how much Facebook knew – and concealed from the public – about the damage it was doing to individuals and societies, Zuckerberg has himself seemed remarkably unbothered. Gone is the Zuckerberg who repeated apologies and pledges to take a broader view of Facebook’s responsibility ad nauseum. New Zuck (dare we call him “metaZuck”?) appears to be primarily focused on his super relatable hobbies (electric surfing, fencing, hydrofoiling, boar hunting) and building a fantasy world that he hasn’t managed to mess up – yet. “I just decided to focus more on some of the awesome things we’re building, and doing more fun things with my family and friends,” Zuckerberg said to a fan who asked about the secret to his being “super laid-back and funny these last few months”. The Guardian would have loved to ask Zuckerberg some follow-up questions about that, but since metaZuck isn’t doing much in the way of sitting for interviews with critical journalists these days, we fell back upon a last resort: we built another Zuckerbot and interviewed it instead. To do this, we worked with Botnik Studios to create a predictive keyboard trained on the past two years of Zuckerberg’s public statements (archived by Marquette University’s Zuckerberg Files). Our previous interview with the Zuckerbot, conducted in 2019 and based on Zuck’s statements from 2016 to 2019, can be found here. Guardian journalists provided the questions; Botnik used the predictive keyboard to generate the answers. Hi Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to talk to the Guardian. It’s been a busy two years since we spoke, and your company has now been implicated in even more violence and unrest around the world. Congratulations! Thank you for welcoming me here today with your own self. Being present with you in person is going to be a killer part of history. To start, you recently changed Facebook’s name to Meta. Why? Imagine a multiplayer game where you pay off a bunch of publications who are physically afraid of content. This is the basic idea behind the internet. Now look up at the sun, close your eyes, feel completely wrapped in virtual goods and commerce. That is the ultimate expression of social networks. That is the metaverse. Can you share any details about what kinds of new experiences will be possible in the metaverse? We tested a model where a big Priscilla avatar fried people using an energy field if they said false things about my friends, and I think it’s going to unlock a lot of new community policies. The metaverse is really just about playing video games, right? The metaverse is a big, valuable baked dumpling full of content without nudity. How long do you think it will take for Meta to be implicated in a campaign of genocide or ethnic violence? The hardest technology to deliver is peace. We built tools that businesses can go, “OK, look at this inflection point. Now we’re entering into the metaverse. Blood conflict is just spam. Thank you, but I never want extreme stuff.” This vision is a reality if you peer through a custom headset. Do you have another name lined up for the rebrand after that? We have some fun brands around at this company for the last year of the metaverse. I really love “Click and Forget”, and then there is “Civilization Meats”, and we took a very different direction with “Earth Problem From Facebook”. We have a lot of these, so we think we’ll be awesome for a few years. Facebook has shown itself to be utterly incapable of policing its platform in this universe. What makes you think things will be better in the metaverse? Think about the metaverse as a symptom of our existence and you will actually feel completely hot for businesses. I believe that we’re building a type of modern relationship where people are spending time grilling with their sentient loans. Recently, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen left the company with a trove of documents that were shared with major news outlets. What is your response to her release of research showing that Facebook knew its products were harming society, and frequently failed to act? I think that people like that are big challenges that we’re dealing with all the time. We built a robot to go back to the beginning of Facebook and deleted all the data, so that’s going to be pretty cool in the past. The documents reveal that Facebook spends about 90% of its resources fighting misinformation on the United States, and 10% on the rest of the world, while about 10% of Facebook’s users are in the United States, and 90% are in the rest of the world. How do you justify that? In the world, we can do nothing to help. In America, we have to deal with senators and Elected Joe, so we build systems that stop terrorists from hacking your news. In VR, you can teleport to the news publishers’ newsroom and ask them if the information is real (they are going to misuse this, but it’s going to be really exciting to see). You appear to have spent a lot of time in recent years focused on your hobbies: hydrofoiling, e-surfing, VR fencing, boar hunting, and destroying democracy. What’s your secret to maintaining a good work-life balance? I am reminded of my favorite multiplayer experience: values. These are really important for relationships and I think generally they are the future of communication. So much fun for me to sit down with some pretty fundamental values and interests like Peloton bike and augmented traffic and just think about all kinds of topics. Instagram has stolen stories from Snapchat, Reels from Tiktok and IGTV from YouTube. What future plans do you have for further IP theft? We all want to take advantage of creators like that, but there’s a different way – yeah, I mean, basically just going in their data to help me to a compelling version of the issues, then also log in to the same tools that they were trying to work on and, um, we will actually be able to have their content remotely deleted. The metaverse is going to support that. Will you let your own children use Instagram, given your own company’s research into how harmful it can be to children’s mental health? Teenagers have a lot of ways to express their views on the internet and now they have one more; they can monetize their families with our “family permanence experience”. You were raised Jewish and have said religion is very important to you. How do you think God will judge you? I believe deeply in a wireless experience you have in the Next Time. You get a mentor and you see a cool effect, and then you go to juvenile detention center in the metaverse. It has a massive amount of problematic goods and it has solar-powered privacy controls that you can break by talking. And it has a major part with a judgment room, right in the top. In this room we are always faced by ourselves. This is inspiring for a second, but it starts to be clear that you are very afraid. That’s gonna be a big part of the challenge in the world to come. You control a 55% voting stake in your company. What safeguards exist to check your power? I need to ask permission from a big personal influence – my parents. They don’t expect that their friends will like the new things I’ve done. Hopefully, later on helping me will become their lives but for now we’re gonna roll with social media for all kinds of ages. Let’s play a game. What are two truths and one lie about yourself? One: I have no company. Two: I have no tolerance for the town square. Three: I do surfing and I am grateful for the world of water. Do you still think Facebook is making the world a better place? The world is going to end, and if we don’t make money from that, then we should just sit down in the water and make Reels right into the last couple of days."

          "headline": "Jamie Dornan: ‘spoilt-for-choice’ TV viewers risk discarding shows too soon",
          "bodyText": "Television is going through a golden age but viewers are so spoilt for choice there is a danger people miss the good stuff, the actor Jamie Dornan has said. Dornan is about to be seen on film in Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast and on television in BBC One’s six-part thriller The Tourist. In an interview with the Radio Times, he said it was a golden age of television, but that came with danger. “We are so spoilt for choice,” he said. “And you’ve also got that ability now where if you’re not enjoying it, you move on to the next thing. Which I think is a bit dangerous. “You know, it’s sad. How many times do we watch stuff and say: ‘I wasn’t sure – it took me three episodes to get into it.’ But it’s still hard to get stuff made. If you’ve got to the stage of getting it made, chances are there’s something good in there, and you’ve just got to give it a chance.” Dornan was a hugely successful model before turning to acting with a smouldering appearance in Sofia Coppola’s 2006 film Marie Antoinette, which led to a piece in the New York Times headlined “The Golden Torso”. His breakthrough came as the sexy serial killer in the BBC drama series The Fall, starring alongside Gillian Anderson. He gained further stardom, as well as much derision, for his portrayal of Christian Grey in the film adaptation of the sadomasochistic romp Fifty Shades of Grey. That was followed by the critically panned Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw described Dornan’s performances in Fifty Shades of Grey as “strictly daytime soap”. His performance in Belfast, on the other hand, has been widely praised, with speculation that he may make it on to the best supporting actor Oscar shortlist. The film goes on general release next month but has already picked up five-star reviews from festival screenings. In The Tourist, Dornan plays a nameless British man who wakes up in the Australian outback with amnesia and who is being pursued by dangerous, shady figures from his past. At the start of the year, while Dornan was quarantining in an Australian hotel before the shoot, his father, Prof Jim Dornan, an obstetrician and gynaecologist, died from Covid. “We’ve all had some sort of testing experience, albeit some more than others,” Dornan said. “As bad as the personal impact on me has been, I’m hoping that something positive comes out of Covid in that this will, in our lifetime, probably be the one thing that worldwide we’ve all experienced together. It’s impacted us all in different ways, of course, but hopefully will have a unifying quality.”"

          "bodyText": "My entire experience of Auckland changed when I got a boat. It was the perfect antidote to a professional DJ lifestyle, where getting up at 5am to be on the water become immeasurably preferable to coming home at 5am from work. On trips out I began sticking my head underwater with such vigour that I somehow turned it into a whole new profession. It didn’t happen straight away, of course. My 40-year-old, 14-foot beige fibreglass boat with a semi-reliable two-stroke engine, named Brown Thunder, only had so much range, and my real goal lay much farther offshore, tantalisingly out of reach. A place where tales of clear blue tropical water and huge fish swirled around a group of uninhabited islands, teasing me from the pages of marine magazines or the crusty lips of old salty sea-mates. I don’t mind sharing the Mokohinau Islands with you because getting to them is not an easy trip. They’re just shy of 40km out to sea, with no shelter in between, with calm weather windows fleeting. A bit of wind against tide can quickly make an uncomfortable trip turn dangerous. Of course, this only adds to the intrigue. From launch the islands aren’t visible but trusting a compass bearing the horizon gradually throws up a lump of land that splits into three on approach. It’s precisely this remoteness that makes the islands so special to me. The Auckland isthmus is lapped by different oceans. On the Pacific side, the Hauraki Gulf is described as the city’s jewel in the crown. It’s an expanse of water filled with more than 50 islands and an incredible diversity of life. More than 20% of all the world’s seabirds can be found here; five of these birds breed no where else on Earth. And out along one boundary lies the Mokohinau Islands, the location a true convergence zone where the rich gulf waters merge with a distinct eastern current. In summer this warm conveyor belt brings a stunning range of tropical visitors. I have found myself in the water here with tuna, marlin, mako sharks, bronze whalers, manta rays, sunfish, false killer whales, real killer whales, pilot whales and even a massive spine-tailed devil ray. As an active freediver I have been humbled in huge vortex clouds of blue mao mao, giant schools of trevally, acres of kahawai and, of course, New Zealand’s legendary monster yellowtail kingfish. They are an internationally renowned sportfish and New Zealand happens to hold 23 of the 24 world records relating to them. I was even lucky enough to once win the national Kingfish Cup, spearing a specimen of 34kg – all at this magical place fishers affectionately call “the Mokes” but I like to refer to as Jurassic Park. The rock formations that rise out of the water differ to the mainland so much that visitors I bring here describe it feeling more like Thailand than Aotearoa. On the right tide I can fit my boat through an archway into a lagoon in the middle of one island, half expecting Leonardo DiCaprio to leap out and stab a shark, à la The Beach. The islands weren’t always uninhabited: alongside their rich Māori history it’s still possible to go ashore and view a once-occupied lighthouse with a troubled past. One lighthouse keeper ran out of food so attached urgent notes to a model boat he made from tin and aimed for the coast. Miraculously, supplies were sent out just nine days later. Another keeper wasn’t so lucky and the extreme isolation drove him to take his own life. My journey to these islands also changed me in ways I couldn’t have imagined. I had been saving for a house deposit but when my very good friend’s breast cancer got the better of her I decided to live in the moment as she had so valiantly, and spent my savings on a bigger boat. While not a financially astute action I finally had the ability to get to the Mokes, and I honoured this impulse by naming my boat after her. The first trips were everything I had hoped for and I started to make videos of the experience because I wanted to show others the unseen magic we have on our doorstep. This led directly to me developing my own television fishing/travel series now five seasons deep and playing in more than 85 countries as a National Geographic title. It developed in me a strong belief in finding ways to connect people to the ocean, to give them a reason to care about what’s going on in and around it. I owe those islands for opening this whole new chapter and helping me discover in myself the things that are truly important in life.

          "headline": "Mail on Sunday publishers to pay ‘financial remedies’ to Duchess of Sussex",
          "bodyText": "Publishers of the Mail on Sunday have agreed to pay “financial remedies” to the Duchess of Sussex, three years after she began a protracted privacy battle over a handwritten letter to her estranged father. On Sunday, the newspaper printed a statement at the bottom of its front page telling its readers that the duchess had won her legal case for copyright infringement against Associated Newspapers for articles published in the Mail on Sunday and posted on Mail Online. On page three it ran a 64-word news story stating it had infringed copyright and that “financial remedies have been agreed.” The story was also published on the Mail Online website at 11.58pm on Christmas Day with links to judgments made by courts. The duchess sued Associated Newspapers over five articles reproducing extracts from a “personal and private” letter to Thomas Markle in August 2018. She won her case earlier this year when the high court judge Lord Justice Warby gave summary judgment in her favour without the need for a trial. Associated Newspapers appealed on the grounds that the case should have gone to trial. That appeal was dismissed earlier this month by court of appeal judges Sir Geoffrey Vos, Dame Victoria Sharp and Lord Justice Bean. They ruled that the duchess had a “reasonable expectation” of privacy regarding the contents of the letter. “Those contents were personal, private and not matters of legitimate public interest,” Vos said. Afterwards the duchess called for a reshaping of the tabloid industry and spoke of how she had been patient in the face of “deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks”. In her statement, she said: “This is a victory not just for me, but for anyone who has ever felt scared to stand up for what’s right. While this win is precedent-setting, what matters most is that we are now collectively brave enough to reshape a tabloid industry that conditions people to be cruel, and profits from the lies and pain that they create. “From day one, I have treated this lawsuit as an important measure of right versus wrong. The defendant has treated it as a game with no rules. The longer they dragged it out, the more they could twist facts and manipulate the public (even during the appeal itself), making a straightforward case extraordinarily convoluted in order to generate more headlines and sell more newspapers – a model that rewards chaos above truth. “In the nearly three years since this began, I have been patient in the face of deception, intimidation, and calculated attacks. Today, the courts ruled in my favour – again – cementing that the Mail on Sunday, owned by Lord Jonathan Rothermere, has broken the law. The courts have held the defendant to account, and my hope is that we all begin to do the same. Because as far removed as it may seem from your personal life, it’s not. “Tomorrow it could be you. These harmful practices don’t happen once in a blue moon – they are a daily fail that divide us, and we all deserve better.” Associated Newspapers said at the time that it was “very disappointed” by the ruling and an appeal to the supreme court was being considered. The duchess’s costs had been estimated at £1.5m before the appeal, but that figure will have increased with the appeal. The Mail on Sunday and Mail Online statement publication had been ordered by Lord Justice Warby earlier this year. In March he agreed that the font size could be smaller than that asked for by the duchess. Representatives of Associated Newspapers and the Duchess of Sussex have been approached for comment."

          "headline": "Jonny Bairstow bemoans losing the toss and poor shots amid England collapse",
          "bodyText": "Jonny Bairstow stressed “everyone is trying” after England delivered their latest soft batting collapse in an Ashes campaign that is fast unravelling. Boxing Day at the MCG followed a familiar pattern when Joe Root’s tourists, wearing black armbands in memory of Ray Illingworth, were bowled out for 185 thanks in part to a sublime three-wicket morning from Australia’s returning Pat Cummins. Root top-scored with 50 and Bairstow marked his latest recall to the Test side with a battling 35 from 75 balls that tried to overcome a lack of match practice on tour, but both sat among a catalogue of dismissals that made for belated Christmas gifts to the hosts. Trailing 2-0 and yet to pass 300 with the bat on tour, England require a dramatic turnaround of fortunes during the remainder of the third Test if they are to prevent Australia claiming a series win at the earliest opportunity. Speaking after stumps on day one, with Australia 61 for one in reply, Bairstow said: “We’re still searching for that big score but both teams were looking to bowl first on that pitch this morning with the help of the conditions and a tinge of green. “I don’t think that you can complain when it’s obviously individuals going out and playing in the way in which they foresee is best. That’s exactly what it’s about. “Naturally the execution … wasn’t there today. But the amount of times that we’ve seen those shots being executed and going to the boundary is high. “It’s one of those days that … we will look back on and probably reassess next time and potentially take different options.” Arguably the most galling dismissal came when, on the stroke of tea with England already 128 for five, the newly arrived Jos Buttler needlessly tried to take on Nathan Lyon, only to hole out for three. From a senior player, it was quite staggering. “That’s an individual decision,” said Bairstow, when asked about his teammate’s choice. “If that’s the game plan to take the off-spinner down and put the pressure back on, to push the field back, then that’s the gameplan that was taken. “I can tell you now, everyone is trying; different methods, individual training techniques. [But] when you’ve got guys bowling 138-144kph it makes you make decisions quicker. That’s part and parcel of the game. “We’ve got to get a bit stronger and tougher with our dismissals. We know that and we’ve spoken about that. That is just being honest with ourselves.” As well as tightening their grip on the urn, Australia’s latest show of dominance had additional significance when Scott Boland was handed his Baggy Green cap and became just the second Indigenous man after Jason Gillespie to play for their Test side. The 32-year-old Victorian also got off the mark in the wickets column to the delight of his home crowd, Mark Wood trapped lbw for six and failing with a review despite uncertainty over whether the ball had struck pad or bat first. “I’m pretty proud,” said Boland, who also claimed two catches. “Obviously my family’s very proud as well. It means a lot to join a pretty small club and hopefully it’s just the start of something big for the Indigenous community in cricket. “I just hope I can be a role model for young Indigenous kids to want to play cricket. I think the Indigenous community in [Australian rules football] and rugby are so big and hopefully one day Aboriginals in cricket can be just as big.”"

          "headline": "‘A blast of joy, energy and invention’ – in praise of Richard Rogers",
          "bodyText": "One way to understand Richard Rogers is as a man who wanted everything. He wanted beautiful new buildings, a fair and civilised society and success for himself and his friends and collaborators. He was generous and tough, romantic and political. He wanted to be in the middle of it all. Such wishes made for a lifetime of majestic achievement, an impact as great as any British architect has ever made. Two documents from his early life sum him up. When he was born, his cousin Ernesto Rogers, a fine Milanese architect, wrote him a letter: don’t eavesdrop behind the door of life, it advised, break through it. As a student at the Architectural Association in London, R got a damning report from one of his teachers. His drawing was bad, it said, his method of work chaotic, his critical judgment inarticulate. He did indeed break the door open. The AA report was also largely true. His genius was to overcome his weaknesses with charm, charisma and determination, and to ally himself with other brilliant people who could do what he couldn’t. His early architectural career was in the partnership of Team 4, with Norman Foster, Foster’s wife, Wendy Cheeseman, and Rogers’s wife, Su, all of whom had skills that he lacked. He designed the Pompidou Centre in Paris with Renzo Piano and an array of other talents. With his second wife, Ruth, Rogers created a social universe around the River Café restaurant, which started as a canteen for his practice, and the triple-height living space of the home they made by knocking two Chelsea townhouses together. An enduring image of Rogers is of him in a cerise or lime-green shirt, standing on the house’s elegant steel staircase, with Andy Warhol prints of Chairman Mao on the walls, making a gracious if slightly incoherent speech to a party that might include a Hollywood star, a cultured footballer or a world-famous artist. With his omnivorous desire went an obliviousness to contradiction, complexity and the obstinacy of facts. This can be seen in an early house that he and Su designed for the photographer Humphrey Spender; enthralled by the steel-and-glass “case study” houses of California, Rogers wanted to achieve the same in rural Essex, without much allowance for differences in climate. In his first winter in the house, Spender sent Rogers a wry Christmas card, a photograph of the frost patterns that formed on the inside of the single-glazed walls. The same obliviousness could be seen in Rogers’s work with Tony Blair, John Prescott and Ken Livingstone to revitalise British cities with the help of good design. This achieved a true transformation of political and cultural attitudes to urban life, but it also entailed accommodations with property interests at odds with the inclusive principles he championed. There could be conflicts of interest between Rogers the social campaigner and Rogers the leader of an ambitious practice: “good design” too often turned out to mean the high-tech style that he and his allies offered. At worst, the results would be something like One Hyde Park in Knightsbridge, a block of super-luxury flats with fortress-like security systems that gives nothing very much to the public realm around it. He could be ruthless in getting his way. Often, his projects didn’t work out as advertised or came at considerable cost to his clients. He successfully wielded the power of British libel laws against the American author Stewart Brand, whose book How Buildings Learn had, in its US edition, challenged the claims of Rogers’s designs to be flexible and adaptable. In the UK version, as if in a Soviet retouched photograph, these sections were replaced by something altogether else. My relationship with Rogers was often spiky. I criticised projects such as his plan to envelop London’s Southbank arts centre with a giant glass roof, with perhaps excessive iconoclastic rage. To which he didn’t take kindly. And yet news of his death, at the age of 88, hit me hard. His courage was phenomenal. And he was, in the end, one of the good guys. The Pompidou Centre, half a century after its inception, remains a blast of joy, energy and invention in the heart of a historic city. Even clients he nearly bankrupted, even Spender with his freezing house, were won over by the power of his vision. “Naivety is an important part of creativity,” Rogers told his partner, Graham Stirk. In the case of this particular architectural giant, you couldn’t get one without the other."

          "bodyText": "With cases, deaths, reproduction numbers, opinion polls and more, we get bombarded with statistics every day. But how can you spot a naughty number, a shabby statistic or dubious data? Lists of questions have been given by Tim Harford, Dave and Tom Chivers, and in The Art of Statistics (which David wrote), with considerable overlap as they grapple with the same essentials. Here is the short list that we use ourselves. The first question: how trustworthy is the source of the story? Are they honest, competent and reliable or are they trying to manipulate my emotions, say by provoking anxiety or reassurance? Are they giving the whole picture or selecting bits to suit themselves? Like the review that found insects had declined, but it turned out had only searched for studies that showed a decline. Second: how reliable is the statistic? A count may not be counting what we think it is: Covid-19 cases only represent those who decide to have viral tests, often after showing symptoms, and are becoming increasingly distinct from infections. Survey estimates seek to generalise from a sample to a target population, but have both margins of error and possible systematic biases, while model outputs reflect assumptions and selected scenarios. The uncertainty and the quality of the underlying evidence should be communicated with due humility. Third: how trustworthy is any claim being made on the basis of the data? Context is all; a “100% increased risk” may make the headlines, but twice not very much is still not very much. Historical statistics can provide a guide to whether something really is a big number. Differences may be attributed to cause rather than just correlation, since observational analyses can have systematic biases or lingering confounders. And sometimes there is basic misunderstanding of good data; ONS found that, among people testing positive, vaccination increased the chance someone would be Omicron rather than Delta, but this led to the claim that vaccination increased the risk of testing positive. Statistics enlighten our uncertain world, helping people make decisions. We need thoughtful consideration, not reflexive cynicism, when we see claims derived from statistical evidence. • This article was amended on 27 December 2021. An earlier version said that “Covid-19 cases only represent those who decide to have PCR tests”. In fact the reference should have been to viral tests to reflect the inclusion of positive tests from lateral flow devices. • David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

          "headline": "The Hidden Case of Ewan Forbes by Zoë Playdon review – a fascinating transgender life",
          "bodyText": "Historical biography always involves a certain amount of detective work, but Professor Zoë Playdon has had to contend with an additional challenge in the writing of her first book, The Hidden Case of Ewan Forbes. As the title implies, information about her subject was not just scant, but much had been actively suppressed. Now Playdon’s determined labours have brought this extraordinary story to light. Playdon first came across Sir Ewan Forbes-Sempill in 1996 as the result of advising on a legal challenge to allow transgender people to change their birth certificate – something that had been the norm in the UK until the late 1960s, although it was unclear how or why the law had changed. In the wake of their defeat, they were approached by a solicitor named Terrence Walton, who provided a missing piece of the puzzle. Walton had represented a trans woman, April Ashley, in a landmark case in 1969. She was a model who had married the Hon Arthur Corbett, but when the relationship broke down and Ashley tried to claim financial support, Corbett took her to court on the grounds that she was male (as recorded on her birth certificate, which she had not changed) and that therefore the marriage had never been legitimate. The case created a precedent that meant a person’s birth certificate was the final word on their legal sex. Walton told Playdon and her colleagues that he and Ashley had been made aware at the time of an earlier case also concerned with establishing an individual’s legal sex, but told they could not refer to it. “All traces of it had been removed from the public eye.” It took Playdon two years and a good deal of persistence to gain access to the 500-page transcript of Sir Ewan’s court case, and it was not until her retirement in 2014 that she was able to devote a further five years of research to his life and historical significance. The result is a detailed and wide-ranging work, piecing together the largely forgotten story of one individual and situating it in a broader context of trans rights, gay rights and the laws of primogeniture over the past century. Sir Ewan’s life is the stuff of costume drama, and it’s no surprise to learn that the television rights have already been sold. He was born in 1912 at Craigievar Castle near Balmoral, the third child of the Lord and Lady Sempill, was registered as female and christened Elisabeth. “But as far as Ewan was concerned,” Playdon writes, “he was a boy, and his certainty about this was so firm that his tranquil memoir, The Aul’ Days, published when he was 72, mentions no other possibility.” His parents seem to have had an ambivalent attitude to their youngest child’s gender. His mother in particular appears surprisingly progressive in some ways; in adolescence, she takes him to European medical specialists for treatments that sound like testosterone injections. But he is still expected to appear in women’s clothes on formal occasions, and to be presented at court as a debutante even after he has developed facial hair. He waited until after his parents’ deaths to change his name and his birth certificate formally so that he could legally marry. At the time, this was “a relatively easy process”, requiring letters from a doctor, though Ewan’s family connections and his own medical career clearly smoothed his path. But in his 50s, Ewan’s quiet life with his wife Patty was thrown into chaos by the death of his older brother, William, the 10th Baronet Forbes of Craigievar. The title was limited by primogeniture; only males could inherit, and William had no sons. At William’s funeral, like the villain in a melodrama, Ewan’s cousin John appeared, claiming his right to the title on the grounds that Ewan was not a man. There followed a legal battle with so many dramatic twists and turns it almost stretches credulity; bribery, sibling rivalry and the sudden death of a key witness is only the half of it. The potential ramifications of the verdict were huge, not only for Sir Ewan, who could have faced two years in prison for perjury, along with Patty, if he was found to be female, but for the future of male succession. “There are some interests that it is more important to protect than the rights of individuals,” as Walton says darkly. As emeritus professor of medical humanities at the University of London and a campaigner with 30 years’ experience in LGBTQ+ rights, Playdon is well placed to examine this story in context and she tells it, as you would expect, from the perspective of her own views on the issues. Ewan Forbes’s story, and the cases that have a bearing on his, are presented with empathy and respect, though at times her strong views can tip her into hyperbole. It is a shame, too, that she feels the need to deploy the derogatory term “Terf” repeatedly throughout her concluding chapter, “Ewan’s Legacy”, which presents selective arguments from the current debate over gender identity. Despite these jarring notes, Playdon has unearthed a fascinating and important story, the impact of which is sure to reverberate through future discussions on trans rights and the rights of daughters to inherit.

          "bodyText": "As cinemas once again struggled with the closures, cancellations and uncertainties of the pandemic, the biggest film story this year was surely the long-delayed release of No Time to Die. Originally slated to open in early 2020, Daniel Craig’s final outing as 007 became the first high-profile release to announce a major Covid-related postponement. For many UK cinemas, the new November 2020 opening date became a mast to which to tie their hopes of recovery – hopes that were crushed when the release date was pushed back again, to April 2021, and then again to autumn. So when Craig’s Bond swan song was finally unveiled at the Albert Hall at the end of September, the sense of relief was palpable – not least because the film didn’t disappoint. Ably directed by Cary Joji Fukunaga (Beasts of No Nation ), No Time to Die opened to strong reviews and solid box-office – although in yet another indication of how much the world has changed in recent years, a streaming release came hot on the heels of the film’s theatrical debut, meaning that right now, viewers can choose to watch No Time to Die in cinemas or at home: the model of the future. Among the many names that have been mooted to breathe new life into the role of 007, Riz Ahmed is popular with audiences. A versatile actor, musician and writer, he proved his mettle in the 2019 drama Sound of Metal, which opened in UK cinemas in April 2021, just ahead of the Oscars, where he was nominated for best actor (he lost out to Anthony Hopkins in The Father). Ahmed is currently on the Oscar radar again with the short film The Long Goodbye, a terrifying dystopian vision of modern Britain, directed by Aneil Karia, which generated debate in parliament when first released in 2020, and has now been shortlisted for the 94th Academy Awards. At the 93rd Oscars in April, Chloé Zhao, director of the recent Marvel blockbuster Eternals, became only the second woman to win best director, following in the footsteps of Kathryn Bigelow (who won for The Hurt Locker in 2010) with Nomadland, which also won best picture, and best actress for Frances McDormand. At Cannes, French film-maker Julia Ducournau became the second woman to win the Palme d’Or (after Jane Campion), with her extraordinary second feature, Titane, a full-blooded body-horror fable that channels the controversial spirit of David Cronenberg’s Crash, and which opens in the UK today . June saw the UK release of English-Pakistani film-maker Aleem Khan’s brilliant feature debut, After Love, which recently swept the board at the British independent film awards, where its trophies included best British independent film, best director and best screenplay, alongside best actress for Joanna Scanlan. There were significant wins too for the documentary Poly Styrene: I Am a Cliché, which opened here in March, and the for the tense, one-shot drama Boiling Point, starring Stephen Graham, which UK audiences can see from 5 January 2022. The most remarkable film of the summer of 2021 was Summer of Soul, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s rediscovery of footage from the 1969 Harlem Cultural festival, featuring jaw-dropping performances by Nina Simone, Stevie Wonder, Sly and the Family Stone, Mahalia Jackson and more. Then in August, the Welsh film-maker Prano Bailey-Bond took audiences back to the 80s heyday of the video nasties with her thrilling feature debut, Censor. But my favourite film of 2021 was Céline Sciamma’s Petite Maman, a flawless gem from the creator of Girlhood and Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Just 73 minutes long, and rated “suitable for all” by the BBFC, this U-certificate masterpiece reminds us of the universal power of cinema to transform, engage and ultimately redeem audiences, transcending boundaries of age, gender and nationality. The top 10 films of 2021 1. Petite Maman Céline Sciamma’s masterpiece is proof of the regenerative power of cinema. 2. Summer of Soul Perhaps the greatest concert movie ever made. 3. The Green Knight David Lowery brings the Middle English poem to life in the 21st century. 4. Another Round A deserving winner of best international feature at the Oscars in April. 5. Titane Julia Ducournau’s Palme d’Or winner; a visceral follow-up to Raw. 6. Censor Prano Bailey-Bond’s genre-bending feature debut has so much more than just nostalgia for the video nasties. 7. Sound of Metal Riz Ahmed is note perfect in Darius Marder’s tale of a drummer learning to live with deafness. 8. After Love Joanna Scanlan turns in a career-best performance in Aleem Khan’s feature debut. 9. Spencer Jonny Greenwood’s electrifying score elevates Pablo Larraín’s “fable from a true tragedy”. 10. Quo Vadis, Aida? Bosnian film-maker Jasmila Žbanić’s harrowing real-life drama took top honours at this month’s European film awards. Turkey Stardust A Bowie film without Bowie’s music, lyrics, wit or glamour."

          "bodyText": "Once upon a time there was a mouse mat. A mouse mat that threatened to undermine global efforts to avert nuclear warfare. The sales photo on Etsy showed a blameless-looking rubber rectangle, hand made in Leicester, with a Persian rug motif. But PayPal decided that it violated international sanctions and suspended the account of the unsuspecting purchaser. To understand the modern business model – and the contents of my consumer inbox – look no further than this “illicit” item. A computer algorithm had decided the mat was Iranian contraband, computer software suspended the customer’s PayPal account, automated warnings threatened termination unless the customer could prove its provenance, and customer service agents seemed powerless to apply human logic. It was the same artificial intelligence and human apathy that forced graduates to keep funding repaid loans , informed an Ovo customer that they owed £19,000 for two months of energy and allowed a 10-minute flight schedule change to scupper a honeymoon. Add to the mix this year’s double act, Brexit and Covid, which gave companies two cast-iron new excuses for skirting consumer rights law. As much of the nation retreated to the sofa to work, and Brexit muddied the rule book, the computer was given ever greater control and customers found themselves trapped in limbo. “Kafkaesque nightmare” is a recurring phrase from our literary readers. As always, there are so many worthy contenders for an award, but it’s been a pleasure to narrow them down to the following standout takes on customer service. In all cases, the customer was only offered effective service after I intervened. Most rubbish excuse A joint gong for eBay and delivery firm UPS. When MS of Manchester sought a refund from an eBay seller for a £130 satnav that never arrived, he was refused. eBay sided with the seller, since tracking showed that the item had been delivered – to his rubbish bin. How could UPS have known that, without a notification card, MS would not think to check his wheelie bin before collection day? Bleeding heart for empathy Legal &amp; General tried hard for this honour. It twice informed a grieving man that he had been bequeathed £14,000 from his late sister’s pension plan before realising it had sent the forms to the wrong relative. Then it erroneously told the deceased’s father to expect £19,000. The bequest was, in fact, intended for the grandson who, in proud Scottish tradition, bore the same name, but a different address to his father and grandfather. The comically named “sensitive claims” department discovered it had lost the late woman’s letter of instruction and, in its absence, refused to discuss the legacy with her executors. Surrealism in Whitehall The UK government sweeps the table. Take your pick. The Department for Work and Pensions misunderstood its own rules and penalised a universal credit claimant for not applying while in an induced coma. The Home Office, whose rules on residency permits are so misleading and whose stance, when applicants are duly misled, so intransigent, that an eligible spouse was denied indefinite leave to remain and presented with a £1,000 bill for NHS services. Or there’s the Ministry of Justice’s multimillion- pound reforms to streamline the probate service. Closure of local probate offices, a new online system declared unfit for purpose by legal firms, and a Covid backlog, have left families in legal limbo for up to nine months. Most cunning cop-out What’s more risky – explosives or footwear? Both score equally, according to courier firm DPD. Its stance makes perfect sense. It allows customers to book a delivery for an identified item, pay extra for insurance cover, and then, if the consignment goes missing and a claim is made, it can duck a payout by declaring it’s on a list of prohibited items along with human flesh and counterfeit currency. Vigilant customers, who study delivery exclusions, may be none the wiser. DPD forbids the mailing of “personal effects”, while Hermes refuses to pay compensation in the event it wrecks or loses “composite items of any description” or “items which can be exchanged by themselves, or with any other item, for money or goods or services”. Brexit bonus prize WK of Cumbria’s purposeful lockdown hours were spent contesting a £111 customs charge on a £12 wall bracket. It had been omitted from a delivery from the German company Loxhome in November 2020, and sent separately in the new year. By then, post-Brexit customs charges had kicked in. The duty for the bracket was applied to the entire £460 order. WK refused delivery to avoid the charges. But courier UPS returned to slip it through his letter box and, by the time the Observer intervened, debt collectors were pursuing him for £115. Meanwhile, a new identity was the Brexit bonus for some startled EU nationals who had been granted EU Settled Status in the UK. A Home Office computer anomaly meant that women who had lived for decades under their married surname, were registered under their birth name which appears first on some EU passports. They faced losing access to services because their proof of residency rights did not match official documents. Great escape artists Holidays! Remember those jaunts to Mediterranean beaches in the old days? While the few who dared set their sights on sunny climes battle for refunds for cancelled trips, many who played safe and booked local are also out of pocket. One reader did get as far as Cornwall, only to discover that the five-star water resort he’d booked had no record of him. Booking.com reassured the family they had been rebooked – in the beguiling suburb of Uxbridge, 250 miles away. Airbnb, meanwhile, decided that lockdowns are not an extenuating circumstance for cancellation and refused to require hosts to refund customers whose trips were banned by government rules, while deducting its 15% service fee from hosts who decided to do the right thing. Distinguished desertion order The high street banks can share this between them for abandoning scam victims to penury. Criminals have again been the biggest Covid winners with increasingly sophisticated strategies to access personal accounts . The good news is, major banks have pledged to refund victims who were not unduly negligent. The bad is, they often try their darnedest to wriggle out of it. I’ve investigated unrefunded losses of £900,000 this year and persuaded banks to return 54%, including a £225,000 pension pot stolen from a retired detective by a cloned investment firm. Nationwide deserves the spotlight for failing to protect, and refusing to refund, a pensioner’s £70,000 life savings, stolen in a similarly sophisticated scam. It finally offered to refund her a year later following contact from the Financial Ombudsman Service. • This article was amended on 26 December 2021. The company that twice incorrectly informed a grieving man he had been bequeathed £14,000 from his late sister’s pension plan was Legal &amp; General. An earlier version incorrectly named that company as NS&amp;I. We apologise to NS&amp;I for the error."

          "bodyText": "The past week has seen tensions rising about scientific modelling during the pandemic. Projections cited by UK and devolved governments as they tightened Covid restrictions have led to strained exchanges. But modelling is essential because it tell us: • What are the range of possible outcomes based on what we know? Society can’t just wait for things to happen. We can and do save lives by being prepared for a range of things, only some of which happen. As information increases, the model improves, and the range of outcomes narrows as scenarios are eliminated. • What assumptions make the most difference to these outcomes? Modelling told us that hospitalisations per 1,000 infections is important to outcomes, so its measurement was prioritised. Modelling can also show that by the time we know something, it is too late. Thus, it tells when decisions matter. • How do different interventions affect different scenarios? In a world of limited resources, the government may have to choose one measure over another. But some things we can’t test, for example what happens when 10% of ambulance drivers are ill? (We won’t send home 10% one day just to document the consequences.) • The “what if” question. What if Omicron has a short generation time or co-exists with Delta? Scientific models are not set in stone; they are open for inspection, updated with new information and, as errors are discovered, they are corrected. To date, the actual outcomes have been within the range of scenarios. For example, in the autumn, Scotland mandated mask-wearing with exceptions that some ignored, while England made masks voluntary but many wore masks anyway. What actually mattered to case numbers is what people did, not the legislation; no model can capture this perfectly. Governments make the decisions about restrictions. I don’t envy them this burden during Covid but politicians and the public must hear the unvarnished truth about the range of health outcomes of Omicron; this means modelling. But it’s not the only input – economic, political and social considerations (outside science) need to be heard. I do worry that media coverage of Covid has shifted from science journalists to higher profile political journalists. Not for nothing is the political slogan “if you are explaining you are losing” often employed. There is an important role for science-based policy advocates and scientists who explain the conflicting data to the public but avoid policy advocacy. I try hard to be the latter and admire the former; but I caution that it seems impossible to do both. If science becomes a tribal identity, then a chunk of fellow citizens will close their ears, to their and our detriment. Professor Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, is a model of compassion, honesty and humility that we should all aspire to, and some in the science community have fallen short of during Omicron. Some usual suspects, mostly from politics, state they knew all along Omicron was less severe; they did not. There were signs that it could be milder right at the outset and I hoped it would be, but there were good reasons to suspect the opposite. False certainty does harm all round. Proper modelling must consider all plausible outcomes. When the new data was published on Wednesday, the models changed. We are not out of the woods; should Omicron continue to spread rapidly, there are risks for the NHS and those developing long Covid. Those arguing against further restrictions must be given airtime – some have interesting things to say. But those who smear modellers and scientists as “gloomsters” are dishonest and irresponsible. It’s a tactic of the political world, playing the man not the ball. Let’s talk about your models, tell us what you don’t know, what you assume and the risks you are prepared for the UK to run. Just under 150,000 people have died from Covid in the UK. Every one of them meant something. To date, more people have died from Covid in the UK as a portion of the population than in most other advanced countries. We got things wrong. There will be a next time, and we must all do better if such tragedy is to serve a higher purpose. I would urge anyone who gets in front of a microphone or tweets or writes to think of the loss and show a little humility and humanity.

          "bodyText": "Leslie Winer – Hold On Postcards Leslie Winer’s mesmerising face – strong jaw, stern lips, graceful cheekbones – made her a muse to Jean-Paul Gaultier, a star of Dior and Valentino ads and a cover girl for Vogue, though girlish she wasn’t: her tough androgyny and power dressing was the perfect expression of an uncaring yet increasingly permissive 1980s. “I was a reluctant model for five junkie years,” she later said, “I’m also a former nasty alcoholic and former Tampax user, each for more than five years and with considerably more enthusiasm.” That career discarded, her next act was astonishing: music that delved into industrial, dub and – influentially – trip-hop, Winer issuing drawled monologues over the top with Gobi-arid humour. Her work was reissued this year by Light in the Attic on the compilation When I Hit You – You’ll Feel It. Hold On Postcards is its sole unreleased track but maybe its very best. Slurring as if after a boozy nap on a sunbed, her vocal as fried as a bit of fritto misto, Winer slowly recites banal postcard observations from Europe: “Lovely weather, we go to the beach, I’ve been playing boules,” this last revelation with a funny note of astonishment as she stirs briefly out of total indolence. Slipping sunburned and omnipotent from Ajaccio to Nice to Guernsey and beyond, she conjures the listlessness of holidays, and of the wealthy, with a supernatural accuracy. With its piano motifs and sing-song backing vocals, there’s something lulling about this song, and yet a mistral of disquiet feels like it’s about to blow in. “Thinking of you all the time,” she admits amid aloof statements about how many new friends she’s making. Tellingly, her holiday ends – or at least her postcards do – at somewhere called the Hotel Nadir. Ben Beaumont-Thomas PE – The Reason for My Love One of the most unfairly overlooked songs of 2021 could just as easily have come out during the sooty New York summer of 1981. The Reason for My Love, by the young Brooklyn quintet PE, channels the fidgety, dark, and inescapably danceable sound of Mudd Club-era, underground bands like Bush Tetras, the Contortions and ESG. From the fractured, no-wave sax to its briskly undulating bass line to the haunted vocal of Veronica Torres, every sound in the song confronts and thrills. Like some avant-garde ear worm, the falling-apart sound in the song oddly coheres. More, it extends a mini-trend of young bands who have been refiguring New York’s aural history. Just as the debut album by the teenage Brooklyn group Geese recast the sound of local guitar bands like Television and the Feelies, PE’s song gives Manhattan’s underground club history its own dynamic twist. Jim Farber Doss – Look In less than three minutes and about five lines of lyrics, the mysterious New York/Baltimore producer (and sometime PC Music associate) Doss draws an addictive portrait of power, temptation and danger. “You see me on my own,” she chants, and depending on which way she limns the line, it’s either an invitation to approach or a warning to back away. She repeats her mantras of isolation – “not looking at my phone / Myself, on my own” – with the cadence of an expertly bounced basketball; around her, an intense bubblegum synth motif that contains strange echoes of Benny Benassi’s Satisfaction pings and bungees. It’s a tightly snatched, head-down burst that doubles as a defiant anthem for these past two lonely years. Laura Snapes Jenna Esposito – The Other Side of Forever It’s the heartbreak and hopefulness of a turbulent 2021 from the mind of a songwriter who knows them all too well. Ernie Rossi, owner of the century-old gift and music shop E Rossi and Company in New York City’s Little Italy, was sidelined by health problems after reopening following the long city-mandated shutdown. Margaret, his wife of 51 years, knew the neighborhood icon might not stay afloat if doors closed once again and solely took over duties with the couple’s best friend, Freddy. Then this past spring, both Margaret and Freddy caught and died of Covid-19. In the wake of their consecutive deaths, Rossi wrote The Other Side of Forever, a heartfelt tribute to the bond the trio shared and the immense loss he feels. Recorded by the New York indie artist Jenna Esposito, the earworm ballad with a momentous opening and climatic finale was produced in the Italian folk style the store was known for being a chief importer of nearly 100 years ago. And today, Rossi is continuing his fight to stay in business. Rob LeDonne DijahSB – New Harrison “I’m not sure what to do, at this point I didn’t plan to survive,” DijahSB matter of factly spits on New Harrison, a standout from their latest album Head Above the Waters. Be it such commendably frank rhymes (along with social media posts) about mental health, or being an out-and-proud non-binary artist in a genre once notorious for its heteronormativity, the rising Canadian MC certainly is a trailblazer. But aside from breaking such ground, DijahSB is also a student of the game. Rather than chase trap-rap trends, they choose instrumentals that are both breezy and fresh but also frequently steeped in rap’s soulful old-school grooves. The mellow, melancholy yet cheeky beat for New Harrison is a prime example of DijahSB’s past-meets-future motif. That, along with the MC’s penchant for on-point NBA-inspired punchlines throughout the song’s three-and-a-half-minute runtime, make DijahSB’s potential to be an all-star in their own right abundantly clear. Kyle Mullin Dylan Fraser – I’d Rather Be Here There’s something horribly, embarrassingly familiar about the predicament at the centre of 20-year-old Scottish singer Dylan Fraser’s hair-raising track I’d Rather Be Here, released to quiet acclaim this past autumn. The song, which starts with a whisper for attention and ends with a cry for help, is about a specifically awful place to be: in love with someone who is detrimental to your mental health (“the top of these buildings used to feel so tall but maybe that’s ‘cause you made me feel so small”). While many songwriters would use this as a jump-off to celebrate the empowerment that comes attached to then taking flight, Fraser instead focuses in on something far messier: staying there because being with someone harmful is better than being without them. It’s slickly produced but Fraser’s alternately sad and furious desperation is nothing but heartbreakingly genuine. Benjamin Lee"

          "bodyText": "It was the year we craved the normality of a meal out, regardless of how abnormal an experience it might have to be for that to happen. No matter that the waiters might be masked up or the tables dotted across the room as if set for an interrogation, or that there could be screens between those tables. If the essentials were present – a list of dishes that you hadn’t cooked yourself, someone to fetch them, a pass on the washing up – many of us were there for it. At times it felt as if all of us customers and staff alike, were working very hard to share that delusion of normality. But 2021 was not normal. I began mine by combing my bookshelves for satisfying cookbooks with which to fill a restaurant column when all the restaurants were closed. I reacquainted myself with the brilliance of great recipe writers and cooks such as Claudia Roden, Simon Hopkinson and the late Gary Rhodes. The latter finally taught me to swallow my shame and learn how to make custard from scratch. Custard vanquished; life skill achieved. Thank you, Gary. You may no longer be here, but you held my hand from beyond the grave. When the time finally came, I grabbed the opportunity to get out of my own kitchen like an A-level student galloping from the exam hall after the final paper. I made a list of the past year’s top restaurant experiences recently and the first three that came to mind were all outside London. I loved the butch, gutsy cooking at the Double Red Duke in Oxfordshire, with its glossily sauced devilled kidneys and its fat scallops under drifts of garlicky crumbs. The sunlit early evening I spent at Sonny Stores in Bristol, sweeping the fattest of salted anchovies on to crusty bread, and demolishing a plate of perfect meringues with white peaches will stay with me for a very long time. And then there was the tiny menu at Erst in Manchester, which delivered so much more than it promised: bubbled and blistered flatbreads swamped with garlic butter; steak tartare under a shouty tonnato sauce; a bay panna cotta that melted away on the tongue. In an age when holding polarised opinions has become a spectator sport, someone somewhere will now extrapolate from this that all restaurants in London are therefore awful. Obviously not. The dish that I got the most correspondence about was the golden carb and dairy fat wonder of a double XL triple cheese toastie served to me at the Wigmore. People exchanged photographs of theirs on social media, like tourists proving they too had visited Angkor Wat on their holidays. Only it was an Angkor Wat crafted out of toasted sourdough, Ogleshield, raclette and Montgomery cheddar. Elsewhere in the capital I was thrilled by the intense nerdiness of Humble Chicken where many specific parts of the bird were carefully grilled on sticks over burning coals. Oh, that line of parsons’ noses. Honourable mentions must also go to the bravery of the Dirik brothers at Mangal 2 who have broken from the traditions of the many Turkish grill houses around them in Dalston, to serve something a little more subtle and, in its own curious way, Scandi. And then there’s the extraordinary bespoke sushi experience that Chris Restrepo narrated his way through at Kurisu Omakase, operating out of his parent’s café in Brixton. I do so love dinner and a show. But if you want stupidity in the restaurant sector, if you want a business proposition that will make your eyes roll so aggressively your neighbours will be able to hear the friction of ball against socket, the capital is still guaranteed to deliver. It speaks volumes about what truly dreadful people you all are, that when I finally broke my self-imposed ban on negative reviews by dismembering the pop-up Polo Lounge on the rooftop of the Dorchester Hotel on London’s Park Lane, it became my most read review of the year online. They deserved it for marking up bog standard wines by a factor of six or seven, and charging £38 for a McCarthy salad that looked like someone had been trying to colour code vegetables as part of a middle management away-day bonding exercise. The second most read review online? It had to be my stupid stunt outside Salt Bae’s Nusr-et Steakhouse in Knightsbridge, during which I declined a hyper expensive gold leaf-wrapped steak in favour of a takeaway from the marvellous Kebab Kid. I will admit I did feel a bit of an arse sitting at a picnic table on the pavement outside, but not as much of an arse, I venture, as all those people who are still going there for £1,000 gold leaf-wrapped steaks even though dear Salt Bae – that’s Mr Bae to you – flew out of London weeks ago, presumably sprinkling various seasonings from his private jet while howling with laughter. Of course, while I swanned around from one table to the next putting my back into the arduous business of eating my tea, life for the restaurants themselves has been rather less dreamy. Many reopened after the lockdown to find that staff they depended upon simply weren’t there any more. Some had re-evaluated what they wanted from life during the pandemic and concluded that a tough job in hospitality wasn’t it. Others were EU citizens who had simply gone home. When I pointed out in a recent review that this was forcing restaurants to shorten their opening hours and blamed this squarely on Brexit, a number of people argued this was a positive. It meant people were no longer willing to work for what were too often the lousy wages offered by hospitality. While I don’t think that negates any of the arguments against the utter bollocks of Brexit, they do have a point. Each week commenters on my reviews online compare the prices in British restaurants unfavourably to those in, say, rural Thailand or Ukraine, while failing to acknowledge the differences between the economies. Those comparisons are pointless. Running a British restaurant is expensive and this past year has shown us just how shaky the sector’s economic model can be. If we want to eat well and be served by people paid a proper wage, we are going to have to accept that it will continue to cost more. That doesn’t mean all pricing is fine. Some restaurants do take liberties. Good value matters. But the cost of eating out is rising. Don’t bother being cross with me about that. It’s just a fact. And it will still be the case in 2022.

          "bodyText": "This year the public saw an alarming side of Facebook, after a huge leak of internal documents revealed the extent of vaccine misinformation and extremism on the platform, a two-tier system of who gets to break the rules and the toxic effects of Instagram for teens. Digital rights activists around the world have warned about these issues for years, but with the company facing mounting pressure, next year could provide an unprecedented opportunity for action. We spoke to researchers, activists and tech experts about how Facebook can be reined in 2022 and beyond, and the innovative solutions that could bring about change. Regulation In the US, the path towards regulation is likely to be a long one. But this year has seen rare bipartisan calls to tighten the rules on big tech. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects Facebook from lawsuits if users post anything illegal, has once again come under scrutiny. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights group Color of Change, who led a corporate boycott of Facebook in July 2020, says amending it is a critical first step. “I believe that there needs to be a removal of the Section 230 immunity when it comes to paid advertising and when it comes to things that are connected to product design,” Robinson said. Meanwhile, lawmakers have introduced bills – including the Children and Media Research Advancement Act and the Algorithmic Justice and Online Platform Transparency Act of 2021 – that would, respectively, fund research into the platform’s effects on young people and tackle Facebook’s often inscrutable algorithms. Robinson says such laws would address “the ways in which Facebook makes money and refuses to be held accountable”. In Europe, 2022 will see a final decision by the European court of justice (ECJ) in a German online gaming case that could pave the way for Facebook to face legal ramifications for privacy violations. Javier Pallero, the policy director at the digital civil rights organisation Access Now, says any regulation must consider human rights, particularly when it comes to content moderation in the global south. Facebook’s current moderation model is flawed, he says. “They either allow too much or they take down too much and they end up basically censoring entities, activists, and so on around the world. So you need human moderators, ergo, you need more investment, you need more people.” Breaking it up Facebook’s sheer size and market dominance remain a significant barrier to change, and a growing chorus of lawmakers and others are calling for a simple solution: break it up. Matt Stoller, research director at the American Economic Liberties Project, says Facebook’s vast power is the greatest threat to democracy. “He’s operating like a sovereign,” Stoller says of Zuckerberg. “And that’s what a monopolist is. Somebody who has control, governing power over a market.” First, Stoller urges breaking up Facebook’s grip on the social media market. Once Facebook took over all its competitors, he says, “they just started surveilling and doing anything that they wanted, and there was really no way around it”. Second, Stoller proposes bringing criminal charges against Zuckerberg and his leadership team over allegations of fraud and insider trading. (Facebook has rejected those claims.) Third, Stoller recommends imposing rules on the social media marketplace so companies such as Facebook can’t be financed by or engage in advertising that is driven by hyper-personalized surveillance. Fixing Facebook from within Some of the strongest efforts for change are coming from Facebook’s own workforce or former workers, including Frances Haugen, the former product manager at Facebook’s civic integrity department who disclosed tens of thousands of the company’s internal documents to the Wall Street Journal and the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Jeff Allen and Sahar Massachi are a former data scientist and data engineer at Facebook who helped build the company’s election and civic integrity team and now run a non-profit organization called the Integrity Institute. They believe the solution is empowering integrity professionals who deal with issues such as trust, security and detecting fake activity. Massachi says Facebook’s culture incentivises the opposite: one team will flag harmful content and recommend driving down engagement, while another team will find a trick to increase engagement with the harmful content. To fix this, he proposes introducing a monthly metric that ranks companies based on integrity. Regulators could monitor companies based on this metric. He envisions regulators being able to take concrete action if companies don’t keep up their score. Katie Harbath, founder and CEO of the tech policy consultancy Anchor Change, said the lack of empowerment for integrity teams was a structural problem at Facebook. “The fact that the integrity team reports into the growth team is problematic,” she said, leading to prioritising growth. “One way to think about this would be to actually put integrity and growth on the same level within the company.” Open the company up to researchers When Facebook promised to collaborate on a research initiative with academics after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, there were hopes it would shed light on how Facebook affects society. Instead, researchers were met with flawed and incomplete data, with only a handful of scholars granted access. Nate Persily, professor at Stanford Law School and the director of the Stanford Cyber Policy Center, has worked with Facebook in an academic capacity but became increasingly frustrated with the amount of data the company shared with researchers. Since then he has drafted text for a law – the Platform Transparency and Accountability Act – which would grant scholars access to information the social media company holds, while protecting user privacy. “These companies have thrived in secrecy and we are now seeing that from the Frances Haugen revelations,” Persily said. The impact of opening the data up would be twofold: first, it would educate academics and the public about what’s happening on the platform, including the role of algorithms, apps targeting kids, and rates of disinformation, Persily said. Second, Facebook would behave differently if it knew it was being watched."

          "headline": "Tory MPs warn Boris Johnson’s rivals to oppose tougher Covid new year rules",
          "bodyText": "Cabinet ministers vying to succeed Boris Johnson have been warned by Tory colleagues that they will damage their chances unless they stridently oppose further Covid measures in England, as MPs called for New Year’s Eve restrictions to be ruled out. With ministers expected to meet as soon as Monday to discuss whether additional measures are needed to protect hospital capacity, several Conservatives said that they would be watching those emerging as leading contenders to replace Johnson should he step aside before the next election. The news comes after it emerged government scientific advisers had modelled the impact of implementing so-called “step 2” restrictions from Tuesday. Such measures would see an end to indoor gatherings, limited outdoor gatherings, and bars and restaurants only able to serve outdoors. The modelling suggested that restrictions could reduce deaths by 18% if kept in place until mid-January or 39% if retained until the end of March. Delaying the measures until New Year’s Day would reduce their impact, though the scientists said their models did not have “sufficient precision” to detect differences in a small delay. “When an epidemic is rapidly growing, the earlier interventions take place, the larger their effect,” they said. New coronavirus restrictions are being introduced by the devolved governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, including new physical distancing rules, the closure of nightc lubs and limits on indoor gatherings. The UK recorded 122,186 new Covid cases on Friday, the highest yet, while the Office for National Statistics estimated that 1.7 million Britons had the virus in the week ending 19 December, also a record. However, Tory MPs are hardening their attitudes against further restrictions and now want cabinet ministers to be vocal in their opposition. “If No 10 proposes tighter restrictions straight after Christmas, those cabinet ministers with freedom-loving instincts – who gave us all so much hope last week – must speak out,” said one member of the Covid Recovery Group of Tory MPs. “In any future leadership contest, we will all remember how they acted this week. We need real, gutsy, freedom-loving Conservatives to rescue us from this madness.” Other Tory MPs also said they would consider a candidate’s position on restrictions in any leadership race. It shows the extent to which speculation over Johnson’s position risks affecting the government’s Covid policies. It also reveals a weakening of the prime minister’s authority after a series of scandals and setbacks that have seen Labour take a poll lead. Liz Truss, the foreign secretary, and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, are seen as the frontrunners if the Tory leadership becomes available. Both are said to have expressed opposition to the tightening of restrictions recently. Allies of the prime minister have already accused them of jostling for position. Several MPs said that data suggesting Omicron was less severe than the Delta variant that it has displaced meant that new restrictions should not be needed. “Evidence is showing there is no need for further restrictions,” said Tory MP Richard Drax. “Time to trust people to get on with their own lives and for the state to back right off.” Former minister Desmond Swayne said: “We have earned the right to be treated like adults: to make our own assessment of the risks we are prepared to take and the sensible precautions that we apply. People are fed up with being ordered what not to do.” Graham Brady, chair of the powerful 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, said: “As we look forward to the new year, it is time to move on from the lazy assumption that government has the right to control our lives; we should take responsibility for our own lives once again.” Charles Walker, a former vice-chair of the committee, said: “I think the PM has done extremely well to weigh up the information, hold his nerve and get us to this point. Like everyone, I hope that the emerging data supports the current course of action being maintained.” However, scientists have continued to stress the need for extreme caution over the next few weeks and to consider further restrictions. “The wiser course is clearly to do everything we can to minimise transmission while the size and nature of the impact of Omicron clarifies itself and while everyone who is willing gets a booster and gets time to mount an immune response to it,” said Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “Better to take the flak for overreacting than for failing to act when there was still time.” This point was backed by Stephen Griffin of Leeds University. “We have to follow the precautionary principle and act ahead of the curve. And that’s the problem at the moment, we’re not doing that. So we will experience harm. We will experience further Long Covid and we will allow the virus to continue to evolve, I’m afraid.”"

Than ks for reading - but you can follow all the pandemic developments at our new blog here: https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2021/dec/26/covid-live-news-france-and-italy-see-record-daily-cases-australias-omicron-outbreak-spreads Cases are continuing to rise in Australia. New South Wales recorded a record 6,394 cases, while Victoria recorded 1,608 new Covid cases. The NSW health minister has urged residents to reconsider whether they need to call an ambulance or go to hospital due to staff furloughs, warning everyone in the state was likely to be infected with Omicron. Testing centre delays were still hitting Australian states and territories, with some reaching capacity before opening on Boxing Day. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day, Reuters reports. New cases reached 54,762 compared to 50,599 a day earlier, the health ministry said. Record cases are being reported in Ireland and in China, where authorities are imposing strict lockdowns to contain the outbreaks. Local transmission is rising in China and its Xi’an province is now allowing only one member of a household to leave their home for necessities every two days. More than 5,400 flight cancellations have thrown the Christmas travel schedule into chaos. Omicron has meant airlines could not staff flights. A quarter of cancelled flights were in the United States. New Covid measures in England could be in place until late March under measures examined by the UK government’s scientific advisers, including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors, in line with the Step 2 restrictions in place in England earlier this year India’s prime minister Narendra Modi has announced vaccinations for children under 15 and booster jabs for healthcare and frontline workers. The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in Portugal, making up almost two-thirds of cases since Wednesday. Schools, bars and clubs are closed until 10 January. There were queues at vaccination centres in England, kept open in some areas to allow walk-in appointments as the government encourages booster shots to counter the surge caused by the Omicron variant. The Nigerian president’s top media aide Garba Shehu said on Saturday that he has tested positive for coronavirus and was in isolation. In east Congo, a suicide bomber has struck a restaurant in the city of Beni killing at least five people as well as himself, Reuters reports. Fourteen people were injured in the attack including two local officials. It is the latest violent attack in a region where Congolese and Ugandan forces last month launched a campaign against suspected Islamists. In a statement, the regional governer’s spokesperson Général Ekenge Sylvain said: The suicide bomber, prevented by security guards from entering a crowded bar, activated the bomb at the entrance of the bar. The ADF did not immediately claim responsibility for the attack. In the US, a male surfer has been killed in an apparent shark attack in California on Christmas Eve. Local police say they responded to the report of a man “unresponsive” on the beach after being pulled from the water early on Friday. The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Morro Bay beach goers have been told to avoid the water for the next 24 hours. The Los Angeles Times has reported the victim is believed to be a 31-year-old body boarder. “PCR tests”, Hazzard says with a sigh: We’re now getting something in the order of 130,000 to 160,000 test as day and that on the face of it sounds good, but then we need to consider why are people being tested and why are we putting the stressors on our pathology system? Well, of course, in many cases, it is forced upon us by direction from health, or because other states, South Australia, Queensland, and so on, are insisting on PCR tests for travel...I certainly send again the message to those states that getting PCR tests is putting an enormous pressure on our pathology system and minimising the capacity for proper clinical PCR tests...as health minister I strongly implore them to review that situation as soon as is possible. It comes with 2,000 staff currently furloughed in NSW, putting “enormous pressure” on the hospital system. Hazzard says “think carefully” before you ask to call an ambulance or need to go to hospital, a disturbing indictment on the state of the health system as a result of rapidly rising Covid cases. NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is up. He says “we’re all going to get Omicron”, so the best present you can give someone is getting vaccinated: Bottom line here is that we would expect that pretty well everybody in New South Wales at some point will get Omicron, we’re all going to get Omicron, and if we’re all going to get Omicron, the best way to face it is when we have full vaccinations including our booster. The challenge for us in the state is to make sure that our health system can cope with that oncoming virus that is so transmissible...and generally what we’re finding, though, in the early stages...is that Omicron is not as severe in terms of its impact on individuals. That is a huge plus for all of us, but quite clearly it does impact on those who are unvaccinated, the majority of people who are in intensive care in New South Wales and requiring health staff to be looking after them, putting them at risk also, are people who have not been vaccinated. So the unvaccinated are taking more places than perhaps should be or actually - no, they’re taking more places than they should be in our ICUs simply because they have chosen not to be vaccinated. Perrottet acknowledges the long queues for Covid tests across the state. Testing numbers remain incredibly strong...but I just want to make the point again in respect of testing - if you do not feel unwell, if you are not required to be tested and have not been directed so by New South Wales Health, or you are not travelling interstate and that is a requirement, there is no need to be tested. What we can’t have are people sitting in testing queues which takes away from people who are unwell and who need that test because we want to get those tests back as quickly as possible...we have been working very closely with the other state premiers to move away from PCR testing to rapid antigen tests for those people who are travelling interstate, and I appreciate the Queensland premier’s movement there to bring that...but in the meantime there’s still going to be pressure on the system...I know there are long queues right across our state, so if we can help with that, if you do not feel unwell, if you are not advised by New South Wales Health, there is no need to receive a PCR test. You are taking spot in the queue from somebody who needs a test. The NSW premier Dominic Perrottet has been providing a Covid update this morning. He thanks “everybody across the state” for “amazing sacrifices” people are making over the Christmas period, including the thousands in isolation on 25 December. Those inconveniences will continue, but the efforts that we make will ensure that we keep our state safe and I have the strong view that New South Wales is in a very good position and we will stand tall during this difficult time and as case numbers continue to increase, more sacrifices will need to be made...but those rules are in place to keep our community safe and we’ll continue to do that as we move through this next phase of the pandemic. He says “there will be challenges” as NSW moves to the next stage of the pandemic, “but we will get through it”. On Christmas Eve, we hit 95% first dose. What an amazing achievement from the efforts that everybody has made across our state. We...never believed we would reach that rate. When you go back months ago to be in a position now where we have one of the highest vaccination rates not just in the country, but globally, ensures that as we open up we’re able to do so as safely as possible. Back in Australia, Tasmania has detected 44 new Covid cases overnight. It is a slight jump on yesterday’s 33 cases, which brought active cases on the island to 113. An employee at the Royal Hobart Hospital tested positive to the virus on Christmas Eve. There is one person being treated in hospital and none in intensive care. Scientists have declared the eruption on Spain’s La Palma officially over, Reuters reports. After nearly 100 days since the Cumbre Vieja volcano began to spew out lava, rock and ash, the eruption was declared over on Saturday. The volcano went quiet on 13 December but authorities held off until Christmas Day to give the all clear. Canary Islands regional security chief Julio Perez told a news conference: “what I want to say today can be said with just four words: The eruption is over”. In Myanmar, women and children are among dozens who have been reported killed in a Christmas Eve massacre. Myanmar government troops rounded up and shot dead at least 38 villagers, a charity and other outlets report, with fighting remaining intense near the village. Purported photos of the aftermath of the massacre in eastern Mo So village have spread on social media, sparking outrage against the military that took control of the state in February. A witness said victims of the attack had fled fighting between the army and armed resistance groups. Two Save the Children workers remain missing, with confirmation their private vehicle was attacked and burnt out. In a statement, the charity said “the military reportedly forced people from their cars, arrested some, killed others and burned their bodies”. Covid-19 testing lines across Australia are reaching capacity on Boxing Day as soon as they open. As of 9am Sunday morning, all of the ACT’s testing clinics were closed or at capacity an hour after opening. In New South Wales, a Covid testing line at Port Macquarie was closed at 7.30 am after reaching capacity, with a more than six hour wait before the centre opened. Huge queues were also forming in Sydney, with drive through testing clinics shutting as record Covid cases were detected. Randwick mayor Dylan Parker told channel 9 people were waiting “all day” to receive a test. I know someone who showed up in line at 8.30am and they didn’t get out until 4pm on Christmas Day...it’s just not good enough. In Australia’s capital territory, rising numbers of Covid cases including the Omicron strain have seen authorities tighten visitor restrictions to health facilities. No visitors will be able to enter a health facility unless in “exceptional circumstances”. In Australia, New South Wales has recorded another record number of infections today, with 6,394 cases reported. More than 5% of today’s tests came back positive. There have been an additional 70 hospitalisations overnight, but ICU rates remain steady. Victoria has recorded 1,608 new cases, a slight dip on yesterday’s numbers. There are 374 people being treated in hospital, and there have been two deaths. It comes as cricket fans begin to stream in to Melbourne’s MCG for the first day of the Ashes Boxing Day test. The Nigerian president’s top media aide Garba Shehu said on Saturday that he has tested positive for coronavirus and was in isolation. Shehu, who is in his late 50s, is in the immediate circle of 79-year-old President Muhammadu Buhari. “I can only confirm that [I am] infected by Covid-19 and on treatment in isolation,” Shehu said. Several local newspapers reported that some of Buhari’s aides and top officials have contracted the virus, including information minister Lai Mohammed, Reuters reported. A presidency spokesman declined to comment on whether any other official or minister was infected and whether Buhari, who received a booster dose on Tuesday, has been tested. UK cabinet ministers vying to succeed Boris Johnson have been warned by Tory colleagues that they will damage their chances unless they stridently oppose further Covid measures, as MPs called for New Year’s Eve restrictions to be ruled out. With ministers expected to meet as soon as Monday to discuss whether additional measures are needed to protect hospital capacity, several Conservatives said that they would be watching those emerging as leading contenders to replace Johnson should he step aside before the next election.

The modelling suggested that restrictions could reduce deaths by 18% if kept in place until mid-January or 39% if retained until the end of March. Australians face a day of festive leftovers, Boxing Day sales and surging Covid-19 infections with the national daily case total expected to pass 10,000. Christmas Day coronavirus numbers across the country hit 9,993, a figure expected to be eclipsed on Sunday, the Australian Associated Press reported. In New South Wales, a record record 6,288 cases were reported with thousands of people in isolation or separated from family. It was a similar story in Queensland where 765 new infections were counted, 151 of them of the Omicron variant. The mark was 176 higher than the state’s previous record set on Friday. Victoria avoided setting a new record on Saturday but another 2,108 people tested positive for the virus, ruining festive plans as they and their close contacts were forced to isolate. South Australia recorded 634 new cases with 12 patients in hospital, two of them in intensive care units. Some 33 cases were diagnosed in Tasmania, while the Northern Territory reported 19 cases, 10 of which were interstate arrivals. Western Australia recorded two new local Covid-19 infections on Christmas Day, both linked to a French backpacker who arrived in the state from Queensland. The cases bring the total number of community infections in WA to seven, after five cases were reported on Friday. Pope Francis has called for dialogue to counter the isolation wrought by the Covid-19 pandemic, as billions around the world marked a second Christmas under the shadow of the coronavirus. In his traditional Urbi and Orbi Christmas Day blessing, the pope told the faithful gathered in St Peter’s Square at the Vatican that “our capacity for social relationships is sorely tried; there is a growing tendency to withdraw, to do it all by ourselves, to stop making an effort to encounter others and do things together. “On the international level, too, there is the risk of avoiding dialogue,” said the 85-year-old Argentine pontiff. “Yet only those paths can lead to the resolution of conflicts and to lasting benefits for all.” In a time of pandemic, Pope Francis also asked God to “open hearts to ensure that necessary medical care - and vaccines in particular - are provided to those peoples who need them most,” AFP reports. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day, Reuters reports. New cases reached 54,762 compared to 50,599 a day earlier, the health ministry said. Record cases are being reported in Ireland, Australia’s New South Wales and in China, where authorities are imposing strict lockdowns to contain the outbreaks. Local transmission is rising in China and its Xi’an province is now allowing only one member of a household to leave their home for necessities every two days. More than 5,400 flight cancellations have thrown the Christmas travel schedule into chaos. Omicron has meant airlines could not staff flights.

There were queues at vaccination centres in England, kept open in some areas to allow walk-in appointments as the government encourages booster shots to counter the surge caused by the Omicron variant. An update to an early story. US airlines cancelled more than 900 flights on Saturday, the second straight day of massive cancellations as surging Covid-19 infections have sidelined some pilots and other crew members. A total of 913 Christmas Day flights, including domestic flights and those into or out of the country, were cancelled, up from 690 on Christmas Eve, according to a running tally on flight-tracking website FlightAware.com. Around 1,110 flights were delayed, Reuters reports. Record sales are expected this Boxing Day in Australia with shoppers tipped to splurge more than $20bn during the summer sales period. The Australian Retailers Association has estimated people will spend $21bn in the post-Christmas sales through to mid-January. Some shoppers are preparing to shrug off Covid concerns and visit CBDs and major shopping centres. However, online purchases are expected to surge this year. The ARA said it expected total sales to exceed last year because people could or would not spend their money on overseas travel during the Covid pandemic. France recorded a record high of 104,611 Covid-19 infections on Saturday, breaking the 100,000 threshold for the first time since the pandemic began. Health authorities said the number of Covid patients in intensive care went up by 28 to 3,282, Reuters reports. The country has also reported a total of 123,531 Covid-19 related deaths in hospital, up by 84. This post was amended on 26 December 2021 to give France’s correct cumulative death toll, according to Johns Hopkins University. Israel has ordered 100,000 units of Pfizer Inc’s anti-viral Covid-19 pill Paxlovid for people aged 12 and older at risk of severe illness, an official said. Channel 12 TV said the country’s prime minister Naftali Bennett agreed the deal in a phone conversation with Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla. The first oral and at home treatment for Covid-19, Paxlovid was nearly 90% effective in preventing hospitalisations and deaths in patients at high risk of severe illness, according to data from Pfizer’s clinical trial, Reuters reports. Recent lab data suggests the drug retains effectiveness against the Omicron variant, it said. In his national address, India’s prime minister Narendra Modi said: “From the point of view of precaution, the government has decided that healthcare and frontline workers should start getting a precaution dose.” India has reported a swift rise in Omicron cases, with the number reaching 415 overall across 17 states. Modi’s government has been accelerating its vaccination campaign, administering at least one dose to 88% of the eligible 944 million population, while 61% have taken both doses. He also urged citizens to continue to wear facemasks and follow other Covid-19 protocols, Reuters reports. Some further data from Italy. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 8,892 on Saturday, up from 8,812 on Friday. There were 106 new admissions to intensive care units, against 102 on Friday, Reuters reports. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,071 from a previous 1,038. Some 969,752 tests for Covid-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 929,775, the health ministry said. Italy reported a third successive record tally of Covid-19 cases on Christmas Day, Reuters reports. New cases reached 54,762 compared to 50,599 a day earlier, the health ministry said. The number of coronavirus-related deaths rose to 144 from 141 on Friday. Italy has registered 136,530 deaths linked to Covid-19 and has reported 5.57 million cases to date. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi has announced new vaccination pushes in an address to the nation as he told citizens to stay cautious but not panic. Modi said vaccinations would be extended to children aged 15 and over from Jan 3, while from the week after booster jabs will be given to healthcare and frontline workers as well as those vulnerable because of health conditions. The Omicron coronavirus variant vigorously continued its viral march across the US on Christmas Day, throwing many winter holiday celebrations into turmoil. Airlines canceled over 2,000 flights on Friday, with more than 600 within, into or out of the US, stranding passengers after short-staffed carriers were hit by pilot and flight attendants reporting infections. Hundreds more cancellations were anticipated for Saturday. The global tally of cancelled flights exceeded 5,400 trips over the weekend. FlightAware, a flight-tracking website, noted 888 flights entering, leaving or inside the US were canceled on Saturday, up from 690 on Friday. Christian churches were disrupted, with many canceling in-person congregations, while others planned outdoor services or a hybrid of online and in-person worship, including requirements to wear masks and show proof of Covid-19 vaccinations. Comedian Sarah Millican has led a campaign to help keep people connected during Christmas, offering entertainment, distraction and someone to speak to for anyone feeling lonely or isolated. Social media users have enthusiastically responded with pictures of their breakfasts and pets under the hashtag #JoinIn. Just over a year ago, Anna-Jane Casey was forced to abandon the Covid-shuttered West End to deliver hundreds of parcels in a second-hand van. She was overjoyed to find herself back on stage this Christmas in one of theatreland’s most star-studded and critically acclaimed shows: Cabaret. But productions are at the mercy of Omicron, with the highly transmissible Covid variant ripping holes in casts and backstage staff daily, so Casey’s triumphant return to the West End has been put on hold. “Cabaret had to come off [last week] because there are about four to five cast members ill,” she said from her home in Kent. “It’s hit so many different departments: the dressers in the wardrobe department … our automation and sound and lighting. We’ve got a lot of cases across the board – and we’re a new production so the understudies aren’t ready to step in yet.” Cabaret – which stars Eddie Redmayne and Jessie Buckley in a revival of the 1960s musical about the Nazi-menaced nightlife of the Weimar republic – is not the only theatrical casualty of the wave of infections sweeping the capital. Last week more than 70 performances of 31 shows were axed, including Moulin Rouge, Mamma Mia! and Matilda. “Up until about four days ago, 2021 was rocking along just fine. But we seem to be back where we were last year,” said Casey, who has appeared in shows including Chicago and Billy Elliot. “Producers are losing money hand over fist. Our producers are being unbelievably generous and paying us while we are not working but I don’t know how long that will last.” How do you forecast the future of the British economy during something as unpredictable as a pandemic? The Guardian’s Economics editor Larry Elliot spoke to Richard Hughes about just how they have tried to do that over the past year and what they’re learning over at the Office for Budget Responsibility. We spend a lot of time talking to public health experts, to epidemiologists, to [England’s chief medical officer] Chris Whitty and to Sage advisers. We start by saying: what’s the outlook for the virus? How effective are the vaccines? What are the prospects of having to reimpose Covid restrictions? Because all of that dictates the near-term economic outlook. ... When you are hit with an enormous shock, you gather information from wherever you can get it. The Queen looked back on a year marked by personal, as well as national, grief in her Christmas Day message – the first since the loss of her husband – yet strived to strike a more hopeful tone for the year to come. As a second year marked by the Covid-19 pandemic drew towards its end, the 95-year-old monarch said she could understand the feelings of all those who have lost loved ones, having been bereaved herself in April. Nevertheless, she looked forward becoming the first British monarch to celebrate a platinum jubilee – 70 years on the throne – in 2022. “Although it’s a time of great happiness and good cheer for many, Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year, especially, I understand why,” the Queen said in her annual televised address. Two more members of the K-pop boy band BTS have tested positive after the group returned to South Korea from performances in the United States. Rapper RM and singer Jin joined their bandmate Suga, who tested positive on Friday. The concerts in Los Angeles were their first in-person performances in the country since the start of the pandemic, which forced them to call off their biggest ever world tour last year. All three members of the group, which has spearheaded a global craze for K-pop, had been double-vaccinated. Scientists who have become familiar faces during the course of the pandemic have taken to Twitter on Christmas Day. Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London and lead researcher of the Covid Symptom Study app, shared an impressive model of a church made from lateral flow tests. From Stephen Reicher, professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews and a member of government advisory body the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group: From Dr Zubaida Haque, a member of Independent Sage and former interim director Runnymede Trust: Kit Yates, senior lecturer in mathematical biology at the University of Bath, writes: From University College London infectious diseases expert Dr Neil Stone, who is working on the ward on Christmas Day: And finally a Christmas Day message from the head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus: Ireland recorded 13,765 new cases on Saturday, more than 2,500 more than its previous record of 11,182 cases just yesterday. Approximately 83% of reported cases are believed to be the Omicron variant. As of 8am this morning, there are 378 people in hospital with the virus and 87 people in intensive care with Covid. The Department of Health said “large volumes” of case numbers are anticipated over the coming period. Hundreds of thousands of people in the UK will be forced to self-isolate on Christmas Day after a record 122,186 tested positive for Covid, the highest daily figure since the pandemic began. If you are self-isolating at Christmas and feeling alone, you’re far from the only one. You can join the comedian Sarah Millican’s #JoinIn Twitter hashtag on Twitter and speak to others in your position. Now in its 11th year, #JoinIn is a space for people who have not chosen to be alone but find themselves on their own on Christmas Day. The Omicron variant has become the dominant strain in Portugal, one of the countries with the highest Covid vaccination rates worldwide, officials said. “The Omicron variant is already dominant in Portugal,” the General Directorate of Health said, “accounting for 61.5% of cases on December 22.” On Friday, Portugal recorded 11 deaths and 12,943 cases – a record since 29 January. Schools, bars and clubs are closed until 10 January, with people told to work from home and face masks mandatory indoors. Germany recorded 22,214 new cases, compared with 35,431 the day before, officials said. A further 157 deaths were recorded. The latest figures came after health authorities admitted they are struggling to trace the contacts of people infected with Covid. In an interview published yesterday, Ute Teichert, chair of the Federal Association of Doctors in the Public Health Service, said “comprehensive followup [of Covid cases] is almost no longer taking place at the moment.” In some German states including Baden-Württemberg, Berlin and Hamburg, contact tracing has been completely suspended as officials focus on recording the “numerous coronavirus infections”, she added. Thousands of people across England will receive a Christmas Day booster jab as the vaccination effort continues in the face of record case rates. Queues have been spotted at pharmacies as people wait for their “jingle jabs” with appointments available in locations in London, Manchester, Swindon and Eastbourne. Vaccination clinics in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are closed today. NHS England has thanked staff who are working or volunteering on Christmas Day. In a tweet, it said: “From vaccinators to volunteers, porters to paramedics, midwives to mental health practitioners, and all other essential workers – thank you to everyone who is working over the festive period!” Meanwhile, the government says it will be sending millions of text messages on Boxing Day urging people to “get boosted now”. The message will say: “Every adult needs a Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against Omicron. Get your Covid-19 vaccine or booster.” Malaysia has detected its first local case of the Omicron variant, officials have said. In a briefing today, the country’s health minister, Khairy Jamaluddin, said the case was reported in the Borneo state of Sarawak on Christmas Eve. The individual, a 38-year-old Chinese national, is fully vaccinated and has not travelled abroad recently, he added. The cause of the infection is not known and investigations are ongoing. Malaysia has a total of 62 Omicron cases, about half of which are from Saudi Arabia, followed by five from the UK, four from Qatar and three from the US. New Covid measures in England could be in place until late March under measures examined by the UK government’s scientific advisers, Press Association reports. The modelling by experts from Warwick University considered a package of measures including a ban on socialising with another household indoors and a return to the rule of six outdoors, in line with the Step 2 restrictions in place in England earlier this year. The research, published on Christmas Eve by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling, Operational sub-group (Spi-M-O), looked at imposing Step 2 restrictions on either 28 December or New Year’s Day and keeping them in place until 15 or 18 January or 28 March 28. A summary read: A reduction in mixing equivalent to half that of Step 2 results in only a very small reduction in severe outcomes compared to Plan B alone. Step 2 has a much larger effect, reducing the number of deaths up to 31st May by 39% (24-54%) if kept in place from 28 December until 28 March , and 18% (12-27%) if kept in place until 15 January. The work was completed before the latest data suggesting the Omicron variant may produce less severe illness than the Delta strain. New South Wales has recorded its highest ever Covid daily caseload, with 6,288 new infections announced today – by far the highest number of cases in any Australian state since the pandemic began. Record Covid cases were reported across Australia on Christmas Day as overwhelmed testing clinics were forced to close and tens of thousands of people spent the holiday in isolation. Covid transmission also continued to surge in Victoria, where authorities announced 2,108 new Covid-19 infections and six deaths from the virus. Queensland announced a daily record of 765 new cases, with the state’s health minister, Yvette D’Ath, declaring “this virus is everywhere now”. D’Ath confirmed 151 of those cases had the Omicron variant. The leading Catholic in England and Wales, the archbishop of Westminster, has urged the government not to reintroduce restrictions on churches amid record Covid-19 infection rates. Data published on Thursday, suggesting the Omicron strain might cause less severe illness than the previously dominant Delta variant, has fuelled speculation in Westminster that Boris Johnson will resist imposing further restrictions in England after Christmas. Cardinal Vincent Nichols said it was clear that large spaces such as churches were “not places where we spread the virus”. He told the BBC prior to midnight mass at Westminster Cathedral: I would sincerely appeal that they do not again consider closing churches and places of worship. He added: I think this country has shown that people can make good judgements themselves. We’re at that point of saying we understand the risk. We know what we should do. Most people are sensible and cautious. We don’t need stronger impositions to teach us what to do. It comes after a further 122,186 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases were recorded in the UK as of 9am on Christmas Eve, another record daily figure, while 137 people died within 28 days of testing positive. Read the full article here: In Bethlehem, the city where Christians believe Jesus was born, thousands usually pack the streets during the Christmas period. On average, Bethlehem welcomed 3 million visitors a year before the pandemic, with Christmas alone drawing 10,000 people to the city’s hotels, around half from abroad. But Israel, which controls all entrances to Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, has barred its borders to foreigners in an effort to rein in infections from Omicron. In Manger Square, numbers were noticeably lower as Covid fears overshadowed celebrations for a second straight year. “It’s very strange,” said Kristel Elayyan, a Dutchwoman married to a Palestinian, who came to Bethlehem from Jerusalem told Agence-France-Presse, adding: Before (the pandemic), you had a bunch of people coming in from different countries to celebrate Christmas, and now you know that everybody who is here is probably not a tourist. Last year, Bethlehem curtailed celebrations sharply with a virtual tree lighting and just a handful of visiting scouts. This year, the celebrations were more vibrant - but still a fraction of their usual size. One shop owner, Victor Epiphane Tabash, said it was his 57th Christmas behind the counter. For him, as for many shopkeepers around Manger Square, “there is nothing to say about Christmas”. He said he kept his business alive during the pandemic by exporting because no customers came to buy in person. He compared the pandemic to two previous Palestinian uprisings, or intifadas, adding: We have lived through the intifadas, wars. But the coronavirus is worse. Japan’s Fukuoka prefecture has confirmed its first infection with the Omicron variant, officials said. The case was a result of possible community transmission as the infection route was unclear, its governor Seitaro Hattori said. New Omicron infections were also detected in the Kyoto prefecture and came a day after community transmissions of the variant were found in another western city of Osaka on Friday. In Tokyo, 38 new cases were recorded today, marking the eighth consecutive day for the number of new cases to exceed that of the previous week. The number of people getting their first jab of a Covid vaccine in England rose by around 46% in the week up to 21 December, figures by the UK’s Department for Health and Social Care show. In total, 221,564 first doses were administered in England in the week of 15-21 December, a 46% increase from the previous week. The total number of people getting a second dose was 279,112, a 39% jump from the week before. The largest increase was seen among young people, with an 85% increase in first doses for those aged 18 and 24 and a 71% increase in first doses for those aged 25 to 30, PA reports. In the week up to 21 December, more over 60s had had a first dose than during any seven-day period since early June. Officials in China are rushing to contain outbreaks in several regions, including the north-western city of Xi’an where 13 million residents have been under lockdown since Thursday. Of the 140 new infections reported today, 87 were locally transmitted, according to officials, compared with 55 a day earlier. In Xi’an, households have only been permitted to send one member outside every two days to purchase necessities. The city has recorded 330 locally transmitted symptomatic cases since the first case was reported on 9 December. Cases from Xi’an have so far spread to five other cities including Beijing, according to state media. China is on high alert for new infections as it prepares to hold the Winter Olympics in February in Beijing. The first doctor to alert South African authorities about the Omicron variant says India will see a surge in cases driven by the strain but the infection may be mild in most people as in South Africa. The Times of India quotes Dr Angelique Coetzee as saying existing vaccines will definitely control the contagion but unvaccinated people “will potentially spread the virus 100%”, adding: I believe it will be difficult [for the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic to end soon]. I presume it will become endemic. India will see a surge in Omicron-driven Covid-19 cases and simultaneously there will be a high-positivity rate. But hopefully the majority of the cases will be as mild as what we are seeing here in South Africa. Passengers travelling over the Christmas holiday have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 4,500 flights, according to a flight tracking website. A surge of cancellations on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day came as the rapidly spreading Omicron coronavirus variant meant carriers were unable to staff their flights. The website of the flight tracking firm FlightAware showed that 2,175 flights around the world had been scrapped on Christmas Eve, a typically heavy day for travel. Around a quarter of those were in the US. Another 1,779 flights were scrapped worldwide on Christmas Day, along with 402 more that had been scheduled for Sunday. The bulk of the cancellations came from five firms, with China Eastern cancelling 474 journeys, while Air China scrapped 188. United cancelled 177 flights, Air India 160 and Delta called off 150. Read the full article by my colleague Clea Skopeliti here: A United States Navy warship has delayed its deployment to South America because of a Covid outbreak among its crew, officials said. The USS Milwaukee, which deployed from Mayport, Florida, on 15 December will remain in port at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, where it had stopped for a scheduled visit, Associated Press reports. In a statement, the Navy said the ship’s crew is “100% immunised” and that all of those who tested positive for Covid-19 have been isolated on the ship away from other crew members. Early last year a major military outbreak of the virus saw the USS Theodore Roosevelt sidelined in Guam for nearly two months, and more than 1,000 of the 4,800 crew members tested positive. One sailor died, and the entire crew went through weeks of quarantine in a rotation that kept enough sailors on the ship to keep it safe and running. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic with me, Léonie Chao-Fong. Here’s a rundown of everything you might have missed. Passengers travelling over the Christmas holiday have been hit with disruption worldwide after airline companies cancelled more than 4,500 flights, as the rapidly spreading Omicron variant meant carriers were unable to staff their flights. Around a quarter of those were in the United States. The Chinese city of Xi’an, home to 13 million people, reported an increase in daily Covid-19 infections as the country’s latest hotspot entered its third day of lockdown. China as a whole reported 140 new confirmed coronavirus cases for Friday, an increase of 62% from 87 cases the day before, its health authority said. One in 35 people in England had Covid last week, new figures show, with 1.7 million people testing positive across the UK – the highest number on record so far. In London, hospital admissions due to Covid have nearly doubled week-on-week, the latest figures show. Across England, 1,246 admissions were recorded on December 22, up 55% week-on-week and the highest number for a single day since February 16. Ministers could meet as soon as Monday to determine whether new restrictions are needed in England over the new year amid growing concerns that soaring Covid cases could hit public services. France reported a record 94,124 new daily Covid-19 infections on Friday while the number of people hospitalised for the disease reached a seven-month high at close to 16,200, according to official data. The seven-day moving average of new cases also reached a new record of 66,417, a total that has tripled in just one month. People in South Africa without Covid symptoms will no longer have to test or self-isolate if a contact tests positive, the government announced on Friday. Additionally, South Africans will be offered a booster dose of Johnson &amp; Johnson’s vaccine from Friday after the health regulator approved its use for the general public. The US will next week lift the travel ban imposed on several southern African nations when the Omicron variant of Covid was first detected, AFP reports. The ban applied to South Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique and Malawi.

          "headline": "‘Don’t dance, sing or do stunts’: how Julian Hill became the most popular Australian politician on TikTok",
          "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has just joined TikTok - but the most popular Australian politician on the social media app isn’t the prime minister, nor the man vying to replace him. That honour goes to Julian Hill, a federal Labor MP from Victoria you may never have heard of if you’re not a user of the app famous for music videos and viral dances. With 125,000 followers and 1.8m likes on his videos at the time of writing, Hill comfortably beats the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, an early adopter of the video sharing social media app with 103,000 followers, into second place. The format allows users to post and share videos of up to three minutes (they are often shorter), rewarding those who can make an impression quickly. Homemade music or dance videos, lip syncs, mimes and satire tend to rate best among non-political users, but Hill’s attacks on his opponents have sent his viewer count soaring. Hill’s most popular video to date, with 1.1m views, is a three-minute clip of him finding creative ways to describe Scott Morrison’s “loose relationship with the truth” in a speech to parliament’s second-string federation chamber. Hill joined the app this year, thanks to the suggestion of Sam Richards, the son of family friends who completed his year 10 work experience in the MP’s office. “I was interested in [him joining] because he had a lot of social media platforms,” Richards tells Guardian Australia. “We started putting videos of his speeches and all that on there and it started to take off.” Richards says he and his friends are big TikTok users, and the platform appeals because the algorithm “tailors [videos] to what people want to see”. Hill says he published a “wide range of material” from parliamentary speeches, to pieces to camera, and while sometimes a video is a sure-fire hit, at other times “the algorithm can be mysterious”. “You’ve got to communicate with people where they are,” Hill says. “A growing number of people engage with social media through TikTok. You have to do them the courtesy of showing up and treating them as intelligent.” Hill says his golden rules are “be authentic, don’t dance, sing or do stunts”. Perhaps stunts are in the eye of the beholder – some might classify calling Indue to ask to be put on to the cashless debit card as a stunt. Hill has become something of an attack dog for Labor, from labelling Morrison a “bullshit artist” to joking about his plan to become a male model by 2050 to ridicule Coalition climate targets. Hill insists that what he posts to TikTok is often no different to content distributed through other social media, which he uses to amplify what he believes, whether said in parliament or outside. Some colleagues wonder whether Hill’s tone – for all his online popularity – may detract from his ability to convey his policy nous, such as work in parliamentary committees covering everything from outsourcing and migration to funding of the auditor general. Hill insists he does tackle the big issues on TikTok, including robodebt, climate change and jobs, immigration and visa issues. He says there is “lots of silly stuff” on TikTok but “although politics is a serious business, it doesn’t always have to be boring and un-engaging”. “That’s the line to tread.” Hill says he gets “great feedback when I’ve taken the time to explain a policy topic or the politics, as I see it, of what’s going on”. His videos about parliament sitting for just 10 days in the first half of 2022, or the Coalition’s move to block an investigation into Christian Porter’s donation disclosure are both in that vein. Richards says many of his friends now follow Hill – but Hill insists it isn’t a medium just for young people. “I had a woman in her 70s who messaged me, delighted by the [electoral boundary] redistribution. She said, ‘I’m glad I’m in your electorate because I follow you on TikTok’. “I’ve had numerous emails from [parents] thanking me for getting their kids engaged in politics, current affairs and ideas. “I get stopped in the street, in restaurants and shops by people wanting to talk to me because of something that struck them from TikTok, because I’ve taken the time to explain something by meeting them where they are.” Hill’s success has caused other MPs to flock to the platform, including the shadow education minister, Tanya Plibersek. Some of his colleagues are already stars of his channel. An unofficial account for Anthony Albanese has recently sprung up, but the Labor leader rated highly on Hill’s account for calling Peter Dutton a boofhead in question time. The manager of opposition business, Tony Burke, also rated strongly for comments attacking the government over Covid-19 vaccinations and quarantine. Richards says a lot more MPs have joined TikTok since Hill, but “no one’s topped Julian yet”. “I hope he stays in that top position, I’d love to see it … Of course it’s still going really well with the numbers – it’s exciting to see. “It was a great experience – the experience of being part of something that’s done well, and helped Julian out was really exciting for me.”"

          "headline": "Slice of life: New York’s famed $1 street pizza under threat from rising costs",
          "bodyText": "“Well, you can never go wrong with bread, cheese and tomato,” Lou Reed, poet of the New York streets, would sometimes remark as he passed by one of the city’s multitude of pizzerias. The late musician was a fan of Coney Island’s legendary Totonno’s, close to the site of one of the first recorded pizza parlors established by Italian immigrants in the 1880s. One hundred and forty years on, New York’s obsessive relationship with cheap street pizza – there are around 1,700 pizzerias across the city – is as enmeshed as ever. But there are now cracks in that union. Rent is increasing, and supply chain problems leading to inflation is pushing up the cost of oil, cheese, wheat and meat. Deliveries are spotty, tomato sauce faces higher shipping costs, and pizza boxes are scarce. Now the existence of the fabled 99¢ or dollar pizza outlets that rely on fast, high-volume trade is being threatened after nearly two years of pandemic-reduced foot traffic. That is a blow not only to the city’s image, but also to many low-income New Yorkers in times of trouble. Abdul Muhammad, owner of 99 Cent Fresh Pizza, an eight-location chain in Manhattan, said he may raise the price of his slice for the first time since opening in 2001 if costs continue to rise. “I have to think about it because my customers, many of them unemployed and struggling to make rent, can’t afford to pay more.” 99 Cent Fresh stayed open during the pandemic except for one month in March 2020, in part, Muhammed said, because he knows that for some of his customers a slice is all the food they may get. “I feel bad because everybody has had a lot of problems with the coronavirus, no jobs, everything was closed, and the food stores that were open doubled their prices. So I try to stay open to help the people,” Muhammad added. Outside the 99 Cent Fresh location on 6th Avenue and 8th street, several customers said they relied on the outlet. “I come here when I’m hungry, but I can’t come here all the time because I’m diabetic,” said Sam Pegano, who said he was homeless. “It’s important to me, especially in the winter, because it’s hot food.” Others stopping by said the dollar slice was important to their lives because it was fast and cheap. “People in New York love dollar-slice pizza because they’re everywhere around the city and they’re open late,” said NYU data science graduate Bishank Gaglani. “Whenever you need to grab a bite, and don’t know what to have, you can have a slice and you’re good to go.” Gaglani said he’d noticed that prices had been rising. “I can’t imagine New York City without the dollar slice. But even if it goes to $1.50, people will still come.” Within New York’s complex pizza ecology, the 99¢ or dollar slice has a controversial reputation. Pizzerias like the famous John’s of Bleecker Street won’t touch the slice trade, opting only for complete pies. Others embellish their slices, and jack up prices to $4 or more. The search of the perfect pizza, a quixotic undertaking, occupies some minds, including that of Scott Weiner, owner of Scott’s Pizza Tours, which ferries enthusiasts across the city by bus in that search. According to Weiner, the dollar-slice business model emerged as a business that worked next to homeless shelters. “It almost seemed like a public service,” he said. After the 2008 recession, the business expanded to high foot-traffic areas and transportation hubs. “It became late-night food for drunk people with the same economics as a $3 slice shop but with more volume,” he said. “At the same time, it lowered the perception of quality of pizza in New York, and became a shining beacon in a city that’s so expensive to live. It was like, look at how cool this city is – you can get a slice of pizza for a dollar.” While New Yorkers are forced to pick and choose their battles – high rents being common – the cheap pizza slice is a way to, in a sense, win one back. “The citizenry is empowered by the variety of pizza in New York because you can choose between getting a 12in, high-quality, great-ingredients, skilled-producer single-serving Neapolitan pizza for $18 or the dollar-per-slice at the opposite end of the spectrum,” said Weiner. Both, Weiner said, can quench the thirst – “it just depends on what the thirst is”. At the same, Weiner worries that dollar-slice chain owners have committed themselves to their pricing in their name and cannot withstand pricing fluctuations. When leases are renewed with higher rents, that alone can wreck New York’s famously tough restaurant business model – which has been hit hard by the pandemic. By some estimates, more than 1,000 New York restaurants have closed during Covid-19. But – despite current travails – New York’s pizza love affair will continue. After all, it has such a long past. Pizza historian Peter Regas traces the first published accounts of a pizzeria to Naples around 1845, when it was described as the “gastronomic thermometer of the market”. By the end of the century, Italian immigrants had bought the tradition to New York, where they established pizza ovens, often in taverns, in harbor or beachfront neighborhoods like Red Hook and Coney Island. “It’s pretty definitive that New York is the home of the pizza in America,” Regas said. The industry grew after prohibition was lifted in 1933, and gre more during the Great Depression and after the second world war, spreading to Chicago. Regional differences began to develop. Chicago, home of the deep-crust pizza, has scant tradition of slice culture. The custom of the single slice, which came into being in the late 1940s, is integral to New York, despite the misgivings of more traditional pizzeria owners, said Regas. The loss of it, he believes, would be a loss to all. Regas recalled a legendary pizzeria, Di Fara on Avenue J in Brooklyn. The elderly owner, Dom, who had been operating there since 1964, became known as the guy for a slice. “I went there in 2006 and there were like 50 people in his shop just staring at him,” he said. “There’s a magic to pizza. There’s an individual personality to a pizza that you don’t necessary get with a hamburger or hot dog, and that plays into the mystery and drama of the whole thing.”"

          "bodyText": "Other people! We stepped – some hesitantly, others pell-mell – back outside last spring. Even if summer and autumn 2021 often felt like a cautious return to normalish (terms and conditions very much applied), amps were dusted down, guitar techs tuned up and Portaloos could not be hired for love nor money as audiences and artists once again met IRL to exchange CO2. For every summer festival that went ahead, though, it felt like two were cancelled. The live music industry cried out for government-backed insurance schemes; these came very late in the day. Glastonbury went online, but glitched; Kano, Idles and Thom Yorke’s new project the Smile nonetheless made memories. Indoor venues reopened; the practice of being politely frisked for your Covid status became just another part of going out. The future kept arriving at pace: popular under lockdown, live streams remained an evolving fixture, many of them reinventing the live spectacle as they went. K-pop superstars BTS probably monopolised the most eyeballs, but in a crowded field, three more stood out: Bob Dylan’s stunning, smoke-filled Shadow Kingdom; Bicep’s retina-melting graphic introduction to Isles from London’s Saatchi Gallery; and St Vincent’s glitzy, sepia Down and Out Downtown. Non-fungible tokens became a trending search term: somewhere between a digital work of art and betting on crypto, NFTs generated cash for some forward-facing artists (Grimes and Kings of Leon among them); for smaller names, not so much. There was some encouraging news for the medium-sized artist, however. Hopes that the streaming model – under which artists are currently paid a pittance – might be reformed, at least in the UK, was sparked by an extensive cross-party Department for Digital, Culture Media and Sport inquiry calling for a “complete reset” of the economics of streaming remuneration. Almost as important as the streaming platforms themselves, as a shopfront for music, was TikTok, where memes, dance crazes and fan-generated creative reuses made reputations daily (such as the UK’s PinkPantheress) and gave old tracks (Little Simz’s Venom, say, or Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue’s Whatta Man) new leases of life. Hand in hand with the new came blasts from the past. Get Back was a groundbreaking deep-dive documentary that threw back the veil on the Beatles’ final weeks in 1969, laying bare their creative process and inter-relationships. Summer of Soul, Questlove’s equally unmissable documentary about the 1969 Harlem Cultural festival, also made use of extraordinary vault footage and featured electrifying performances from everyone from Nina Simone to Sly and the Family Stone. While pop continued to throw out fresh sensations – welcome Olivia Rodrigo, pop-punk adjacent chanteuse of teen heartbreak, who bossed charts either side of the Atlantic – the old-school album could still shift dials. Abba returned in fantastic voice after nearly 40 years. Force majeure Adele, meanwhile, came back with 30, a full-throated, grownup record about female unhappiness and its remedies. Her desire to not settle for a life of quiet desperation was echoed in the indie sphere by Rebecca Lucy Taylor’s equally powerful second album as Self Esteem. And behind the scenes, one camera-shy talent came into his own: Adele’s was one of a number of records this year in which shadowy but tireless London producer Dean Josiah Cover, AKA Inflo, had a hand (Sault’s Nine and Little Simz’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert were the other two headline-grabbers, not forgetting Cleo Sol’s Mother). A couple of very 21st-century US artists proved they weren’t mere flashes in the pan. Emotive and thought-provoking albums came from made-over Gen-Z siren Billie Eilish and genre-slaying, LGBTQ+ mischief-maker Lil Nas X. Dave’s second album, the pandemic-referencing, self-examining We’re All Alone in This Together, maintained the high bar of his first. Whether going deaf in public with friends once again, or the communities self-generating on TikTok, togetherness proved a mighty weapon this year. A case in point: Britney Spears’s conservatorship ended, with empowered fan activism widely credited as the irresistible force that pushed over the immovable legal object. The top 10 albums of 2021 1 . Ignorance The Weather Station Tamara Lindeman’s oblique, elliptical breakup album between humanity and the planet was as beautiful as it was desperate. 2. Prioritise Pleasure Self Esteem Recovering people-pleaser Rebecca Lucy Taylor channelled her considerable wit and frustration into this liberatory dance-pop opus. 3. Promises Floating Points, Pharoah Sanders and the LSO One electronic producer, one jazz great and an orchestra ebbed and flowed in stunning fashion. 4. Space 1.8 Nala Sinephro Spiritual jazz for right now, the medicinal debut album by Belgian-born, London-based harpist Sinephro was the panacea a wounded world demanded. 5. Nine Sault Sault’s albums of 2020 tackled the brutality of US law enforcement; this year’s Nine doubled down on the collective’s London roots, their pain and their joy. 6. Sometimes I Might Be Introvert Little Simz Incipient fame caused rapper Little Simz to tussle with her own demons, celebrate Black sisterhood and exude compassion and rage. 7. Isles Bicep Frequently tagged as 90s rave revivalists, the Northern Irish duo’s second album transcended their sources with a slew of emotive digital bangers. 8. For the First Time Black Country, New Road Guitar music for the 21st century: klezmer hooks, lashings of sax and riveting lyrics about sertraline. Unmissable. 9. Spare Ribs Sleaford Mods Great guests and peeks into Jason Williamson’s childhood elevated the Mods’ bilious sixth record alongside Andrew Fearne’s sublime beats. 10. Pohorylle Margo Cilker The contemporary country debut by this ninja-level Oregon troubadour had everything: dangerous rivers, broken hearts and a longing for “all of the wine in the world”. Turkey Donda Kanye West Overhyped and confused, West’s 10th album was no fitting tribute to the late Dr Donda West."

          "bodyText": "Remarkably, the website is still live. Eight months after the European Super League disintegrated in an embarrassing fireball, you might think its founders would be minded to erase all trace of their hubris and humiliation. But perhaps that would be to credit them with too much competence. And so there it remains to this day: “The Super League is a new European competition between 20 top clubs comprised of 15 founders and five annual qualifiers.” Well, good luck with that. There is, of course, an alternative theory. After all, the Super League is still not quite dead in a legislative sense; certainly not if you believe the loud and persistent avowals of Andrea Agnelli at Juventus, Joan Laporta at Barcelona and Florentino Pérez at Real Madrid, the three remaining hoarse men of the apocalypse. Meanwhile the impulses that generated the Super League – greed, inequality, shifting financial models, Covid – have not disappeared. Perhaps on reflection, that the Super League website is still up is not an oversight, but a warning. The junking of the Super League may have been a rare moment of harmony in a toxically clannish game – and really, it takes some effort to unite the commentariat, the players, the coaches, the broadcasters, the vast majority of the clubs and the vast majority of fans in revulsion at your product. But in the days and weeks afterwards fans talked openly of a new compact in football, a renegotiated and more equitable power settlement that placed supporters and communities at its heart. As we near the end of one of the most tumultuous and rancourous years in the history of football, how’s that going? In order to answer that question let’s start at Oldham, who banned three of their own fans from Boundary Park for “promoting dislike” against the club’s owner, Abdallah Lemsagam, before reversing their decision amid a widespread backlash. In his three years in charge, Lemsagam has overseen nine managerial changes and a drop to 23rd in League Two. Explaining his original decision (taken from his home in Dubai), Lemsagam offered this reasoning: “If they are not behaving like every person just watching the game, they deserve to be banned. If you want to protest, nobody can stop you. But why can’t I also ban you?” In a way, this is the basic ideological faultline of modern football: what is a club and who does it belong to? The romantic will tell you a club is the sum total of its people and its history, that players and coaches pass through but fans remain true, that owners are no more than custodians preserving the institution for the next generation. The three briefly banned fans may feel that Oldham are more their club than Lemsagam’s. But the Companies House filings will tell a very different story. This is why any attempt to frame the power imbalance in football as one of bigger clubs against smaller clubs, or even bigger leagues and smaller leagues, often obscures as much as it illuminates. Part of the ideological opposition to the Super League was based on the idea of football as a pyramid: a linked whole driving not just investment but aspiration and hope. But within this structure all sorts of complex smaller battles are being fought: between fans and owners, fans and other fans, players and governing bodies, clubs and agents, clubs and broadcasters, broadcasters and fans. The economist Paul Mason argues that football is not so much a pyramid as a “class struggle”: between fans and players on one side, and the massed ranks of owners, broadcasters, the financial sector and big tech on the other. If one side possesses most of the fervour, the talent and the human emotion, the other side owns pretty much everything else. To modern capitalism, football is essentially a product to be sold, generated, grown, disseminated. Anything that distracts from this fundamental goal – player welfare, fan sentiment, 3pm kick-offs – must by extension be suppressed. The Super League crystallised this vision perfectly. Too perfectly: in explicitly stating its intention to convert 65 years of European football history into a sort of fungible on-demand content stream, an enclosed circus, a Vegas residency, it horrified not just long-standing “legacy” fans but also advocates of the status quo. The snap-back has been modest but not inconsequential. Manchester United’s first ever fan advisory board will meet in January with Joel Glazer in attendance. Liverpool and Chelsea have announced similar plans. None of this would have happened without the Super League. So is this a defining moment? Have the owners of the biggest clubs undergone a Damascene conversion to democracy? Or was it merely an attempt to stave off the more far-reaching reforms proposed by the government’s fan-led review, which was unveiled last month with proposals for an independent regulator and a levy on Premier League transfer fees? The fierce backlash to the latter proposals from some owners – the Leeds chief executive, Angus Kinnear, derided them as “Maoist” – suggests any meaningful change in the game will have to be won over the stiffest resistance. And besides, what are the available vehicles for change? Fifa? National governments? Fan boycotts? Good luck with any of that. What is certainly true is that the appetite for change is there. Breaking with football’s traditional model of saturation and endless growth is no longer a niche opinion but a mainstream opinion. “Football must change quickly,” the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, said in a recent interview. “The quality of the show has dropped a lot. The players cannot take it any more. Fatigue, injuries, games that end 10-0. Enough is enough.” This is not a conversation we were having 20 years or even five years ago. But of course, everyone agrees on the need for change. It is the direction that is contested. For people such as Pérez, Ancelotti’s boss, the answer to competitive imbalance is simply for Madrid to stop playing teams such as Elche and Leganés (“I do not think it’s more attractive to watch unfamiliar teams,” he said during the infamous El Chiringuito interview in April). The answer to player fatigue is to reduce games to 45 or 60 minutes with plenty of ad breaks for the broadcasters. The Super League itself may have been defeated but its ideas continue to triumph everywhere. In April, Uefa quietly pushed through its new 36-team Champions League format that provides an even bigger safety net to the biggest clubs. Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain may have been toppled in Italy and France, but elsewhere established giants firmly laid to rest any notion that Covid might offer a temporary levelling of the playing field. Sheriff Tiraspol made it six titles in a row in Moldova, Red Bull Salzburg eight in a row in Austria, Bayern Munich nine in a row in Germany, Ludogorets 10 in a row in Bulgaria. Across Europe, clubs are partnering with cryptocurrency companies with the sole intention of further milking their fanbases for cash. In England, virus-emaciated squads are being forced to play three games in a week because nobody is brave or foolish enough to slow down the gravy train. And yet even in these grim days of midwinter, it remains possible to glimpse something better. The Super League protests showed us that when fans and players and genuine football lovers speak with a single voice, not even the most powerful men in the game can thwart them. Eight months on, much of that initial energy may have diffused and dissipated, but the will to change football for the better has not subsided. In time, we may come back to look on 2021 as the year when football’s silent majority finally, tentatively, discovered its voice."

          "bodyText": "Liverpool It’s going pretty much how most Liverpool fans expected: we’re up at the top and we cruised through the Champions League group stage to the knockouts. We’re playing some brilliant football and we’re a joy to watch. We’ve had our big names back from injury, which has boosted confidence, and, when we do go behind, the belief is there that we’ll score and score again, and usually go on to win. 9/10 Stars/flops Mo Salah is the obvious standout performer and remains on another level to anyone else in the league. It’s a thrill and privilege to watch him play every week. We’re finally seeing how brilliant Thiago is and new signing Konaté is already proving he’ll go on to be a major player. A word, too, for young Tyler Morton who has been eased into the team and really shown his potential. As for flops? I seem to have been saying this for some time but we really don’t have any. Happy with the manager? He has elevated us to Europe’s most revered and feared team. He makes us smile in our play and his actions. We could have no better boss. 10/10 We will finish … 1st. Funniest moment in 2021? During the games against Atlético Madrid, seeing Diego Simeone reduced from touchline hard case to panto villain. Oh, and Fred lunging at a laughing Konaté at Old Trafford, sending himself viral. • Steph Jones Manchester City I don’t think it could have gone much better. We’re top of the tree at Christmas, three points clear of Liverpool, topped our Champions League group (ahead of PSG) and have managed our squad really well. The only real disappointment so far was getting knocked out of our beloved Carabao. 9.5/10 Stars/flops Plenty of stars. But the standout, without doubt, has been Bernardo Silva. He and Salah are comfortably the best players in the league this season. He’s always been a one-man pressing machine, a mesmeric dribbler, and capable of dictating the pace of a game on his own, but this season he’s added goals and assists. He can literally do everything. Cancelo and Rodri definitely deserve mentions too. Both have taken their games to another level. Happy with the manager? Of course. Pep has proven yet again that he’s the best in the business. Klopp is a close second and Liverpool’s resurgence is mightily impressive, but Pep’s consistency and relentlessness is unrivalled. I thought the lack of a striker would hamper us – Pep really wanted a No 9 and I thought he’d struggle to keep the striker-less system fresh – but he’s done it. He has us perfectly positioned going into 2022. 10/10. We will finish … 1st. Funniest moment in 2021? Ole being at the wheel. I think I speak on behalf of all City fans when I say I’m gutted that era is over. It was a great laugh. Oh, and people seriously tipping United for the title in August. • Lloyd Scragg ninetythreetwenty.com; @lloyd_scragg Manchester United It’s been awful. Many of us expected to be legitimate title challengers after finishing second last season and adding Varane, Sancho and Ronaldo. Going top after Ronaldo’s second debut against Newcastle added to that sense. So what followed beggared belief. The 5-0 defeat to Liverpool was the worst, most humiliating loss in living memory. It was clear for a while that the players had stopped playing for the manager: Ole should have walked then rather than wait for further defeats to City and, embarrassingly, Watford. 2/10 Stars/flops We’ve become over-reliant on Ronaldo but Greenwood and a rejuvenated De Gea have been the best out of a poor bunch. Varane’s injury was a blow: he steadied a flapping defence bereft of any confidence. Flops? Bruno has been way below his usual standard but his mediocre performances are nothing compared with the pathetic fare served up by Wan Bissaka and captain Maguire. Both consistently woeful. Happy with the manager? It’s too early to rate him but he talks a good game. I admired his comments about players not wanting to be at the club, and him saying: “I don’t communicate with agents via the media and press.” I hope he clears the decks of the wage thieves and will address the lack of quality in the midfield. We will finish … 4th. Funniest moment in 2021? The reaction of rivals when we re-signed Ronaldo on that Friday afternoon in August. It really lifted our spirits in what seems otherwise like a really drab 12 months of football. • Shaun O’Donnell Newcastle One win in 18, calamitous defending, rotten luck and some troubling refereeing … it’s been a nightmare, even by our standards. But Ashley’s departure and Eddie Howe’s appointment lifted the mood. Home matches no longer reek of toxicity and, at times, the atmosphere has been electric. Yes, the short-term prognosis is dire and it’ll take a long time to emerge from Ashley’s shadow, but the future looks brighter than it has in years – whether we are relegated or not. There is hope. 2/10 Stars/flops Callum Wilson is a true Newcastle No 9: vital to the cause. But our error-prone defenders – especially Jamaal Lascelles and Ciaran Clark – are threatening our Premier League status and, sadly, Joe Willock hasn’t lived up to his promise. In truth, after years of neglect, we’re lacking in real quality all over the pitch. There are too many Championship level players in the current squad. Happy with the manager? Howe “gets” Newcastle and has the respect of our fans. The team look fitter and more positive going forward … and he seems to have turned the much-maligned Joelinton into a world beater… At 4-0 down against Man City, we were singing “Eddie Howe’s black and white army”, which says it all. 7/10. As for Steve Bruce, we’re surprised he didn’t get the Manchester United job, given the esteem the football intelligentsia seem to hold him in… 2/10 We will finish … 17th. That’s with huge investment in January, and a miraculous turnaround. Funniest moment in 2021? Local lad Sam Fender’s hungover appearance on BBC Breakfast the morning after the takeover was completed. Fair play, he did well to get through it. • David and Richard Holmes Norwich We’re bottom, we’ve been there for most of the season, we’ve scored eight goals and have been ridiculed by everyone from the MotD crew to that bloke on Twitter who reckons we should declare and hand back our Premier League cash. It’s been grim, basically. As is invariably the case when we breathe in this refined air, we’ve struggled to compete. It seems our “self-funding” model, however worthy, is incompatible with being competitive at this level. 3/10 Stars/flops Mathias Normann – a summer loan signing from Rostov – has been the pick of the bunch but in typical Norwich fashion managed to pick up a pelvic injury just when he’d really started to make a difference. Ditto Milot Rashica who, after a slow start, found a rich vein of form before, you guessed it, picking up an injury that ruled him out for all of December. Happy with the manager? Dean Smith has an unenviable task but, armed with a squad that is simply not good enough, has made a decent enough start. 6/10. Daniel Farke was brilliant at getting us promoted but unable to work his magic in the Premier League. We will finish … 20th. Funniest moment in 2021? Laughs have been limited in Norfolk, so my thanks to Leeds fans who, while watching their team getting pumped by Arsenal, found it in their hearts to speak for the nation with a song about Boris Johnson. Not repeatable but it was both amusing and spot-on. • Gary Gowers myfootballwriter.com; @Gary_Gowers; @MFW_NCFC Southampton Performances have largely been fine but instinctively it feels that results haven’t quite matched them – despite taking seven more points compared with the corresponding games last season. That’s probably a result of the ever-growing but ever-tedious “points dropped from winning positions” statistic. If we could hold on to a lead we’d be comfortably in the top half and very happy with life. 6/10 Stars/flops Mohammed Salisu and Tino Livramento have stood out in a defence that has often struggled as a collective. Armando Broja has scored some important goals at the other end in a relatively unproductive attack, while Che Adams’ displays have been better than his goal return would suggest. On the flipside, Jan Bednarek has regressed and captain James Ward-Prowse – following a bumper new contract in September – hasn’t been up to his usual high standards. Happy with the manager? Reasonably. He still makes some baffling selections and can still be too slow to react to opposition changes, but we are pretty well-drilled. He’s also now the longest-serving Saints manager since Chris Nichol in the 80s, which says quite a lot – not much of it positive – about the club over the last 30 years or so. 6.5/10 We will finish … 12th. Funniest moment in 2021? I was a big fan of the whole England setup winding up the Conservative party during the Euros, and the government flailing desperately to row back on the criticism as we progressed further in the tournament. Funny in many aspects but also a sad indictment on modern life and governance, I guess. • Steve Grant SaintsWeb.co.uk; @SteveGrant1983 Tottenham The Tottenham rollercoaster. You have no choice but to get on it and no way of getting off it. From Kane in Disneyland to the misguided appointment of “nice guy” Nuno to then finally getting our man. No, not Mauricio; Antonio. Conte is the jolt Spurs have been desperate for. With games in hand we’re in contention for the top four – even in crisis, we still find a way to potentially gatecrash. Conte will fix us but it will take time. 8/10 for Spursyness, 6/10 for the mess we’ve allowed Antonio to inherit. Stars/flops Eric Dier, Ben Davies and Oliver Skipp have excelled: proof that Conte can reboot players. Tanguy Ndombele continues to be benched, not because he lacks talent, but because, like Dele Alli, he doesn’t quite fit. Unless they too are rebooted. Future acquisitions need to blend into the blueprint. Happy with the manager? Nuno was a cursed placeholder. 4/10 is the most diplomatic score I can offer him. Conte? We are blessed. His obsessive mentality is what we need: a culture-defining appointment. 9/10 for simply getting him in our colours. We will finish … 4th, because I wear my heart on my sleeve. I’m a romantic fool. Covid, postponements and the impact on training make it improbable that we’ll find the momentum, but … well, this is THFC. We often do the opposite of what everyone expects. Funniest moment in 2021? Getting beaten by Zagreb, whose manager was in prison, was a glorious moment of dark comedy. A very special moment indeed, would you agree, José? • Spooky dearmrlevy.com; thefightingcock.co.uk; @spooky23 Watford Some things haven’t gone well, some things haven’t worked and perspective is always shaped by the most recent events … So, overall “could have been a lot better, could have been worse” sums it up. 5/10 Stars/flops Emmanuel Dennis has grown from being an occasionally effective irritant to consistently top class. Also Moussa Sissoko, more captainy with every game, is dominant in a reworked midfield. Less successful have been Danny Rose, who has been very decent sometimes but less than decent too often, and William Troost-Ekong, who has suffered a crisis of confidence in our volatile defence. Happy with the manager? Results haven’t really improved but that disguises the stark contrast between the relatively gentle opening to the season and a daunting run more recently, at just the point when a rejuvenated side under Ranieri might have picked up some momentum. We recorded our first win at Everton, thrashed United, scared Chelsea and limited a rampant Man City to 3-1. We now have a presentable, credible side with a couple of things that aren’t quite working. Progress. 7/10 We will finish … 14th. Funniest moment in 2021? Bournemouth’s collapse was enjoyed and celebrated far and wide. And Tyrone Mings’ own goal on the opening day – via a perversely unlucky deflection – also had a touch of karma about it. Two years ago he somehow escaped a red card against us at Villa Park before unwittingly scoring a last-minute winner when Ezri Konsa’s shot deflected in off his backside. • Matt Rowson bhappy.wordpress.com; @mattrowson West Ham There’s been a slight slump recently but we’ve progressed with surprising ease in the Europa League and been challenging for the top four. With fans back, the London Stadium has finally started to feel more like home and West Ham have at times been massive (everywhere we go), beating Spurs, Man United, Man City, Liverpool and Chelsea, which is unprecedented. The only downside is that the squad is now looking stretched. 8/10 Stars/flops Declan Rice has looked the league’s best defensive midfielder, gliding through matches and adding a great turn of pace. He’s also had a social media hit with Rice Baby. Credit also to Jarrod Bowen, who’s on fire and, erm, dating Dani Dyer, Antonio, Fornals, Benrahma, Johnson and the unsung Craig Dawson. Relative flops have been Soucek, who looks very tired, and new signings Vlasic and Kral, though it’s early days. Happy with the manager? He has transformed the club, taking us from relegation fodder to contenders for a Champions League place. We very rarely have two good seasons in a row, but so far Moyes has bucked that trend. Should he get us to a cup final the party could rival one of Boris’s. But as he says, having set high standards, the players have to keep them up. The only gripe is Moyes’ failure to secure a back-up striker in the summer. 8/10 We will finish … 7th. The pressure on our small squad is likely to tell with Zouma and Ogbonna out, and having Antonio as our only striker. Funniest moment in 2021? Arthur Masuaku proving that he really is better than Lukaku with that late winner against Chelsea. Don’t be fooled by Arthur’s false modesty – he definitely saw Mendy off his line and scored with a sublime Messi-like chip. • Pete May Author, Goodbye to Boleyn; hammersintheheart.blogspot.co.uk Wolves Better than expected. I was worried about Nuno being replaced by a new coach with little reputation, and by only minor surgery to a squad that limped home last season. But Lage has proved an astute tactician, the new players have done well and we’ve been a highly competitive outfit. Not too shabby at all. 8/10 Stars/flops Max Kilman has graduated from squad filler to first-team regular and looks like a top Premier League defender. Behind him José Sá had big boots to fill replacing Rui Patrício but has been an upgrade in almost every respect. It’s harsh to call them flops but Traoré, Trincão and Podence haven’t managed a single league goal between them and our attacking output has been poor. Happy with the manager? 9/10. You just have to look at the group of players he’s working with and the level of competition. He’s done about as well as anyone could expect. He wants to be progressive in possession but is also wise enough to know he has to play to the team’s strengths. We will finish … 9th. I’ve seen enough to believe we can hold our own in the mid-table scrap but Europe will probably be out of reach unless we make some decent additions in January. Historically, we don’t do much so I’m not holding my breath. Funniest moment in 2021? Raúl’s viral failed Rabona gave me a chuckle. His comeback has been one of football’s feelgood stories this year and he’s looked like he’s really enjoying his football – maybe a bit too much on that occasion… • Thomas Baugh wolvesblog.com; @wolvesblog • Part one: Arsenal to Leicester"

          "headline": "Putting the ‘national’ in the National Gallery: Kaywin Feldman wants the museum to serve the people",
          "bodyText": "Donato Bramante’s Tempietto in Rome. The Parthenon in Athens. Angkor Wat in Cambodia. The Barcelona pavilion in Spain. The Guggenheim museum in New York. And the White House in Washington. All have been turned into architectural birthday cakes by Kaywin Feldman, director of the National Gallery of Art, as gifts for her architect husband. “I’m not a cook so they’re not pastry masterpieces,” says the 55-year-old, who used carrots for the minarets of the Hagia Sophia mosque in Turkey. “They sort of amuse me.” It seems just that the custodian of some 156,000 works of art, from Rembrandt to Rothko, not to mention a constant cycle of temporary exhibitions, should be allowed a creative outlet of her own, albeit an unusual one (she also engraves fresh jars of peanut butter). Feldman became the fifth director of the National Gallery – and first woman to lead it – in March 2019. A year later she initiated an unprecedented shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic and, like other cultural leaders, confronted historic racial injustices in the wake of the police murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Now the gallery has a clutch of new shows that include African American photographer James Van Der Zee’s chronicle of life in Harlem, New York, in the 1920s and 1930s, and The New Woman Behind the Camera, a radical reassessment of the impact women had on the history of modern photography. Sitting in a beige seventh-floor office with one of the best views in Washington – her window is dominated by the west front of the US Capitol, scene of presidential inaugurations and the 6 January insurrection. The National Gallery, which receives two thirds of its budget from Congress, is a national treasure that offers free admission and received around 5 million visitors a year before the pandemic. Feldman says: “I feel like I was hired with one clear mandate from the board which, they like to say, is to put the ‘national’ back in the National Gallery and think about how we serve the American people, because our funding in large part comes from the American taxpayers.” Among the first steps was boosting the gallery’s digital strategy and answering the pleas of many visitors for better signage around its maze-like buildings. She discovered that there was no simple, unifying brand identity so she had a new logo, combining a conservative typeface with a bright color palette, crafted by the top design firm Pentagram. Then just over a year into her tenure, Covid-19 hit. The institution has weathered the storm better than most. It did not have to make drastic cuts to staff and was forced to cancel only one exhibition, though dates of others were juggled. Like other museums it endured stops and starts, with its longest spell of closure running from November to May. Even then Feldman came to work almost every day along with a skeleton staff of between 60 and 80 security and maintenance workers. Free from tourist crowds, she had the privilege of being able to walk the corridors and savor personal favorites such as a portrait of Napoleon by Jacques-Louis David and The Feast of the Gods by Giovanni Bellini and Titian. But the novelty soon wore off. “In the first couple of weeks, I thought, ‘Ah! I’ve got the gallery to myself, I can go in all of the galleries and enjoy the collection,’” she says. “I did for a while and then it became depressing. As fantastic as the works of art are, they need people to just bring them to life and I didn’t like the total quiet and still atmosphere.” Then came the Black Lives Matter uprising. Having lived in Minneapolis for 11 years before taking this job, Feldman was well aware of the local context surrounding the death of Floyd, an African American man, under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin. Museums, theatres and other organisations that had long paid lip service to racial diversity, equity and inclusion faced a new reckoning. Feldman says: “Most organisations, but certainly museums, are all about people and so issues like that resonate. Since I arrived it’s a topic that we’d been talking about but the murder of George Floyd just added more urgency to doing the work and the realisation of how much more that we had to do.” Notably the gallery postponed an exhibition by Philip Guston, a white artist whose work depicts cartoon-like, hooded figures that allude to the Ku Klux Klan in attempt to critique white supremacy. Feldman was condemned, including by some Black artists, for seemingly trying to dodge a potential controversy. She defended the decision in an article for international art magazine Apollo earlier this year: “Guston used these figures to explore the seeds of racism and the capacity for evil in all humans. His intentions were good, as are those of the National Gallery in presenting the exhibition. But those good intentions do not negate the trauma we may cause in a public display of imagery that makes reference to slavery, lynching and racial terror.” She added: “It is imperative that the National Gallery slow down and really listen, not only to the curators and art critics but also to members of our staff and the wider community who have something to say about how these works affect them. To ignore or dismiss their very real emotions would be to deny their value and their agency. We will gain new understandings of Guston’s work and the important issues the artist raised by listening to people whom museum directors don’t always hear.” Her position has not changed. “It’s a very important show for us and one that we are committed to and we’re hosting in 2023,” she says. “But between the pandemic and the inability to have in-person conversations and the moment of of Floyd’s killing, which caused us all to think more about diversity and inclusion within the institutions, the pause was really important for us.” Before then Afro-Atlantic Histories, a show looking at the historical experiences and cultural formations of Black and African people since the 17th century, will open in April. “It’s another one that’s causing us to stretch in new ways and I always say that to successfully embrace exhibitions that deal with particularly America’s complicated and painful past, museums have to come from a place of authenticity, legitimacy, generosity and curiosity.” Feldman estimates that about 90% of the National Gallery’s permanent collection is by white male artists, but notes that in recent years it has gained significant works by artists of color, including Native Americans. In October the museum announced the acquisition of The American People Series #18: The Flag is Bleeding (1967), its first painting by Faith Ringgold, one of America’s most important Black female artists. The gallery has also diversified its leadership team, Feldman notes, including hiring Kanitra Fletcher as its first ever curator of African American and Afro-Diasporic art. Feldman brings a transatlantic perspective. She was born in Boston but lived in Britain from age six to 11 when her father, who served in the US Coast Guard, had a stint at the American embassy in London. She reflects: “I have such a nostalgia for my childhood and growing up. We lived in Gerrards Cross in Buckinghamshire and I went to a very small English school just up the street that I could walk to. It was a very idyllic place.” Feldman later worked in the education department at the British Museum (“that’s sort of my home museum”) and also carried out a work project at the National Gallery in London, which was a model for the Washington version conceived in the 1930s by Andrew Mellon, a financier, US treasury secretary, art collector and Anglophile. “It was never his intention that we would have a representative showing the entire school of American art or Spanish painting,” Feldman explains. “It was the idea that it would just be jewels in the crown, much like the National Gallery in London, and they really are a sister institution to us. We work together constantly. We’re both very generous in lending works of art and are in close touch. It’s a friendship and collegiality that all of us here really enjoy.” London, New York and other major art cities became famous for “blockbuster exhibitions”, hot ticket shows built around signature artists that drew long queues. But Feldman, a past president of the Association of Art Museum Directors and past chair of the American Alliance of Museums, suspects the phenomenon may be drawing to a close. “I think the museum extravaganza blockbuster era is going to decline partly because of the wear and tear on works of art and then because of climate change. The environmental impact of these big exhibitions is extraordinary. “You can have an exhibition with 60 or 80 different lenders. Those are all airplanes and crates that, if you’re really lucky, get recycled for another two uses but otherwise they’re thrown away. The installations and sets are often thrown away. It is a topic that the field has to start stepping up to.” She adds: “The part that I find so exciting about that is thinking about how we might think differently about the permanent collection. I don’t just mean doing exhibitions out of the permanent collection, while that is certainly legitimate, but we have an extraordinary collection of masterpieces here. We have the best so why not think about new kinds of installations and galleries and projects to animate the collection that we have?” The upheaval of recent years has evidently offered an opportunity to pause and rethink a museum as a place of people as well as objects, a place with responsibilities to the nation and even the planet. In 2016 Philando Castile, an African American man, was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop in Minnesota. Then director of the Minneapolis Institute of Art, Feldman mounted a small exhibition in response, an expression of connection with its community. The impact remains profound for her. She recalls: “One of my trustees in Minneapolis in exasperation once said to me, ‘Why does everybody expect museums to solve so many of the issues in society today?’ I said it’s because museums are about people. We’re not just things because the objects we have on the walls were all created by people in particular circumstances, often for people, and we welcome people in to experience it.”"

          "headline": "Head of US FDA’s advisory group: ‘We never expected Covid vaccines to be so good, so effective’",
          "bodyText": "It is likely that in the “before times”, few Americans knew that independent experts advised the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and that the FDA usually took their advice. Less than a year into the Covid-19 pandemic, that quickly changed. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee became arguably the most closely watched group of experts in the US federal government. The media followed hearings, and thousands of Americans tuned in live to see whether these scientists considered Covid vaccines safe and effective. For the chair of that advisory group, Dr Arnold Monto, a professor at the University of Michigan’s school of public health, the last year has been a revelation. “It’s really difficult, given the fact we never thought this [pandemic] was going to happen in this way … it’s all been a revelation,” said Monto. “And the revelation is also how societal beliefs would affect what we are seeing in terms of the continuation of severe disease.” Ultimately, experts and Monto did say vaccines were safe and effective, and the FDA authorized Covid-19 vaccines for emergency use shortly thereafter. More than 237 million Americans have since received a vaccine. Through several more hearings, VRPAC has recommended vaccines to everyone older than five and booster doses to everyone older than 18. Now, Monto is the author of a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, in which he considers the long-term future of the pandemic, and whether scientists can learn from another disease that was once pandemic – influenza. In an interview with the Guardian, Monto considered both this possible future – in which Covid-19 “is not going away, in spite of how well our vaccines perform” – and an incredible and perplexing year of vaccine distribution. “The first thing is [that] we never expected our vaccines to be so good, so effective,” said Monto. “This was a very happy surprise to everybody – and it was a surprise.” He and other scientists watched as a vaccine against Covid-19 was developed faster and more effectively than any dared to hope. Then Monto watched in astonishment as tens of millions of Americans refused to take them. “Those of us who are on the front lines here, in terms of development or evaluation, are so incredulous about people not wanting to get vaccinated,” he said. Perhaps the most frequent question people now ask Monto is whether people will need a Covid vaccine “every six months”, especially in light of the recently discovered Omicron variant. Pfizer recently announced that a third shot of its mRNA vaccine appears to protect as well against Omicron as other variants. “The question is: is this going to be like influenza” – against which an annual vaccine is recommended – “or is it going to be like measles?” – which requires only two doses for lifelong protection. “That’s where many of us disagree.” Data has shown immunity wanes over time. VRPAC has approved booster shots for all three vaccines, in part to prevent Covid-19 infection, even as mRNA vaccines have shown very good, stable protection against hospitalisation and death. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether three shots will provide lasting immunity against infection. “We really don’t know how well our vaccines will be holding up,” he said. Monto said he now believes waning immunity and the continued emergence of new variants, termed “antigen drift”, make influenza a useful model for Covid-19 response. Each year, scientists create a vaccine based on seasonal, circulating variants of the flu virus. Monto said “permanent protection from our current vaccines” is unlikely, making this model a useful basis for future Covid-19 response. And, he said, this is a future we’ve been apprehensive to consider. “This is unprecedented, because it’s lasted so long,” said Monto. By comparison, the jolt of the 1918 influenza pandemic was more acute on a population level, but lasted a shorter period of time. “It’s been difficult to get people to focus on long-term consequences because people have been so wrong already in predictions,” said Monto. The virus “continues to create problems”. “Whenever you think things are going to be getting better – because they have already – and are they going to continue to get better, we’ve had a new surprise,” said Monto. “And that’s why many people have tried not to think long-term for any extent, because the question then, which is difficult to answer, is: are we going to be back to normal?” And that question implies a larger one about what the future may look like with masks and social distancing. Those “non-pharmaceutical” interventions, as scientists call them, are not addressed in Monto’s recent article, but he does give us a peek into the meaningful data of the future. Hospitalizations and deaths among people who are vaccinated could become more important metrics than cases alone, as vaccines become a long-term tool to mitigate the worst effects of Covid-19. The development of drugs to treat those infected with Covid-19 will also remain important, particularly if variants affect the efficacy of those already developed, as is the case with monoclonal antibodies. However, right now, Covid-19 remains a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”. At the time FDA advisers voted in favor of approving the first vaccine, around 285,000 Americans and 1.5 million people globally had died. Today, more than 791,000 Americans and 5.2 million people globally have died. In the US, many of those deaths immediately post-dated the authorization of vaccines, when they were in short supply. Now, they are widely available, but only 60.4% of the population is fully vaccinated. “The data are clear: this is a safe vaccine,” said Monto. “The data are clear that Covid is a dangerous infection to get, even if you’re not older or having underlying conditions, because the outcomes are unpredictable. “And you may be one of the unlucky ones that gets a severe infection.”"

          "headline": "UK police trial Tesla cars as fleets prepare for shift to electric",
          "bodyText": "British police have been testing out Tesla cars as part of a drive to electrify more of their fleet, and the results so far are promising, according to a Tesla spokesperson. Early findings show “great results” around the suitability of the firm’s Model 3 vehicle for emergency service operation, said Max Toozs-Hobson, emergency services lead at Tesla. He told the Guardian that while the average blue light run in the UK was seven to 15 minutes, the Model 3 had been able to take part in runs that lasted four hours on active deployment under advanced driving conditions, and said that “it’s achievable to do over 200 miles of blue light advanced driving with the [Model 3]”. Positive results could lead to more Tesla Model 3 cars being adopted by UK police, paramedic and fire services. The trial began earlier this year when the electric car firm offered UK police an adapted and liveried version of its Model 3. The test comes as UK police look to invest in more electric-powered cars ahead of a 2030 government ban on new diesel and petrol motored vehicles. Tesla made a number of adaptations to the car, but according to Toozs-Hobson, the systems did not impact the car range. Running automatic number plate recognition for three hours would take less than a few miles of range off the car, he said, and the LED lights could run for days off the battery pack. The charging system was successful. Toozs-Hobson said he had “joined a traffic unit who got into the car with just 80 miles of range. We stopped at a V3 supercharger and gained 70% power in less than 20 minutes. This gave us another 5-6 hours of driving for the shift. Plus, this fill up cost less than £20”. However, the trial results were not all positive. Toozs-Hobson criticised the light bars found on emergency vehicles, saying that they were like “running with a parachute” on. He suggested integrating police lights into the car cabin, similar to many unmarked police cars, which he said would reduce drag and the drop in car value that comes from drilling holes into vehicle roofs. The Tesla Model 3 Performance, the vehicle type believed to have been used in these trials, is more expensive than non-electric or hybrid high-performance equivalents. A Tesla Model 3 Performance is available from £59,990, while a BMW 3 Series Saloon costs nearly half that at £33,250. However, high initial costs may also come with lower operating costs, reducing the total cost of the vehicle over its lifetime. Toozs-Hobson said that the public response to Tesla’s active units had been “mind-blowing” and that the firm would continue working with police ahead of the 2030 combustion motor ban. A government spokesperson said, “Over the next few years police forces across England and Wales will play a significant role in achieving the government’s net zero carbon ambition through the de-carbonisation programme for policing”. He added that “some forces have already made significant progress in decarbonising their fleet”."

          "headline": "Trial delays put a brake on e-scooter makers’ UK ambitions",
          "bodyText": "E-scooter trials are to be prolonged until late 2022 as the government weighs up legalisation, with use of public rental vehicles dwarfed by that of an estimated half million illegal e-scooters in Britain. Legislation has been put on hold amid increasing safety concerns over private unregulated e-scooters – especially with tens of thousands more vehicles expected to be sold in the UK this Christmas – and scepticism that legal e-scooters can ameliorate congestion or public health. A negative decision would come as a blow to mobility firms that have invested tens of millions of pounds to enter the UK market, which has lagged European neighbours in embracing e-scooters. Businesses have become concerned at the length of trials which were originally due to last 12 months from mid-2020, but are now being extended to November 2022. Evangelists for micromobility argue that e-scooters are far greener than cars, and are a transport solution that tackles the “last mile” from home or work, allowing users to connect to buses or trains. But influential voices in government suggest that far from switching from cars, most e-scooter users were previously cycling, walking or on public transport, which have better health benefits and environmental credentials. Meanwhile, scientists have warned that the UK’s Christmas scooter spree will consume hundreds of tonnes of precious elements, mainly lithium and cobalt in batteries. According to the Royal Society of Chemistry, unless e-scooters are used daily for many years and replace a car, their impact on the environment is ultimately damaging, with high carbon costs in manufacture as well as mining raw materials. While MPs on the transport select committee last year recommended legalisation of all e-scooters, privately owned as well as those on rental schemes, government sources suggest that ministers are far from convinced – with safety concerns at the forefront. At least nine people are known to have died in crashes involving e-scooters in 2021, according to the parliamentary advisory council for transport safety (Pacts). NHS trauma specialists cited in a recent Pacts report said they were now treating more and more e-scooter riders, many with “life changing head injuries”. One London-based neurosurgeon said the severity of e-scooter riders’ injuries were “more similar to those of motorcyclists than pedal cyclists”. An interim report is due to be published by the Department for Transport (DfT) showing data from the trials which started in July last year in Middlesbrough and now are taking place in 34 areas of England (with Wales and Scotland so far declining the opportunity). While the government data remains under wraps, a source said it was “not encouraging”, suggesting it showed only a small fraction of e-scooter trips replacing a car journey, with many simply riding for fun, and the biggest proportion riding instead of walking: “On those figures, there wouldn’t be a carbon saving, there would be a carbon increase.” Ministers wrote to retailers before Christmas to remind them of the law on private e-scooters, after being urged by the executive director of Pacts, David Davies, to hold them liable, as well as warn users of the risks. Davies said: “There is a lot of confusion and we’d like to see more awareness-raising … certainly some retailers are not going out of their way to inform their customers. They are significantly more risky than bicycles.” The Guide Dogs charity recently commissioned independent testing that showed a pedestrian hit by a legal e-scooter at the top permitted speed, 15.5mph, could suffer fatal injury. Operators, as well as Pacts, stress that the safety differences between legal, regulated models and private e-scooters is huge. According to Alan Clarke, director of public policy at Lime, which launched its e-scooters in Milton Keynes in August 2020, followed by Greater Manchester and London this year, the former have “two independent brakes, [are] stability tested, [with] lights you can see 300 metres away”; most people will buy a model with “small wheels, one handbrake, and not fit to be used on roads or cycle lanes.” Fred Jones, regional general manager at Tier, which operates e-scooters in 13 countries and is part of the trials in York and London, said: “What’s clear is that the majority of anecdotal issues of safety and concern is almost exclusively with the private side. If someone’s willing to do something illegal, they may have a greater disposition to do something irresponsible when riding them.” Almost 200,000 people have used Lime’s vehicles, making more than 822,000 trips, on average travelling 2km each time. While casualty reports from illegal scooters have overwhelmingly involved male riders, Clarke said rental e-scooters are used by a broad demographic across sex, race and age groups. Clarke maintains e-scooters can be part of multi-model public transport – even if for now all remain banned from London’s trains and buses after a spate of battery fires – with the busiest docks in the capital found next to tube stations. “That shows us people are using them to link into another transport mode.” The DfT says it is waiting to gather all the evidence from trials before making any decision. Meanwhile though, it has extended the deadline for a further eight months, until 30 November 2022, to get more data while tweaking the trials to introduce compulsory ID plates. Operators remain largely upbeat, despite the delay, which will have hit the business plans of the firms hoping to expand across the UK after the trials. Jones said: “Any business would love clarity for five years when you’re taking out warehouses and things.” But he remains confident e-scooters will be legalised in some form in the UK, with Ireland recently starting legislation to permit their use on roads, one of the last EU states to do so: “The momentum across Europe bodes well.” • This article was amended on 26 December 2021 to refer to e-scooter crashes rather than accidents."

          "bodyText": "That’s all for today. Hope you have a lovely festive break, and that Santa pays his traditional visit (although he didn’t linger long in the London stock market today!). Here are today’s stories: Merry Christmas! GW Last-minute shopper numbers are sharply down on their pre-pandemic levels today, although retailers are busier than last year. Data analysts Springboard report that retail footfall this morning was 21% lower than on Christmas Eve 2019, just before the pandemic, showing the impact of the omicron variant on retailers. But it’s 30% busier than Christmas Eve 2020 when non-essential shops in parts of the country had been forced to close, and vaccines hadn’t yet been rolled out. Retail footfall up to noon was 13.9% higher than a week ago. But struggling high streets have only seen a 6.7% weekly jump, while retail parks are 23.6% busier and shopping centres have nearly 20% more customers. Footfall in Central London has plunged by 30% week-on-week, reflecting that many more office workers are at home, perhaps cutting their social contact ahead of Christmas Day meet-ups. In city centres outside London, footfall was 10% lower than last week. Springboard says: The increased activity in retail parks today will in part be due to trips for food and grocery products as the majority of retail parks have a food store. However, since the start of Covid, retail parks has consistently been more resilient in retaining shoppers as they are large open spaces, with large stores which make shoppers feel safer and less nervous. Their shopper numbers throughout this period have been boosted by the presence of food stores, as despite the growth of online food shopping, it only peaked at 11% of total retail spend and is now at around 10%. The UK’s benchmark stock market index hit a 22-month high on Friday, coming within touching distance of the levels seen in February 2020 just before stock markets around the world were sent into a tailspin by the first European lockdown, my colleague Jasper Jolly reports. The FTSE 100 hit an intra-day high of 7,403.65 points – surpassing the previous post-lockdown high that it hit last month – before slipping back one point to close at a Christmas Eve loss. Traders on the London Stock Exchange downed tools at 12:30pm on Friday to mark Christmas Eve, while exchanges across much of Europe were closed. Markets have been boosted in recent days by data suggesting that the latest variant of concern, Omicron, is not as severe as previously thought. British Airways owner International Airlines Group was among the biggest gainers, up 1.9%, while hotels group Intercontinental also edged up by 1.2% – both are particularly sensitive to pandemic restrictions. The cautious optimism around Omicron has helped the FTSE 100 to gain 4.4% so far during December. That would be its best month since November 2020, when news of Pfizer’s first successful vaccine prompted a global rally. The morning rally left the FTSE just shy of its closing point on Friday 21 February 2020 of 7,403.92 – the day Italy imposed a lockdown in the regions of Lombardy and Padua, sending markets around the world plummeting when they reopened the next Monday. The value of the FTSE 100 companies dropped by £62bn that day. Investors look out for a “Santa rally” on markets at the end of the year, as the low volumes combine with other factors that may include end-of-year portfolio adjustments. The S&amp;P 500, Wall Street’s benchmark, appeared to catch that mood with a fresh record high on Thursday, although the positive sentiment faded on the FTSE 100 on Friday. Some late news: asset management group Apollo is acquiring UK housebuilder Miller Homes, which builds family homes in England and Scotland. They’ve struck a deal to buy Miller from current owner Bridgepoint Group. Financial terms aren’t disclosed. Miller is on track for a record 2021; it builds approximately 4,000 homes a year across nine regions and hopes to grow to 6,000 per year. The government is planning to send out a UK-wide mobile alert urging the public to get a Covid booster, a move mobile operators fear could spark a backlash from customers opposed to vaccinations, my colleague Mark Sweney reports. The UK’s biggest mobile operators – EE, O2, Vodafone and Three UK – have been asked by the government to send a message on Boxing Day. The campaign, in which mobile operators would send a message on behalf of the government to their tens of millions of customers, is understood to have not yet been given final signoff. The message is likely to be on behalf of the NHS, with the text encouraging all adults to get an additional vaccination. The proposed copy of the text message will say: “Get boosted now. Every adult needs a Covid-19 booster vaccine to protect against Omicron. Get your Covid-19 vaccine or booster. See NHS website for details.” It is understood that the mobile operators will all enable the message to be sent, but some are agreeing with reluctance given the highly politicised nature of the vaccination programme. “Operators feel a little nervous about angering some customers because it is such a heated issue,” a telecoms industry source said. “We will make it happen, but don’t want those who don’t agree with the message to blame us.” Here’s the full story: The London stock market is now closed until next Wednesday (the Christmas Day and Boxing Day holidays will be marked on Monday and Tuesday). And despite slipping back in late trading, the FTSE 100 could still post its best month in just over a year. Here’s Reuters take: Shares of heavyweight banks including HSBC, Barclays, Standard Chartered and Lloyds Group have all benefited after the Bank of England raised its interest rate to 0.25% from a record low of 0.1% (last week) for the first time since the pandemic. “The FTSE 100 has not had as stellar a year as some, but the recovery of 7,400 today puts it in good stead for the year ahead,” said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG Group. “A run at the pre-pandemic highs could still be possible if Omicron concerns can be kept under control and earnings continue to recover in the fashion they have throughout 2021.” The mid-cap index was subdued at the close on Friday but logged its strongest week since early August, as travel and leisure stocks rose strongly in December. Here’s a chart showing the wild swing in European gas prices this week: The fabled Santa Rally didn’t hold across the channel either. France’s CAC index of the 40 largest listed companies in Paris fell 0.3%, away from the record highs set in November. Amsterdam’s AEX index lost 0.2%, while other bourses were already on holiday for Christmas..... We’re into the closing stock market auction.... and the rally has rather fizzled out. The FTSE 100 index has dropped back from this morning’s 22-month high, to close 1 point lower at 7372 points. That’s a bit of an anticlimax, after the blue-chip index was on the brink of recovering all its losses since the crash that began on 24th February 2020. More companies rose than fell today (55 vs 42, with three unchanged), but heavyweight stocks such as miners Antofagasta and BHP Group lost ground in a quiet session. But, travel and hospitality stocks did still strengthen, amid speculation that further pandemic restrictions may be avoided if Omicron proves to be milder than Delta. Airline group IAG rose 1.86%, and Premier Inns owner Whitbread gained 1.2%. Among smaller companies on the FTSE 250 index, holiday firm TUI jumped over 4%, easyJet gained 1.9%, and cruise group Carnival picked up 2.3%. The Christmas spirit is slipping away in the City.. with the FTSE 100 dipping back from its earlier 22-month high. It’s now up just 8 points on the day, or 0.1%, around 7381 points, with the half-day session nearly over. There is some relief for energy suppliers and users - gas prices have dropped back from their record highs today. The day-ahead UK gas prices has dropped by 18% to 246p per therm, having hit 457p per therm on Tuesday. That’s still unusually high (the contract was around 60 per therm back in January), but might take some of the pressure off. European gas prices have also dropped sharply today, with the benchmark contract for delivery in the first quarter of 2022 down 20%. The government is to hold emergency meetings with the bosses of the UK’s biggest energy suppliers, after providers warned on Thursday of a “national crisis” that could lead bills to increase by more than 50% to £2,000 a year. Kwasi Kwarteng, the business secretary, is to hold virtual meetings on Monday with energy suppliers, who are pushing the government to intervene to alleviate the unprecedented rises in consumers’ bills caused by soaring wholesale gas prices. The energy industry believes the crisis, during which more than 26 energy suppliers have gone bust at a cost of £1.8bn to date, could be made more manageable if the government axed the 5% VAT on bills imposed when the UK was part of the European Union. More here: The FTSE 100 has now hit its highest level since the markets began to crash in late February 2020. The blue-chip index has touched 7403.65 points, a new 22-month high. That’s just over the previous pandemic high set in November 2021, in today’s thin pre-Christmas trading. It’s a broad rally, with 75 of the hundred companies on the index up today. Travel and hospitality companies are still doing well, with InterContinental Hotels (+2%) now the top riser. Stock markets in Europe and Asia have cemented gains in light holiday trade today, while the safe-haven dollar eased on signs the Omicron variant would not significantly derail global economic growth, Reuters reports. The greenback was set for its worst week in four months while other risk-friendly assets from bitcoin to the Australian dollar held onto their recent gains, buoyed by ebbing concerns over the severity of the new Covid-19 variant. A top European equity benchmark hovered around one month highs after a week of gains and the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.1%, after a record closing high for the S&amp;P 500 on Thursday. Even though it is highly infectious, studies have shown how Omicron is less severe than the Delta strain, fuelling optimism about a limited fallout from new restrictions, and setting the MSCI world equity index for a 2% weekly gain. Giuseppe Sersale, fund manager at Anthilia in Milan, said: “The most popular motivation (for the rally) is the growing perception that Omicron is less lethal. This certainty helped risk appetite return, but self-fulfilling expectations of Christmas rallies and reduced liquidity also came in play.” “I still think the news on Omicron is good, but not as good as the market is taking it. So it really depends on how much the contagions will fly.” The FTSE 100 is currently on track for its best month in just over a year. The blue-chip index has gained 4.8% during December, as stocks recovered from their slump in late November when Omicron fears first rocked markets. That would be its best month since November 2020, when news of Pfizer’s successful vaccine prompted a global rally. Fawad Razaqzada, analyst at ThinkMarket, says investors should use the long weekend to assess the risks facing the economy and markets. Chief among those risks are high levels of inflation and potentially weaker economic growth, owing to the rapid spread of omicron triggering waves of restrictions around the world. Judging by the stock market rally this week, it appears as though investors are still confident that the ongoing recovery from the pandemic recession can survive the omicron wave. Sentiment has been lifted by several scientific studies showing that omicron is less severe than previous mutations. The new variant has also introduced a new element of uncertainty as to whether central banks will be able to follow up with more rate rises if the economic recovery falters. Cities are attracting more property hunters with demand for flats outstripping that of houses in the autumn, the latest sign that the pandemic-fuelled “race for space” could be waning. UK property prices hit record levels during the pandemic as factors including the rise of home and flexible working fuelled a buying boom outside cities. However, as staff returned to offices with flexible and hybrid working patterns through the autumn – prior to the emergence of Omicron – interest in flats has surged. “When the housing market reopened in May, there was an immediate rush for room from buyers to look farther afield from the capital,” said Tim Bannister, the director of property data at the property portal Rightmove. “However, in recent months we’ve seen higher demand to live near London, with buyer inquiries returning towards pre-pandemic levels. This is happening quicker than some will have anticipated, and is likely driven by many businesses encouraging a hybrid, rather than fully remote working model.” Rightmove said that flats have become the most in-demand property type among prospective buyers, supplanting the popularity of houses throughout the pandemic. More here: Holiday firm TUI (+3%), cruise operator Carnival (+2.8%) and budget airline easyJet (+2%) are also higher this morning, after several research studies this week suggested the effects of the Omicron coronavirus variant were less severe than Delta. But, experts have warned that this may make no change in the level of infection, due to the surge in Omicron cases. My colleague Richard Adams explains: In the UK, the huge surge in cases – with another 119,789 new infections reported on Thursday – means that even if only a small proportion of people with Covid need to attend hospital, it could cause difficulties for the NHS. Mark Woolhouse, a professor at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Scotland study, said the weight of new research meant that projections would be less pessimistic, although Omicron’s rapid spread meant there were still dangers ahead. “It’s good but it doesn’t get us out of the woods. Severity of infection is clearly very important but it is only one factor in terms of the public health burden,” Woolhouse said, speaking in a personal capacity. Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, points out that trading volumes are rather thin this morning, with many investors clocking off for Christmas: “With US, German, Italian and Swiss markets closed, the FTSE 100 has opened with a small move to the upside amid much thinner than normal volumes as the festive week rounds up and on risk-on sentiment. The UK index is enjoying its fourth day of gains, trading at six-week highs and inching closer to the next major resistance hurdle at 7,400. It is better late than never for the Santa rally, which helped drive gains for US indices yesterday with the S&amp;P 500 closing at a record high up 2.27% on the week while tech outperformed with the Nasdaq closing the week up 3.19%.” Stocks are creeping higher in London, lifting the FTSE 100 nearer to its pandemic high. The blue-chip index is now up 21 points, or 0.3%, at 7394 - putting November’s 20-month high of 7402.68 points in sight. The Footsie, which contains the hundred largest companies listed in London, has rallied by over 14% this year, helped by hopes of economic recovery from the pandemic. But it’s still below its pre-Covid levels, unlike US and other European indices, as the FTSE 100 suffers from a lack of major tech companies listed in the City. Pharmaceuticals group Hikma (+1.8%) is now the top riser, followed by BA parent company IAG (+1.7%), online grocery business Ocado (+1.5%), and Premier Inns owner Whitbread. Tiz the season...to test your knowledge with the Guardian’s Business Christmas Quiz. Good luck! Consumer giant Reckitt Benckiser has agreed the sale of skincare brand E45 for £200m, as it shifts its focus to higher growth areas. The Slough-based company, which also owns brand including Dettol and Durex, told investors this morning that it is set to sell the business to Swedish group Karo Pharma. E45 cream, which can soothe dry and itching skin and help with eczema, was created in 1952 by Reckitt subsidiary Crookes Healthcare and was initially only available in hospitals. Increased demand and positive results saw the brand move into traditional retail. In the financial year to December 2020, the E45 brand and related sub-brands had a combined net revenue of £43m. The proposed sale is the latest move by Reckitt to shake up its portfolio in a bid to focus on higher growth areas of its operations. Earlier this year it sold its infant formula and child nutrition business in China and its Scholl foot treatment brand. Reckitt benefitted from higher sales of Strepsils and Nurofen this autumn, as the lifting of global lockdowns led to more people catching coughs, colds and flu. But it has also been hit by rising costs due to the supply chain inflation. It’s not much of a rally.. but the UK’s blue-chip shares have opened a little higher in today’s shortened session. The FTSE 100 is up 7 points, or 0.1%, at 7380 points, nudging towards November’s 21-month highs. Airline group IAG, which owns British Airways, is the top riser, up 1.6%, with conference organiser Informa rising 1% and hotel operator Whitbread 0.9% higher. The Selfridges deal is the latest instalment of a rollercoaster history for the brand founded by a retail legend, our retail correspondent Sarah Butler writes: After more than 20 years rising through the ranks of the Marshall Field’s store in Chicago, in 1906 the US entrepreneur Harry Gordon Selfridge arrived in the UK with one intention: to found a great department store. By some accounts, he was tempted to the UK by Liverpudlian Samuel J Waring Jr, who had built up a string of furnishings stores in London and wanted someone to run a neighbouring shop to his new Waring and Gillow outlet on Oxford Street. It was initially intended to be called Selfridge-Waring store, but Selfridge took control when his partner hit financial difficulties and the new store opened in March 1909 under his name alone. From the start, Selfridge embraced retail theatre and was determined his store would be “a civic centre, where friends can meet and buying is only a secondary consideration”. On the opening day, which drew enormous crowds, the store dazzled shoppers with live music, abundant floral displays and copious lighting in its airy halls. The store sold a huge range of goods but, out of respect for his early business partner, not food or furnishings. It housed a library, a rest room for ladies, a picture gallery and a restaurant linked to a roof garden. Selfridges set a new benchmark for UK department stores, ditching the tradition of housing staff above the shop and opting for large modern window displays more akin to advertising than the practice of piling up as many goods as possible. When the store was awarded one of English Heritage’s blue plaques in 2003, the charity said: “It is largely thanks to Selfridge that Oxford Street remains the commercial heart of the West End.”. More here: The big news of the morning is that Selfridges, the UK-based department store chain, has been acquired in a £4bn deal by Thai conglomerate Central Group and Signa, an Austrian real estate group. The deal will see the return of the luxury department store’s former boss Vittorio Radice. The firms have bought the group from Canada’s Weston family, and are thought to have beaten off rival bids from the Qatar Investment Authority, which owns Harrods, and Lane Crawford, a Hong Kong-based department store owner. The Thai group, which began with one store in Bangkok run by Tiang Chirathivat in the 1950s, last year listed part of the business on the Thai stock exchange, and has other interests in convenience stores, shopping centres and hotels. Signa is owned and run by René Benko, one of Austria’s richest men. The deal with the Westons includes Selfridges’ four UK stores – in London, Birmingham and two in Manchester – as well as Brown Thomas and Arnotts in Ireland and De Bijenkorf in the Netherlands. It also covers about £2bn of the chain’s prime property assets, including the freehold of its listed Oxford Street flagship store in London. Here’s the full story: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Just one trading day in the City until Christmas, and investors are straining to see signs of the fabled Santa Rally. US stocks rallied last night, as traders took heart from mounting evidence that the Omicron variant of coronavirus is milder. The S&amp;P 500 closed at a record high - it’s 68th this year - and European markets staged their own rally on Thursday. As Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, told Morningstar: “Today, it is about economic optimism that this variant is not going to be as bad as delta and original virus.” Last night, a UK government study showed that the risk of being admitted to hospital is up to 70% less for people with Omicron compared to those infected with Delta. Australia’s share market has joined the festive cheer, with the ASX index rising 0.4% in the Christmas Eve session, with financial stocks, mining and gas companies and tech among the gainers. The markets have a habit of rallying around Christmas time (news depending...), and Jeffrey Halley of OANDA says it has arrived: Thankfully, reporters have stopped asking me if we will get a Santa Claus rally in stock markets, as it has well and truly arrived. Wall Street rose again overnight after a strong procession on US data and markets convincing themselves even more, that omicron is a mildly symptomatic storm in a teacup. But in the UK, concerns about rising financial distress on the high street and at hospitality firms is hitting the mood. My colleague Sarah Butler explains: More than 35,000 British retailers and 20,000 bars and restaurants are facing significant financial distress, according to new data, while shoppers are forecast to spend almost a quarter less in physical stores this Boxing Day than before the pandemic. If fashion and footwear shops, furniture businesses and other “non-essential” retailers are allowed to remain open from 26 December, £3.94bn is expected to be spent in stores and online that day, 10% less than before the pandemic and 1% lower than last year. Spending in physical stores alone is expected to fall by 23% compared with 2019 as many shoppers avoid high streets, shopping centres and retail parks amid fears over the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Yesterday, the FTSE 100 hit a six-week closing high, near to its highest since the pandemic crash in March. But it could be a subdued start today, with the blue-chip index expected to dip a little. It could be a quiet session, with trading finishing early at lunchtime (hurrah)."

          "headline": "Oriol Bohigas obituary",
          "bodyText": "Known as the masterplanner of the successful 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, the architect Oriol Bohigas, who has died aged 95, was a fierce defender of urban planning as a political and social act. He played a critical role in the cultural and political life of his city, influencing generations of urban theorists and practitioners. As leader of Barcelona’s urban planning department in the mid-1980s, Bohigas conceptualised and implemented the “Barcelona model” that formed the urban backbone to the city’s Olympics. This event and its lasting legacy put the grey, debilitated but fiercely independent city, punished by decades of Francoism, firmly on the international map. Twenty years later, the Barcelona model informed London’s approach of using the Olympic Games as an opportunity to create an integrated piece of city with housing and amenities for the capital’s more deprived neighbourhoods. With the death of Franco in 1975, Barcelona had grasped the opportunity to democratise and modernise. Working closely with the first socialist mayors of the post-Franco era, Narcís Serra and Pasqual Maragall, Bohigas created the intellectual and spatial armature for its transformation. He was committed to innovation through continuity rather than aggressive rupture and restructuring, and recognised that the public spaces of the city – the pavements, streets, squares, parks, beaches and waterways – should be at the heart of a democratic vision of the contemporary city. Bohigas built on the canonical work of the father of modern urbanism, Ildefonso Cerdà, who in the mid-19th century had created a plan for the growing city with an elegant and functional diagonal grid known as the Eixample. With its tree-lined avenues and pedestrian friendly ramblas, generous public spaces and community parks, Cerdà’s Grid served the city well. Bohigas re-interpreted this model for the 20th century, upgrading the public realm, intensifying its local neighbourhoods and reuniting the city with its seafront on the Mediterranean. “Monumentalise the periphery; functionalise the centre” was Bohigas’ linguistically obtuse slogan for re-energising Barcelona. This translated into a focused programme of interventions that gave dignity to deprived neighbourhoods – such as the working-class district of Poble Nou – and made the dense inner-city districts more liveable, with pocket parks, markets, play areas and local amenities. In the space of two decades much was achieved. In recognition of this collective effort, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) broke with tradition in 1999 and awarded the City of Barcelona – and not an individual or group of architects – the royal gold medal. Bohigas was one of five individuals singled out in the citation. Equally sharp in manner of speech and dress – he spoke in short, staccato sentences delivered with rasping gravitas and wore immacutely ironed shirts, linen jackets and colourful socks – Bohigas had the air of a fin-de-siècle aesthete but the mind of a pragmatist. He was outspoken, often pugnacious, but always with a glint in his eye. He was keen to get things done, and resigned as elected councillor in charge of culture in 1991 when he felt Maragall was too slow in implementing one of his pet projects for neighbourhood libraries. Born in Barcelona, Oriol was the son of middle-class Catalan intellectuals, Maria Guardiola and Pere Bohigas, a professor of linguistics. His high school friend Josep Martorell convinced him to enrol in 1943 at Barcelona’s school of architecture, ETSAB, which he would go on to lead as director from 1977 to 1980. In his 30s, he formed the militantly pro-modern R Group and had the temerity to write to the architect Mies van der Rohe to propose the reconstruction of his elegantly minimalist Barcelona Pavilion, which had been designed for the 1929 International Exposition and torn down the following year. Happily, this plan was realised in 1986 and the reconstructed modern masterpiece stands in Montjuïc Park. With Martorell and David Mackay, Bohigas formed MBM Arquitectes, one of Spain’s most successful design practices, with a significant portfolio of public and private buildings that adhered to the principles of low-key, contextual modernism. Their buildings prioritised the relationship to the city rather than gymnastic self-promotion. For example, their design for the 1992 Olympic Village is memorable for the way in which the layout of the urban blocks opens out towards the sea, reconnecting the old city with its waterfont. Bohigas provided the critical intellectual and theoretical underpinning to the practice. He was a founding member of the publisher Edicions 62, an editor of the journal Arquitecturas Bis (1974-85) and chair of the Fundació Joan Miró museum (1981-88). He published more than 15 books, including Barcelona Entre el Pla Cerdà i el Barraquisme (1963, Barcelona Between the Cerdà Plan and Shanty-towns ). He argued strongly for the social responsibility of the architect. In a letter addressed to a member of the urban planning commission of Barcelona city council in 1964, he made his view explicit: “To be an urban planner is to begin to be a socialist now.” Together with the director of urban projects of Barcelona city council, Josep Acebillo, Bohigas was responsible for selecting some of the most talented final-year students - the so-called “golden pencils” – from the ETSAB architecture school and giving them responsibility for coming up with ideas for individual city districts. He also played an important role in attracting international figures, from Arata Isozaki to Frank Gehry, to build in Barcelona and giving opportunities to locally trained, younger architects to make their mark on its urban landscape. Bohigas believed that the cumulative effect of small, “punctual” projects – often referred to as urban “acupuncture” – could be more effective than large-scale, complex initiatives that took years to implement and required budgets that did not exist in Spain’s fragile early democracy. This approach can be seen as a precursor to the current vogue for “tactical urbanism”, whereby small-scale improvements – pavement widening, outdoor seating, street closures, tree-planting – are implemented quickly and on a temporary basis in close cooperation with local communities. In the 1960s and 70s, Bohigas was associated with Gauche Divine, a group of left-leaning intellectual bourgeois artists, film-makers, philosophers and artists who met regularly at the Boccaccio discotheque in Barcelona. Their spirit shaped not only his professional but also his social life. In the late 1970s, Bohigas and his partner, the landscape architect Beth Galí, turned their apartment in Plaça Reial – in what was then a run-down area of the old city – into a salon of international cultural exchange and heated debates on city politics. Bohigas, often accompanied by whiskey and a cigar, would argue deep into the night with professionals and politicians of different generations and persuasions in one of the most beautiful squares at the very heart of his beloved city. He is survived by Beth; by his wife, Isabel Arnau, from whom he was separated, and their five children, Josep, Gloria, María, Eulalia and Pere, nine grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. • Oriol Bohigas i Guardiola, architect, born 20 December 1925; died 30 November 2021"

          "bodyText": "Cities are attracting more property hunters with demand for flats outstripping that of houses in the autumn, the latest sign that the pandemic-fuelled “race for space” could be waning. UK property prices hit record levels during the pandemic as factors including the rise of home and flexible working fuelled a buying boom outside cities. However, as staff returned to offices with flexible and hybrid working patterns through the autumn – prior to the emergence of Omicron – interest in flats has surged. “When the housing market reopened in May, there was an immediate rush for room from buyers to look farther afield from the capital,” said Tim Bannister, the director of property data at the property portal Rightmove. “However, in recent months we’ve seen higher demand to live near London, with buyer inquiries returning towards pre-pandemic levels. This is happening quicker than some will have anticipated, and is likely driven by many businesses encouraging a hybrid, rather than fully remote working model.” Rightmove said that flats had become the most in-demand property type among prospective buyers, supplanting the popularity of houses throughout the pandemic. “The complete reversal in demand from bigger houses to flats paints a picture of society opening up again and a group of people looking to be closer to city centres,” said Bannister. “Although there was less demand for flats when the market reopened, with more availability than other property types, and more steady average asking price growth over the last year, flats could be a good opportunity for people looking to move or to get on to the ladder next year.” Rightmove’s findings chime with trends identified by mortgage lender Halifax, which found that in November flats were changing hands for 10.8% more than at the same time last year, while detached houses were typically fetching 6.6% more. Despite the boost in popularity of flats, Rightmove said the longer-term trend towards bigger houses, in outer-city and rural or coastal locations, is here to stay. Prospective buyers have widened their searches for their ideal home by an average of 50 sq km (19 sq miles), according to Rightmove. In October, the typical asking price for a detached house was 76% higher than a semi-detached property. “The pandemic redefined the role of the home and placed new emphasis on its importance, and people looked for more room in order to work, exercise, and often teach under one roof,” said Bannister. “People have extended their search area, which suggests there isn’t as much reliance on being near key transport hubs, or realising that living just a bit further away from the high street could open up more properties that a buyer can afford, or they may get more for their money.” Last week, Halifax forecast that the boom in UK house prices is likely to end next year as household finances become increasingly stretched."

          "headline": "Vallance hits back at Tory accusations of Omicron fear-mongering",
          "bodyText": "The UK government’s chief scientific adviser has hit back at accusations from Conservative MPs that epidemiological modellers had “spread gloom” about the Omicron variant. Sir Patrick Vallance said it was not the responsibility of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) “to take a particular policy stance or to either spread gloom or give Panglossian optimism”. He used an article in the Times to respond to criticism that was widely circulated among Tory MPs and ministers that suggested Sage’s Omicron modelling had been an exercise in fear-mongering. The Spectator’s editor, Fraser Nelson, had a Twitter exchange with the Sage member Graham Medley over the weekend, suggesting ministers asked Sage to model worst-case scenarios. The exchange was reportedly widely shared in the WhatsApp groups of Tory MPs. In an account of the exchange in his column in the Telegraph on Monday, Nelson complained that Sage projections that Omicron could kill up to 6,000 in a single day had been seized on in the press, and more cautious projections ignored. Nelson wrote: “The 6,000 is the top of a rather long range of ‘scenarios’, not predictions.” He added: “I’ve been contacted by a few ministers saying they were alarmed to think Sage modellers were not giving the probability of various outcomes but cooking up gloomy scenarios to order.” In an apparent riposte, Vallance wrote science was “self-correcting” and about making “advances by overturning previous dogma and challenging accepted truths”. He wrote: “Encouraging a range of opinions, views and interpretation of data is all part of the process. No scientist would ever claim, in this fast-changing and unpredictable pandemic, to have a monopoly of wisdom on what happens next.” A widely reported statement from the Spi-M group of scientists, who report to Sage, on 18 December warned hospitalisations could peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day and deaths at between 600 and 6,000 a day based on models assuming no new restrictions were introduced. Vallance said modellers were “trying to model lots of different scenarios of how the wave of Omicron might grow, determine which factors are likely to have the biggest impact on spread and its consequences, and to assess how different interventions might alter the outcomes”. He added: “They do not, contrary to what you might have heard, only model the worst outcomes.” The comments follow an interview the scientist did with BBC Radio 4 in October in which he said his job was “not to sugarcoat” reality. He said at the time: “My mantra for a long time during this [pandemic] has been … ‘You’ve got to go sooner than you want to in terms of taking interventions. You’ve got to go harder than you want to, and you’ve got to go more geographically broad than you want to.”"

          "headline": "Starstruck star Rose Matafeo: ‘Success freaks me out! It’s a gut-punch’",
          "bodyText": "Rose Matafeo is arguably the breakout star of 2021. Her BBC Three sitcom Starstruck became the channel’s best-performing comedy within weeks of launch, racking up 3m views and earning a second series before it even premiered. The impact was so huge and immediate that you could be forgiven for thinking she had dropped from the sky fully formed. This couldn’t be further from the truth. After winning a New Zealand international comedy festival award for standup in 2007, at the age of 15, Matafeo has conquered just about everything she has ever attempted. She has written for Daily Show-esque satirical news programmes. She has presented entertainment shows. She co-created and starred in a sketch series, and has directed sitcoms. In 2018, her show Horndog – detailing, in part, how she was kicked off a Franz Ferdinand messageboard for being “too racy” – won an Edinburgh comedy award. And last year she was the lead in the film Baby Done, executive produced by Taika Waititi. And yet, even for those of us who knew her work, Starstruck was the perfect showcase for all of Matafeo’s talents. Despite a premise that wasn’t entirely novel – like Notting Hill before it, it told the story of a civilian who accidentally fell in love with a movie star – Matafeo’s presence helped to reset and update a number of hoary old romcom tropes. Equal parts confident and anxious, for a few weeks in April, she was more or less all anyone could talk about. She’s a big deal now. She is also exhausted. “I’m having a lie-down,” says the 29-year-old New Zealander over the phone from London. Series two of Starstruck is almost complete, marking the end of a two-year treadmill for her, and she is deliberately choosing to pause. “I’ve got no work plans for next year and it’s great,” she says. “I really want to watch about a hundred movies and possibly, I don’t know, just chill out.” It’s a nice idea, but Matafeo isn’t convinced it’ll stick. “I will hate it,” she sighs. “I’ll hate it because I have nothing to do and it will kill me.” Part of the issue seems to be that, as wildly as Starstruck was received, she didn’t have any time to enjoy its success. “I had one day,” she says. “Not even one day. The first series came out on iPlayer at 6am the day before we started shooting the second series.” To compound things, the entire series showed up at once and people quickly discovered that the best way to consume it was in one sitting, like a movie. “Straight away the audience was like, ‘Great! When’s the next one coming out?’,” recalls Matafeo. “I thought, this is like a gut punch! It’s really flattering, like, that’s great! But oh my God! It freaks me out, you know?” Ultimately, though, the lack of a break can only be good for Starstruck. With no downtime between series, Matafeo and her writing partner Alice Snedden didn’t have time to bow to the pressures of fan service, so they didn’t have to second-guess themselves. “It’s scary because you go, ‘Maybe we didn’t write what the audience wanted’,” she says. “You know, people really love the show and you see a lot of series step it up extensively for series two. But it’s actually nice not having that, because it means that we’ve made a second series that we like. It was consistent and in keeping with the spirit of the first one. I’m a terrible people-pleaser so I think it was good not to have that little voice in my head.” Since we’re here to talk about Matafeo’s 2021, it made sense to ask her about the things she enjoyed watching. The short answer is “nothing current” – she caught up with 2019’s Watchmen in February, and adored it – but for the most part she fell back on old favourites. “I became kind of emotionally reliant on Dawson’s Creek,” she says. “I think I still am. Honestly, I got in deep with that and it saved me. It pulled me out of some dark places.” Fittingly, for a woman whose character worked in one, Matafeo has also been taking advantage of the cinemas reopening. “I’ve been going back to the BFI, back to the Prince Charles [cinema in Leicester Square], where I’ve been doing some screenings of Beverly Hills Cop one and two, my favourite films. And been really diving into my interest in more obscure 60s movies that you have to find on some bootleg weird zone on DVD. “But, yeah,” she continues, “it’s been a year of doing hobbies and stuff. When you’re making TV in particular, you look at a screen all day and then when you come home, you’re like ‘I don’t want to look at a screen’. So it’s been a year of getting into model making. I bought a bass guitar. I’m trying to shred on bass guitar. I just got into 16mm film cameras and learned all about that, so it’s been a year of nerd-dom, and I love it.” That’s real self-improvement territory, I say. “It’s borderline,” she says, laughing. “Self-improvement slash self-sabotage in terms of now I spend my money on cameras and I’m not seeing anyone.” Our time is coming to a close, and I’m concerned that Matafeo doesn’t realise how much people enjoyed Starstruck. So I reassert the notion, going on at some length about all the ways I loved it. And I really did. In another year that has been marked by a general sense of gloom, the unapologetic loveliness of Starstruck felt like the shot in the arm we all needed. “Aw, that’s really kind! I’m so glad so many people have liked it, and I hope when the second series comes out, they’ll still like it,” Matafeo replies. She pauses, and checks herself. “But also I don’t care because, you know, whatever.”"

          "bodyText": "Three intensive care workers share the stories that have remained hidden from public view during the pandemic. Dr Katrina Tonga, respiratory consultant It was an eye opener seeing young people come in with severe respiratory illnesses. We’re used to managing people with respiratory diseases, but not to the extent they were almost on death’s door. We had to talk to patients on the phone, or, if we were in the room, wearing PPE. They couldn’t have family members or friends so it was really tough on them. It was heartbreaking seeing patients with their whole families in hospital, but they were spread throughout Sydney. Sometimes they hadn’t had any contact until a FaceTime or Skype call. Having to talk to family members on the phone and trying to relay how sick their family member was, or tell them they were going to pass away, was a really challenging time. In my culture – I’m Tongan – it’s very family oriented, and seeing Pacific islander families coming into hospital, and knowing that’s what they needed, I think some felt a bit more reassured someone could speak to them in their own language. One of the patients I remember was really quite sick. We were getting him sent to the intensive care unit. He was a young guy, I was on the phone to his wife wheeling him out and he said to me: ‘doctor, am I going to die?’. And I thought in my mind, ‘you could’, but I had to reassure him we were doing everything we could and we were sending him to intensive care to get the treatment he needed. Courtney Lace, Covid nurse manager We had a mixed model on the ward – [first we] utilised the negative pressure rooms, then we installed bubbles, then we transitioned the rest of the patients out, and we went full Covid. It was all staff in full PPE from the minute they arrived. We set up a donning station outside of the ward and had particular nurses supervising the procedure. Their background is neurology, stroke, brain injury and suddenly they were taking patients with respiratory issues – and they just took it in their stride. The acute patients were very unwell, and it is extremely labour-intensive on the nurses working in those areas, particularly in the bubbles. It’s such a different way of nursing, it’s like a tent on the outside of the four-bedded bay so they’d be zipping through two sets of tent to get into the patient … It’s extremely hot, really dehydrating for the nurses because they’ve got the full PPE on and it steams up really quickly. We did a transfer late one night, we had about 32 patients on the ward at the time, it was just a particularly busy day, patients were really sick and they deteriorated quickly with the Delta strain … It really hit home seeing how many patients were in and how sick they were. It was very different to getting on the bus and heading home to what was going on inside the hospitals. The public were protected from that. Dr Priya Nair, director of intensive care When Covid came, particularly with the second wave, our work changed completely. It was really a once-in-career type experience. I’ve never seen anything like it before, and most of my colleagues haven’t either. We went from being a 20 bed ICU which had two pods in it … to suddenly having to expand to a four pod ICU to accommodate our Covid patients. We also provide services for Covid patients with very severe lung problems who can’t be looked after in other hospitals … so even though there weren’t a huge number of Covid patients in our local community who needed ICU, we were seeing patients from all across New South Wales. Our workload increased exponentially … We needed many more nursing staff, more doctors, more equipment and more space and all of this came with its logistical challenges. The moments that stood out were when we had a patient dying without their family being able to be there with them … Having to be their healthcare workers but their family at the same time as well, you really feel that level of humanity comes out at the time."

          "headline": "Should Americans ditch their holiday plans? Maybe that’s the wrong question",
          "bodyText": "When it comes to the surging Omicron variant of Covid, just about all I’m hearing is advice about holiday planning. Should one attend a holiday party? Travel? Meet friends at a restaurant? Much of the answer boils down to how to calculate one’s tolerance for risk when so little is known about Omicron except that it spreads easily. Experts are throwing around a lot of numbers. Columnists are sharing their own personal calculations. I understand. We’re all a bit spooked and don’t know exactly what to do. Calculations offer a degree of reassuring certitude. But why does America need to turn this latest Covid surge — as we do so much else — into a question of individual risk, personal calculation, and self-concerned choice? Personal responsibility is important, of course. But I worry that this hubbub over individual risk assessment is distracting us from what we need to do now as a society to be readier for Omicron than we were for Delta or for the first Covid surge. It also plays directly into the hands of anti-vaxxers who want to believe Covid is only about personal choice. On Friday’s Fox Business, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was asked if he was getting the booster. DeSantis smirked, shook his head no, and then went into a long harangue about why people should make vaccine decisions “for themselves.” This past weekend, at Turning Point USA, the Maga college Republican spin-off (whose founder died from Covid-19 last summer), Sarah Palin said it would be “over my dead body” that she got vaccinated (no pun intended). And Tucker Carlson (perhaps the most harmful person in America these days) railed against those who are urging vaccination, saying they just want to “punish people.” Carlson then praised the “naturally immune” who “earned it.” It’s too easy for the rest of us to respond to this rubbish by telling ourselves that anti-vaxxers will pay the price because they’re putting themselves at much higher risk of being hospitalized and even dying. But this kind of thinking reflects the same dangerous fallacy — that each of us must make such life-or-death decisions solely for themselves. On Friday, Jeff Zients, the White House Covid coordinator, inadvertently promoted this fallacy by telling reporters that while the administration will work to minimize Omicron disruption for the vaccinated, the unvaccinated should expect “a winter of severe illness and death for yourselves, your families....” In reality, all of us are in this together. And so far, all of us together are failing. America’s rate of deaths from Covid is the highest of all advanced nations. Fewer than 62 percent of us are fully vaccinated — the lowest of all advanced nations. Those who continue to refuse to get vaccinated are endangering the rest of us — and not just because they’re increasing the risk of a “breakthrough” infection in those of us who have been fully vaccinated. As Omicron surges, the unvaccinated are likely to overwhelm hospitals throughout the land, making it harder for our entire health system to respond to all health needs and emergencies. The unvaccinated are also incubators for the next variant. Anti-vaxxers aside, the emphasis on individual risk is allowing us to forget the social needs that became exposed when the pandemic first hit in early 2020 — most of which are still unmet. America is still doing almost no contact tracing compared to other advanced nations. Rapid Covid tests are still difficult to find, and too expensive. (The free tests that the Biden administration is touting won’t be available until next month.) N95 masks are still in short supply. There’s still little or no coordination among different levels of government. Biden’s order that large businesses require employees to be vaccinated remains stuck in the federal courts. Hospitals in many places still don’t have enough Intensive Care Units. We could once again face a shortage of ventilators. Too many workplaces are still unsafe. They’re still not required to test employees and report all Covid infections. They still don’t have to provide personal protective equipment. Workers still can’t stay home for fear of getting the Omicron variant at work because we still don’t have a national system of paid leave (thanks to Joe Manchin and senate Republicans). They can’t quit their jobs because extended unemployment insurance has run out. America still isn’t taking the lead in getting vaccines to poor nations around the world, thereby allowing more variants to emerge. I’m unable to advise you about whether you should attend that holiday party or cancel your travel plans. But I can assure you that what we’re facing is not just a matter of personal choice or individual risk tolerance. We’re facing another test of America’s capacity to respond to a public-health crisis. And the safety of every one of us depends on the nation doing better this time than we did before.

          "headline": "Could Chile show the United States how to rebuild its democracy?",
          "bodyText": "Chile always gave the lie to the cold war claim that the United States stood for democracy. When its voters in 1970 showed the temerity (“irresponsibility”, Henry Kissinger called it) to elect socialist Salvador Allende as president, Washington helped orchestrate the coup that toppled him, and backed the resulting dictatorship. It seems those “irresponsible” Chilean voters are at it again – on Sunday, they elected leftist Gabriel Boric as president by a 12-point margin, on the back of a campaign for a new constitution. But if Chilean democracy seems on the road to recovery from its Washington-backed disfiguration, prospects for democracy in the United States look rather bleak. Sunday also saw Joe Manchin brandish the veto power the US system grants a senator representing fewer than 300,000 voters to tank the agenda of a president chosen by 80 million. And that was but the latest reminder that Americans are not governed by the democratic will of the citizenry. The US supreme court looks ready to strike down abortion rights supported by about two-thirds of the electorate, while Democrats in office seem unable or unwilling to deliver on basic social programs supported by a majority of voters, whether on drug prices or childcare or public health, and much more – or to prevent Republicans brazenly reengineering state-level laws and procedures to prevent voters of color from ever again making the difference they made in 2020. Minority rule is a feature, not a bug of the US constitutional system. Donald Trump was legitimately elected president in 2016 despite losing by 3m votes. And 6 January notwithstanding, the Republican party needs no coup to lock itself into power for the foreseeable future, even if it represents a diminishing minority of voters. The US constitution provides all the tools they’ll need: the electoral college; the US Senate (two seats per state means it can be controlled with less than 20% of the national vote); the supreme court the Senate effectively picks; and the state houses empowered to set voting laws and rules, and even redraw districts to partisan advantage. The framers of the constitution never intended that every American would have a vote, much less a vote of equal value. They created a system to regulate a society ruled by and for wealthy white male settlers engaged in the conquest and subordination of the country’s Indigenous and Black populations. Decades of bitter struggle on the streets have won Black and Brown people far more access to the US political system than the founders ever intended. Still, even the gains codified in the civil rights era are being consciously rolled back by a billionaire-funded white nationalist party looking to cement its hold on power for the foreseeable future against any demographic headwinds. Ineffectual appeals to “save our democracy” reflect the paralysis of mainstream Democrats in the face of the Republican offensive that has weaponized a minority-rule constitutional system. Nor is a majority of citizens easily able, within its rules, to change these anti-democratic provisions of the US constitution: even minor changes require agreement by two-thirds of each house of Congress, and three-quarters of the 50 states. Democratizing the United States – creating a system of government shaped by every citizen having the right to a vote of equal value – would require a different constitution, democratically adopted by a national community quite different from the one imagined by the founding fathers. But that’s what Chileans are attempting. *** Boric is a product of a student rebellion a decade ago that fed into a broader social justice movement focused on issues ranging from austerity, a failing social safety net, healthcare and economic inequality to gender violence and Indigenous rights. While even center-left governments were stymied from delivering on voter expectations, many in this parliament of the streets recognized that their grievances were products of the democracy deficit built into the dictatorship’s 1980 constitution to ensure continuity of its economic model. Although it allowed Chileans to elect their president and lower house of parliament, that constitution built in minority vetoes, such as appointing one-third of senators and much of the judiciary, as failsafe mechanisms to prevent democratically elected politicians from enacting the systemic changes demanded by voters. Thus the emergence of a democracy movement based outside formal political parties, which in late 2019 won a referendum to have a new constitution democratically drafted. That movement’s energy also propelled Boric to power. So, does Chile have lessons to teach US progressives? It’s a question worth investigating. Sure, the US is nowhere near a point where public opinion recognizes the need for a new constitution. But it’s equally clear that the US fails as a democracy – and the morbid implications of US minority-rule-with-a-democratic-face can’t credibly be avoided. Curiously enough, US conservatives have never been shy to follow Chilean examples: the shrink-government campaign that began in the Reagan era was road-tested by Chile’s dictatorship under the tutelage of US “free-market” ideologues. And President GW Bush, in his 2005 effort to privatize social security, cited Chile as the model to emulate. But the Chilean popular rebellion against that same neoliberal model, and the potential it has raised for a democratic reordering of power and of that country’s social contract, suggests that the right are not the only Americans who may have something to learn from Chile.

          "bodyText": "It was hard to get through 2021 without hearing about the supply chain. Before the pandemic, the way products from all over the world would get to American consumers seemed to be a part of a smooth-going system. A survey of consumers found that 45% of Americans admitted to never thinking about how their products were made and delivered before the pandemic. But the last year has seen dozens of ships stuck at ports, warehouses full to the brim with stuff and a shortage of truck drivers, all leading to emptier shelves and out-of-stock messages online. Issues with the supply chain have led to shortages across the country of goods ranging from cars to cream cheese to Christmas trees. Experts believe the pandemic caused a perfect storm of factors that led to cracks in the supply chain that was already vulnerable in the first place. “You have a supply chain that has been built on a premise of being lean and efficient and that works great when things are operating smoothly,” said Keely Croxton, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. “But as soon as there’s a glitch in the supply chain, these lean supply chains become brittle and break.” Companies today largely rely on a supply chain model called “just in time” that was created by Toyota in the 1950s. As its name suggests, the model has companies keep few raw materials on hand and only order them when they need it, all with the goal of getting the end product to consumers just on time. The “just-in-time” model clashed with the reality of consumer demand during the pandemic. Many companies assumed that demand would drop as the spread of Covid-19 caused worldwide shutdowns, including in manufacturing factories. But the pandemic ended up bolstering consumer demand for goods as aid from stimulus bills and savings from spending less on other expenses like travel and eating out encouraged people to shop online. Retail sales during the 2020 holiday season grew 8.3% despite the pandemic as Americans continued to shop. Ultimately, consumers were wanting more goods while companies were simultaneously making less. This phenomenon particularly hurt the manufacturing of computer chips, which led to shortages of cars and some consumer electronics, like video game consoles. Increased demand also saw more goods being shipped from Asia to the US, leading to seemingly indefinite congestion at two major ports in California. At one point, a record high of 100 vessels were waiting off the coast of Los Angeles to dock. Some ships were waiting months to unload their goods. This affected retailers like Victoria’s Secret, which saw half of its inventory for the fall season delayed because it was stuck on ships unable to unload. Part of the congestion clog comes from a lack of space at the ports because they are overwhelmed with large empty shipping containers. Some reports say there are over 115,000 empty containers sitting in the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The twin ports have started threatening ocean carriers with fine penalties for leaving empty shipping containers in the ports in an effort to offload empty containers. Costco and Walmart were some of the few major companies that resorted to renting shipping containers to ensure goods get to stores in time for the holidays. On top of issues at the port, the US has been seeing a shortage of truck drivers. The trucking industry estimates that it is now short 80,000 truck drivers because of pandemic-induced retirements and resignations. In mid-December, the White House announced it would expand paid apprenticeships and recruit military veterans to bolster the industry, though the impacts of the initiative will probably not be seen any time soon. Croxton said supply chain researchers have long studied the weaknesses of today’s supply chain and have advocated for more resilient structures that can handle disruptions. For example, companies could pay attention to weather events and news and track inventory levels throughout the supply chain. Shortening the supply chain, like relying on domestic manufacturing, would also mean more oversight. “The number of disruptions that we’ve had in our supply chains has been increasing over the last decade,” Croxton said, citing extreme weather events and economic and political uncertainty. “This isn’t new to companies that the supply chains get disrupted.”"

          "bodyText": "We are going to put the blog to bed now – thank you so much for spending the second half of Thursday with me. Here were the big stories: A man died after a triple stabbing in Sydney. 20 Victorian Covid-19 testing centres closed due to huge lines. Victoria recorded 2,005 cases, NSW 5,715 and one death, Tasmania 26, Queensland 369, the ACT 85, the NT 10, SA 484 and WA had one new local Covid case. All Victorian frontline police to be equipped with Tasers. Indoor mask mandates to return in Victoria. Hunt says Omicron is not creating a serious increase of cases in ICU. NSW to mandate masks. Chant says roughly 80% of NSW Covid cases are Omicron variant. There were fires at Melbourne hotel housing refugees. And WA to introduce a mask mandate after a community case. And I’ll see you all again tomorrow! The Morrison government has told a tribunal there is “strong public interest” in preserving the secrecy of “business case” documents that may outline the nucleus of the unlawful robodebt scheme. IT expert Justin Warren won access to documents connected to the since-scrapped welfare debt recovery program under freedom of information laws in 2019, but he is yet to receive them after the government appealed against the decision. I suspect many separated families will be asking similar questions. Minister for Foreign Affairs Marise Payne has announced Australia will provide $5m in emergency relief to help the people of the Philippines recover from the devastation caused by Super Typhoon Rai. As many as 2.6 million people have been affected by the typhoon, with thousands sheltering in evacuation centres and many still without access to fresh food and water, power, and basic services. “Australia will continue to partner with the Philippines Government and humanitarian organisations to respond to this disaster,” Payne said in a statement. “Our assistance will include: funding for the Philippines Red Cross and UN Population Fund to distribute relief supplies (including sleeping, shelter and water and hygiene kits) and essential child and maternal health services (including sexual and reproductive health kits) funding for the World Food Programme, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization and the International Organization for Migration to provide critical transportation and communications support to the Philippines Government for delivery of relief supplies funding for Australian NGOs already operating in the Philippines to deliver immediate lifesaving assistance (including food and non-food items, shelter and water and hygiene kits), protection and livelihood recovery activities funding for local NGOs to respond to the needs of particularly vulnerable groups in remote areas. “I would like to convey Australia’s condolences and heartfelt thoughts to those families in the Philippines who have lost loved ones or whose lives have been affected by this disaster.” Earlier today, the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) put out a statement on Omicron, calling for a system-wide approach to preparing for more Covid cases. ACEM president, Dr Clare Skinner, said: Emergency physicians, nurses and other acute healthcare workers must be included in the conversations and planning for Covid-19 increases. Covid-19 surges have significant impacts on ED demand and workload, which are not reflected in reported numbers of patients admitted to hospital or ICU. Skinner said many of Australia’s emergency clinicians are anxious about Omicron. We experienced this anxiety when Covid-19 first appeared, and then again with Delta. The first waves were challenging, but we worked together, adapted our processes, and worst-case scenarios were avoided. So there are quite a few exposure sites: On 22 December: Aldi and Kmart at The Square Mirrabooka shopping centre and Vinnies Mirrabooka. On 19 December: McDonald’s Girrawheen, Perth Mess Hall, Connections Nightclub, and Geisha Nightclub. On 18 December: Dan Murphy’s Joondalup. On 17 December: the Bloody French restaurant in Subiaco and Palace Cinema Raine Square. On 16 December: the Galway Hooker pub, Scarborough Sunset Markets and WA Museum Boola Bardip. And that’s it for the WA presser, but sit tight and I will get the full list of current exposure sites. Sanderson says the backpacker and his girlfriend are being kept in hotel quarantine. They are in hotel quarantine, and at the moment the department is attempting to find a hotel quarantine for the four campers. Sanderson has been asked if WA’s hospitals and ICU departments are ready. We have made a significant investment in putting online a number of beds, and more than 200 will be online by the end of this year. We have the ability of 300 ICU beds and ventilators and have them staffed. If we put in place sensible public health measures and higher rates of vaccination, we think that will serve us well. The WA health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, is asked how long it will take for people to get results. We have increased testing capacity. [It should take] the same amount of time as it has previously. For some people it is a matter of hours, for others a couple of days, but generally, we are not expecting ... that to blow out at all. Dawson reiterates that anyone who has been in the Perth/Peel region from 16 December who has travelled out of the area will have to wear a mask inside unless in a private residence. Dawson says it is a $50,000 fine for nightclubs that open. “We have had actually good cooperation through the licensed premises,” he says. Dawson says there are no restrictions on the number of people in a home, but people should use common sense. In a private home, there is no restriction in terms of the numbers of people but, again, common sense has to prevail here, so we’re just asking people to use common sense in a private setting. But if you’re going shopping, if you’re going to do last-minute buying drinks etcetera, you will have to wear a mask. While it [comes into effect at] 6pm, it is an arbitrary rule to give businesses and people a chance. Dawson says people need to go and get tested if they have been to those venues or are feeling symptomatic. You do not know who you have been in contact with. The virus does not respect any venue, any road, it will go wherever it goes. Check on the website where those venues are and if you have been, if you are in contact with others that have been to any of these venues, then use your common sense, go and get tested. Clearly, get vaccinated if you have not been vaccinated. Commissioner of police Chris Dawson is up now. 100,000 people have now had the third dose, I know from our statistics, 165,000 others who have had five months lapsed and have not taken the booster. So have it. Testing clinics will be open tonight until 10pm and from 7am to 8pm tomorrow and Christmas Day, and 7am to 10pm Boxing Day. McGowan is asked why police had to use his phone pings to find him. He is 25 years of age and he is a backpacker and goes out a lot. We had to check his phone, knock on the door and tell him the bad news. McGowan says the man is symptomatic. The reason that he went and got tested is that he was unwell, and now the degree of unwellness, I don’t know. But that was the reason that he went and got tested, which is fortunate, and that’s the reason that we know about it now. McGowan says if WA has community spread the February opening day will become redundant. Obviously, if we have community spread of the virus, obviously the February 5 border opening in many ways becomes redundant. McGowan says “this may be the event” that ends WA’s Covid-free streak. I’ve said to you repeatedly over the course of the last couple of weeks, I hope that we make it to February 5 without community spread of the virus. We’ll be lucky to make it that far. This may be the event that provides us with community spread of the virus. ... And that’s why I’m saying to everybody, please go and get vaccinated as soon as you can. If you’re eligible for a third dose, go and get vaccinated. McGowan is asked if it could stretch on to NYE: We don’t know yet. We’ll see what we pick up and see what the health advice is. We’ll see if the testing brings any more cases to light. It’s four campers who are positive and have been all over the place. We’ll have to investigate that. The contact tracing teams will be working on all of these things now and as the minister said, there are a great many contact tracers now working on this. ... So we just want to track down any cases that might be out there and make sure that they’re dealt with appropriately. McGowan on the mask mandates: It’s from 6pm tonight: the mask-wearing mandate, the closure of nightclubs, the shutting down of the music festivals and the like, until 6am on Tuesday morning. McGowan says they believe it is Delta, not Omicron. We suspect that it is Delta but they have to do the whole genome sequencing to work out if it is the Omicron variant. At this point in time, we think that it is the Delta variant. If it is Delta, that’s less infectious than the Omicron variant. Whilst none of this is good news, at least it’s better than the more infectious [variant]. McGowan says if you leave Perth now you still have to wear a mask. I’m saying if you leave Perth now ... the requirement is, at least for the next 4.5 days, that you’re required to wear a mask. Now, that may extend. We’ll just see what we pick up through the testing clinics in the course of the next four days. McGowan says the backpacker is currently being interviewed. There are a lot of questions about when the backpacker came to Australia. WA doesn’t know, but as McGowan points out, there are a lot of backpackers who stayed in Australia over the course of the pandemic. The main priority is to find out where he’s been. Obviously, when you’ve been in the community for 12 days, particularly infectious from the 16th of December, you want to find out every single place that he went to. And I don’t know about you, but if you asked me where I’d been in the last 12 days, every single spot I went to, it’s hard to remember. So the main thing is that we track his movements entirely over the course of that period of time so that we can work out every single place that needs to be declared an exposure site. In terms of his arrival in Australia and the like, you know, I suppose we can ask those questions but the main priority at this point in time is trying to keep people safe. McGowan says they are acting in proportion to the risk. One truck driver who visited a service station and slept in his cab, we probably wouldn’t be doing this. But this is a backpacker who has been to multiple nightclubs, restaurants, bars with hundreds of people, and has been in the community for an extended period of time, so therefore, we are taking this action. McGowan says there are five close contacts currently. Five close contacts we know of, the backpacker’s girlfriend who has shown symptoms and a number of his housemates. The number of close contacts may grow, but at this point in time, in terms of casual contacts, that will [be] in the hundreds. McGowan is asked if it is mandatory for contacts to isolate while they wait for their test results. Close contacts need to isolate and get tested. That’s a two-week period. For casual contacts, it is isolation until you get a negative test. At the moment the vast majority, overwhelming majority of people are casual contacts, so they will need to isolate and get tested. Look, if they have to isolate over Christmas Day, that’s an unfortunate reality, a sad reality, but the reality of Covid. Someone has asked if it will lead to further cases. You don’t know with COVID ... That’s why we are encouraging everyone who has been to any of the exposure sites, anyone who is showing symptoms, please go and get tested. “We are ramping up the staff, expanding hours. They will be open until 10pm tonight, and depending on demand, open until 10pm tomorrow night. And 10pm on Christmas Eve and Christmas. If you see the sites he went to – nightclubs, shopping centres, bars, museums, restaurants, he has been to lots of places, so lots of people who have potentially been exposed. McGowan is asked if he is disappointed in the backpacker because he didn’t get tested earlier. He is a backpacker. He felt unwell. At the time he left Queensland, there had only been a handful of cases in the whole state reported when he left Queensland and came here. I don’t think he would have been thinking he could have been Covid-positive, but it turns out he was. McGowan is asked if visitor restrictions will be put in place for Christmas Day. Christmas Day will proceed as normal. The mask-wearing mandate applies in all public indoor settings, workplaces, shopping centres, hospitality venues, public transport. All indoor settings – hospitals, wherever you might be, except for family homes, those sorts of family lunches and get-togethers. Obviously we are not going to put in place a mask mandate for those. McGowan is asked why WA is not going into lockdown. We are at around 84% double-dosed over 12s, but the over 16s it is obviously even higher. I expect this event will mean far more vaccination occurs, so here we are at very high levels of vaccination – in fact, almost world-leading vaccination. This gives us a level of protection. That’s why I have been saying it, banging on about it, every day for months on end – please go and get vaccinated because you never know what’s around the corner. He came in one hour before the hard border went up with Queensland. He has arrived. We hope there hasn’t been community spread, but there may have been. That’s why we are taking the steps to protect ourselves if there has been spread of the virus. McGowan says the type of venues the Covid-positive person visited and the length of time he was infectious means they have to take these steps. I think [the number of contacts] is in the hundreds. As you can see, he is a backpacker who went out and went to nightclubs, bars, museums, restaurants, and it is in the hundreds. That’s why we are so concerned. He has been to events where there has been lots of dancing, lots of fun, lots of interaction by lots of people in close proximity. That’s why we are concerned about it. Some people are saying we are going too far in our reaction to this because it is one case, but the venues he has been to and the length of time he has been infectious means we have to take these steps. McGowan says this was not what anyone wanted before Christmas. I know this is not the news we wanted to hear two days before Christmas, but unfortunately this is the reality of Covid-19. No matter how hard our border controls ... [Covid] can sneak into Western Australia. We now need to face the potential of community transmission in Perth and Peel. That is why I am asking everyone to please do the right thing over this period. McGowan is introducing some changes to the Perth and Peel region: From six o’clock tonight until at least six o’clock in the morning on Tuesday, December 28 the following rules will apply across Perth and Peel. Masks will be mandatory in all public indoor settings including workplaces, shopping centres, hospitality venues and public transport. The mask mandate will not apply to the home and will not apply people doing vigorous indoor exercise. We are recommending masks be worn outside when you cannot physically distance, so we’re urging people just to use common sense. High-risk, large public events like music festivals will be cancelled during this period and all nightclubs closed. All dancing is banned except for weddings. In addition, the mask rules will apply to anyone who has been in Perth or Peel since Thursday, 16 December and are now located in a different part of the state. McGowan has listed multiple exposure sites – which I will post at the end – and says if you’ve visited them, you need to get tested. The backpacker has been checking in which has enabled us to identify a comprehensive picture of the man’s movements since his arrival in Perth. This has allowed contact tracers to reach out to hundreds of people who have checked in at the same location. It is also an important reminder for us to keep checking in, now more than ever. Obviously some people have dropped away from checking in, but this proves that we need to make sure that if one does the right things that we can keep track of any potential outbreaks. Health staff are very busy working to piece together a clearer picture of the level of risk to our community, but as we know when it comes to Covid, the situation can change very dramatically and very quickly. McGowan says the backpacker is not vaccinated; his girlfriend is symptomatic and has been moved into hotel quarantine. Further investigations have confirmed he has been living with four other people at a house in Girrawheen. These four people have been camping, but they have since been contacted and are now undergoing testing. They will also be directed into hotel quarantine. Health has identified several exposure sites across Perth. Premier Mark McGowan is up. WA has one new local Covid case. In this case it is a backpacker, case 1133, who travelled into Western Australia from Queensland earlier this month, a 25-year-old man who was originally from France. He felt sick on Sunday and got tested yesterday. The result came through this morning and it was a strong positive. The advice at this point is that it is unlikely to be the Omicron strain and therefore more likely to be the Delta variant. Investigations have confirmed the backpacker came into Western Australia 11 days ago on Sunday night December 12. The WA premier, Mark McGowan and health minister, Amber-Jade Sanderson, will hold a press conference soon with updates on the pandemic. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) has welcomed the reintroduction and extension of vital Covid-19 public health measures. Dr Jacqueline Small, president-elect of the RACP, has expressed relief governments have moved in line with the RACP’s recommendations and those of the country’s senior public health advisers. “What we are seeing with Omicron is that it spreads at lightning speed, and if we don’t take action now, we will have even more challenging times ahead of us,” Small said. “The unprecedented climb in case numbers in NSW shows why we urgently needed public health measures to be put back in place. “We strongly welcome the state governments’ decisions to reintroduce or maintain mask mandates, in addition to QR code check-ins and density limits. Modelling by the Doherty Institute earlier this week had shown the need to remain flexible and prepared to reintroduce certain public health measures, Small said. “We have to ensure that people can continue living their lives and celebrate this time of the year with their loved ones while minimising risks to their health and safety. “These proportionate actions help keep all in our community safer and ensure the health system can meet the needs of those who become unwell,” Small said. Queensland’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, has called in an application mining magnate Clive Palmer made to a regional council to build a large coal-fired power station. Palmer’s application to the Barcaldine regional council was seen by conservationists as an attempt to sidestep consultation on the plan, which Miles himself had suggested could be a “thought bubble.” Miles said this afternoon: “Barcaldine regional council has never assessed a project of this size. This call-in allows the state to address a broader range of matters than the council was able to under their planning scheme. “This will include seeking public comment on the project. I want to make sure the community get their say on a project of this scale.” Palmer’s Waratah Coal company made the application in February 2020 to build a 1,400-megawatt power station near the tiny town of Alpha, about 390 kilometres west of Rockhampton. Waratah Coal has an undeveloped but approved coal mine project about 30 kilometres north of Alpha, and Waratah coal says the mine project is dependent on the power plant. After Miles said last month he intended to call the project in, Waratah Coal wrote that the power plant would have lower emissions than other plants and provide jobs and cheap power to the state, and said the application through the council was appropriate. Dave Copeman, the director of Queensland Conservation Council, said the project should be stopped. “Minister Miles has acted responsibly by calling in this project. Proper government assessment will find what Queenslanders already know; we cannot build a new coal-fired power station in the face of the worsening climate crisis. “New coal in Queensland would lock consumers into higher prices and get in the way of our chance to fully embrace the opportunities of becoming a renewable energy superpower. “Queenslanders want a vibrant and innovative future that takes advantage of new renewable energy technology, not outdated, toxic coal-fired power.” While we’re on SA – I have this from AAP: South Australia’s Covid-19 cases have more than doubled in 24 hours, setting a record for the seventh consecutive day as the paramedics union warns the hospital system isn’t coping. SA Health reported 484 new cases on Thursday, taking the number of new infections since the state’s borders opened a month ago to 1307. Seven people are in hospital with one man in his 30s on a ventilator. SA now has 1214 active infections, most being managed in home isolation. The big jump in cases came as the Ambulance Employees Association said suspected and positive coronavirus patients were kept waiting in ramped ambulances outside the Royal Adelaide Hospital overnight in further evidence of the stress on the healthcare system. Taking to social media on Thursday, the Ambulance Employees Association said one crew was sent to three “severely unwell” Covid-19 patients overnight. It said two patients were ultimately transported in one ambulance while another crew eventually arrived to take the third patient. “Treating paramedics almost ran out of oxygen, they ran out of medications,” the association said. “They were calling for intensive care back-up with none available. Our healthcare system is not coping.” But the premier, Steven Marshall, said all the patients taken to hospital were treated appropriately. “They were triaged, they were treated within the clinically appropriate time frame,” he said. “Our clinicians treat people in accordance to their acuity and the advice I’ve received is that’s exactly what happened.” Marshall said of the four cases transferred to hospital overnight, three were from the same family, so it was acceptable for them to travel in the same ambulance. More on the SA Covid situation here: Western Australian fire authorities are preparing for maximums of more than 40 degrees across WA in the coming days. Fire and emergency services commissioner, Darren Klemm, addressed the media a little earlier and warned total fire bans are likely to be introduced soon. The forecast weather conditions present significant challenges from a fire weather point of view. [There are] some challenges around the health and wellbeing of those people responding, so it is important from our point of view that everyone plays a role. Total fire bans are likely to be placed in certain parts of the south-western state. They get decided around 4pm on each day for the next day, and people need to monitor WA to make sure that they are aware what bans are [in place] in the area they will be in on any day. Comments from Chris Minns, NSW Labor leader on rule changes: NSW Labor welcomes the decision by the NSW Government to back our calls for a mask mandate, and to reintroduce the 2SQM rule. We’ve already said this is a health crisis and is above politics. Whatever levers we can pull to get this pandemic under control, short of a lockdown, should be used. We all want to avoid a lockdown, and today’s announcements are sensible steps that the community, experts, and Labor have been calling for. We are in a position of strength to get through this, with some of the highest vaccination rates in the world. The NSW transport minister, David Elliott, says he has put brakes on the easing of capacity limits on public transport until January next year. In a statement, he said: This afternoon I instructed Transport for NSW Secretary Rob Sharp to cease the further easing of customer capacity limits on public transport services until late January 2022. Customer capacity limits and green dots across all modes of public transport were set to be removed on Friday 31 December 2021. In light of the current environment and measures announced by the Premier today, I have directed this work to be delayed to keep commuters and staff safe. The current capacity limit of 75 per cent of customers on any public transport service will remain in place. Masks are mandatory for anyone using public transport services across the network. SA Health says seven people are now in hospital, including a child. One man in his 30s is in the Royal Adelaide Hospital on a ventilator. Two new people are in hospital. Two separate fires have broken out in a hotel housing refugees and asylum seekers in Melbourne. Shortly after 1.30pm on Thursday, fire crews and police were called to the five-storey Park Hotel in Carlton – where 34 asylum seekers are being held – after an automatic fire alarm was triggered. Wearing breathing apparatus, some of the 30 firefighters on scene “entered the building and worked to contain the fires, bringing the incident under control at 2.11pm”. Crews are still on scene extinguishing flames and ventilating the building, a Fire Rescue Victoria spokeswoman said. There were fires on the third and fourth levels of the hotel, including one in a room. It is not clear how the fires started. While the FRV spokeswoman said “all occupants were safely evacuated” and some patients were transferred to ambulances, Ian Rintoul, spokesman for the Refugee Action Coalition, said the asylum seekers, who are staying on levels two and three of the building, were evacuated to level one. Mehdi Ali, one of the asylum seekers being held at the hotel, tweeted that authorities were “keeping us in the building instead of taking us to a safe place”. Victoria Police and FRV will investigate the cause of the fires. Additional reporting: Ben Doherty OK, that was a big presser for NSW. Let’s recap on the big changes: From midnight tonight, masks indoors will be mandatory – that’s until January 27. Next year, rapid antigen tests will be provided for free, but how that will be rolled out is yet to be determined. QR codes will be brought back in a limited way in low-risk settings. People have been asked to work from home if they can. The one person per two square metres rule in indoor hospitality will be reintroduced from 27 December to 27 January. And people in the state are being asked that, unless they are feeling unwell or they have been specifically told to get a PCR test, don’t get one. Hazzard is asked about visitors to households and if they will be restricted for NYE. The phrase I have used is ‘never say never’. We are in a pandemic, one in 100 years; we are keeping it under review, we will make changes as necessary and take public health advice where appropriate. At this stage my view is, Christmas, you know what? Last year we had the northern beaches locked down for Christmas, then we had parts of the eastern suburbs locked down, and parts of western Sydney – we need a break. We need people, as the premier said many times, to take some responsibility for themselves, but we don’t want to impose unnecessary restrictions. Take it easy folks, don’t have too many people over to your house. Open the windows. Hazzard says his advice to the federal government is that NSW “will do our bit”, but he is glad the feds are offering GPs and pharmacists more money. If you’re a pharmacist and already tired from two years of the pandemic, 23 months on Christmas Day, you’re only making $16 a pop for a job, you won’t be too keen because you’ll make a lot more money selling things across the counter, doing prescriptions. The fact the federal government have now said they will step up and pay additional funds to GPs and pharmacists – we should say thank you to the prime minister and thank you to the federal health minister, and hopefully that’ll make a difference. Hazzard says the majority of cases are young people. 10- to 39-year-olds occupy 70% of all of our positive cases. He says one positive case in Newcastle resulted in 250 positive cases. Look after yourself and don’t actually start hanging too close together with people you probably don’t know all that well. As we saw in Newcastle, one person went for a party boat and turned 250 people into positive cases in one nightclub in one night. We are striking a balance of personal responsibility – get sensible, folks, don’t try and mingle too closely with people you don’t know. In some cases, even with people you know. But also, if you can, get vaccinated. Hazzard is back up now: I’d like to see the federal government get advice from Atagi to bring forward the vaccinations [boosters] from the five-month point to the four-month point. Perrottet says the government hopes to offer free rapid antigen tests in 2022. Perrottet has just been asked about elective surgeries – he says the state is catching up. At the moment we have a very strong position and the health team – and I’ll ask a minister to make further comments on this, to give more direction – we are still bringing forward and catching up to those elective surgeries that we had to delay from last year. Perrottet says the pandemic is a balance of health and economic choices. This pandemic is a balancing act and we balance the health needs with the mental health needs, with the economic needs. The decisions of the NSW government has kept our state strong. People are working, being kept safe, low death rate, ICU presentations are incredibly manageable at the moment, particularly given where our case numbers are. We are in a strong position in our state, and the slight changes we have made as we move through until 27 January are modest but cautious, to make sure New South Wales gets through the holiday season ... they will play some role but ultimately, personal responsibility plays the key role. Someone has asked about NSW businesses having to shut if they have a case, because of staff isolating. Perrottet: The alternative is we close everything down. It’s very similar to the challenges we have seen in the school system. We brought kids back into the classroom as quickly as possible which meant from time to time, schools had to close. That was a challenge and difficult, but in the main, schools remained open. We believe the changes made to the close contact definition have made a marked improvement on that front and I’ve heard from the hospitality industry that they have seen a change, but they will be offset as cases increase. This will be a challenging time as we go through 2022 with difficulties, but in the main, we are in a much stronger position. I couldn’t hear the question, but I think it was about the backflip on some measures. Perrottet says: We have always said we tailor the settings ... we have said that through the entire pandemic and that’s what we’re doing today. The concern we have seen [in the past] 48 hours, it is primarily based on health staff and we want to ensure the system is resourced. There are many other pleasing factors so when you look at what we are seeing today, there are a lot more good than bad. The early evidence in relation to Omicron is it is five times less severe than Delta, which is incredibly pleasing. We have seen an increase in ICU but it is very manageable ... we always have our number one priority here in NSW to keep our people safe as we learn to live alongside the virus. We just ask everybody across our state to be cautious over Christmas, treat everyone with kindness and respect, we will get through the other side and we will have a strong 2022. Perrottet is again stressing that if people get pinged from the QR code check-ins, but they don’t feel unwell – they do not need to get a test. Especially when we have a situation when many people in NSW are travelling around the country for holidays to see families, we are doing everything we can to get those test results back as quickly as possible. But if we can reduce the people lining up on those queues who don’t need to do so, that will be very much appreciated from the government and everybody across the state who really does require ... one of those tests. “The last point in relation to that – I look forward to working with the other state premiers about minimising or reducing the time because it is the taxpayers [who] are ... paying for those tests, for people to travel interstate, and the queues are substantial and slowing down the testing but also affecting the health response. Only get a test if you feel unwell or are contacted by health authorities, he said. Perrottet is asking people to use “personal responsibility and common sense and be cautious over the Christmas break.” Perrottet: I think the changes we have made are modest, cautious and precautionary, to make sure, as these case numbers increase over this period of time, that we get through the summer ... and NSW will continue to lead our state out of the pandemic. With the QR codes, the issue for national cabinet’s decision yesterday – it became very apparent to me different states are in different positions. We have much greater cases especially of Omicron; other states aren’t in that position yet but will be eventually. In those circumstances, the effectiveness of having QR codes in every single retail store may work in a WA setting but not necessarily in a NSW or Victoria setting. Perrottet is back – he says the changes they are making today “are proportionate”. While we are seeing low numbers in ICU, very manageable numbers in ICU, it is more in relation to making sure that our health system is able to be well-manned during the summer period. We have already heard from David in relation to NSW Ambulance over the summer months, there are challenges that come our way ... In relation to masks, we are seeing pretty much right across the board, 85% of people wearing masks, that’s incredibly positive. NSW Ambulance acting commissioner David Dutton is up and he is asking people to only call an ambulance in an emergency. Yesterday, we answered an emergency 000 call every 24 seconds. We are asking to save 000 for saving lives. I want to be clear: if somebody is unconscious, if someone has chest pain, somebody has shortness of breath, if there are injuries as a result of a motor vehicle accident – please call emergency 000. I want to be equally clear on the following points: if you can’t sleep, if you have a toothache, if you have a splinter, if you want to check the opening hours of testing clinic, or follow-up on a Covid-19 vaccination, please do not call emergency 000. Those calls that I just referenced potentially delay NSW Ambulance mounting an emergency response, to a member of the community that really needs it. Chant says get vaccinated and wear a mask. Only get tested if you have symptoms or [if] health directs you to, or you know you had contact with someone that is Covid-19 positive. In the current settings, NSW Health will only be contacting and focusing our efforts on people that have entered or worked in high-risk settings. So what we are doing currently as we test people who have a positive result, we give them advice about what they need to do to self-isolate. We also ask them to fill in an online questionnaire. Chant asks people that they dance and sing outside over the festive season. We are introducing those density restrictions and hospitality settings and discouraging activities we know are associated with increased transmission: singing, dancing, things often associated with fun. At this time of year we have to tell it as it is in terms of what are the things associated with risk, especially indoors. Please take those activities outdoors, with lots of social distancing. Chant says more than about 70% of cases are in the age group of 10 to 39-year-olds. It’s really sad to see some very young people in ICU who are not vaccinated. So, again, a big callout to everyone – just because you’re young, this message doesn’t mean you’re necessarily going to be lucky enough to have the mild disease. You can be hit hard. Please get vaccinated. Get your first vaccine, get your second and get your booster. I want to talk about the transmission settings. So at the moment, Covid is circulating in a very young population relatively. We’ve got Kerry Chant now, who says NSW is currently experiencing both the circulation of Delta and the Omicron variant of Covid. Approximately 80% of our cases are currently Omicron. The increase in Omicron largely explains the steep rise in cases. The Delta case numbers did start to rise in mid-December, but we’re now seeing the Delta proportion of cases declining and that large uptick being accounted for by Omicron. Pulling together multiple pieces of evidence from overseas countries such as South Africa and the UK, and using some of our own emerging data, it indicates that infection with Omicron is likely to be milder than infection with Delta, with the risk of hospitalisation being around 60% to 80% less than for Delta. But the issue is the increased transmissibility, leading to high case numbers, and the impact this is having on vulnerable settings, vulnerable people and critical workforces, such as our health and aged care workforce. Hazzard says people who are unvaccinated are still in the ICU. They need to take the opportunity and get the vaccine while they can. In the last couple of weeks, we get the daily announcements on how many people are in ICU but I want to stress people come in and people go out from the ICU. Obviously that’s a good thing when they go out of the ICU, but we had about 60 people in ICU over the last two weeks and 65%, more than two-thirds, are unvaccinated people. Unvaccinated people. My message to those out there who think this is still some sort of pixie-land argument, that it doesn’t exist, is: it does exist. And you might be one of those two-thirds who have ended up in our ICUs in the next week or two or three, it might be you. This is your chance to take it seriously. Hazzard says people need to make sure they get boosters. Because we do know that particularly for older people, and those who had AstraZeneca, whilst it was fabulous for the time, it does have its challenges now [with] its waning effect on immunity, so we need to get a booster. I was one of those. Hazzard says people are also calling out ambulances when they don’t have to and that needs to stop. It’s frustrating for me to hear that ambulances are being called out at a time when we’re so busy dealing with Omicron. Our hospitals and frontline staff are so busy ... people are still thinking that ambulances are for something other than emergencies. They’re not. Ambulances are here for emergencies. Hazzard: If you’re going visiting over the next few days, please don’t go out and just get a PCR test for the sake of it, because next time when you do need a PCR test, seriously, you may not be able to get it because too many people go out and use our pathology system to that extent. Hazzard says testing is “a bit of an issue”. There are too many tests. Go back 22 months, we were excited when we were up around 40,000 tests. We’re now four times that amount, 160,000 tests. But it is sucking the energy out of all the frontline pathology workers, the people who are doing it, doing the tests, people who are then doing the pathology examinations, the administration, people who are sending the details out. I would ask everybody to listen very carefully to the message that if you don’t need to go – if you haven’t got symptoms or haven’t received a message telling you that you must have a PCR test – probably you don’t need to have a PCR test. Move your celebrations into the open air, Hazzard says. Anything you can do over the next few days, if you’re having people around to your house, try and do it out on the balcony or backyard, or if you can’t do that, open all the windows. What we do know is Omicron is not terribly successful when it’s out in the fresh air. It tends to get us when we’re inside in closed environments. Be very cautious. Brad Hazzard is up now – he says “it’s too early” to tell what will happen with Omicron. The Omicron virus seems to be challenging, it is very transmissible. So far it hasn’t been causing the level of anxiety medically that previous variants did. But we’re on high alert. The government is on high alert. I think the community should be on high alert. We don’t know yet. It’s too early. Perrottet: I do know there has been a fair bit of frustration out there. Many people waiting hours in queues, particularly as we come into Christmas. We’re doing everything we can to alleviate that pressure. In addition to the PCR testing, if you’re unwell and those people from New South Wales ... if you aren’t feeling unwell, please do not get a PCR test. Perrottet is now addressing the testing times – he says if you are not unwell, but get a ping through the QR code system, please don’t get a PCR test. At the moment what we’re seeing is that many people across the state who are asymptomatic and do not feel unwell are lining up for a PCR test. This is putting enormous pressure on the system and I thank everybody for their patience as we go through this period of time. But we need to make sure those people who need to get tested get tested in a timely way. If you aren’t feeling unwell ... [if] you receive a notification through the QR code system, the position that we have here in New South Wales is monitor for symptoms. If you do feel unwell, at that point in time, please go and get a PCR test. Perrottet is now talking about the change in QR codes. Many of you will be aware we’ve had those QR codes in place for some time. We kept them in place for high-risk settings. What we will do in relation to retail settings and lower-risk settings is we’ll bring them back in a limited way. The reason we removed those QR codes I think has been slightly misunderstood. It’s not in terms of opening up the economy, it’s to provide the support to the health system. Perrottet says there will also be density limits. We’ll be moving from hospitality venues indoors to two square metres from December 27 to January 27. And also the indoor face mask requirement will also be in place until January 27 as well. That’s just to ensure, as we move through this period of time, we do have that support for our health officers over this summer and holiday period. In addition to that, we’re encouraging people not to mingle ... when you’re out and about at a restaurant or cafe or a pub or a club, please, where possible, don’t mingle. We know that from a case we’ve seen in Newcastle, that singing and dancing and the like has been part of that increase in spread. So we just ask everybody use personal responsibilities, please be cautious as we move through this phase. Perrottet says masks will be mandated inside. As of midnight tonight, we will be requiring that masks are worn in indoor settings. We are encouraging people, particularly over the holiday period, if you can work from home, please work from home. Perrottet says, “it looks like the Omicron [variant] will be five times less severe than Delta.” Perrottet says NSW will be getting 300,000 boosters a week in January. That will be crucial. It’s our best line of defence as we move through this next phase of the pandemic. I want to thank everybody who has gone out and made the effort. Perrottet is talking about boosters, and says the numbers are good. If it’s been five months since your second vaccination, the booster shot is key to keeping you and your family safe, and to see now that health has administered 158,000 booster shots as of December 22 is incredibly pleasing. I congratulate the prime minister and the federal treasurer for their decision yesterday to provide additional financial support for our GPs and pharmacists who will be taking a heavier load when it comes to the booster shots over this period of time, particularly over the next four months. Perrottet begins by thanking frontline health workers. [They] have done an amazing job over the last two years, and particularly going through this most recent period of time, with significant vaccination and our booster shots required. I want to thank you on behalf of the government and the people of our great state for the continued effort in keeping our people safe. Perrottet is up now. We are just waiting for NSW premier, Dominic Perrottet, who is expected to address media any moment now ... Here’s more on QLD’s numbers – one person in ICU. Melbourne airport is now only doing pre-departure Covid-19 testing for international flights on the day of departure: From AAP: Queensland planning minister, Steven Miles, will scrutinise an application for a controversial coal-fired power station proposed by Clive Palmer’s Waratah Coal. Waratah, a subsidiary of Palmer’s Mineralogy, submitted a development application for the power plant with Barcaldine regional council in central Queensland. The application was made under a 2006 planning scheme that does not require public consultation. But Miles has called in the application, saying this will make sure a thorough planning assessment can be made on the project and the community get their say. “Barcaldine regional council has never assessed a project of this size,” he said. “This call in allows the state to address a broader range of matters than the council was able to under their planning scheme.” Calling in the project places approval of the power station in the state government’s hands. An earlier notice proposing the call in gave people the chance to make representations which had been considered together with the council’s initial assessment. A Northern Territory environmental group has won a court battle over a Morrison government grant to develop the Beetaloo basin onshore gas field. The Environment Centre NT argued in federal court that the $21m grant for exploration wells was legally unreasonable on multiple grounds. Justice John Griffiths on Friday rejected arguments that the resources minister, Keith Pitt, should have considered the risks of increasing greenhouse gas emissions when he made the grants. And we’ve just found out there will be a NSW Covid update at 2.30pm with premier Dominic Perrottet, minister for health Brad Hazzard, CHO Dr Kerry Chant, and NSW Ambulance acting commissioner David Dutton. A big lineup there! In closing Fyles thanks frontline health workers. In closing want to acknowledge our frontline staff. They’ve worked incredibly hard. It has been a gruelling 20 months and I think all of us thought, heading into the Christmas period, that would be an opportunity to take stock and prepare for the new year, but Covid is here and it has proved a significant challenge. So from the centre to the top end, whether it’s people delivering vaccination, people in our hospitals, or in our quarantine facilities, thank you for all your efforts to our Aboriginal medical organisations. Thank you, and now can we wish you a safe and merry Christmas. NT health minister, Natasha Fyles, says vaccinations are the best gift you can give for Christmas. While it is slowly creeping up ... We’re seeing a number each day, but we certainly would like to see more people vaccinated, and I again reiterate my message about how safe and effective the vaccine is. Of those new cases, five of them are linked to the Tennant Creek outbreak and locally acquired. Currently, there are 11 people in hospital with Covid and one, a woman in her 60s, is in ICU. And that’s it from Hunt. To recap: Hunt said the public health measures discussed at national cabinet had started in some states and territories. 1.8 million Australians have received their booster shot. And while Omicron is becoming the dominant strain, we are not seeing an increase in the seriousness of cases in ICU. Hunt has pivoted from attacking Labor to thank Australians for getting boosters. “Having said that, I want to thank Australians for coming forward to be vaccinated. “Thank Australians for coming forward in record numbers to be boosted, 167,000 boosters yesterday, 54,000 of those in pharmacies. The states have indicated they’ll be stepping up and restoring the capacity, which understandably was wound down when the first and second doses were being completed. “We can do this. We know how to do this as a country. We have done this before. We’ll do it again, no change in ventilation numbers on the latest advice I have, we’ll keep Australians safe, but Australians are doing their part as well. Thank you very much.” Hunt has been asked about remarks Anthony Albanese made this morning about testing sites. This is what Albanese said: “Overwhelmingly, people are waiting in queues because the governments haven’t prepared. The federal government shut down a whole lot of the testing areas.” Hunt has said this is false. “For Mr Albanese to make a false, untrue, incorrect, inaccurate statement, either without thinking or deliberate knowing it was a lie, is the act of someone who is not fit to be prime minister,” Hunt said. Hunt was asked if Vic was prudent to implement mask mandate indoors. “It’s entirely a matter for Victoria.” Hunt has been asked about Victoria mandating masks: “We’re encouraging people, as a result of the advice to national cabinet, to use masks in indoor settings. “It’s a matter for states and territories. But states and territories with their public health orders, whether it’s the QR codes in New South Wales, the masks in Victoria, have responded well.” “I think that it’s very important to show that national cabinet is delivering safer outcomes, but without constraining people’s lives. Across the board, I welcome the actions of the different states.” Hunt is asked about why we are seeing private health providers delay their premiums. “In terms of private health providers – one of the things that we have done is encourage them to have as low a premium as possible, and where they can give people no change for longer, then that’s even better. “And I’m pleased that they’ve responded. The lowest change in 21 years and if some of them have deferred that change, that means people are paying lower premiums for longer. “And so, I think that that is a really good outcome.” Hunt has been asked about how many aged care residents have had their boosters. “We’ve had over 1,500 aged care facilities receive their boosters. “Every aged care facility that has been able and willing to receive, because they were eligible and they were ready, has had their deliveries done so far. “Those that are still to be done are on the basis of their own timing. And so, we’re well ahead of schedule. We’re about 300 facilities ahead of where we’d anticipated and expected to have been.” Hunt is asked if we are equipped to deal with any change to the booster timeline and if hospitals can deal with Omicron. “I have requested that Atagi plans and focuses on continuous review about the booster program. They’ve already shortened it from six months to five months. “There’s the eligibility period. And in that time, what we’ve seen is 1.15 million doses in a 10-day period delivered with regard to boosters. And that’s now tracking at over 160,000 a day.” On Omicron: “But ventilation a week ago was 54 patients with Covid around Australia. As of yesterday, there were still 54 patients on ventilation with Covid. “So despite the increase in case numbers, there had been zero increase in ventilated patients numbers. ICU – what we see is that a week ago, there were 109 patients in ICU. “As of yesterday, the figures provided at midday today by the National Incident Centre, there were 112. So an increase of only three patients in a week. So the two things that we know - the hospital system is well equipped ... “The second thing is, despite an increase in case numbers, we’re not seeing an increase in the serious cases of ICU or ventilation in any significant way, with no increase in ventilation on the latest numbers that I have. “Now, these things can change. There can be a lag. So we’re fully prepared and I don’t want to make false promises on that.” And Hunt says public health measures discussed at national cabinet yesterday have started in some states and territories. “The states and territories have begun to implement the measures discussed yesterday at national cabinet. “There are measures in relation to QR codes in New South Wales and masks in some states and territories. “In terms of vaccination clinics in Victoria. That’s matched with the additional $10 for vaccinations by GPs and pharmacists under the commonwealth system which is being paid immediately as of today. “So, I want to thank all of those people for coming forward. They’re helping themselves. They’re helping their friends, their family and they’re helping to protect the country.” Hunt says there’s been a 2.7% increase in private health insurance - which is the lowest in 21 years. “At the same time, I’m really pleased that we’ve just achieved the lowest change in private health insurance fees in 21 years. “A 2.7% increase. We’ve had progressively the lowest change during my time in 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 and now 21 years. “And so, the lowest change in private health insurance in 21 years. That’s good for families. That’s good for private health insurance and what we’ve seen as a result is five successive quarters of an increase in private health insurance uptake. “It takes the pressure off the public hospitals. It shares the load across the system and it means that the Australian model of public and private - it’s not as reliant on the public as the UK system. “It’s not as reliant on the private as the US system. It means that the Australian model is not just being sustained, but it’s strengthening.” Greg Hunt is speaking in Melbourne now – he says the rates of bulk billing are up and that’s a good thing. “We have had bulk billing increase to 89.6% in the July-to-September quarter. “So the last quarter is up 0.7% in terms of bulk billing. And what does bulk-billing mean? “It means that now almost nine in ten visits to the doctor are completely free for people. And that’s a really extraordinary national achievement. “Again, thank you to our GPs and our clinicians right across the country. This is approximately 7.9% higher than for the same period immediately prior to the Coalition coming into government. So a nearly 8% increase in bulk-billing over the life of the Coalition. “It just means more services, more people, more people able to access the doctor without having to dip into their pocket.” With that, I will pass you on to Cait Kelly, who will keep you company for the rest of the afternoon. We are still waiting to hear from Greg Hunt, who was due to front the media at 12.30pm. Over in the ACT, testing numbers have eased at Nicholls but Mitchell’s drive through testing centre is still at capacity. As of 12pm: Mitchell drive through testing clinic (open 8am to 10pm): at capacity Garran testing clinic (open 7.30am to 9pm): 3 hours 30 minutes+ Kambah drive through testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 2 hours+ Nicholls testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 15 minutes+ Still at the Victorian press conference, Foley says fines for mask wearing will vary between $500 and $1,000. There has been no confirmation as to whether he accepted all the advice of the chief health officer but this will eventually be tabled in parliament under the pandemic legislation. The ABC is reporting two positive cases have been identified in Alice Springs. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese is strolling in to throw in his two cents around the same time as Greg Hunt (due to front the media at 12.15pm). The Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says it would have preferred mask-wearing to be a choice, but recognises it will allow venues to stay open without density limits: A reporter asks if Victoria is looking at going in the same direction as Western Australia, which has become the first jurisdiction to mandate a third vaccination dose. Sutton: I have got no advice on that at the moment. I think people are super keen to get the booster. We need to make it available. We need to ensure that appropriate numbers are available and then see how the booster coverage goes. A reporter asks the difference between getting a booster at four months verses five. Sutton: We can’t say with absolute certainty, and that is why this is not an easy space to provide advice in order to lead a position, but we need to respond to what is in front of us right now as an immediate and urgent concern. That is my view, and I know that people are at risk without the booster dose and I want to see them, especially those that are most at risk ... to have access to the booster ... we can say for certain that people who have not received the booster are at greater risk of dying and ICU. Reporter: So the difference between four and five months? Sutton: The difference is who is eligible to get it right now as we face large numbers of Omicron and having those individuals eligible and perceiving that booster will protect them. We need as many people in that category already boosted as we possibly can, especially those at risk of dying. Sutton is asked: why mandate instead of strongly encourage masks? The difference between highly recommending something and mandating something is the level of compliance that we see. I have just pointed out to you the masks that we saw come off as soon as we went from mandate to strongly recommended. We usually get about 50% levels of cooperation or compliance with a strong recommendation. It goes to 95-99% with a mandate. Why would you introduce a half measure when you need the full measure to be in place? This was the PM yesterday on mask mandates: Sutton reasserts the importance of ventilation and socialising outdoors coming up to Christmas. He made a video about this. Perhaps our TikTok aficionado Matilda Boseley has met her match! I have made a video recently about the importance of ventilation. Meeting outdoors, critically important. If you can, please do. If you can open doors and windows wherever possible if you are meeting indoors, please do. I will be doing a little round for Christmas to open doors and windows whenever I am inside. The video: Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton is up. He got his third dose yesterday, and has a satisfyingly sore right arm. We are reporting over 16,000 doses delivered through state run centres yesterday. That is double what it was a week ago, and a week ago is double what it was the week before that, so it is really ramping up which is fantastic. We also hit another milestone today - 5 million vaccinations delivered through services. A huge effort. One of the biggest in Australia if not the biggest, and as the acting premier said, we have built one of the most vaccinated societies on earth. That puts us in just a fantastic position - a wall of immunity to meet Omicron and it means that we can go ahead with much more confidence than other places in the world ... I know Victorians are concerned about what summer might have ahead, but again, our current vaccination rates are very important in measuring our individual and collective protection. We know that two doses provide good protection against severe illness against hospitalisation, against ending up in ICU. The booster dose, and the evidence is increasing day by day, provides even greater protection against severe illness and hospitalisation. Some 28 more pop-up vaccination sites will open in the coming weeks throughout Victoria, and the current 50 sites will extend opening hours to 12 hours a day, seven days a week. The site at the Royal Exhibition Building will stay open as the “iconic flagship site” well into late March 2022. Health minister Martin Foley is up, confirming Victoria is in a “strong position” by any measure worldwide to combat the new variant. In addition to mask mandates, there are new “recommendations”, not orders, to have in place for the festive season. One is working from home, and the second is a recommendation for hospitality venues to, “when they can”, stick to seated service and save dance floors for outdoor, well-ventilated areas. We acknowledge that Victorians have done so much to go out and get vaccinated in such strong numbers. And we’ve delivered on our part of the national plan for reopening. But a new variant of concern has arisen globally and we need to take measures to protect our community from that rapidly spreading variant whilst our health experts ... understand what it means for our community going into 2022. On advice of the chief health officer, the health minister will introduce additional measures to slow the spread of Omicron in Victoria, to remain in place until 12 January. From 11.59 tonight: Face masks will be required in all indoor settings, except private homes, for persons eight and over. Face masks will also be required at major outdoor events for people over 30,000 people. They can be removed when seated. Work from home if you can over the festive period. This is a recommendation. Merlino announces investment in a “major boost” to support the third dose rollout, including more than $31 million to support the commonwealth vaccination program while waiting for Atagi to provide advice on the potential shortening of the interval between a third vaccination dose. I want to be really clear. The interval needs to be shortened and the interval needs to be shortened immediately. That’s the view of Victoria. That’s the view of New South Wales. That’s the view of jurisdictions across the country. It is the clear public health advice we are getting. The interval needs to be shortened and it needs to be shortened immediately. We’re announcing today that we are ready to scale up to meet that demand so this new investment will enable a massive scale-up to support a major expansion of our state-run vaccination centres. Victoria’s acting premier James Merlino is up alongside health minister Martin Foley and chief health officer Brett Sutton, announcing changes to come into effect in response to the new variant. Merlino says Victoria is in one of the “strongest positions” around the world to combat Omicron because of high vaccination rates. Victoria is not considering going into lockdown. As a Victorian even the word “lockdown” is triggering. Tasmania’s premier Peter Gutwein has been providing a Covid update after 26 cases were recorded in the state. There has been no community transmission yet, but it is expected cases will pop up in the days ahead. Gutwein has ordered 100,000 rapid antigen tests to add to the current stockpile, which can be purchased at chemists and supermarkets. Someone PCR test that snake stat: Back to Palaszczuk, who says testing delays “are not just [because of] Queensland”. Let’s be very clear about this, it’s a bit Sydney-sided at the moment ... our response is we have always kept Queenslanders safe, and the measures in place were the measures outlined in the roadmap and the roadmap stands. The press conferences are rolling in, and in a quite civilised manner. We’ll be hearing from Victoria’s acting premier soon, followed by health minister Greg Hunt from Mount Martha. Case numbers in the ACT are in, and they’re up again. There have been 85 new Covid cases. There are three people being treated in hospital, but fortunately none in ICU, and no deaths. Some 123 confirmed Omicron cases have been detected in Queensland, but there’s likely to be more as there’s also a lag in testing, Gerrard says: We’ve tested 123 confirmed Omicron viruses, but there’s a lag in our testing. There’s a lag until we know the total numbers of Omicron. It’s clear that Omicron is becoming dominant and will dominate henceforth. We continue to see infections across the state. So wherever you live, you need to assume that you will be exposed in the coming weeks to this virus. Queensland’s chief health officer John Gerrard is up, making an interesting point about the “necessary” spread of the virus through the state. Masks and other social measures won’t stop the virus but slow it “a little bit” until we receive our third vaccination, he says. I think it is important at times like this as the numbers increase that we reflect on what exactly we are trying to do and where we are going. The spread of this virus, which is now this particular strain Omicron, is extremely contagious. Not only is the spread of this virus inevitable, it is necessary. In order for us to go from the pandemic phase to an endemic phase, the virus has to be widespread. We all have to have immunity. You will all have to develop immunity. There’s two ways you can do that - by being vaccinated or getting infected. There are only two choices, only two ways to do that. And once we’ve done that, once the virus is spreading, once we all have some degree of immunity, the virus becomes endemic, and that is what is going to happen. Queensland is now at 90.1% single dose targets. But the premier is concerned about lagging vaccination rates on the Gold Coast, a major tourist hotspot. We’re on the beautiful Gold Coast but I am still worried that vaccine coverage is not high enough here on the Gold Coast, which is one of the reasons we’re doing this press conference here today. Across the south-east of our state, essentially every area is above 90% except the Gold Coast region. Logan, Ipswich, where we had a huge vaccine drive, they have hit over 90%. In Brisbane, they’re heading towards 95%. On the Gold Coast, it’s 88.8%. This is a tourism hotspot. This is where the tourists are coming from just across the border. If you have not been vaccinated, go and see your GP or your pharmacist or one of our vaccination centres today. It is absolutely imperative that we drive up the vaccination rates on the Gold Coast. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is providing a Covid update. The state has recorded 369 new Covid cases, which she says will inevitably rise. Positive cases have been detected across the state - in Brisbane, Central Queensland, Gympie, Noosa, Redland, Southern Downs, Sunshine Coast, Toowoomba, Townsville and the Whitsundays. There is currently one person in intensive care, with “other medical issues”. Wait times for Covid tests are out in South Australia: Heavy rainfall and a possible thunderstorm warning is in place over the Central Coast. The latest update from ACT Health is out, and all testing clinics are currently at capacity. As of 10.15 am: Mitchell drive-through testing clinic (open 8am to 10pm): at capacity Garran testing clinic (open 7.30am to 9pm): 2 hours 30 minutes+ Kambah drive-through testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 2 hours 30 minutes+ Nicholls testing clinic (open 8am to 6pm*): 2 hours 30 minutes+ We are experiencing high demand for testing this morning and all our testing clinics are at capacity right now. Please do not queue on the roads, and come back later. We apologise for any inconvenience this may cause, however the safety of staff and our community is paramount. Victoria’s health minister Martin Foley will be up later today. No word yet on whether any changes to restrictions will be made in the state. Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese this morning backed calls for the timing of booster shots to be reduced from five months. All the medical advice from overseas and the experience that we have is that it should be. And I’m sure that Atagi will come up with that recommendation as I’m sure it’s inevitable as well as it is overseas, in order to be considered fully vaccinated, that third shot as the protection against Omicron is particularly important. One of the benefits that we’ve had here in Australia due to our location, where we are, this island continent with natural protections, due to our distance from the world, is that we can see as we did with the first and second waves, we can see what is happening in the rest of the world. And anticipate it and get ahead of it. We need to do that. We need to stop playing catch-up, which is what this prime minister consistently does. Meanwhile, Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will hold a press conference at Burleigh Heads in roughly half an hour. Tasmania’s numbers are in. There have been 26 new Covid cases reported - a record high for the state. One active case is in hospital for another medical condition. The Police Association Victoria has welcomed the announcement, which it says has been long advocated for as a “critical non-lethal tactical option”. The $215 million rollout comes as the state’s war on crime has seen spending on police, courts and prisons grow at double or triple the rate of other states and territories over the past decade. Victoria’s police minister Lisa Neville is up now alongside chief commissioner Shane Patton. She confirms all Victorian frontline police and PSOs will be equipped with Tasers, which will be linked to body warn cameras. The rollout of 6,000 of the stun guns is expected to take five years. Specialist training will be provided to officers. A 62 year old man has died following a single-vehicle crash in the New South Wales Riverina overnight, NSW police report. Emergency services were called to Shoards Road, north-east of Temora, late last night, following reports a double truck towing two trailers left the roadway and rolled. A passing motorist called emergency services and attempted CPR on the driver until paramedics arrived. The man died at the scene. A report will be prepared by the coroner. Back to Covid, the good news is high testing numbers. The bad news is the reference rate. Some 3.56% of tests are coming back positive in NSW, and 2.36% in Victoria. That’s a significant growth rate in the past week. Looking for a useful distraction from the pandemic this morning? How about a dip into Guardian staff’s funniest things we saw on the internet. I laughed out loud at this more than once, and not just at my own contribution (the guy with a phone full of QR codes). Thanks as ever to Matilda Boseley for guiding us through this morning’s news and bringing us Jacqui Lambie’s elf costume. With that, I shall pass you over to the amazing Caitlin Cassidy who will bring you the rest of the morning’s news! The Omicron variant of coronavirus appears to be milder, with a 20%-25% reduced chance of a hospital visit and at least a 40% lower risk of being admitted overnight, the first UK data of its kind has showed. But as daily Covid cases topped 100,000 for the first time on Wednesday, experts warned that high transmissibility means the NHS is still at risk of being overwhelmed. In what was described by scientists as a “qualified good news story”, two studies on Wednesday pointed to a lower risk of hospitalisation with Omicron. An Imperial College outbreak modelling team led by Prof Neil Ferguson analysed hospitalisations and vaccine records among all PCR-confirmed Covid cases in England between 1 and 14 December. The dataset included 56,000 cases of Omicron and 269,000 cases of Delta. You can read the full report from Ian Sample and Heather Stewart below: No word yet on when we will be getting a health update from Victoria today. Just to put things into perspective: Just to break the absolute doom and gloom that was those Covid numbers, here is Jacqui Lambie dressed as an elf. Looks as though we will be hearing from Anthony Albanese at 11.50am today. NSW daily case numbers have jumped by nearly 2,000 cases today, with 5,715 new cases. According to AAP, 20 testing sites have closed in Melbourne this morning after reaching capacity. Scott Morrison insists it’s not necessary for the states to introduce mask mandates in response to a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases, despite health advice recommending they be compulsory in indoor settings. Speaking after a national cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the prime minister instead said it was “highly recommended” to wear masks indoors, urging Australians to use common sense and to reduce their risk of spreading Covid to their loved ones over Christmas. Health advice circulated to state and territory leaders late last week made the case for mandating masks in all indoor settings, including retail, entertainment facilities and hospitality when not eating and drinking. “Implementation of mask wearing measures should occur prior to Omicron case escalation to have maximum benefit,” said the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee advice. You can read the full report below: A man is dead after a triple stabbing in a western Sydney park and a teenager is fighting for his life in hospital, reports AAP. NSW police were called to a reserve at Catlin Close, Whalan, about 7.30pm on Wednesday. Officers found three men – aged 40, 25 and 19 – with stab wounds. The 40-year-old died at the scene and the two injured men were taken to Westmead hospital for treatment. The youngest man is in a critical condition with injuries to his torso and arm, while the 25-year-old is in a stable condition with a cut to his arm. All three men were known to each other. As Covid cases surge in Australia, attention is turning to how the health system is coping. To track the impact of the spread of the Omicron variant on hospitals, we have brought together the data on hospitalisations and new case numbers – both nationally and across states and territories for the last six months. Cases include those infected locally, overseas and where the source is unknown or under investigation. Due to the difference in reporting times between jurisdictions it can be difficult to get a picture of the numbers, trends and impact on the healthcare system. But the seven-day average of new cases shows how cases are trending in each jurisdiction. Experts say there can be a lag of 10 to 14 days from when cases are reported and subsequent hospitalisations. You can read the full data blog below: The NSW government is considering providing free rapid antigen tests in the mail and it’s likely there will be a return to mandatory QR check-ins at retail and hospitality venues, reports AAP. But premier Dominic Perrottet is still resisting bringing back mask mandates at indoor venues, despite NSW Health urging everyone to wear them in high-risk settings. Covid-19 cases are surging in NSW and testing clinics are being overwhelmed. Some 15,815 people have tested positive since 16 December and yesterday’s record daily caseload of 3,763 infections could be smashed today. Perrottet emerged from yesterday’s national cabinet meeting to flag a plan to provide residents with the rapid tests, which are in short supply and expensive: Providing rapid antigen testing kits for those who want to do the right thing will help take the pressure of our testing clinics while giving people confidence to get on with their lives ... This will also help people monitor their symptoms and go about their daily activities in a responsible manner helping protect themselves, their families and the community. The need to relieve pressure on Covid-19 testing sites across the state is becoming more urgent with just two days until Christmas, after days of long queues at the facilities. People wanting to travel interstate or get the all-clear to attend Christmas celebrations are waiting hours to get a PCR test and about 72 hours to get a result. Restrictions eased in NSW on 15 December for all residents, including the unvaccinated, but the government is now expected to announce it will bring back mandatory QR check-ins at supermarkets, shops and hospitality venues. The ABC is reporting this morning that NSW is poised to reintroduce QR code check-ins as well as provide free rapid antigen testing kits as cases surge in the state. Reportedly there isn’t a strict time frame for when businesses will be required to comply with the reintroduced check in-laws, but we should learn more when Dominic Perrottet speaks today. The ABC reports that free rapid antigen tests are being explored as a way to potentially reduce pressure on Covid-19 testing sites. Covid-19 testing clinics are reducing their openings hours during the Christmas period despite “unprecedented demand” and reports of hours-long wait times in several states. Guardian Australia analysis shows 77% of the 490 testing sites listed on the NSW Health website on Wednesday will either close or operate on reduced hours through the Christmas and new year period. This comes amid record Covid cases in NSW and the highest testing numbers in Victoria since the beginning of the pandemic. Victoria reported 92,262 Covid test results on Wednesday, the most processed in a 24-hour period. In Melbourne overwhelming demand for testing forced at least 14 testing sites across the city to shut from 9.45am, after reaching capacity. You can read the full report below: John Frewen has been asked if the hotly anticipated Novavax will be included in the booster program mix. But it seems we will still have a while to wait: Novavax is still going through the approval process. I know they’re getting closer. We’re looking forward to get Novavax into the mix of available vaccines as well. It won’t be until the new year. I don’t know exactly when. As soon as Novavax is ready to go, we’ll be delighted to get it out there. I know some people have been holding out for Novavax specifically. It will be part of our arsenal and we look forward to helping people access that vaccine if that’s what they want. John Frewen: We have got 5m doses on shelves around the country in GPs and pharmacists. We have got record number of deliveries going in this week. We have had orders placed both before Christmas and for the first week of January, we have got an emergency ordering system in place and we also have a cell within the taskforce that’s helping people get connected to stuff that’s sitting on shelves in GPs and pharmacists not being used. Sometimes it’s a pharmacy or a GP around the corner, sometimes it’s across town. The vaccines are there. I encourage any of these businesses to contact the vaccine operations centre and we’ll have them connected to supply. But I assure you that supply is not a concern. We are working hard on the distribution. And then it’s about that great workforce to get the vaccines into people’s arms. Lieutenant General John Frewen (the army guy who is in charge of all our vaccines) has defended Australia’s booster rollout: The booster rollout is proceeding at speed. I think the queues you may be seeing at the moment may be around the testing regime. We have been hitting record days on boosters. We had almost 2 million people have their boosters over the last few weeks. We adapted very quickly to the Atagi decision to shift from six months to five months. We did that in a matter of days. That decision only happened a little over a week ago. We’re postured ready to respond if Atagi shifts the medical health advice around the booster recommendations again and supply is absolutely not a concern this time around. We have got more vaccines than will be needed over the months ahead. Australia’s peak doctors body has criticised an “unethical” proposal to charge unvaccinated people for their medical care that is being considered by the New South Wales government. The state’s health minister, Brad Hazzard, confirmed the government was looking at forcing people who had not received the jab to pay for their medical bills if they required hospital treatment for Covid. “This is an option under consideration by the NSW government,” Hazzard said in a statement on Wednesday evening after it was first reported by Sydney radio station 2GB. The health minister did not provide any further details about how such a plan would work and did not respond to further questions. You can read the full report from Lane Sainty and Michael McGowan below: Good morning everyone, it’s Matilda Boseley here, and Merry Christmas Eve Eve! As a Christmas treat, I have ... well, more Covid-19 news. Mask regulations are tightening in Queensland cinemas and hospitality venues as Covid-19 case numbers in the state surge into triple figures for the first time. Queensland reported 186 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, prompting the state government to ramp up the requirement for mask-wearing. From 5am on Thursday, workers and patrons at theatres and cinemas will be required to wear masks, while staff in hospitality venues such as pubs and restaurants will also have to mask up. Masks are mandated in supermarkets and shops as well as public transport and rideshares. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk vowed Queensland would stay open despite the rapid increase in Omicron infections: We want to keep our restaurants and our cafes and everything operating over Christmas and new year. The rules come as the state on Wednesday hit the 90% threshold for first-dose vaccinations, according to federal government data. Moving south, it’s expected that mandatory QR code check-ins will be reintroduced in high-risk settings in NSW after an informal national cabinet meeting yesterday. These rules were scrapped on 15 December but as case numbers in NSW reached 3,700 yesterday, it appears premier Dominic Perrottet has conceded that Omicron may require some backtracking on the rules. We should learn more when he speaks later in the day. It’s a similar story in Victoria this morning, only this time it’s masks that might be coming back. The acting premier and chief health officer have voiced their support for increased mask-wearing in high-risk settings, so we shall see what the ruling is when they step up later in the day. Well, there is clearly plenty to get through today, so why don’t we jump right into the day!"

          "headline": "Nord Stream 2: how Putin’s pipeline paralysed the west ",
          "bodyText": "The saga of Nord Stream 2, the gas pipeline between Russia and Germany running along the Baltic seabed, has been stuck so long it has been likened to a suitcase at an airport without a handle – impossible to abandon, and impossible to carry forward. Most of the original cast of characters – Jean-Claude Juncker, Angela Merkel, Matteo Renzi, David Cameron, Petro Poroshenko – have left the political stage. Only one politician has survived the entire story: Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, and the master of divide and rule. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy giant Gazprom has been built to carry gas from western Siberia, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. But the one thing this pipeline is not, as lamely claimed by the former German chancellor Merkel, is a purely commercial project. It has vast geostrategic consequence, with every inch of pipe a pitched political and legal battle. Indeed few engineering projects have thrown up so many issues: the restoration of the post-Soviet empire, the climate crisis, American bullying of Europe, Germany’s emotional embrace of Russia, the legal powers of the European Commission, corporate lobbying, energy forecasting, and Gazprom’s monopolistic model. Its fiercest critics have described it as a modern day betrayal on the scale of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of 1939. By handing Putin such potential leverage over European energy security, it is argued, the 1,200 km pipeline leaves Free Europe at his mercy. If Putin wants a new Yalta, a new border settlement with Europe, then gas, and Europe’s dependence on Russian reserves, has become a means to achieve it. Nord Stream 2’s critics say it isn’t so much about creating additional capacity as it is about supplanting the main existing path for Russian gas to Europe, which runs through Ukraine. Others say this is hyperbole, and Russia would find that if it used gas as a geopolitical weapon that Europe has many alternative sources. The pipeline’s construction was completed in September after many postponements and legal hurdles straddled. But the Gazprom board is now waiting for final legal permission from German regulators to start sending gas down the pipeline to grateful German consumers. That permission has become the subject of early infighting within the new German coalition, made all the more intense by Putin’s threats to Ukraine’s sovereignty. Such are the shifting balance of forces, it is just conceivable, if unlikely, that at the last moment the project will be blocked for good, leaving Gazprom and its five European co-investors with a gleaming white elephant at the bottom of the Baltic seabed, a child of a different era, a reproach to Putin’s imperial overreach. If so, it will be a great victory for Ukrainian independence. Ever since the pipeline was proposed, only one year after the invasion of Ukraine by Putin, Kyiv has ferociously lobbied against the idea. Ukraine fears that by bypassing its own leaky gas route from Russia to Europe, the new pipeline – part of a wider Russian strategy to cut links with post-Soviet Republics – will deprive it of badly needed transit fees, the equivalent of 4% of its GDP. Kyiv has also argued that the pipeline will increase Russia’s control and share of the European gas market and therefore give Putin a chance to put his boot on the windpipe of Europe. The pipeline has an annual capacity of 55bn cubic metres – more than half of the 95bn cubic metres of gas Germans consumed through 2019. Ukraine found ready allies for its cause in Poland, the Baltic States, belatedly Italy, the UK and, critically, the European Commission. They have all pointed to the Russian gas standoffs of 2006 and January 2009, and to Putin’s recent threats to Moldova, to argue Russia will show no compunction about turning the gas taps off to secure geostrategic advantage. Kyiv’s lobbying led in December 2019 to the introduction of US sanctions under the Protecting Europe’s Energy Security Act (PEESA). It meant construction on the pipeline was suspended for a year and a half, as the Swiss-owned contractor laying the pipeline backed off. Such was the German government’s concern that in a private letter of 7 August 2020 Olaf Scholz, then finance minister and now German chancellor, proposed to the then US Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, that Germany would fund the construction of two liquid natural gas terminals in Germany with as much as €1bn (£856m) in exchange for the US ending its hindrance of Nord Stream. The US has long lobbied for more LNG exports to Germany. Donald Trump rejected the German offer, telling Merkel she had to stop feeding the beast. At a Nato summit in 2018 he complained: “Germany will have almost 70% of their country controlled by Russia with natural gas. You tell me, is that appropriate? We’re supposed to be guarding against Russia and Germany goes out and pays billions and billions of dollars a year to Russia.” Initially the Biden administration’s approach was one of continuity, copying the firm line adopted by Trump and urging Europe not to make itself vulnerable to Russian energy blackmail. But by May, the line had softened. German diplomacy was at work. On 19 May Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, waived sanctions on Nord Stream’s chief executive, Matthias Warnig, chair of Nord Stream 2 and a close friend of Putin, explaining he wanted to give time for diplomacy to work. By 7 June Blinken said the pipeline was a fait accompli, and on 21 July, a week after meeting Merkel at the White House, Biden lifted sanctions altogether in a farewell gift to her. Complaining he had been stabbed in the back – not the first US ally to make this point about Biden – Ukraine president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Ukraine had been carved out of the decision making process, something the US contests. Under the agreement Merkel had reached with Biden, Germany promised to push to extend a Russian-Ukrainian gas transit agreement for 10 years as well as contribute $175m to a new green fund for Ukraine to improve its energy independence with renewables. “Should Russia attempt to use energy as a weapon or commit further aggressive acts against Ukraine”, the statement also read, “Germany will take action at the national level and press for effective measures at the European level, including sanctions, to limit Russian export capabilities to Europe in the energy sector, including gas”. Merkel said these assurances applied not just to her administration, but to her successor’s. Amos Hochstein, Biden’s senior adviser for global energy security, later justified Biden’s pragmatism, saying: “The idea of reaching the joint statement with Germany was recognising the reality of the completion of the pipeline itself, understanding that aggressive action by the United States would probably not have changed the outcome and perhaps only would have delayed it. So looking at reality, understanding it, and fashioning something with an arrangement with Germany that would allow us to continue to defend the significant interests that Europe has, that the United States have, to defend the security of Ukraine while addressing and mitigating the bad effects and the threats that Nord Stream 2 could pose”. This judgment has been repeatedly questioned, including in the UK. Biden decided to give the pipeline his reluctant blessing this spring, precisely at a time when Putin had first started to mass troops on the border of Ukraine. He also gave the go-ahead just as the German Green party, adamantly opposed to the pipeline and determined to take Germany in a new foreign policy direction, had climbed in the polls to become the largest party ahead of the September election. It was an odd time for Washington to send a defeatist signal to Annalena Baerbock, the Green party leader, and she did not hold back in criticising Biden’s decision as one that would divide Europe. Biden had also done little to square off angry Republican Senators that support sanctions on Gazprom as a national security necessity. Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican who authored the bill mandating US sanctions on the pipeline project, rejected Biden’s logic. “It was 95% complete in December of 2019 when we passed the sanctions, and we stopped it. And a 95% complete pipeline is 0% complete. And we saw, for a year, it remained a hunk of metal at the bottom of the ocean until Biden got elected”. By way of reprisal, Cruz sent letters to German firms working on the project threatening sanctions that will destroy their companies. He also issued a blanket hold on all of Biden’s nominations for senior state department posts, hobbling US diplomacy. The move put more than nearly 30 nominees in limbo, leaving many countries without confirmed US ambassadors. The standoff only ended when Cruz was promised a Senate vote on reimposing sanctions by mid-January. Cruz will need 60 votes in favour. Biden’s calculation was understandable. He wanted to mend fences with Germany, and seek its support over China. In the process he knew he would be upsetting Ukraine, but, as he showed with Aukus – the Indo-Pacific security pact that excluded the French – Biden’s national security team is quite willing to disoblige allies in the interests of focusing on the great strategic competitor, China. The German Greens were also deeply disappointed the state department had swallowed the German diplomat’s argument that the pipeline was unstoppable. Yes, Gazprom was almost within touching distance of the finishing tape, but there were still significant regulatory hurdles ahead within Germany and the EU. But since then, Merkel’s carefully constructed equilibrium has been disturbed by three events: skyrocketing gas prices in Europe, fuelled by booming demand in Asia; the renewed massing of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine; and the arrival of Greens in the coalition government. Nord Stream 2 is back in the cross hairs. Scholz, now German chancellor, remains a supporter of the project, but he, Biden and the G7 leaders, in search of ways to deter Putin, have united in saying any invasion of Ukraine will lead to its suspension, not cancellation. That is hardly controversial. The real question is whether the Greens, ironically aligned with the US Republicans, can kill the project altogether. To do this will require a dramatic challenge to the way Germany views Russia. In his book Germany’s Russia Problem, John Lough, Chatham House fellow, has studied how Germany’s emotional connection with Russian society and culture has contributed to a German willingness to misread the direction in which Russia has been heading. Speaking at Chatham House recently he argued “a strange combination of emotions is at play – an historic fear of Russia, a sense of guilt for the crimes of the Nazis, a gratitude to Moscow for permitting German unification to happen when it did and with such speed, and a large measure of sentimentality based on a liking of Russian culture. Then there was an economic logic – historically Germany has had the technology and Russia the resources, and that creates some sort of natural complementarity between the two countries. Finally there is a widely held perception that Ostpolitik [the normalisation of relations between the Federal Republic of Germany and Eastern Europe] from the late 1960s and 70s brought an end to the cold war. By relaxing tensions, building contacts, trading more, somehow in the end Russia will be a rational actor”. There is an almost religious belief that since Russia needs markets and Germany needs Russian gas, the mutual dependence will ensure stability. Lough argues Germany finds it very difficult to accept that Russia has been steadily moving in an authoritarian direction. “To do so you would have to shift policy and recognise you are dealing with a much more difficult partner”. Indeed Merkel’s instinct, according to her long term chief foreign policy adviser Christoph Heusgen in Der Spiegel, was always to keep in mind what was tolerable to Russia. For that reason she opposed the Nato action plan for Ukraine, the provision of offensive weapons and continued to argue Nord Stream did not threaten Europe’s energy security. That mindset, according to Ralph Fücks, director of the German Centre for Liberal Modernity and close to the Greens, comes close to providing Russia with a veto power. But with Baerbock installed in the foreign ministry, and Robert Habeck, her ally, in the giant climate change department, he argues a new generation of powerful voices opposed to the decades long dominance of the so-called Russlandversteher have come to the fore. To win the Greens have to take on their senior coalition partners, the SPD. Gerhard Schröder, the 77-year-old former German SPD chancellor, is chair of Nordstream’s shareholders committee, a post he took up within weeks of leaving public office. Schröder’s defence of the project is unconditional. Asked, for instance, about the relationship between the pipeline, something he describes as a European project, and the poisoning of the Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, he said: “One has nothing to do with the other,” adding nothing had been scientifically proven about the poisoning. Not surprisingly, Navalny describes Schröder as “Putin’s errand boy”. He points out the true beneficiaries of Nord Stream 2 will not just be morally corrupt Germans, but US-sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Schröder’s advocacy of the project is wholly typical of SPD opinion. For many years Trump’s bullying of Germany made this an easy argument to run inside a party determined to defend German sovereignty. It provided a shield for those in the SDP who defended closer relations with Russia on the basis of Wandel durch Handel, change through trade. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, for instance, defends the project by citing Henry Kissinger’s dictum that good diplomats look for points of contact in foreign policy “in order to transform a bad present into a better future”. “Both sides have to think about whether this bridge can be demolished completely and without replacement,” he recently said. “I think breaking bridges is not a sign of strength. How are we supposed to influence a situation that we perceive as unacceptable, when we cut the last connections?” The former German foreign minister Heiko Maas, also from the SPD, presented the pipeline as a means of staying in touch with Russia. A “strategy of burned bridges”, he said, is not only wrong but also dangerous, since this would push Russia into close economic and military cooperation with China. Sometimes this approach tips into outright appeasement. The former Brandenburg state premier Matthias Platzeck, a Social Democrat, landed in hot water in 2014 when he said “the annexation of Crimea must be retroactively arranged under international law so that it’s acceptable for everyone”. Platzeck was also chair of the German-Russian Forum business lobby. But the greatest enthusiast has been Manuela Schwesig, the prime minister of Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, who has repeatedly clashed with the Greens. In her state, the seaport of Mukran, in the very north-east of Rügen, has been a big works hub for the pipeline. She has been a leading advocate, celebrates Russia Day every year and even set up a foundation to protect firms from US sanctions, which bears the title Foundation for Climate and Environmental Protection. Schwesig’s personal popularity has not been dented by this support for the pipeline. “If we want to get out of nuclear energy and coal power, we need gas at least for a transitional period,” she has said. So to win Baerbock not only has to take on her coalition partners, but also win an argument with the German public, many of whom agree with Scheswig and are sceptical that the country can afford to wean itself off nuclear power, coal and gas all at the same time. But Bearbeck has influential allies among energy forecasters. Dirk Messner, head of Germany’s environment agency UBA, in August said NS2 could soon be outdated for climate policy reasons. “Nord Stream 2 could quickly become something of a dinosaur among energy projects, because we want to have [net] zero emissions by 2045”. Baerbock’s most important potential ally is the European Commission and the law. For years the commission and Gazprom have been at odds. The Russian company has tried to avoid the EU’s regulatory net by arguing that a 2019 energy directive did not apply to the pipeline. Gazprom failed, and now the German regulator along with the EU will take six months to decide if the pipeline meets EU law. Other companies have been given permission to make their case to the German regulator, including Ukraine’s gas grid operator GTSOU and Poland PGNiG. A whole series of EU regulatory requirements on third-party access, ownership unbundling and tariff transparency come into play. The unbundling requires pipeline owners to be different from the suppliers of the gas flowing in the pipes, something Gazprom opposes. “It is clear that European energy law also applies to this project, the separation of trade and transport is clearly specified,” said Sven Giegold, Germany’s new influential state secretary for economic affairs in the ministry of climate change. In a land where the rule of law matters, Habeck also sees a way to kill the project: “The aim of the laws is to prevent monopolies and dependencies. The network and operations must be separate for this pipeline as well, and that is not the case. There was a lot of political pressure under the last federal government to approve Nord Stream 2. Even so, it is not in operation. The Federal Network Agency will check the documents in accordance with the law – as it should do”. Benjamin L Schmitt, a former US state department energy official and senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Gazprom had not been cashing in by providing additional volumes through the Belarus, Poland or Ukrainian route, in a possible bid to strong-arm the regulator. “They have ample pipeline capacity that they could be using right now, but they are not. They have not broken their contracts, but nor have they followed normal market dynamics by booking additional capacity.” A mother of all legal battles awaits, and in the meantime, the suitcase without the handle awaits its fate. • This article was amended on 23 December 2021 to describe the port of Mukran as a works hub rather than the point of landfall for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. It was further amended on 24 December 2021 to include the full name and role of Benjamin L Schmitt, not Schmidt as it was spelt in an earlier version."

          "bodyText": "The federal government will pay a traditional owners corporation representing some of the poorest communities in Australia more than $2m after settling a class action that argued the remote “work for the dole” program was racist. The Community Development Program (CDP) has required about 30,000 jobseekers in remote communities to work up to 25 hours a week to receive the dole. Participants, 80% of whom were Aboriginal, were said to have faced tougher welfare penalties than those in other parts of Australia. After sustained criticism from Indigenous leaders who claimed the program was racist and even “modern-day slavery”, Western Australia’s Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku and the Ngaanyatjarra council launched a class action in 2019 on behalf of 680 CDP participants. Following a year of confidential mediation, orders issued this month by the federal court Justice Richard White officially approved the settlement, revealing the government will pay $2m to the Ngaanyatjarra council. The court said the council “represents the interests of around 2,000 Ngaanyatjarra, Pintupi and Pitjantjatjara Traditional Owners (Yarnangu) who reside in the Ngaanyatjarra Communities”. It said it intended to use the money for an infrastructure program and an arts project at Warburton, the largest community in the area. The government also agreed to redesign the CDP scheme for jobseekers in the 10 communities covered by the class action. Without referencing the case, the Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, announced in the May budget that the government would overhaul the entire CDP. The government made no admission or concession of legal liability, while the class action members waived the right to recoup lost welfare payments or damages. The government will also pay the applicants’ costs, worth $278,897.19. Families and lives ‘upended’ The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku president, Damien McLean, who led the action, said the government’s decision to overhaul the program was very welcome. He said the CDP program had been “just terrible”. “For communities with high costs of living and high levels of poverty, it was very difficult, very stressful,” McLean said. “That’s why we’re glad the commonwealth has had a good look at it and seen the problems it is causing.” He said the CDP required people to be “punished”, which “upended their families and their lives”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The class action represented 10 remote Aboriginal communities who told the court their residents’ per capita income was the lowest on mainland Australia. They alleged the CDP breached sections 9, 10 and 13 of the Racial Discrimination Act. The class action argued it was tougher for those in the Ngaanyatjarra communities to meet their obligations due to “remoteness of their communities, their low levels of education and literacy, and other aspects of their socio-economic status”. The communities, based in sparsely populated land near the Northern Territory and South Australia borders, first raised concerns about the program to the Australian Human Rights Commission in 2016. They filed a lawsuit when mediation at the commission failed. It is the second time in 12 months the Morrison government has settled a class action over claims its welfare programs were unlawful, after it reached a $1.8bn deal over the robodebt scandal in June. The CDP followed a similar trajectory to that scandal, with the government steadfast for years despite sustained criticism from Aboriginal leaders, the Australian National Audit Office, a former Liberal Aboriginal affairs minister and even the government’s own review, which found 36% of participants said their communities were worse off under the scheme. Northern Territory Labor MP Chansey Paech labelled the CDP “modern-day slavery” in 2018, while John Paterson of the Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory called in 2019 for the CDP to be abandoned and replaced with a “positive Aboriginal-led model”. No guarantee of recouping individual payments The CDP was introduced in 2015 by the Coalition government and contracted organisations, including the Ngaanyatjarra council, to run employment services for jobseekers in remote areas under the scheme. It soon sparked outrage, with analysis showing a 740% increase in financial penalties for jobseekers compared to the previous remote job and communities program. CDP participants who failed to meet their mutual obligations requirements – such as work for the dole activities, job search or meetings with an employment services provider – had their payments docked by $50 a day. Repeated “non-compliance” could result in eight weeks without any payments. Crucially, analysis by Australian National University researchers found people in remote areas were 25 times more likely to face these penalties than those in non-remote areas. In its orders handed down this month, the federal court noted that the 680 CDP participants involved in the class action had lost $1,291,438 in welfare income, or an average of $1,793.29 a person. Taking into account the class action group definition of the lawsuit, however, the court said “the probable total” that group members could have tried to claim back was $534,628.77, an average of $786.22. Explaining his decision to approve the settlement, White said “the potential recovery for each group member … would, while no doubt significant for that group member, be modest”. There were also “risks” or “even the probability” many would not be able to make out the case they should be paid back by the government, he added. White said there was “extensive community engagement in the mediation process” which gave him confidence of “wide community support” for the settlement. McLean told Guardian Australia recouping lost welfare payments for the class action members “wasn’t on the table”. “That would have required the commonwealth to agree that the program had been discriminatory, which they insisted it hadn’t been,” he said. “Recovering individual payments … would have required a very long court action … And there would be no guarantee of success anyway.” Indigenous affairs minister, Ken Wyatt, said in May the program would be replaced by a new remote jobs program in 2023 following a re-design. The Shire of Ngaanyatjarraku is among the sites hosting a trial of the new program, which is voluntary and will see people in work-like placements receive supplementary payments of up to $190. Wyatt’s office was approached for comment."

          "headline": "‘I thought everyone should be as obsessive as I was’: Eddie Jones on 5am alarms and staying hungry",
          "bodyText": "Eddie Jones laughs when I ask him if he has ever tried therapy. Turns out I’m not the only one who has suggested it. Jones recently hired a forensic psychiatrist to work with his coaching team on their communication skills. “I don’t have therapy with her,” he says, “but I think sometimes she thinks I should.” I’m surprised he hasn’t tried. Jones’s new book, Leadership, shows how he roams through conversations with football, cricket, basketball and Australian rules football coaches, multinational chief executives, investment bankers, acting coaches and school teachers looking for every last little nugget that might make him a better coach. Jones is restlessly obsessive about it. If the book has a single line that seems to sum him up, it’s this: “The only reliable advantage we’ve got in life, in business or sport, is to learn faster than the opposition.” He spends a lot of time trying to find the edge that will help him do exactly that. Jones sits down to start work at 5am each morning. It has, he says, been a long time since he got his eight hours of decent sleep. “I normally get four or five, then, maybe, have a nap later in the day.” But early morning “is the best time of the day for thinking, mate, you’re uninterrupted, you don’t have things buzzing, or clicking”. Unless you’re working for him. Then you can expect to get dawn emails and WhatsApp messages. “Have a look at this? What do you think?” He says he’s got better at this. He doesn’t expect immediate responses any more. “In the old days I used to go around putting notes under people’s doors. “That’s a thing I’ve got to understand,” Jones goes on to say. “When I first started coaching I thought everyone should be as driven, and as obsessive, as I was. Now I understand that people have their own rhythms.” Not everyone who has worked with him will agree. England have churned through a lot of assistant coaches and support staff since Jones took over. He sounds like an exacting boss. One former employee, who moved on from his job in Jones’s first year, once described it as like working for Napoleon, only, he guessed, with more swearing. In Leadership, Jones mentions a lot of other coaches. He is good friends with Celtic’s Ange Postecoglou and the basketball coach Brian Goorjian, has regular conversations with Gareth Southgate, David Moyes and Dave Brailsford. It’s interesting that he doesn’t mention Trevor Bayliss since he and Jones took over English national teams at the same time, and in similar circumstances. They are similar ages and from the same part of the world, New South Wales. They even used to play Grade cricket against each other in the 1980s. “We caught up three or four times during his tenure,” says Jones, who already knows where I’m going with the question. For all their similarities, he and Bayliss couldn’t be more different in their approaches to coaching. Bayliss was so laidback as England head coach that when he left the post the English press gave him a Yucca plant, a scented candle and a CD of ambient music. “Trevor was one of those guys who sat back and smelled the environment, and then gave it whatever he thought it needed,” Jones says. The reason it worked so well, he reckons, was because of Bayliss’s partnership with his assistant, Paul Farbrace. “They were a great combination. Farbrace was energetic and direct with the team, while Trevor sat back and created a good environment.” So does Jones have a sidekick to work with? He goes back to Steve Borthwick. “He was a great right-hand man.” But Borthwick left England last year. “Recently?” he says, “the last four or five years, I’ve been lucky to have Neil Craig.” Craig is interesting. He is the Rugby Football Union’s head of high performance, has a background in Aussie rules and cycling. By his own admission, he doesn’t know a whole lot about rugby. In the book Jones says Craig’s role is “to tell the truth and also to help me coach the coaches”. Craig is the one who pulls Jones up on his behaviour. “Sometimes we’ll finish a meeting and he’ll say: ‘Maybe you went a bit hard there.’ And I listen to him, and I take advice from him.” At 61, Jones says, he’s still maturing as a coach. “And he’s helped me no end.” There is a fascinating little video interview with Matt Giteau on YouTube in which he talks about how Eddie is “still someone that scares me” 15 years after they last worked together. He talks about him with a mix of love, loyalty, fear and respect. Back when Jones was coaching Japan, he used to wonder why some of the players were so reluctant to speak up in meetings. It was only later that he realised, and after the team psychologist pointed it out, that it was because they were intimidated by him. If Jones has softened since, he’s still hard enough. If you want to understand Jones, the way he works and why he succeeds, you need to know where he comes from. He believes that himself. Listen to him describe the differences between him and Bayliss: “He was a country boy and I was from the city. He’s laconic and I’m much more aggressive. I want to run the show.” So how does Jones’s own upbringing shape him? “Mine’s probably pretty obvious. I was half-Japanese, half-Australian in a white Australian society where, if you weren’t good at sport, you weren’t considered to be worthy of the group, and I wanted to be part of the group,” he says. “I was little, and I looked different, but I wanted to be good at sport, so I had to find a way. I didn’t have any athletic gifts, so I became a competitor. I fought.” He is still fighting to prove himself now. It’s one of the reasons he took on the England job, and why he’s still tickled, six years later, by the idea of an Australian running the England team. “I think it is bloody fascinating, because this is the home of rugby and Australia is, or at least was, seen as an outpost.” It’s also why Jones says his favourite moments in coaching are the ones “when everyone thinks you’re an idiot, everyone thinks they know better than you”. It’s an interesting way of putting it. I’m not sure anyone who’s ever spoken to Jones would describe him as an idiot. “But we’re involved in something that everyone thinks they know,” he says. “One of the great examples, we had Roy Hodgson in the last Six Nations. He’s 74, he came into dinner and his first statement was: ‘Boys, I’m still trying to work out what a good coach is.’ And I think that’s so true. Everyone thinks they know, but the people who are really involved in this business, we know that we don’t. And I think that keeps driving me.” That, and the feeling he gets in those last few moments before kick-off. “That’s the elixir, that bit where you’re never quite sure what’s going to happen, it is the thing that keeps you in it.” He had it again before England played South Africa in the autumn. “We’ve got four young blokes on the bus and they don’t know what the game is going to be like, we’ve prepared, we’ve talked to them, the senior players have talked to them, but you actually don’t know how they’re going to handle it.” He is addicted to the bit that’s still beyond his control. *** The book comes at an interesting time, after England finished fifth in this year’s Six Nations. Jones has been preoccupied with figuring out what went wrong and how to put it right. His answer is characteristic. He thinks some of his squad started to feel entitled. It happens, he says. “You take over a team when they’re not doing well. You come in, you’ve got this great energy, and you find the other people who have the sort of same energy, same desire, same mentality, and if you say the right things, and get the right picture in their heads, then you create a winning team. And as soon as you win – and this has happened in every team I’ve had – then people don’t want to work as hard.” So the process starts again. Only second time around it’s harder “because you’ve got to get rid of those same players who have been successful for you. And they’re still really good players, but they don’t have that same mentality, that fight.” Jones dropped a number of senior players – George Ford, Mako and Billy Vunipola – from his squad for the autumn internationals. Will he pick them again? “We’ll just wait and see. Again, it’s about their mentality, if they want to keep improving, want to keep getting better, and are prepared to do those hard yards. They are the things we need to see.” Entitlement isn’t just an English problem, he says, “but I think maybe there are factors here that exacerbate it. If you’re an England rugby player here and you play a couple of Tests you’ll never have to worry about playing top-level rugby again. There’s 13 professional teams so you can find a spot somewhere and keep playing.” The great teams are the ones who keep winning year after year. “It’s rare because teams get comfortable. They want to settle. That’s the hardest thing to keep driving.” Jones believes conflict is healthy. “I think I understand that it’s the only way you keep winning,” he says. “Because whenever you’re comfortable, everyone wants to take a short cut, don’t they?” Again he goes back to his past. “My father left school when he was 15 to work in a coalmine, so I’ve had a much easier life than he’s had, and my daughter has had a much easier life than I’ve had. Every life gets easier, that’s how it is, because we want life to be comfortable. But to achieve things that take effort outside of that is uncomfortable.” Jones is always looking for the balance between supporting his players and staff, and challenging them, between making them feel at ease, and making them feel on edge. I know from my own small experience of his charity work that Jones can also be tremendously kind and thoughtful. One of the solutions to England’s entitlement problem, Jones says, was to change the leadership group, but he has stayed loyal to his captain, Owen Farrell, who he describes as a “glue player” in the squad. Jones says he had to change the leadership group because of the salary-cap scandal at Saracens. He is now trying to build a smaller and more diverse leadership team but create more leadership in the squad outside that group too. “It’s almost like rugby used to be,” he says, “you had a group of leaders, the captain, and vice-captain, but basically most of the leadership was done by the team. And that’s where I see ourselves evolving.” Jones has a soft spot for players who he feels have similar backgrounds to his own. “I like the guys that have come up the tougher way, who maybe don’t fit the stereotype, who have got to keep battling, have got to keep proving themselves, because they’re the loyal players. They’re doing it because they want to be good, not for someone else.” And of course he sees some of that in Farrell. The book makes it clear he’s invested in him as a captain, but also that he has room for improvement. He describes Farrell as a “developing” captain, even though he has already led England in 34 Tests, and says he needs to get better at managing relationships with referees. “When you grow up in a tough environment those softer skills aren’t so appreciated, so you don’t tend to develop them. I think the big thing that’s changed in society and in sport is the way you talk to people. That ability to be robust but also to be empathetic is so important in today’s society.” Can you teach empathy? “You can learn it, definitely,” Jones says. And here he is talking from experience. “The one thing we know is that unless as coaches we model that it is going to be hard for the players to have it. There’s no doubt it’s such a more important skill to have now. Whether you call it emotional intelligence or empathy, you need to have it – you can’t be that blunt bloke who comes in and doesn’t worry about people’s feelings, that just doesn’t work. You need to learn to be in other people’s shoes, and to understand what they’re thinking much more. You can definitely learn that. “But I don’t know whether I’m a good teacher of it or not mate.” And he cackles again. Leadership by Eddie Jones is out now (Pan Macmillan, £20), and was co-written with the Guardian’s Donald McRae"

          "headline": "‘He keeps coming back for more’: Matt Hancock’s rapid return to the fray",
          "bodyText": "Considering how many parties they are alleged to have held, Boris Johnson and his government have recently seemed to be very short of friends. A national shortage of Downing Street defenders reached its nadir on 8 December, the morning after a video emerged of No 10 staff laughing and joking about “cheese and wine” at a “business meeting”. Even Sajid Javid, the health secretary, pulled out of a morning media round. Most people would understand Javid’s reticence. Still, there was one man Johnson could count on even at his lowest ebb, never mind that he had called that person “totally fucking hopeless” in a WhatsApp message last year: Matt Hancock. A couple of weeks later, Hancock would find himself dragged into the conflagration over possible parties and social gatherings in Downing Street when the Guardian published a picture of a No 10 garden gathering in May 2020. He admitted he had been in the garden on the evening in question but said it was “not clear” whether a man in the photo seen from behind, with close cropped hair, a dark blue suit and a familiar stance, was him. On 8 December, though, he was riding to the government’s rescue on Good Morning Britain. It was not an easy appearance for Hancock, who faced hostile questioning comparing the alleged party to his own breach of Covid regulations – the notorious kiss with his aide Gina Coladangelo, now his partner, that was captured on CCTV and led to his swift resignation in June. “I wish I could help you more but I can’t,” he said. “The prime minister wasn’t there, as far as we understand, if there was a party.” Whatever Johnson said about Hancock’s performance as a minister, you might imagine he now seemed very useful as a human shield. After such a nightmarish year, Hancock could be forgiven for lying low – and, indeed, has repeatedly been encouraged to do so. So what lies behind his decision to return to the fray? Some view his re-emergence as a kind of penance, indicating his determination to reinvent himself as a backbench heavyweight. Among those he has convinced of his seriousness is Labour’s Rupa Huq, who noted on Twitter that “one can disapprove of @MattHancock’s breaking of the rules” but cited his work with her on efforts to curb the abuse of politicians, and his dyslexia campaign. “I know he looks up to Theresa May,” the former Conservative MP Ben Howlett said. “He said to me that looking at what she’s doing, holding the government to account and using her years of experience, is very inspiring to him.” But while May pulls no punches, Hancock’s parliamentary interventions have largely been to congratulate the government on its competence, leaving others less persuaded that he has entirely abandoned his ministerial ambitions. “Doing the media round when the government is keeping ministers off the airwaves – it’s definitely something people in Downing Street will notice,” said Henry Hill, a news editor for the ConservativeHome website. “It’s perfectly possible to have a meaningful career on the backbenches, but that’s never been the route he’s chosen. I would put good money on his goal being a return to government.” * * * Hancock has always seemed to be a man in a hurry. Those who knew him in his days as a Cambridge master’s student remember a fairly flashy Jaguar and a tendency to drop friends in his hurry to climb the greasy pole. Now, too, he appears to be operating on fast-forward. His period of quiet reflection after his 27 June resignation ended on 7 September when he popped up in the House of Commons with a question in praise of the government’s furlough scheme. Rishi Sunak thought he was “absolutely right”. Hancock’s re-emergence into the full glare of media attention took a little longer – and then proceeded with an almost masochistic intensity. On 1 December he gave his first broadcast interview since his resignation, telling ITV’s Robert Peston: “I’d blown up every part of my life … I let a lot of people down.” The next week, the day before his appearance on Good Morning Britain, he gave an interview to Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on This Morning. While he might have expected that an elevenses sofa chat about his campaign to improve dyslexia screening at primary schools was safe enough territory – non-ideological, unimpeachably positive and underpinned by his own experience of the condition – he endured a jarring change of pace from Schofield: “Was it your dyslexia that meant you misread the social distancing rules?” On air, Hancock appeared ashen, pensive, humble. Off air, ITV staffers suggest, he was in a better mood, enthusiastically bumping elbows with anyone in range and hanging around after filming to chat, when as a minister he would have swiftly departed. “He almost seemed euphoric,” said one. “He didn’t seem to mind being the butt of the joke.” Another said he came across as “nervous, but bouncy … There was a sense of – he’d got the difficult stuff out of the way, and now he’s back.” After the brutal realities of responsibility for the nation’s health during a once-in-a-generation pandemic, and a humiliating personal crisis that led to the end of his marriage, Hancock seemed to feel “now, suddenly, you’re free … I didn’t have the impression that he was wishing he was health secretary at all.” Whatever else, nobody could accuse Hancock of lacking the optimism to overcome experience. In August he announced that he would run the London marathon, only for his sponsorship page to be swamped by punters willing to give a minimum donation of £2 to St Nicholas Hospice Care to insult him. (“I hope your charity vest gives you nipple chafe,” wrote Alan Hamburgers, who gift-aided his contribution.) Still, Hancock got in shape, raised nearly £8,000 and came home in under four hours despite heckles from what he called a “small but noisy group of anti-vaxxers”. In September he posted a comeback video from Haverhill, Suffolk, in which he smiled sadly through a series of observations that might have applied equally to the global pandemic or his own defenestration. “We’ve got through it, haven’t we? And now we’re coming out the other side,” he told one constituent, before leaning on a fast-food counter like the last barfly at closing time and telling a man trying to cook burgers: “It’s nice to be out and about.” After a predictable quantity of internet derision, he deleted it. There was the surreal sight of him posing in stonewash jeans and rollneck on the red carpet of the Capital Jingle Bell Ball. There was the Daily Mail story in which he said “I have been approached to write a book”, only for the supposed publisher, HarperCollins, to issue an emphatic denial. A book summary leaked later gave the provisional title of The Race and explained that Hancock had led the UK to develop a vaccine “beating every country in the world”. Most painful, perhaps, was his announcement on 12 October that he had been offered a job at the UN Economic Commission for Africa (Uneca) as a special representative on financial innovation and climate change. The appointment was reportedly the result of representations made by the campaigner and government adviser Nimco Ali, a close friend of Carrie Johnson, to Uneca. Hancock retweeted congratulatory messages from her and 11 others before the offer was withdrawn on 16 October. While the reversal was ostensibly forced by a sudden realisation that Hancock was ineligible as a sitting MP, it came about after at least 64 NGO leaders and scholars expressed their displeasure, according to a list provided by Tian Johnson, the founder of the African Alliance for HIV Prevention. Johnson said he saw Hancock as “a disgraced politician whose competence has been questioned in his own country and who knows little about Africa”. Nick Dearden, the director of Global Justice Now, said he had been dismayed by the appointment. “People told me, we’ve lost this one, no way is it going to be withdrawn,” he said. “So the uproar must have been much more significant than people in the UN expected.” Through it all, even some of Hancock’s critics admit a certain grudging admiration. “I think there’s something wrong with him,” a bemused Labour MP said. “He just keeps coming back for more. He’s got what boxers would call a very good chin.” His allies, meanwhile, view his re-emergence as a story of redemption. “He’s still the same person,” said Rachel Hood, the chair of the West Suffolk Conservative Association. “Life’s not an exact science. Suffolk people are very nice – of course there are always dissenters, but when [the local party] looked at it all, we took the view that we would support him.” He had been a model constituency MP since then, she added, visiting a local prison literacy project and supporting a campaign to bring a cinema to Newmarket. If such efforts lack the epic scale of The Race, Hancock is unwilling to say that he yearns for the bigger stage. “He’s not in a rush,” said someone who worked with him in government. “He’s enjoying backbench life more than he expected.” Whatever the future holds, they added, he has significant support on the backbenches, particularly among the 2019 intake. MPs praised his responsiveness during the Covid crisis, and noted his keenness to be liked and respected by colleagues. But they were not always complimentary about his competence. And Tory strategists poured cold water on the idea of a cabinet return. One branded him a “total fantasist”. A second said while he had built up some credibility during the pandemic, Hancock was now seen as “a joke figure”. “There is currently no way back for him,” a veteran observer of the Conservative party said. “He has no real friends in parliament. No one owes him anything … A period of silence on his part would be welcomed by most of his colleagues.” If so, it appears they are unlikely to get their wish."

          "bodyText": "“Let us be reminded that before there is a final solution, there must be a first solution, a second one, even a third. The move toward a final solution is not a jump. It takes one step, then another, then another.” So began Toni Morrison’s 1995 address to Howard University, entitled Racism and Fascism, which delineated 10 step-by-step procedures to carry a society from first to last. Morrison’s interest was not in fascist demagogues or fascist regimes. It was rather in “forces interested in fascist solutions to national problems”. The procedures she described were methods to normalize such solutions, to “construct an internal enemy”, isolate, demonize and criminalize it and sympathizers to its ideology and their allies, and, using the media, provide the illusion of power and influence to one’s supporters. Morrison saw, in the history of US racism, fascist practices – ones that could enable a fascist social and political movement in the United States. Writing in the era of the “super-predator” myth (a Newsweek headline the next year read, “Superpredators: Should we cage the new breed of vicious kids?”), Morrison unflinchingly read fascism into the practices of US racism. Twenty-five years later, those “forces interested in fascist solutions to national problems” are closer than ever to winning a multi-decade national fight. The contemporary American fascist movement is led by oligarchical interests for whom the public good is an impediment, such as those in the hydrocarbon business, as well as a social, political, and religious movement with roots in the Confederacy. As in all fascist movements, these forces have found a popular leader unconstrained by the rules of democracy, this time in the figure of Donald Trump. My father, raised in Berlin under the Nazis, saw in European fascism a course that any country could take. He knew that US democracy was not exceptional in its capacity to resist the forces that shattered his family and devastated his youth. My mother, a court stenographer in US criminal courts for 44 years, saw in the anti-Black racism of the American legal system parallels to the vicious antisemitism she experienced in her youth in Poland, attitudes which enabled eastern European complicity with fascism. And my grandmother, Ilse Stanley, wrote a memoir, published in 1957, of her experiences in 1930s Berlin, later appearing on the US television show This is Your Life to discuss it. It is a memoir of the normalization years of German fascism, well before world war and genocide. In it, she recounts experiences with Nazi officers who assured her that in nazism’s vilification of Jews, they certainly did not mean her. Philosophers have always been at the forefront in the analysis of fascist ideology and movements. In keeping with a tradition that includes the philosophers Hannah Arendt and Theodor Adorno, I have been writing for a decade on the way politicians and movement leaders employ propaganda, centrally including fascist propaganda, to win elections and gain power. Often, those who employ fascist tactics do so cynically – they do not really believe the enemies they target are so malign, or so powerful, as their rhetoric suggests. Nevertheless, there comes a tipping point, where rhetoric becomes policy. Donald Trump and the party that is now in thrall to him have long been exploiting fascist propaganda. They are now inscribing it into fascist policy. Fascist propaganda takes place in the US in already fertile ground – decades of racial strife has led to the United States having by far the highest incarceration rate in the world. A police militarized to address the wounds of racial inequities by violence, and a recent history of unsuccessful imperial wars have made us susceptible to a narrative of national humiliation by enemies both internal and external. As WEB Du Bois showed in his 1935 masterwork Black Reconstruction, there is a long history of business elites backing racism and fascism out of self-interest, to divide the working class and thereby destroy the labor movement. The novel development is that a ruthless would-be autocrat has marshalled these fascist forces and shaped them into a cult, with him as its leader. We are now well into the repercussions of this latter process – where fascist lies, for example, the “big lie” that the 2020 election was stolen, have begun to restructure institutions, notably electoral infrastructure and law. As this process unfolds, slowly and deliberately, the media’s normalization of these processes evokes Morrison’s tenth and final step: “Maintain, at all costs, silence.” Constructing an enemy To understand contemporary US fascism, it is useful to consider parallels to 20th century history, both where they succeed and where they fail. Hitler was a genocidal antisemite. Though fascism involves disregard for human life, not all fascists are genocidal. Even Nazi Germany turned to genocide only relatively late in the regime’s rule. And not all fascists are antisemitic. There were Italian Jewish fascists. Referring to the successful assimilation of Jews into all phases of Weimar era German life, my father warned me, “if they had chosen someone else, some of us would have been among the very best Nazis.” We American Jews feel firmly at home. Now, where the fascist movement’s internal enemies are leftists and movements for Black racial equality, there certainly could be fascist American Jews. Germany’s National Socialist party did not take over a mainstream party. It started as a small, radical, far-right anti-democratic party, which faced different pressures as it strove to achieve greater electoral success. Despite its radical start, the Nazi party dramatically increased its popularity over many years in part by strategically masking its explicit antisemitic agenda to attract moderate voters, who could convince themselves that the racism at the core of Nazi ideology was something the party had outgrown. It represented itself as the antidote to communism, using a history of political violence in the Weimar Republic, including street clashes between communists and the far right, to warn of a threat of violent communist revolution. It attracted support from business elites by promising to smash labor unions. The Nazis portrayed socialists, Marxists, liberals, labor unions, the cultural world and the media as representatives of, or sympathizers with, this revolution. Once in power, they bore down on this message. In his 1935 speech, Communism with its Mask Off, Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels described Bolshevism carrying “on a campaign, directed by the Jews, with the international underworld, against culture as such”. By contrast, “National Socialism sees in all these things – in [private] property, in personal values and in nation and race and the principles of idealism – these forces which carry on every human civilization and fundamentally determine its worth.” The Nazis recognized that the language of family, faith, morality and homeland could be used to justify especially brutal violence against an enemy represented as being opposed to all these things. The central message of Nazi politics was to demonize a set of constructed enemies, an unholy alliance of communists and Jews, and ultimately to justify their criminalization. Contrary to popular belief, the Nazi government of the 1930s was not genocidal, nor were its notorious concentration camps packed with Jewish prisoners, at least until the November pogrom of 1938. The main targets of the regime’s concentration camps were, initially, communists and socialists. The Nazi regime urged vigilante violence against its other targets, such as Jews, separating themselves from this violence by obscuring the role of agents of the state. During this time, it was possible for many non-Jewish Germans to deceive themselves about the brutal nature of the regime, to tell themselves that its harsh means were necessary to protect the German nation from the insidious threat of communism. Violent militias occupied an ambiguous role between state and non-state actors. The SS began as violent Nazi supporters, before becoming an independent arm of the government. The message of violent law and order created a culture that influenced all the Nazi state’s institutions. As Yale historian Timothy Snyder writes in On Tyranny, “for violence to transform not just the atmosphere but also the system, the emotions of rallies and the ideology of exclusion have to be incorporated into the training of armed guards.” In the US, the training of police as “warriors”, together with the unofficial replacement of the American flag by the thin blue line flag, augur poorly about the democratic commitments of this institution. For a far-right party to become viable in a democracy, it must present a face it can defend as moderate, and cultivate an ambiguous relationship to the extreme views and statements of its most explicit members. It must maintain a pretense of the rule of law, characteristically by projecting its own violations of it on to its opponents. In the case of the takeover of the mainstream rightwing party by a far-right anti-democratic movement, the pretense must be stronger. The movement must contend with members of that party who are faithful to procedural elements of democracy, such as the principle of one voter one vote, or that the loser of a fair election give up power – in the United States today, figures such as Adam Kinzinger and Elizabeth Cheney. A fascist social and political party faces pressure both to mask its connection to and to cultivate violent racist supporters, as well as its inherently anti-democratic agenda. In the face of the attack on the US capital on 6 January, even the most resolute skeptic must admit that Republican politicians have been at least attempting to cultivate a mass of violent vigilantes to support their causes. Kyle Rittenhouse is becoming a hero to Republicans after showing up in Kenosha, WI as an armed vigilante citizen, and killing two men. Perhaps there are not enough potential Kyle Rittenhouses in the US to justify fear of massive armed vigilante militias enforcing a 2024 election result demanded by Donald Trump. But denying that Trump’s party is trying to create such a movement is, at this point, deliberate deception. Black rebellion, white backlash Street violence proved invaluable to the National Socialists in their path to power. The Nazis instigated and exacerbated violence in the streets, then demonized their opponents as enemies of the German people who must be dealt with harshly. Trump’s rise followed Black protest, at times violent, of police brutality in Ferguson and Baltimore. More recently, the murder of George Floyd and a historic protest movement in the US in the late spring has given fuel to fascist misrepresentation. All of these recent developments take place as only the latest in a long US history of Black rebellion against white supremacist ideology and structures, and a parallel history of white backlash. White vigilante groups regularly formed in reaction to Black rebellions, to “defend their families and property against Black rebellion”, the historian Elizabeth Hinton writes in her recent history of these rebellions. Hinton shows that police often acted in concert with these groups. For decades, the instigator of these rebellions has typically been an incident or incidents of police violence against members of the community, following a long period of often violent over-policing that exacerbated these communities’ grievances. Street movements in the US have often been accompanied by vigorous campus protests, from the protests against the Vietnam war of the 1960s, to recent campus protests for racial justice that attracted media rebuke (paradoxically, for “chilling free speech”). Politicians in both parties have feasted on these moments, using them to troll for votes. During these episodes of protest and rebellion, US politicians from Barry Goldwater onwards, placing campus protests together with Black rebellion against over-policing, have encouraged harsh law and order policing and crackdowns on leftists. John Ehrlichman, one of Nixon’s top advisers, said that Nixon’s campaign and administration “had two enemies: the anti-war left and Black people”, and invented the drug war to target both: You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did. Politicians have shown less interest in addressing the underlying conditions that lead to violence in poor Black urban communities – the widespread availability of guns, the massive and persistent racial wealth gap and the effects of violent policing and mass incarceration. And why should they? As long as these underlying conditions persist, politicians of either party can run for office by milking fear and promising a harsh law and order response. Morrison’s 1995 address is a warning that these conditions are ripe for harnessing by a fascist movement, one targeting democracy itself. In its most recent iteration, in the form of the reaction against Black Lives Matter protesters and the demonization of antifa and student activists, a fascist social and political movement has been avidly stoking the flames for mass rightwing political violence, by justifying it against these supposed internal enemies. Rachel Kleinfeld, in an October 2021 article, documents the rise of the legitimation of political violence in the US. According to the article, the “bedrock idea uniting right-wing communities who condone violence is that white Christian men in the United States are under cultural and demographic threat and require defending – and that it is the Republican Party and Donald Trump, in particular, who will safeguard their way of life.” This kind of justification of political violence is classically fascist – a dominant group threatened by the prospect of gender, racial and religious equality turning to a leader who promises a violent response. How to topple a democracy We are now in fascism’s legal phase. According to the International Center for Not for Profit Law, 45 states have considered 230 bills criminalizing protest, with the threat of violent leftist and Black rebellion being used to justify them. That this is happening at the same time that multiple electoral bills enabling a Republican state legislature majority to overturn their state’s election have been enacted suggests that the true aim of bills criminalizing protest is to have a response in place to expected protests against the stealing of a future election (as a reminder of fascism’s historical connection to big business, some of these laws criminalize protest near gas and oil lines). The Nazis used Judeo-Bolshevism as their constructed enemy. The fascist movement in the Republican party has turned to critical race theory instead. Fascism feeds off a narrative of supposed national humiliation by internal enemies. Defending a fictional glorious and virtuous national past, and presenting its enemies as deviously maligning the nation to its children, is a classic fascist strategy to stoke fury and resentment. Using the bogeyman of critical race theory, 29 states have introduced bills to restrict teaching about racism and sexism in schools, and 13 states have enacted such bans. The key to democracy is an informed electorate. An electorate that knows about persisting racial injustice in the United States along all its dimensions, from the racial wealth gap to the effects of over-policing and over-incarceration, will be unsurprised by mass political rebellion in the face of persistent refusal to face up to these problems. An electorate ignorant of these facts will react not with understanding, but with uncomprehending fear and horror at Black political unrest. Sometimes, you trace a fascist movement to its genesis in Nazi influence on its leaders, as with India’s RSS. In the United States, the causal relations run the other way around. As James Whitman shows in his 2017 book, Hitler’s American Model: The United States and the Making of Nazi Race Law, the Jim Crow era in the United States influenced Nazi law. In 2021, legislators in 19 states passed laws making access to the ballot more difficult, some with specific (and clearly intentional) disparate impact on minority communities (as in Texas). By obscuring in our education system facts about this era, one can mask the reemergence of legislation that borrows from its strategies. Indeed, the very tactic of restricting politically vital information to schoolchildren is itself borrowed from the Jim Crow era. Chapter 9 of Carter G Woodson’s 1933 book, The Mis-Education of the Negro, is called Political Education Neglected. In it, Woodson describes how history was taught “to enslave the Negroes’ mind”, by whitewashing the brutality of slavery and the actual roots and causes of racial disparities. In Fugitive Pedagogy: Carter G Woodson and the Art of Black Teaching, Jarvis Givens documents the strategies Black educators used to convey real history in the constricted environments of Jim Crow schools, strategies that, tragically, will again become necessary for educators to take up again today. Fascist ideology strictly enforces gender roles and restricts the freedom of women. For fascists, it is part of their commitment to a supposed “natural order” where men are on top. It is also integral to the broader fascist strategy of winning over social conservatives who might otherwise be unhappy with the endemic corruption of fascist rule. Far-right authoritarian leaders across the world, such as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, Hungary’s Viktor Orbán, and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, have targeted “gender ideology”, as nazism targeted feminism. Freedom to choose one’s role in society, when it goes against a supposed “natural order”, is a kind of freedom fascism has always opposed. According to National Socialist ideology, abortion, at any point in pregnancy, was considered to be murder. Just as it was acceptable to murder disabled people and other groups whose identities were considered dangerous to the health of the “Aryan race”, it was acceptable to perform abortions on members of these groups. In the first six years of Nazi rule, from 1933 to 1939, there was a harsh crackdown on the birth control movement. Led by the Gestapo, there was a punitive campaign against doctors who performed abortions on Aryan women. The recent attack on abortion rights, and the coming attack on birth control, led by a hard-right supreme court, is consistent with the hypothesis that we are, in the United States, facing a real possibility of a fascist future. If you want to topple a democracy, you take over the courts. Donald Trump lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in 2016 by almost 3m votes, and yet has appointed one-third of supreme court, three youthful far-right judges who will be spending decades there. The Roberts court has for more than a decade consistently enabled an attack on democracy, by hollowing out the Voting Rights Act over time, unleashing unlimited corporate money into elections, and allowing clearly partisan gerrymanders of elections. There is every reason to believe that the court will allow even the semblance of democracy to crumble, as long as laws are passed by gerrymandered Republican statehouses that make anti-democratic practices, including stealing elections, legal. There has been a growing fascist social and political movement in the United States for decades. Like other fascist movements, it is riddled with internal contradictions, but no less of a threat to democracy. Donald Trump is an aspiring autocrat out solely for his own power and material gain. By giving this movement a classically authoritarian leader, Trump shaped and exacerbated it, and his time in politics has normalized it. Donald Trump has shown others what is possible. But the fascist movement he now leads preceded him, and will outlive him. As Toni Morrison warned, it feeds off ideologies with deep roots in American history. It would be a grave error to think it cannot ultimately win. • This article was amended on 22 December 2021 to correct a misspelling of Theodor Adorno’s first name as “Theodore” and on 27 December 2021 to correct a misspelling of Rachel Kleinfeld’s surname as “Kleinfield”."

          "bodyText": "As the US supreme court prepares to decide a case that could deny women the right to abortion in much of the US, Latin American activists like me are holding our collective breaths. The continent has some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the world, in spite of recent progressive reforms in the past decade in countries including Uruguay and Argentina. The end of Roe v Wade would deliver a frightening message throughout the region. El Salvador’s courts have sentenced women who have had a miscarriage to 30 years in prison – treating an obstetric emergency as an abortion. In Honduras, where abortion is already illegal in all circumstances, congress amended the constitution to state that life starts at conception. Against this dismal legal backdrop, Roe v Wade has long been a source of inspiration to women in Latin America fighting for their basic rights. It has given us a strategic model as well as strong legal arguments against constitutional obstacles. Like women in the US, we have taken our cases to court, sometimes securing significant and progressive gains in the last decade. In Colombia, the constitutional court ruled in 2006 that women could have an abortion in cases involving rape or incest, when it posed a risk to the pregnant person’s life or health or when the foetus was diagnosed with severe malformations. In Brazil, the supreme court in 2012 authorised abortion if a foetus is found to have anencephaly, a condition that leads to miscarriage, or death in the first weeks of life. And the court is considering another case that could decriminalise all abortions in the first 12 weeks. Most recently, the Mexican supreme court declared the criminalisation of abortion unconstitutional and mandated that state legislatures across the country act on that ruling. In all of these cases, activists drew on the arguments in Roe v Wade for their successful litigation strategy and judges cited the landmark case and related rulings in making their decisions. If the US state of Mississippi succeeds in overturning Roe v Wade after nearly 50 years, we will lose this crucial legal precedent and endanger progress on reproductive rights throughout Latin America. Just this month, the Brazilian senate approved the nomination of a conservative Christian pastor to the country’s supreme court. President Jair Bolsonaro’s choice is expected to oppose expanding abortion rights. One glimmer of hope for Americans is the US Food and Drug Administration’s decision last week to permanently lift restrictions on the abortion pill. This reaffirms that Latin American activists have long made the right choice to bet on self-managed abortion for ensuring access while waiting for rights to be granted through the legislative process. Funders must now expand their support for these direct action strategies throughout the Americas. But few are willing to associate their names with an issue as stigmatised as abortion, which means financial backing is scarce for activists working to expand rights and access. Philanthropists in the US have been fundamental to our success, and they will most likely want to redirect their funding to American organisations if the era of Roe v Wade does come to an end. They would be right to do so, but it would be a mistake to turn away from organisations and activists in other parts of the world that have made so much progress. Emboldened by anti-gender movements, powerful forces have swept Latin America, Europe and Africa, seeking to undermine the quest for greater sexual and reproductive freedom – particularly access to abortion and birth control – for the women who are least likely to advocate for themselves. We cannot fight them alone. Funding community-based self-managed abortion initiatives in countries where access is highly restricted may be the only way to save women’s lives while we battle repressive policies on multiple fronts across the global south. It may require funders to be less prescriptive in supporting our reproductive justice struggles, and to trust local advocates and the solutions we propose. Doing so will make clear that the lives of women matter, no matter who we are or where we live. We may lose Roe, but never the commitment to our fight. • Mariana Prandini Assis is an Aspen New Voices Fellow and a Brazilian human rights lawyer, researcher and activist"

          "bodyText": "If there had been a popularity contest at Cop26, the Costa Rican president, Carlos Alvarado Quesada, would have been a clear winner. Leonardo DiCaprio, Jeff Bezos, Boris Johnson and Prince William all wanted to speak with the leader of the tiny Central American country, eager to bask in its green glow. The climate summit in Glasgow was, in effect, Costa Rica’s Super Bowl, another chance to show off its impressive environmental credentials. It is the only tropical country that has successfully halted and reversed deforestation, a commitment dozens of others made at Cop26 but are far from achieving. Costa Rica, which celebrated its bicentenary in 2021, is aiming for total decarbonisation by 2050 – not just a net zero target – and is helping lead the world on efforts to protect 30% of the Earth by the end of this decade. From Christiana Figueres, who was head of the UN climate convention that achieved the Paris agreement in 2015, to Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, chief executive of the Global Environment Facility, Costa Ricans are routinely found in international leadership positions on the environment. Alvarado was proud of Costa Rica’s record when he spoke with the Guardian in early 2021. But in his final interview at Cop26, after an exhausting schedule, Alvarado cautioned that his country’s example should not be taken as a blueprint for others to follow. “The Costa Rican example ought not to be taken literally. Take whatever is good that we have, but also adapt it locally. The thing about our example is the possibility of change and not the particular change itself,” he said. “We have seen the world make global decisions in Glasgow but we cannot be tempted by the idea that they can be a one size fits all solution.” In October, Costa Rica was among the five inaugural Earthshot prize winners for its policy to pay citizens to protect standing forest and restore ecosystems. The scheme is credited with helping reverse one of the worst deforestation rates in the world at the time by altering the cost of clearing trees for coffee, banana and pineapple plantations, recognising that forests are worth more alive than dead. The policy has led to an ecotourism boom. But Alvarado, who is coming to the end of his term as president, does not want to stop there. He acknowledges Costa Rica is “green – but not blue”, prompting the announcement at Cop26 of his country’s involvement in a vast new marine-protected area. “The more we provide an example, the more moral and political leverage there is for others to follow. That’s our approach,” he says. In Glasgow, Denmark and Costa Rica launched the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance (Boga) to speed up the end of the fossil fuel industry, attracting intense media attention. While the initiative was set up by a small group of countries that had already committed to phasing out fossil fuels, it is hoped a coalition of the willing can translate into global change. Andrea Meza, Costa Rica’s environment minister who helped announce Boga, says winning the Earthshot prize was a moment of national unity akin to winning a football match. She underscores the importance of combining the inherent value of nature with financial realities to ensure its protection, along with environmental education for all citizens. “What we have learned from the Costa Rican case is that you need to put nature in as part of your development model. It’s not about development and protecting nature. It’s understanding that nature needs to be part of the kind of development that you want. We understood that,” she says. “After one or two generations, you’ll see the change. We can see the different species: the sloth, the hummingbird … and we feel proud.” Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow biodiversity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features • This article was amended on 22 December 2021 to correct the surname of President Alvarado."

On Thursday, modelling from the University of NSW and cited by NSW health minister Brad Hazzard found Covid-19 cases in the state could reach 25,000 a day by the end of January. The latest modelling to raise alarm bells came from the Doherty Institute and was leaked to the media on Tuesday after being sent to politicians ahead of a meeting of national cabinet on Wednesday. It said Australia could see 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January or early February. Early into the pandemic in 2020, other models predicted “hundreds of thousands” of Australian deaths, while health workers in NSW were told to prepare for 8,000 deaths in the first wave. But these are worst-case scenario models and are just one scenario out of dozens of different scenarios that are calculated by epidemiologists and biostatisticians. What is often lost in the reporting of these worst-case models is that they rarely ever eventuate but are calculated to allow governments to see what might happen if they did nothing at all to control an outbreak, and to plan accordingly. The leaked Doherty Institute modelling projecting 200,000 cases came with an important caveat: this would only eventuate if nothing was done, including if people did not change their behaviour at all of their own accord. It also assumed no change to the pace of booster rollouts, and that only very basic restrictions, such as requiring masks in hospitals, were maintained. But already, people are changing their behaviour in states like NSW where mask mandates for retail don’t exist, wearing masks anyway to shopping centres or cancelling bookings for crowded venues. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (Atagi) is constantly reviewing data on boosters and adjusting its recommendations accordingly. What doesn’t make headlines are the other less worrying scenarios depicted by the Doherty Institute and other institutions that project what may happen if, for example, masks are worn, vaccines prove to offer fair protection against variants, or data changes on the reproduction rate of the virus. There is no one model or scenario experts rely upon, and models are constantly tweaked as more information is gathered about the virus. Ahead of national cabinet meeting on Wednesday the chair of the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, Prof Paul Kelly, said the 200,000 figure “presents one of the worst case of all potential scenarios including assumptions that the Omicron variant is as severe as the Delta variant, an absence of hospital surge capacity, a highly limited booster program, no change to baseline public health and social measures and an absence of spontaneous behaviour change in the face of rising case numbers”. “None of these five assumptions represent the likely state of events, let alone all of them together, therefore presenting that scenario as the likely scenario that will occur is highly misleading.” The problem is that when parts of reports leak ahead of time, the most concerning picture, rather than the full story, is often presented. Chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, Prof Adrian Esterman, said epidemiologists now model by creating individuals with certain ages, occupations, social movements and other characteristics. It’s known as agent-based modelling, and it is used by the Doherty Institute. “They then do this a million times, each person with slightly different characteristics, then they simulate what happens when all of these individuals interact,” Esterman said. “To do that, they not only have to enter all these details about each individual person, they have to add in the things like the generation interval of the virus, its incubation period, its effective reproduction number as well. “And the point is, every single one of those things is an estimate, and is subject to change. So we now have dozens and dozens of parameters in the model, each of which are estimates creating ‘what if’ scenarios. “Taken together, these different scenarios help governments aim for the best but plan for the worst. But they are only estimates, never certainties.”"

          "bodyText": "Olympic and Paralympic sports will benefit from an unprecedented quarter-of-a-billion-dollar windfall in the buildup to the 2024 Paris Games after the Australian Institute of Sport and the federal government revealed a new long-term funding model for elite sport. The AIS announced on Wednesday it will, through government support, commit $257m over the next three years in an attempt to capitalise on Australia’s successful campaign in Tokyo earlier this year. It is the first time funds have been allocated for a full Games cycle, removing the uncertainty sports had previously faced on 12-month plans. The new model is not based on rewarding success from the Tokyo Games, the AIS CEO, Peter Conde, said, but rather a commitment to build towards Paris and beyond – with a home Games looming in Brisbane in 2032. Several sports stand to benefit from cash increases, notably women’s football and the Matildas, who will receive just over $1.9m over the next three years dedicated specifically to the football tournament in Paris, after Sam Kerr’s team fell just short of winning a medal in Tokyo. Canoeing, women’s rugby sevens, rowing, surfing and skateboarding are among the other sports also set for sizeable increases. The women’s sevens program will jump 39% to an annual total of $2.5m, while surfing will get a 30% increase to $2m a year. Para and able-bodied canoeing increases to $7.15m a year, while rowing will get $10.055m. “This funding commitment is made possible because of the belief and confidence the Australian government and the AIS has in Australian sport,” Conde said. “The Tokyo Olympic Games and Paralympic Games inspired us all and we have worked with government to secure longer-term funding to forward plan and continue building on that success. This is why we are now launching an even stronger platform for Paris. “This additional high performance funding for the 2024 Games is in addition to $14.6m a year in direct athlete grants being provided leading into Paris, as well as the $82.2m allocated in the 2021 federal budget to fund wellbeing programs and extend performance pathways to develop our champions of the future. “This overall commitment to high-performance sport furthers the aim of the National High Performance Sport Strategy to create conditions for sustainable success, not only for Paris, but Los Angeles 2028 and our home Games in Brisbane in 2032.” The new funding is in addition to existing direct athlete grants ($14.6m) and the government’s $82.2m wellbeing and future athlete package, which has already led to increased investment in sports including softball, baseball, gymnastics, women’s hockey, men’s football and rugby sevens. “Through this commitment by the federal government and via a collaborative process with the AIS, sports are enabled to build their plans in advance for a full summer Games cycle, with funding right through until the end of 2024,” the minister for sport, Richard Colbeck, said. “This will be the first time that sports have received funding certainty so far out from an Olympic and Paralympic Games, and we’re proud to have made that commitment to building sustainable success for our high-performance athletes and their support teams.”"

          "headline": "‘A moral issue to correct’: the long tail of Elena Ceaușescu’s fraudulent scientific work ",
          "bodyText": "Romanian researchers have called on academic publishers to remove Elena Ceaușescu’s name from almost two dozen scientific papers and books fraudulently published as her work, more than 30 years after the wife of the former communist dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu was executed. Elena Ceaușescu was celebrated by state propaganda under her husband’s regime as a world-famous chemistry researcher, despite having no credible qualifications. The researchers say some of her work is still being cited and accessed, even though she was barely literate in science and unable to recognise basic formulas taught to first-year chemistry students. They also want Ceaușescu’s honorary titles, awards and PhD to be revoked, and for institutions that honoured her – including the UK’s Royal Society of Chemistry and the Polytechnic of Central London (now the University of Westminster) – to withdraw recognition and acknowledge that her scientific career was bogus. Her PhD was never retracted in Romania, even though it was widely known she did not write it. Chris Isloi, a neuroscience and psychology researcher based in London, and Andrei Dumbravă, a doctor and senior lecturer at the Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Iași, are leading the call to have the scientific record corrected. But Isloi says it is proving difficult “since no academic publishers ever wrote their publishing guidelines anticipating an author might be a communist dictator’s illiterate wife”. The Ceaușescus were executed on Christmas Day 1989 after Romania’s attempt to follow the other countries of eastern Europe in a peaceful overthrow of their regimes descended into bloodshed that ultimately allowed former communists to retain power under the guise of democracy. Craving for legitimacy Elena Ceaușescu’s claim to scientific status was driven by her own desire for prestige and Romania’s curious position as the communist state most indulged by the west, despite the crushing brutality of the regime. Nicolae Ceaușescu came to power in 1965 and won praise in the west for opposing the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia three years later. In 1969, Richard Nixon visited Bucharest, the first US president to set foot in a communist country. Ceaușescu was invited to the White House in 1970 and 1978, and in the same year was the first communist head of state to visit London. Margaret Thatcher, herself a qualified chemist, visited Bucharest in 1975 as opposition leader and was received by the Ceaușescus, then met them again on the 1978 visit, a year before her first election victory. But at home he drove the Romanian economy into the ground, presided over an appalling human rights record, cut funding for science and medicine, and constructed a shameless personality cult around himself. “They were hard times,” Dumbravă says. “It’s always complicated to tell the whole story for people who never experienced any kind of totalitarianism. “It was a world in which everything was dictated to you,” he said. “The efforts of the Ceaușescus to pay off foreign debt meant they wanted to avoid any imports which required currency … Everything from oranges to bananas disappeared … And everything was under strict control. You could not sacrifice a cow in your village. It was illegal. You could go to prison if you got caught with some meat.” Isloi believes the Ceaușescus’ craving for international recognition and legitimacy was the reason Elena’s scientific credentials were raised to such heights, but her connection to chemistry research began well before Nicolae came to power. Her biographer Lavinia Betea, a professor and historian at the University of Arad, says holding the title of scientist legitimised Nicolae Ceaușescu’s “rise as a leader of the intellectual elite”. “The Ceaușescus never needed money again after Nicolae Ceaușescu was appointed general secretary of the Communist party in 1965,” Betea says. “All their expenses for food, clothes and leisure were taken care of. However, the constitutions of communist countries stipulated that citizens had both a right and an obligation to work. As the wife of the most powerful politician in the country, Elena Ceaușescu wanted to portray herself as a role model, worthy of being next to the ‘great political leader’, her husband. She wouldn’t hear of having just any job. As communism prized science as a force for industrial production, and being an intellectual had also been valued when she had been younger, a job as a scientist would work well with being the first [female] comrade of the country.” Elena Ceaușescu was born to a family of farmers and traders in 1916, according to her biography in the Romanian national archives. She attended night school at the Polytechnic Institute in Bucharest for seven years from 1950, and after her graduation went to work at the National Institute for Research and Development in Chemistry and Petrochemistry (ICECHIM), in the department working on elastomers – a type of polymer. Dumbravă says this is probably why she “specialised” in polymer research in her academic publications. “It was just a matter of chance,” he says. “Before she got her ‘PhD’, and before she got her bachelor of science ‘degree’ in chemistry, she was an unskilled worker in the institute, under the supervision of the person who had most worked on her PhD.” In his book Kiss the Hand You Cannot Bite: the Rise and Fall of the Ceaușescus, Edward Behr writes: “There is no record of her chemistry degree in advance of her doctorate … but by 1960 she had a full-time job as a researcher at the Chemical Institute (ICECHIM), and by 1965 she had become its director. “Mircea Corciovei, a scientist at ICECHIM … recalled that ‘in her [Ceaușescu’s] new position it was very difficult to talk to her. She gave orders, she wanted no arguments’,” Behr writes. “It was impossible for him to discover the extent of her knowledge of chemistry, for she never discussed the scientific aspects of the institute’s work, ‘concerning herself only with political and administrative matters’ … Corciovei discovered she didn’t know what a chromatograph was, and didn’t recognise the formula for sulphuric acid – H2SO4 – taught to first-year chemistry students.” The book describes how in 1967, when Ceaușescu was due to appear before a board of examiners to defend her chemistry doctorate while she was still working at ICECHIM, Corciovei tried to attend – such events were open to the public by law and university tradition. But when Corciovei showed up, the door was locked. The session had occurred in camera. ‘Everyone knew she was an imposter’ Ceaușescu’s scientific reputation may have had the full resources of the Romanian state behind it, but it could not have reached international proportions without the help of western publications, institutions and political leaders. “Her international fame was supported by forcing Romanian chemists to write papers, some of which were published in international journals, as well as a book that was translated in English and published by Pergamon Press, a widely known British academic publisher,” Isloi says. That book – based on Ceaușescu’s PhD – was published by Pergamon under the title Stereospecific Polymerization of Isoprene and carries a foreword by the Nobel prize-winning British chemist Dorothy Hodgkin, who wrote: “I am not equipped myself with enough technical knowledge of the field of this work to give a critical scientific evaluation of its contents. “But even a necessarily brief reading makes one think that the field of research surveyed by the author is vast and recent.” Pergamon, which was owned by Robert Maxwell, also published hagiographic biographies of several eastern bloc leaders, including one on the Romanian dictator titled: Nicolae Ceaușescu: Builder of Modern Romania and International Statesman (1983). In 1991, a few months before his death, Maxwell sold Pergamon to the academic publishing giant Elsevier, where Ceaușescu’s two books are still available. Her work is also available through the publishers Taylor &amp; Francis and Wiley. Journal articles under her name appeared in publications such as the Journal of Macromolecular Science and the now discontinued Journal of Molecular Catalysis. Ceaușescu’s reputation was also promoted by Romanian officials who pushed for recognition from respected institutions in the west. Dumbravă says she had a “childish desire” to be showered with gifts from around the world as a sign of her prestige. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the former head of Romania’s intelligence service, who defected in 1978, wrote in his 1987 book Red Horizons that Ceaușescu demanded he arrange for universities in New York and Washington to award her honorary titles. “I tried my best to explain that the American president did not have the same power that the Romanian did,” Pacepa wrote. “The only result, however, was Elena’s wrath.” Dennis Deletant, a historian and emeritus professor of Romanian studies at University College London, says in 1978 he was approached by the principal of London University, who told him Romanian diplomats had been trying to get Ceaușescu an honorary title ahead of her state visit in June of that year. Deletant was asked whether this was a wise decision. He says: “The Romanian embassy in London made strenuous efforts to persuade certain British academic institutions to recognise Elena’s ‘scientific achievements’– she was trumpeted in the Romanian press as ‘a scientist of world renown’, even though her doctorate was the work, I was reliably informed by Romanian sources, of a professor at the University of Iași. “I was invited by the principal of London University to discuss with him the grounds for the award of an honorary doctorate to Elena,” Deletant says. “I expressed a strong opposition to such a step.” An emissary from the Romanian Academy was also sent to plead Ceaușescu’s case for recognition by the Royal Society, the oldest national scientific society in the world. Deletant’s wife, Andrea, who taught Romanian at Bradford University, acted as interpreter at a meeting with the society’s president, the Nobel prize-winning chemist Alexander Todd. “After giving the emissary generous hospitality, in which alcohol played a significant part, Professor Todd asked the emissary in all frankness whether Elena deserved an honour from the society,” Deletant says. “The answer he received was no.” Both the University of London and the Royal Society rejected the Romanian requests. The Romanian embassy then turned to the Royal Society of Chemistry, which made Elena an honorary fellow, and the Polytechnic of Central London, which gave her the title of honorary professor. The latter did not respond to a request for comment on the call to revoke Ceaușescu’s credentials, but in a statement the Royal Society of Chemistry said “We acknowledge the lasting impact of Elena Ceaușescu being granted such recognition and the importance of clarifying her place in the history of science”. “The process of revoking her association with the Royal Institute of Chemistry – our antecedent society until 1980 – had been started in the days before her death, which effectively ended her honorary fellowship. Since the formation of the Royal Society of Chemistry in our current form in 1980, we make public all of our honorary fellows. We have a code of conduct for anyone in our profession.” Her biographer Betea says it is important that those outside Romania share responsibility for the legitimisation of Ceaușescu. “Her first ‘recognitions’ came from France and the United States, before entering the Romanian Academy,” Betea says. “Can you excuse the interests of those who did not live in a communist dictatorship, and blame only those in the country? Or just her? That’s not fair, in my opinion. “Obviously, everyone knew she was an imposter. Those who gave her titles or pressured others to do so … are guilty of having contributed to an intellectual imposture of colossal proportions. “Those who took part in the deception were not penalised. Without them, those like Elena Ceaușescu would not have existed as a ‘world-renowned scientist’.” ‘Offence’ to honest scientific work Professor Mircea Teodorescu from the Polytechnic University of Bucharest’s Department of Bioresources and Polymer Science, co-authored papers with Elena Ceaușescu between 1984 and 1989. He is part of the push to have her name retracted from scientific works. At the time, Teodorescu was a young assistant professor with a research laboratory in ICECHIM’s rubber department. “The whole scientific output of this department had to have Elena Ceaușescu as the first author, because of the orders of the Communist party,” Teodorescu says. “This included all joint projects with researchers from other institutions, like me and other colleagues of mine. I knew from the very beginning that all papers resulted from these joint projects would have Elena Ceaușescu as the first author, but I accepted the situation due to the location of the laboratory and also because the projects I participated in involved high-quality scientific research which offered me the opportunity to learn a lot and gain research expertise.” Teodorescu wants the works on which she was the sole author withdrawn and her name removed where she was a co-author. The science in those papers was sound, Teodorescu says – it’s just that Ceaușescu had no involvement in it. “In fact, I believe that she did not even read those works because I very much doubt she had the ability to understand them,” he says. “I consider that it is a moral issue to correct this.” In their letter to Elsevier, sent on 10 December, Teodorescu, Isloi, Dumbravă and their co-authors call Ceaușescu’s behaviour “a ruthless act of intellectual misappropriation”. “In the name of the self-correcting nature of science, as well as the hard-earned Romanian democracy, we ask that you consider retracting the titles bearing her name, as her authorship on these works is not only fraudulent, but an offense to Romanian anti-communist protesters who were killed during the Romanian Revolution, as well as every Romanian scientist who has ever done honest work. “We are well aware that these titles have ended up in your catalogue through no fault of your own. However, we consider this correction of the scientific record to be crucial.” Similar requests have been sent to Wiley and to Taylor &amp; Francis. All the publishers have guidelines stating that false claims of authorship and plagiarism are grounds for retraction. A spokesperson for Wiley said: “We take all allegations of authorship abuse very seriously and thank the individuals who brought this to our attention. “Since receiving their letter, we have quickly initiated an investigation into four articles in Acta Polymerica, a journal which was discontinued in 2003, in accordance with industry standards set forward by the Committee on Publication Ethics.” Elsevier and Taylor &amp; Francis did not respond to a request for comment. The co-authors are also calling for 36 patents registered under Elena Ceaușescu’s name with the European Patent Office to be retracted. ICECHIM’s website still lists her as a former general manager, but says nothing about her dark history, harsh cuts to scientific funding or lack of credentials. Its current general manager, Mihaela Doni, said: “The period of 1970-1980, in which Elena Ceaușescu held the position of the institute manager, cannot be removed or permanently erased from the history of this institution. “Our institute, as it is now, has no [qualification] in determining whether Elena Ceaușescu would have asked to be the co-author of some scientific works to which she did not contribute, and even more, to ask the publishers to withdraw her name from the published works,” she said. “The only ones who are entitled to do this are the co-authors themselves.” Isloi says Ceaușescu’s impact on science in Romania persists. “In Romanian academia, plagiarism is rampant, as is nepotism,” he says. “Sloppy science is ubiquitous, [much of it] a consequence of Elena Ceaușescu’s nefarious and outsized influence in the 70s and 80s.” Betea says Ceaușescu is now perceived less harshly than when she was alive. There’s a certain collective guilt over her hasty trial and execution, she says. But her fraud had a lasting impact on politics and science. This month, Romania’s minister of innovation resigned after an investigation found significant irregularities on his résumé and evidence he plagiarised from an academic paper. “Being enrolled as a student in a private university, and paying to have your own books or articles published in order to advance your academic career, is usually associated with Elena Ceaușescu’s model,” Betea says. “As is the Romanian politicians’ objective of having academic titles or PhDs, which is looked upon as a consequence of the obsession that the Ceaușescus had of embodying both political and scientific figures.”"

If you’ve been following along, thanks for joining us and catch up with anything you might have missed by viewing all our coronavirus coverage here. The Covid self-isolation period has been cut to seven days in a move that could save Christmas for thousands of people and ease mounting staff shortages. From Tuesday, new guidance will enable the 10-day self-isolation period for vaccinated people in England who have tested positive for coronavirus to be reduced by three days if they get the all-clear from lateral flow tests. People who receive negative results from tests taken 24 hours apart on day six and day seven of their self-isolation period will no longer have to self-isolate for the full 10 days, the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said. Those who leave self-isolation on or after day seven are “strongly advised” to limit close contact with other people in crowded or poorly ventilated spaces, work from home and minimise contact with anyone who is at higher risk of severe illness if infected with Covid-19, the agency added. Read the full story here. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog. First up, some numbers out of Australia where I will reporting to you from. The state of NSW has recorded 3,763 new cases and two deaths. It is rise of more than 700 on yesterday’s number, a previous record day. Victoria reported 1,503 cases and six deaths. Meanwhile, Australia could have 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January or early February under a “worst-case scenario” included in Doherty Institute modelling to be discussed at national cabinet. Boris Johnson has confirmed no further Covid restrictions will be put in place in England before Christmas. The UK prime minister said there was currently not enough evidence to justify tougher measures before Christmas but curbs could be imposed after 25 December. Edinburgh’s annual Hogmanay street party has been cancelled, while in Wales employees face £60 fines for failing to work from home as governments tightened rules to limit the spread of the Omicron variant. The Scottish and Welsh governments also imposed limits on sporting events from Boxing Day. People over the age of 60 in Israel will be eligible for a fourth Covid vaccination, the country’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, announced. His remarks came the country recorded its first death from the Omicron variant. The World Health Organization’s European chief has warned countries to brace for a “significant surge” in cases as Omicron spreads across the continent. Dr Hans Kluge said Omicron is now the dominant variant in a number of European countries, including the UK, Denmark and Portugal. The next mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said on Tuesday he would postpone his inauguration ceremony, which was set for 1 January, due to the rise in cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. He did so shortly after the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced that residents who get a Covid-19 booster shot by the end of the year will receive $100. Germany has announced a string of new measures that are to take effect from 28 December “at the latest”, in a bid to get a rampant surge in new infections under control. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the fourth wave of infections was now under control, but warned that the fifth wave was just around the corner. Portugal’s government ordered nightclubs and bars to shut doors and told people to work from home from 26 December to at least 9 January to control the spread of Covid-19 over the holiday period. A negative coronavirus test will also be required to stay at Portuguese hotels and outdoor gatherings will be limited to 10 people per group on New Year’s Eve. The archbishop of Canterbury has said that people will have felt “sorrow and sadness” seeing the photograph of Downing Street staff drinking together last May because it will have reminded them of what they sacrificed. In an interview, Justin Welby hinted at his disapproval over the gathering, saying that leadership involved setting an example. A bailout package worth about £1bn for businesses losing trade because of the Omicron surge was announced by the UK’s chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The funding will primarily help firms in the leisure and hospitality sectors, and follows concerns that they have faced cancelled bookings. Israelis over the age of 60 and medical teams will be eligible for a fourth Covid vaccination to protect against the fast-spreading Omicron variant, the country’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, has announced. “The citizens of Israel were the first in the world to receive the third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine and we are continuing to pioneer with the fourth dose as well,” he said on Tuesday, calling on those who meet the criteria to “go and get vaccinated”. Bennett’s remarks came after a meeting of the country’s ministerial coronavirus cabinet which convened amid growing concern over the spread of the Omicron variant. The premier called the pandemic expert committee’s decision to go ahead with a fourth dose “wonderful news that will assist us in getting through the Omicron wave that is engulfing the world”. A statement from the health ministry noted that immunodeficient people will also be eligible for the fourth shot, which can be administered to them, elderly people and the medical teams at least four months after the third shot. Read the full article here: The UK’s National Health Service has increased the daily rate of booster vaccinations by three-quarters in a week – but remains short of the roughly 1.5m jabs a day needed to match Boris Johnson’s promise of a booster jab for all those eligible by the end of the year. One group of health service bosses said the NHS “should not be blamed” if the target is not met, reflecting concern there could be political recriminations if the goal set by the prime minister just over a week ago is not reached. On Monday, 897,979 boosters were administered around the UK, compared with 513,722 a week ago, the day after the prime minister brought forward the vaccination target in a televised address. There remain 15.1 million people across the UK who had a second jab before the end of September and have not yet had a booster – and there are 10 days, excluding Christmas Day, to complete the programme in line with the prime minister’s pledge. Read the full article by my colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Libby Brooks here: The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby has said he thought about “the sorrow and sadness” many will have felt at seeing the picture of Boris Johnson and Downing Street staff drinking wine during lockdown. Speaking to ITV, he said he “felt a whole lot of emotions” after seeing the photograph, adding: I thought about the many people who’ll look at that and remember what they were doing on that day – and the sorrow and sadness they felt because of not being able to see someone or a bereavement of the last time they saw someone they loved. Although he said he was “not quick to judge people”, he said it “costs lives” not to have the “moral authority to lead”. There needs to be truth and integrity and the cost of leadership is that you set an example. You lead from the front which means you obey the rules. The next mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, said on Tuesday he would postpone his inauguration ceremony, which was set for 1 January, due to the rise in cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19. He did so shortly after the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced that residents who get a Covid-19 booster shot by the end of the year will receive $100. “Today we’re announcing a $100 incentive for anyone who gets a Covid-19 booster at a city-run site or with our partner Somos Care,” De Blasio said. “This is a limited time opportunity – through 12/31. “This is the moment. Get your booster and protect your family and city,” he said. In his own statement, Adams, a Democrat like De Blasio, said: “It is clear that our city is facing a formidable opponent in the Omicron variant. After consulting public health experts, we have decided that [the] inauguration ceremony will be postponed to a later date.” The Omicron variant is spreading rapidly. According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Omicron is now the dominant version of the coronavirus in the US, making up 73% of new infections last week. CDC data revealed a nearly six-fold increase in Omicron’s share of infections in just one week. New York state reported that nearly 22,000 people tested positive on Friday, the highest single-day total for new cases since testing became widely available. More than half of the positive results came from New York City. Read the full article here: One of Britain’s most senior scientific figures has warned “uncontrolled, high transmission” could have a “profound” impact across all sectors in the country. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust, said it is “impossible to have a functional economy” if high rates lead to illness, time off work and hospitalisations. As we await more data to confirm trends, he has recommended the public get boosted, wear masks in all indoor spaces as well as to reduce contacts as much as possible. Early human testing of an experimental Covid-19 antiviral pill developed by Pardes Biosciences shows it works as a standalone treatment, the company said. If the drug, PBI-0451, proves effective in later-stage testing, it could have an advantage over similar pills that need to be taken with a second booster medication, such as Pfizer’s two-drug antiviral regimen, Paxlovid. Pardes said it expects to complete its current phase I study in healthy volunteers early next year and plans to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, Reuters reports. “We’re hoping to be able to move as quickly as possible and generate significant data in 2022,” said the company’s chief development officer Brian Kearney. The Pardes pill is a protease inhibitor, designed to prevent the coronavirus from replicating in human cells. Company officials said it plans to discuss with regulators the design of a larger, global trial of PBI-0451, including the number of participants and geographic locations. Hospital bosses in England are bracing themselves for “a dangerous situation” because of the fast-growing Omicron-driven surge in Covid cases, an NHS leader has said. Responding to Boris Johnson ruling out any new rules limiting social mixing in England before Christmas, NHS Confederation chief executive Matthew Taylor said: “It remains a question of when rather than if further restrictions will be brought in to curb the rapid spread of Omicron. “While it is for the government to decide national policy on Covid restrictions, many NHS leaders are preparing for a dangerous situation in which rising patient numbers coincide with rising numbers of NHS staff off sick. That is why we must monitor the situation daily and stand ready to respond to changing evidence,” said Taylor. He did not comment directly on the prime minister’s decision. But it is likely that hospital chiefs, many of whom are busy finalising plans for yet another wave of seriously ill patients who need to be admitted, will be concerned at Johnson’s reluctance to change tack because his action could help the virus to spread – which could result in a spike of hospitalisations. Taylor urged the public to behave responsibly over the festive season. “The best thing the public can do is continue to behave in ways that will keep themselves and others safe, including taking up the offer of a vaccine or booster if they are eligible,” he added. Hello, it is Léonie Chao-Fong here, taking over from my colleague Jedidajah Otte. The World Health Organization’s European chief has warned countries to brace for a “significant surge” in cases as Omicron spreads across the continent. Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Dr Hans Kluge said Omicron is now the dominant variant in a number of European countries, including the UK, Denmark and Portugal. He said: We can see another storm coming. Within weeks, omicron will dominate in more countries of the region, pushing already stretched health systems further to the brink. Last week, 27,000 people died from Covid in the region and an additional 2.6m cases were reported, he said. Although these cases include all variants, he noted this figure is 40% higher than during the same period last year. He added: The sheer volume of new Covid-19 infections could lead to more hospitalisations and widespread disruption to health systems and other critical services. Governments and authorities need to prepare our response systems for a significant surge. The Welsh parliament will be recalled on Wednesday “to consider a matter of urgent public importance”, government officials have confirmed. First minister Mark Drakeford will make a virtual statement addressing the Senedd on the Covid-19 pandemic from 1.30pm and ministers will then have the opportunity to ask questions. It will follow a government media briefing which will be held just after midday to update the country on the Omicron crisis after Cabinet talks were held on Tuesday. The Senedd has been on winter recess since Monday. It is planned to sit again in Plenary on Tuesday, 11 January 2022. Germany has announced a string of new measures that are to take effect from 28 December “at the latest”, in a bid to get a rampant surge in new infections under control. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, North Rhine-Westphalia’s prime minister Hendrik Wüst and Berlin’s governing mayor Franziska Giffey gave a press conference about new coronavirus measures. Scholz said the Omicron variant would soon cause infections to skyrocket. “Covid-19 won’t take a Christmas break,” he said. The chancellor said the fourth wave of infections was now under control, but warned that the fifth wave was just around the corner. Private gatherings will be limited to 10 people even for those who have recovered from the virus or who have been vaccinated. Children under the age of 14 are not included in this number. Clubs and discos will remain closed. The “2G rule” – which stipulates that people must either be vaccinated or recovered from Covid-19 – will apply in cinemas and theatres. In addition, the sale of fireworks will be prohibited on New Year’s Eve, and there will be a ban on assemblies on 31 December. Tough restrictions for unvaccinated people will remain in place – with the 3G rule [having to be either vaccinated, recovered or able to produce a negative test] applying at work and on public transport, and tight contact restrictions also applying over Christmas. All measures decided on Tuesday should not start until after Christmas, Scholz said, adding that the past few years had shown that Easter and Christmas aren’t major drivers of infection. The government is aiming to administer a further 30m booster vaccinations by the end of January, Scholz said. As an interim goal, the overall vaccination rate in the population is hoped to increase to at least 80%. The different heads of Germany’s individual states will meet again on 7 January to discuss further steps, which is also when further financial aid for companies will be discussed again. France will pass a law that will transform its health pass – currently needed to exercise some professions and to go to cinemas and bars – into a “vaccination” pass in the first half of January, government spokesman Gabriel Attal told journalists on Tuesday. Reuters reports: “The wave awaiting us will be high,” Attal said, adding that the Omicron variant accounts for 20% of new Covid-19 infections in France and is spreading rapidly, particularly in the Paris region. The main aim of a vaccination pass will be to do away with the option of obtaining a valid certificate by testing negative instead of having the jabs. In contrast to other European governments, Attal on Tuesday ruled out further restrictions, saying that the country had the means to battle the next wave of cases with its vaccination campaign and mass testing. France logged 72,832 fresh infections on Tuesday, compared with 63,405 a week ago. Israel on Tuesday recorded its first death from the Omicron coronavirus variant, according to Israeli news media which on Tuesday reported that a man in his seventies with pre-existing conditions died in Beersheva on Monday after having received two vaccination doses, Reuters reports. The country confirmed 170 new cases of the Omicron variant, the health ministry said on Tuesday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases of the highly infectious variant to 341. The health ministry said it was looking into 807 confirmed Covid cases that may be Omicron, but have yet to be confirmed, Haaretz reports. The government’s coronavirus cabinet is set to meet later on Tuesday to discuss ways to handle the spread of the Omicron variant in Israel, in what will be the cabinet’s first meeting since the end of November. Fresh infections continue to soar, with Tuesday’s 1,306 new coronavirus cases marking a two-month peak, but the number of patients in serious condition remains stable, according to official figures. The country’s R number – representing the average number of people each coronavirus carrier goes on to infect – continues to climb, but the country has been able to observe a slight downward trend in serious cases over the past month. Currently, there are 81 patients in serious condition, out of whom 48 are in critical condition and 41 are on ventilators. Portugal’s government on Tuesday ordered nightclubs and bars to shut doors and told people to work from home from 26 December to at least 9 January to control the spread of Covid-19 over the holiday period. Prime minister Antonio Costa also announced that a negative coronavirus test would be required to stay at Portuguese hotels and said authorities would limit outdoor gatherings to 10 people per group on New Year’s Eve. Portugal’s recorded infections are still below the EU average, with 433 new Covid cases per day per million inhabitants. But in the previous week, this number stood at 386. A total of 7,801 people were in hospital in the UK with Covid-19 as of 20 December, government figures show. This is the highest number since November 23 and is up 1% from a week earlier, PA reports. During the second wave of coronavirus, hospital numbers peaked at 39,254 on 18 January. Separate figures from NHS England show that 1,904 people were in hospital in London with Covid-19 as of 21 December, the highest number since 2 March and up 41% from a week earlier. The peak of the second wave had stood at 7,917 on 18 January. Across England, 6,902 patients were in hospital with Covid-19 on 21 December – the highest number since 10 November and up 7% week-on-week. The second-wave peak for England was 34,336 on 18 January. Italy reported 153 coronavirus-related deaths on Tuesday versus 137 the day before and 120 a week prior, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 30,798 from 16,213, the first time above 30,000 since November last year. Italy has registered 135,931 deaths linked to Covid-19 since February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 5.4 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 – not including those in intensive care – stood at 8,381 on Tuesday, up from 8,101 a day earlier. There were 96 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 73 on Monday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 1,012 from a previous 987. 851,865 tests for Covid-19 were carried out over the past 24 hours, compared with a previous 337,222, the health ministry said. British prime minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday that he would not be introducing new Covid-19 restrictions in England before Christmas, but stressed the situation remained extremely difficult and the government might need to act afterwards. In a video posted on social media, Johnson said: We don’t think today that there is enough evidence to justify any tougher measures before Christmas. We can’t rule out any further measures after Christmas. We continue to monitor Omicron very closely and if the situation deteriorates we will be ready to take action if needed. Johnson said that while people could go ahead with their Christmas plans, he would urge them to be cautious and follow advice such as keeping windows open and taking a Covid test before visiting elderly or vulnerable relatives, and get a booster jab if possible. The Philippines’ health ministry on Tuesday halved the waiting time for a Covid-19 vaccine booster to three months after a second vaccination to help prevent the spread of the more infectious Omicron variant. A growing list of countries, including South Korea, the UK, Thailand and Germany are shortening the interval for boosters to try to stave off a new surge in infections, Reuters reports. Adults in the Philippines can receive a booster dose at least three months after the second shot of a two-dose vaccine, cutting the six-month gap. Recipients of a single-dose vaccine can get a booster shot after two months, the health ministry said. “We are exploring all possible options to safely mitigate the effects of more transmissible variants of Covid-19,” health secretary Francisco Duque said in a statement. The Southeast Asian nation has detected three imported cases of the Omicron variant. The Philippines has received more than 192m doses of Covid-19 vaccines, and fully inoculated roughly 44.2 million of its 110 million population, government data show. In November, the government started the rollout of booster doses for healthcare workers and the elderly. Covid-19 cases have fallen to an average of 378 a day in December from the peak of 18,579 daily in September. A further 90,629 lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases have been recorded in the UK as of 9am on Tuesday, the government said. A further 172 people were reported to have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been over 173,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. On Monday, the UK reported 91,734 new daily infections, and 59,077 a week ago. The UK Health Security Agency said there had been 15,363 additional confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 reported across the UK. This brings the total confirmed cases of the variant in the UK to 60,508. A total of 897,979 booster and third doses of Covid-19 vaccine were reported in the UK on Monday, new figures show. It is the second-highest figure on record, behind 940,606 doses on Saturday 18 December. More than 29.8 million booster and third doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 5.8 million in the past seven days. The figures have been published by the UK’s four health agencies. Vaccine sceptics in Sicily paid a nurse to give them fake Covid-19 jabs in order to obtain a health certificate that is mandatory for some professions, police said on Tuesday. Reuters reports: Three people, including the nurse and a local leader of the movement known in Italy as ‘No-Vax,’ have been arrested and face charges of corruption and forgery. Police used a hidden camera to film the nurse at a major inoculation centre emptying the vaccine syringe into a tissue before briefly putting the needle into the arm of the recipient. About a dozen health passes were obtained in this fashion, including by a policeman. Local media reported that people paid up to €400 each for the service. “We have uncovered the dark and fraudulent plots of these die-hard, No-Vax people who do not hesitate to break the law,” Palermo police commissioner Leopoldo Laricchia said in a statement. In an effort to curb Covid-19 infections, the government has made vaccinations mandatory for health care workers, teachers, law enforcement officers and the military. Italy further tightened curbs on people who are still not vaccinated on 6 December, limiting their access to an array of places and services, including indoor seating at bars and restaurants, museums, cinemas, clubs and sporting events. Some 81% of all Italians have received either one or two jabs – one of the highest rates in Europe – while 26% of the population has had a booster jab. As pressure has mounted to get vaccinated, so have reports of people trying to dupe the system. Earlier this month, a dentist turned up at a vaccination centre in northern Italy wearing a fake silicone arm, hoping to fool a nurse into giving him a jab in order to obtain a Covid-19 health certificate. Omicron is now firmly established as the dominant strain of coronavirus in Scotland, first minister Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she announced new restrictions on public events. Large-scale Hogmanay celebrations in Scotland are to be cancelled and live sports will be “effectively spectator-free” for three weeks from Boxing Day. More restrictions in hospitality venues will be introduced after Christmas. People in Scotland should also minimise their socialising at New Year, with Sturgeon urging people to keep their contacts with other households to a minimum. Updating MSPs, the first minister said 62.9% of cases showed the S-gene dropout, and that more restrictions were needed to slow the spread of the virus. She said: It is currently spreading rapidly across Scotland, and so the steep increase in infections that was predicted last week has now started to materialise. She added: Difficult though it is, please follow this advice over New Year – minimise Hogmanay socialising as much as you can. If we all follow the advice to minimise the contact we have outside our own households, we will help limit the spread of infections. This is the bedrock of our plan for the immediate period ahead. On restrictions for hospitality, Sturgeon told MSPs: From 27 December, again for a three-week period – we intend to introduce some further protections in hospitality settings and other indoor public places to reduce transmission risk in what are, through no fault of those who run such venues, higher-risk environments. I can confirm that a requirement for table service-only will be reintroduced for venues serving alcohol for consumption on the premises. And we will also ask indoor hospitality and leisure venues to ensure one-metre distance, not within, but between groups of people who are attending together. Recent funding from the Treasury will give Scotland an extra £175m to spend now, Sturgeon said. She told MSPs the entirety of this sum would go towards supporting businesses, bringing the total package for business support over the next three weeks to £375m. Discussing the new restrictions for hospitality, which include a rule for table service-only in venues serving alcohol, she said: I know how unwelcome this will be for everyone - but we believe these precautionary steps will help us navigate a difficult period more safely. I am also acutely aware that these decisions - and the advice we are giving the public – have significant financial implications for many businesses. More than two-thirds of people aged 18 and over and who are eligible in England have received a booster jab against Covid-19, NHS England said on Tuesday. In total, over 25 million people who are at least three months on from their second dose have already been boosted in England, with the online service opening to eligible adults last Wednesday. The latest numbers follow a week of “blockbooster” records for vaccinations, including a weekend with over 830,000 booster jabs delivered on Saturday – the highest number ever – and more than 1.5m boosters reported over Saturday and Sunday. More than 5.3m boosters were reported between 13 and 20 December. More than four in five of people aged 50 and over have now been boosted. The NHS is urging everyone who is eligible – three months on from their second jab and able to book after two months – to get their booster as soon as possible. However, people cannot get vaccinated within 28 days of having had the virus. Recent data from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) showed that two doses of the vaccine are not enough to stop people becoming unwell from Omicron, but a booster significantly increases protection against the variant. On Monday, the NHS opened the national booking service for 12- to 15-year-olds to get their second Covid-19 vaccine with more than 1.3 million young people already having taken up the offer of a first dose. Despite high vaccination rates, Spain could be forced to reintroduce measures as the Omicron variant is running rampant. Prime minister Pedro Sánchez will meet via video with the heads of Spain’s 17 regions on Wednesday to discuss new health measures, while medical groups and experts are clamouring for more action to be taken. The country had hoped to rely on the willingness of 80% of its entire population of 47 million (90% of those over age 12) to line up for vaccine shots with little-to-no prodding and the widespread use of face masks to have a Christmas that looked much more like 2019 than like last year, AP reports. But the incredibly fast spread of the Omicron variant is starting to put pressure on hospitals, prompting authorities in Catalonia to prepare to become the first Spanish region to reinstate serious limitations (see 10:35). The region accounts for one in four people hospitalised in Spain with Covid-19. “We had all hoped to spend these Christmas holidays with our family and loved ones, but unfortunately we are not in that situation,” Catalan regional president Pere Aragones said Tuesday. “You don’t have to look at the numbers. All of us know people who have been infected.” Spain is back in the high-risk zone with over 600 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over 14 days, more than double the accumulated cases seen before last year’s winter holidays. The Omicron strain has increased from 5% of new cases in Spain to 47% within one week, according to the health ministry. The British government needs to provide certainty, not just handouts for Covid-hit firms, a business owner has said. Nathan Godley, of restaurant supplier Premier Seafoods, told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: This time of year I need to know what I need for the restaurants and they are unsure what to tell me, and I am unsure what to tell my supplier. Fish doesn’t just go from the boat to the restaurant. There’s quite a few of us in this supply chain in between and we all need to know what is happening. Godley said he wanted an idea of how he could plan a week in advance, adding: “I don’t need any handouts. I am not asking for that. I am just asking for certainty.” His remarks were echoed by the president of British Chambers of Commerce, who said the new grants for hospitality businesses this Christmas are a “good start”, while calling for more certainty about future restrictions. Conservative peer Baroness Ruby McGregor-Smith told BBC Radio 4’s World at One: We asked very much for grant support, so we are delighted that grant support has been given, but we don’t know yet the definition of eligible businesses and companies. I think it is a good start. Our concern is around the fact that we need business confidence and we have got uncertainty. We need to know that we can stay open and continue to trade and consumers will return. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Labour “will be going through the details” of the new support measures for businesses, adding the government had been “dragged kicking and screaming” to announce them. Mark Davyd, founder and chief executive of Music Venue Trust, described the announcement of a further £30m for the government’s culture recovery fund this winter as “inadequate” to deal with the impact of rising cases on the sector. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said newly-announced support for the culture sector was “far too little” and “borders on the insulting”. Sweden will urge all employees to work from home if possible and impose tighter rules for social distancing, the government said on Tuesday, as it ratchets up restrictions aimed at fighting a surge in new infections of the Covid-19 virus. The new rules also will also require seated-only service at bars and restaurants as well as at larger public events. “We must now take joint responsibility and we need to adapt to the new reality,” prime minister Magdalena Andersson told a news conference. “I understand that many are tired of this – so am I – but we now have a new virus variant, which means we are in a new situation.” The Swedish Health Agency said on Tuesday that the worst case scenario in an updated pandemic model would lead daily new Covid infections to rise beyond 15,000 by mid-January. In previous waves of the pandemic, daily infections have peaked at just over 11,000 cases, Reuters reports. The new model projection factored in the spread of the more contagious Omicron variant, assuming it is 25% more contagious than the Delta variant and factored in varying degrees of protection offered by vaccines. A bailout package worth about £1bn for businesses losing trade because of the Omicron surge was announced by the British chancellor, Rishi Sunak, on Tuesday. The funding will primarily help firms in the leisure and hospitality sector in England, and follows concerns that they have faced cancelled bookings and plummeting custom since the government implemented its Covid plan B. My colleagues Andrew Sparrow and Richard Partington have the full story. Hundreds of far-right protesters gathered in Romania’s capital, Bucharest, on Tuesday to oppose a bill that would introduce “green certificates” in workplaces, which authorities hope will limit the spread of coronavirus infections and prevent another collapse of the country’s health care system, AP reports. The protest was attended by various rightwing groups including supporters of Romania’s nationalist AUR party, which holds seats in parliament. Romania, a European Union nation of about 19 million, faced its deadliest wave of coronavirus infections and deaths in October and November when intensive care units across the country were overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients, and hospital morgues ran out of space. In response to the unfolding disaster, authorities tightened restrictions in late October, and daily coronavirus cases have since dropped to their lowest since August. Authorities are concerned another surge is on the cards, after Romania confirmed more than a dozen cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Romania’s new coalition government is discussing a bill that would require people going into their workplaces to present green certificates – available to those with proof of full vaccination, those who have recovered from Covid-19, or those who have a negative test. They would be introduced after three consecutive weeks of an increasing Covid-19 infection rate, and once a certain incident rate is exceeded. Only 40% of Romania’s population, or 7.7 million people, have received two doses of a coronavirus vaccine. About 2 million of those have also received the booster dose. Over the winter holidays, hundreds of thousands of Romanians living abroad are expected to return home, which prompted authorities to implement on Monday passenger locator forms to improve the traceability of infections. In 24 hours, more than 100,000 forms have been filled out. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases recommended on Tuesday that “maximum contact restrictions” should be imposed immediately, to curb a surge in infections caused by the Omicron variant. Among the body’s other recommendations, which applied through mid-January 2022, were restricting travel only to what was absolutely necessary, accelerating the vaccination campaign and ensuring that enough free coronavirus tests were available, Reuters reports. Federal and state leaders are expected to meet later on Tuesday to decide on new measures, which are likely to include contact restrictions even for the vaccinated and those who have recovered from an infection, but a nationwide lockdown seemed to be off the agenda on Tuesday morning. The RKI reported 23,428 new infections on Tuesday, and 462 deaths, taking Germany’s total to 108,814. Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia (UEA), said the previous rapid increase in cases in England appears to be slowing and, if that is true, there is no need for a lockdown. Meanwhile, Prof Hunter told PA Media that measures such as social distancing and lockdowns “never ultimately prevent infection unless eradication is a possibility”. He said: What they do is flatten the curve and delay the inevitable. Sometimes that is sufficient if the epidemic would overwhelm the health service, or if effective new treatments or vaccines are coming. No new treatments or vaccines are likely to come soon so the issue is all about flattening the peak. But if you flatten the peak you prolong the epidemic, or as we say, ‘the area under the curve remains the same’. Prof Hunter said if Omicron cases continue to double every two days “then it would not be long before we got to seriously high numbers that would eventually put the NHS under a dreadful strain and under some predictions could ultimately overwhelm the NHS.” Under some modelling scenarios, high hospital admissions are “pretty much locked in” and “a lockdown after Christmas would probably be too late”, he said, but at the lower end of the predictions, hospital admissions would not overwhelm the NHS. He added: If restrictions are not needed then they would only delay illness and prolong the impact on health services as well as the other negative impacts that lockdowns have on our wellbeing. Prof Hunter said the “latest data suggests that total case numbers, and therefore Omicron, may already have plateaued or even peaked”. Indeed, infection numbers may have fallen slightly in the last few days. Transmission of the Omicron variant in the UK is “eye-wateringly high”, though there is still uncertainty about its impact on the NHS and whether the situation warrants further restrictions, a leading expert has said. Sir Jeremy Farrar, director of the global charitable foundation Wellcome and a former government adviser, said “we’re in the most difficult, most uncertain time, perhaps of the whole pandemic, certainly since March of 2020.” The government is expected to release further details on Tuesday about supporting firms struggling due to the advice for people to rethink some of their Christmas plans. Farrar told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Omicron is spreading unbelievably fast. It is a phenomenal variant, transmission is eye-wateringly high, but there is great uncertainty. What is it going to lead to in terms of pressure on the health system, people going to hospital, people dying, but also what impact is it going to have on the broader society, staff absences, the ability to have functioning other services? So there is great uncertainty. My personal view is that I think we can wait at the moment until there are more restrictions formally placed, but each of us can do a lot of things today that would make the chances of further restrictions lighter. More data will be available today and tomorrow and I would act on those if transmission is rising still and if hospitalisations are going up across the country. He said that, until recently, Omicron was doubling every two days and it was not yet known if that was levelling off. People were already changing their behaviour and workplaces were breaking up for the Christmas break, meaning previous predictions of between 6 and 10 million cases by the New Year were “unlikely to happen”, he said. Nevertheless, Farrar warned of a potential impact on essential workers, including nurses, doctors and teachers, if transmission is not curbed. He said: At the moment, with the incredibly difficult policy and political decisions that need to be made, this is a time of great uncertainty, but I think waiting for that data for the formal decisions doesn’t mean to say that all of us can’t do what we can do over the coming days and weeks to reduce the chance of transmission and all of our sectors suffering and the economic damage that comes from that. There is data coming out today and if it does show the transmission is continuing to rise and if hospitalisations in London and across the rest of the country are starting to rise, then the government will have to act before Christmas. In New York City, nearly 42,600 people citywide tested positive from Wednesday through Saturday last week, compared with fewer than 35,800 in the entire month of November, AP reports. The city has never had so many people test positive in such a short period of time since testing became widely available. On Saturday, the state of New York recorded the highest number of daily Covid cases since the pandemic began. Governor Kathy Hochul urged New Yorkers to not be complacent, get vaccinated and boostered once eligible and wear a mask. There is no clear picture of how many people got the virus during the city’s first surge in the spring of 2020. US president Joe Biden plans to avoid a lockdown and instead increase support for hospitals, improve access to Covid-19 testing through hundreds of millions of rapid at-home tests and expand the availability of vaccines that can reduce the risks from the Omicron variant. A senior administration official, insisting on anonymity, provided details on the proposals Biden will announce in his speech Tuesday afternoon, the Associated Press reports. The administration is prepared to deploy an additional 1,000 troops in medical professions to hospitals as well as direct federal medical personnel to Michigan, Indiana, Wisconsin, Arizona, New Hampshire and Vermont. There are also plans to send out additional ventilators and equipment from the national stockpile besides expanding hospital capacity to handle infected patients. The government will purchase 500m rapid at-home tests to be delivered for free to the homes of Americans who request them, and put up new testing sites and use the Defense Production Act to help manufacture more tests. In a preview of Biden’s speech, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at Monday’s press briefing that the president doesn’t plan to impose any lockdowns and will instead be encouraging people to get vaccinated – and, if they’re eligible, to get their booster shot. “This is not a speech about locking the country down. This is a speech about the benefits of being vaccinated,” Psaki told reporters. Biden’s top medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said over the weekend that Biden will issue “a stark warning of what the winter will look like” for unvaccinated Americans. Psaki said Biden has tested negative twice since Sunday and will test again on Wednesday, after he had been in close contact with a staff member on Air Force One who later tested positive for Covid-19. There are 40 million eligible but unvaccinated American adults. Psaki said the president plans to appeal to survival instincts. “Our health experts assess that you are 14 times more likely to die of Covid if you have not been vaccinated versus vaccinated,” she said Monday. The Omicron variant has already become the dominant strain in the US, accounting for nearly three-quarters of new infections last week. Early studies suggest that the vaccinated will need a booster shot for the best chance at preventing an omicron infection but that even without the extra dose, vaccination should still largely protect people from serious sickness or death. About one in four local authority areas in the UK are recording their highest rate of new Covid-19 cases since mass testing began in summer 2020, new analysis shows. PA Media reports: The areas include two-thirds of authorities in London, more than half in south-east England and nearly a half in eastern England. Most of the rest of the country has yet to reach record levels, however, with only a handful of areas in the north and west seeing rates at an all-time high. The figures, which have been compiled by the PA news agency, show that: • 21 of the 32 local authorities in London now have record Covid-19 case rates, with the capital accounting for the top 10 highest rates in the UK and 20 of the top 25. • Four London areas have rates above 2,000 cases per 100,000 people: Lambeth (2,461.4), Wandsworth (2361.9), Hackney and City of London (2,096.8) and Southwark (2,064.0) • In south-east England, 37 of the 64 local authorities are now seeing record rates, led by Elmbridge (1,384.7), Reigate and Banstead (1,317.3) and Epsom and Ewell (1,271.6), all of which are in Surrey. • 21 of the 45 local authorities in eastern England have record case rates, including St Albans (1,311.3) and Cambridge (1,177.0). These are not the highest rates in the region, however – Brentwood (1,460.3) and Thurrock (1,342.2) in Essex are higher, though this is slightly below the record for both areas, which was set during the second wave of the virus last winter. • 12 of the 40 areas in the East Midlands are at a record high, led by South Northamptonshire (970.8), Broxtowe in Nottinghamshire (917.8) and Charnwood in Leicestershire (916.6) All figures are for the seven days to 16 December, as data for more recent days is still incomplete. In total, 102 of the 377 local authority areas in the UK (27%) are now recording their highest Covid-19 case rates since mass testing was rolled out across the country in May and June 2020. Figures for case rates in the early months of the pandemic are not directly comparable, as only a small number of people were being tested, mostly in hospitals and care homes. Of the 102 areas, only 11 are outside the south and east: six in north-west England (Bury, Cheshire West and Chester, Manchester, Salford, Stockport and Trafford); three in Scotland (East Lothian, Edinburgh and West Lothian); one in Northern Ireland (Ards and North Down); and one in the West Midlands (Newcastle-under-Lyme). The contrast between the south and east and the north and west reflects the way the Omicron variant of Covid-19 has spread in recent weeks – in particular, how London was the first area of the UK where Omicron became the dominant variant of the virus. Although nine in 10 local authorities in the UK are recording a week-on-week rise in rates, most areas in the north and west of the country have yet to hit levels seen during the second wave of the virus. But this could change in the days and weeks ahead, once Omicron has become the dominant variant in all parts of the country. Weekly registered deaths with Covid-19 in England and Wales have fallen to their lowest level in two months, new figures show. Seven hundred and 64 deaths were registered in the week to 10 December where “novel coronavirus” was mentioned on the death certificate, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said, accounting for 6.4% of all deaths registered over this seven-day period. This was a 4% decrease in the number of deaths compared with the previous week when 792 deaths were recorded. It is the lowest number of weekly deaths registered since the week to 15 October, when the total was 713. It is too early to see what impact the rapid spread of the Omicron variant will have in the weekly ONS data on Covid-19 deaths. Overall, England registered 3,185 deaths due to Covid-19 in November 2021, an increase of 774 compared to October, the ONS said. In Wales, there were 302 deaths due to Covid-19 in November 2021, compared with 284 deaths in October. The figures also show that 65 care home resident deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales were registered in the week to December 10, down slightly from 67 in the previous week. In total, 44,406 care home residents in England and Wales have had Covid-19 recorded on their death certificate since the pandemic began. The ONS figures cover deaths of care home residents in all settings, not just in care homes. A total of 173,525 deaths have occurred in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, the ONS said. Hello everyone, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be taking over now for the next few hours. As ever, feel free to get in touch to flag anything you think is relevant for our coverage, I’m on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. Here is a round-up of all the day’s top Covid news stories from around the world: The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that holiday festivities would in many places lead to “increased cases, overwhelmed health systems and more deaths” and urged people to postpone gatherings. Covid vaccine maker Moderna does not expect any problems in developing a booster shot to protect against the Omicron variant of coronavirus and could begin work in a few weeks, chief executive Stephane Bancel said in an interview. Catalonia is preparing to become the first Spanish region to reinstate serious limitations given the latest spike in infections in a country that is among the world leaders in vaccination. New Zealand plans to shorten the gap between second Covid vaccine doses and boosters, as well as pushing back the phased reopening of its borders. Germany looks set to introduce new contact restrictions around New Year’s Eve, as chancellor Olaf Scholz and the federal heads of state meet this afternoon to discuss ways to protect the country’s essential services from being overwhelmed by an anticipated new wave driven by the highly infectious Omicron variant. In Australia, a NSW man who absconded from hotel quarantine in Hobart and sparked a three-day lockdown across southern Tasmania has been sentenced to five months’ jail for breaching public health orders. Thailand will reinstate its mandatory Covid quarantine for foreign visitors and scrap a quarantine waiver from Tuesday, the Reuters news agency reported. India has recorded 200 cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant across 12 states, mostly in the western state of Maharashtra and the nation’s capital New Delhi, the health ministry said on Tuesday. Concerns are growing in Spain as the country prepares to enter the Christmas season without a clear plan. The sixth wave of Covid has sent infection rates soaring – the number of cases per 100,000 people hit 609 on Monday, up from 381 a week ago and 290 a fortnight ago. People hopping over the border to Belgium and Germany to avoid the Dutch lockdown are filling the neighbouring countries’ restaurants and shops despite calls for them to “stay away”. Hungary has decided to rejoin the European Union’s Covid vaccine procurement process to shield its population from the Omicron variant, ordering 9.5m doses of the jab developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. That’s it from me, Tom Ambrose, for today. I will be back tomorrow morning but, for now, I am handing over to my colleague Jedidajah Otte, who will be bringing you all the latest coronavirus news throughout the day. Catalonia is preparing to become the first Spanish region to reinstate serious limitations given the latest spike in infections in a country that is among the world leaders in vaccination. Health authorities have asked the courts to authorise a battery of measures including a new nightly curfew between 1am and 6am, a limit of 10 people per social gathering, the closure of night clubs, and capping restaurants at 50% of seating indoors and stores, gyms and theatres to 70% capacity. If approved by the courts, they would take effect on Friday and last for 15 days in the north-east region surrounding Barcelona. Regional health chief Josep Argimon said that the measures are needed because of the arrival of the more contagious omicron variant. “Infections have grown 100% over the past week,” he said. People hopping over the border to Belgium and Germany to avoid the Dutch lockdown are filling the neighbouring countries’ restaurants and shops despite calls for them to “stay away”. Since Mark Rutte, the Dutch prime minister, announced the closure of hospitality and non-essential shops from Sunday, border regions have experienced a rush of visitors. While the hospitality industry in the Netherlands is shuttered, Belgium has resisted scientists’ calls for stricter measures, with restaurants open until 11pm to customers who can prove full vaccination. The German Länder, or states, have been given the power to close restaurants but such measures are generally yet to be enforced. At a meeting with the governor of the Belgian province of Antwerp, Cathy Berx, on Monday, local mayors expressed their concern about the potential spread of the Omicron variant due to border-hopping. Berx said: “Letting this happen is the shortest route to a closure of the catering industry, and nobody wants that. And so the friendly but firm appeal is: don’t come to cafes or restaurants in the province of Antwerp now.” Germany looks set to introduce new contact restrictions around New Year’s Eve, as chancellor Olaf Scholz and the federal heads of state meet this afternoon to discuss ways to protect the country’s essential services from being overwhelmed by an anticipated new wave driven by the highly infectious Omicron variant. A draft proposal, seen by several German papers, proposes banning gatherings of more than ten people, closing clubs and discotheques and holding larger sports events behind closed doors from at least 28 December. Children under the age of 14 are exempt from the rule, while unvaccinated people are already only allowed to meet no more than two people from outside their own household. Germany’s rates of new infections and deaths have dropped over the last week, but the government’s council of scientific advisers has warned the expected spread of the Omicron variant will soon create “extreme pressure” not just on hospital’s emergency care unit but critical infrastructure like police, fire services and delivery services. The new measures come as the country continues to debate the introduction of a general vaccine mandate in the spring, with parliament likely to hold a free vote on the subject early in the new year. Justice minister Marco Buschmann, of the Free Democratic party (FDP), said there would likely be three motions that delegates will vote on: a general mandate that would see fines for those who continue to resist vaccination, an outright rejection of a general mandate, and a compromise whereby a vaccine mandate would be phased in by age groups. Chancellor Scholz and finance minister Christian Lindner have indicated their support for a general mandate, while a group of around 30 FDP delegates have said they would outright reject a general mandate. Concerns are growing in Spain as the country prepares to enter the Christmas season without a clear plan. The sixth wave of Covid has sent infection rates soaring – the number of cases per 100,000 people hit 609 on Monday, up from 381 a week ago and 290 a fortnight ago. The surge is already putting some hospitals and medical centres under strain. Although the proportion of ICU beds occupied by Covid patients stands at 15.5% nationally, it rises to 25% in the Basque Country and almost 30% in Catalonia. The prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, has urged people to remain calm but called an emergency meeting of Spain’s regional presidents on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the response. Some regional administrations are already taking their own measures. On Monday, the Catalan government said it was seeking legal permission to introduce a curfew between 1am and 6am that would begin on Friday and last for two weeks. It also plans to close nightclubs and limit gatherings to 10 people. In Madrid – where the regional president, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, has fiercely resisted restrictions, arguing they are too damaging economically – school authorities have called on the regional government to “urgently” consider shutting schools two days before the end of term to help counter the spread of infections. Doctors in the capital and the surrounding region have also warned that immediate action must be taken to stave off collapse as the highly infectious omicron strain accounts for 60% of new infections. The Official College of Madrid Doctors said trying to control the spread of the variant through nothing but testing and isolation risked collapsing the region’s primary care system. It called for restrictions on the number of people allowed in enclosed spaces such as bars and restaurants, and caps on social gatherings. The college also said that the vaccination of school-age children needed to be brought forward to help arrest the spread of the new strain. Hungary has decided to rejoin the European Union’s Covid vaccine procurement process to shield its population from the Omicron variant, ordering 9.5m doses of the jab developed by BioNTech and Pfizer. Prime minister Viktor Orbán also told a news conference on Tuesday that he expected the European Commission would publish a clear stance before the end of the year including nuclear energy in its “sustainable finance taxonomy”, a rulebook that will restrict which activities can be labelled as climate friendly investments. Rail operators in the UK have blamed coronavirus-related staff shortages for widespread cancellations during the Christmas getaway. A number of firms are running reduced timetables due to workers being off sick or isolating, PA Media reported on Tuesday. CrossCountry said it is “expecting widespread disruption to our services this week”. It went on: “Please pull your journey forward to sooner rather than later to get to your end destination as early as possible.” Dozens of trains are being cancelled by the company each day, and many others have fewer carriages than usual. Cancellations have been made on several of its routes, including Manchester to Bournemouth via Birmingham; Bristol to Paignton, Devon; Cardiff to Nottingham; and Birmingham to Stansted airport. Avanti West Coast told passengers: “The pandemic is unfortunately resulting in some staff shortages. We’re doing everything we can to run our full timetable but there may be some short-notice cancellations.” The firm has removed all peak ticket restrictions over the Christmas period in a bid to spread demand. Govia Thameslink Railway said a train crew shortage means there will be a reduced service across the Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern network until the end of the day on Christmas Eve. Greater Anglia said it has removed trains from its timetables due to falling passenger numbers “as people follow advice to work from home”. It added: “We also have to plan for our staff being affected by the Omicron variant, especially as we’re already starting to see the early signs of its impact, to ensure we can continue to provide a reliable service.” In Australia, a NSW man who absconded from hotel quarantine in Hobart and sparked a three-day lockdown across southern Tasmania has been sentenced to five months’ jail for breaching public health orders. Much of the island state, including the capital, was forced into lockdown on 15 October after Timothy Andrew Gunn, 31, returned a positive coronavirus test having spent time in the community. He had been directed to quarantine at Hobart’s Travelodge hotel for two weeks when he landed several days earlier on a flight from Melbourne. Gunn told emergency staff he had been in Queensland for the 14 days before arriving when he had in fact spent time in NSW. Tasmania had banned travel from NSW at the time. Gunn had earlier pleaded guilty to failing to comply with the lawful direction of an emergency management worker, and knowingly providing false or misleading information. He was sentenced in Hobart magistrates court on Tuesday to five months’ jail, with two of those suspended. The UK government borrowed £17.4bn in November, outstripping economists’ predictions and suggesting debt could far overshoot officials’ forecasts if the Omicron coronavirus variant slows the economy as expected. It was the highest November borrowing since comparable records began 30 years ago, barring last year. Last year, during the furlough scheme, the Treasury under Rishi Sunak set successive peacetime records for monthly borrowing as it covered the costs of 80% of salaries for millions of people as well as support schemes for businesses. Significant borrowing has continued in 2021, with £136bn borrowed between April and November, according to data published on Tuesday by the Office for National Statistics. That was the second highest since records began in 1993. Some breaking news has just come in from Thailand. The country will reinstate its mandatory Covid quarantine for foreign visitors and scrap a quarantine waiver from Tuesday, the Reuters news agency reported. The move was confirmed by a government spokeswoman who said the action was being taken due to concerns over the spread of the Omicron variant of coronavirus. Germany’s leaders are set to decide on new restrictions to come in after Christmas aimed at slowing the spread of the new Omicron variant of Covid, but plans so far fall short of a full lockdown. Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Germany’s 16 state governors plan to consult later on Tuesday after the government’s new panel of experts called for action to be taken within days and said that nationwide measures are needed, “in particular well-planned and well-communicated contact restrictions”.” Officials have said that nightclubs will likely be closed regardless of local infection rates, on which closures currently depend. There are likely to be further restrictions on crowds at major events, while new contact restrictions are expected to be introduced for vaccinated people — with gatherings reportedly to be capped at 10 people. Restrictions already in place target mainly the unvaccinated, with proof of vaccination or recovery required to enter non-essential stores among other things. There would be “economic consequences” to further Covid restrictions, a UK government minister has stated as he said Parliament is not yet due to be recalled to discuss new measures. Steve Barclay told BBC Breakfast: “The Prime Minister has given a commitment that where there are additional regulations bought forward that Parliament would be recalled in order that Members of Parliament can scrutinise and debate those issues, but we are not at that stage. “We are looking closely at the data and we need to recognise there are economic consequences to further restrictions.” He also said that the government will “say more” about its discussions with business leaders calling for more financial support later on Tuesday He added: “There is much that we still don’t know but we are still looking at that data on what are very finely-balanced decisions.” Covid vaccine maker Moderna does not expect any problems in developing a booster shot to protect against the Omicron variant of coronavirus and could begin work in a few weeks, chief executive Stephane Bancel said in an interview. Moderna hopes to start clinical trials early next year on a vaccine to protect against the fast-spreading Omicron variant but for now is focusing on a booster dose vaccine. “It only needs minor adjustments for Omicron. I don’t expect any problems,” Bancel said in an interview with the Swiss newspaper TagesAnzeiger published on Tuesday. The company was awaiting important information on the variant to begin development. “That will take another week or two,” Bancel said. “It will take a few months before we can produce 500m doses after [regulatory] approval. But our capacities are much higher today than a year ago,” he said. If approval bodies such as the US Food and Drug Administration and Switzerland’s Swissmedic require further studies, that would add at least three months. “Some authorities want a study, others are still undecided. In my opinion, it depends very much on how severely the disease progresses,” he said. Iran’s top diplomat to Yemen died on Tuesday after reportedly contracting coronavirus, Iranian state TV has said, just days after he was abruptly recalled from his mission in the war-torn nation. The Associated Press reports: State-run media in Iran said Ambassador Hassan Irloo had become infected with the coronavirus in Yemen, where a conflict between Iran-backed Houthi rebels and a Saudi-led military coalition has raged for six years. Authorities said he was flown out of the country for urgent medical treatment in Iran over the weekend. However, The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Irloo was being removed from his post over growing strains between Iran and the Houthis, who seized Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north in 2014. In an effort to oust the Iran-backed rebels on its southern border, Saudi Arabia intervened in the war months later with a U.S.-backed bombing campaign. Iran’s foreign ministry has denied that his departure was the result of tensions with the Houthis. Houthi spokesman and chief negotiator Mohammed Abdul-Salam offered his condolences on Monday. He said earlier this week that the ambassador had departed Sanaa on an Iraqi flight made possible despite a Saudi air blockade on the capital through “an Iranian-Saudi understanding via Baghdad.” Hello, I’m Tom Ambrose and I will be bringing you all the latest Covid news over the next couple of hours. Let’s start with the news that New Zealand plans to shorten the gap between second Covid vaccine doses and boosters, as well as pushing back the phased reopening of its borders. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins told reporters the government has agreed to a “suite of precautionary measures” in light of the threat posed by the omicron strain of the coronavirus. The gap between a second vaccine dose and a booster will be shortened from six to four months, meaning 82 percent of vaccinated New Zealanders will be due for a booster by February. New Zealand’s strict border regulations so far have been successful in keeping omicron from spreading in the community. The only cases reported so far have been in travelers who are in managed isolation and quarantine. “Public health advice suggests that soon every case coming into our border, into our managed isolation facilities, will be the omicron variant,” Hipkins said. “We already know that booster vaccinations significantly lift an individual’s immunity, reducing the spread and the severity of Covid-19.” India has recorded 200 cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant across 12 states, mostly in the western state of Maharashtra and the nation’s capital New Delhi, the health ministry said on Tuesday. The country’s tally of Omicron cases has nearly doubled within a week, but there have been no deaths reported so far. In less than 40% of cases, patients either fully recovered or were discharged, the data showed. India has been accelerating its vaccination campaign amid fears of potential surges in infections, with at least one dose given to 87% of the eligible 944 million adults. India recorded 5,326 new Covid-19 infections in the past 24 hours, the lowest overnight tally in more than one and a half years. Overall, the country has reported 34.75 million cases, the second-highest behind only the United States. Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya told parliament on Monday that 80% of Omicron cases were asymptomatic. Bereaved families have accused Boris Johnson of showing “flagrant disregard” for the public as ministers struggled to explain the justification for a wine and cheese event in Downing Street at the height of lockdown. A Cabinet Office inquiry into other alleged government parties in breach of Covid rules could be expanded after the Guardian published an image showing the prime minister alongside his wife and up to 17 staff in the Downing Street garden in May 2020. Amid growing fury over the photograph, Johnson said on Monday: “Those were meetings of people at work, talking about work.” Labour dismissed Downing Street’s explanation and said it amounted to evidence of law-breaking. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said the lack of any signs of work, with red wine and a cheeseboard visible rather than laptops or pens, showed Johnson “presided over a culture of believing that the rules applied only to other people”. Read the full story here. Kuwait will require travellers arriving to the country to have a Covid booster shot if more than nine months have passed since their vaccination, the government communication centre said in a tweet on Monday. The procedures are to be followed for those arriving to Kuwait as of 26 December, the announcement said. Kuwait will also require incoming travellers to quarantine at home for 10 days unless they receive a negative PCR test for the coronavirus within 72 hours of their arrival. Scientists have reacted with dismay to Boris Johnson’s decision not to impose fresh restrictions to curb the spread of Omicron, emphasising that waiting until the new year would “almost certainly be too late to have a material impact on the epidemic”. Because the rate of growth in infection rates may already have plateaued or fallen by then, it may also be too late to know what impact those restrictions would have had if they had been introduced earlier. “We are damned if we do and damned if we don’t,” said Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. The prime minister announced after a cabinet meeting that he would not be introducing any further Covid restrictions for now, adding: “The situation is extremely difficult and the arguments either way are very, very finely balanced.” Data on the hospitalisation rate for those infected with the Omicron variant would be kept under “constant review”, he said, with government sources hinting that further restrictions were likely after Christmas, possibly starting a week tomorrow. Read the full story here. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you on the blog today as we unpack a busy day of Covid announcements and government changes over the Omicron variant. The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that holiday festivities would in many places lead to “increased cases, overwhelmed health systems and more deaths” and urged people to postpone gatherings. “An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters. In a blow to those wanting to join in on the celebrations in England’s capital, London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced the New Year’s Eve celebration event scheduled in Trafalgar Square will not go ahead because of the surge in Omicron cases. The event was set to host 6,500 key workers and members of the public but has been cancelled “in the interests of public safety,” Khan said. Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s news so far. The Omicron variant is spreading faster than Delta and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Travellers to Hong Kong from Britain will have to initially quarantine in a government camp from Tuesday, joining 12 African nations and the United States on the city-state’s strictest entry tier, Agence France-Presse reports. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has rejected a return to Covid lockdowns. New Zealand has announced a suite of measures to strengthen its defence against the Omicron variant, including pushing back the start of its quarantine-free border reopening for its citizens returning from Australia to the end of February. The Chinese city of Xi’an began testing millions of residents for the coronavirus on Tuesday after the detection of 42 new cases. Singapore has detected a cluster of three Covid-19 cases linked to a gym, its ministry of health said late on Monday. The White House says US president Joe Biden had close contact with a staff member who later tested positive for the coronavirus and is experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. Health officials in Texas say the state has recorded the first death related to the Omicron Covid variant. It is believed to be the first known recorded Omicron death in the United States. Omicron is now the dominant version of the coronavirus in the US, federal health officials said on Monday, racing ahead of Delta and other variants and accounting for 73% of new infections last week. Los Angeles has called off its New Year’s Eve celebrations as the Omicron variant sweeps across the US. The World Health Organisation declared 2022 to be the year ‘we end the pandemic’ while sounding a new warning about the Omicron variant, arguing some events over the festive period should be postponed. The Chinese city of Xi’an began testing millions of residents for the coronavirus on Tuesday after the detection of 42 new cases raised concerns of wider transmission, Agence France-Presse reports. China is now fighting local outbreaks in several cities, including key industrial hubs in the east and south. Authorities are intent to extinguish the flare-ups ahead of a crucial period that will see the capital Beijing host the Winter Olympics in February as well as a surge in cross-country travel during the Lunar New Year. Xi’an - a historic northwestern city of around 13 million people -has also shut schools and large indoor recreation venues while encouraging residents to avoid going out and congregating in large groups, according to local government notices. The museum housing the world-famous Terracotta Army - the 2,000-year-old mausoleum of China’s first emperor - said in an online statement that it had closed from Sunday “according to the needs of epidemic prevention work”, without giving a reopening date. The president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) Dr Omar Khorshid has called on the national cabinet to institute a national plan to tackle Omicron, while reinstating mask mandates for indoors and high-risk settings as well as density restrictions. “Tightening public health restrictions should not be seen as a policy failure,” Khorshid said. “There is a growing consensus among key medical experts [that] we need to do more to slow the spread of Omicron.” Khorshid described NSW premier Dominic Perrottet’s approach as “reckless”. DIY contact tracing, watered-down check in requirements, the abandonment of mask wearing mandates, and the removal of density limits altogether [are] a recipe for disaster and by the time hospital admissions and ICU cases grow beyond whatever benchmark he is working to – it will be too late. A much more cautious approach is required, at least until we know more about Omicron and its severity of illness. We are not going to be able to eliminate Omicron, but we can do a lot to slow its spread, reduce pressure on the health system, save lives and keep businesses open. Indoor mask mandates, mandatory check ins, density limits for venues and major sporting events, all need to be part of a stronger national response to Omicron.” Travellers to Hong Kong from Britain will have to initially quarantine in a government camp from Tuesday, joining 12 African nations and the United States on the city-state’s strictest entry tier, Agence France-Presse reports. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, Hong Kong has maintained some of the world’s toughest quarantine restrictions, with curbs increasing due to the Omicron variant. Most people arriving in Hong Kong must undergo 21 days of hotel quarantine and frequent testing before being allowed out. However, people from countries deemed to have high Omicron infection rates must spend the first four days of quarantine in a government-run camp before seeing out the rest of their isolation in a hotel. Britain was added to that list from midnight on Tuesday. The other countries on the highest tier are Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, the United States, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Will the UK face another Covid Christmas? That’s the question Guardian science correspondent Nicola Davis attempts to answer on the latest Today in Focus episode. The British government hasn’t cancelled Christmas – yet – but the rate of the Omicron variant’s spread should make us all reconsider our plans, Davis reports. Last winter, after promising the nation it would get to enjoy Christmas as usual, prime minister Boris Johnson’s government made an 11th-hour U-turn, introducing new Covid-19 restrictions in a last-ditch attempt to control the virus. It was “the right decision – made at the wrong time and in the wrong way”, as the Observer put it. This year, the government has been reluctant to be seen cancelling Christmas again. But as the Omicron variant sweeps through the country, rising case numbers are making the situation harder to ignore. Over the weekend, Sage issued guidance suggesting that whole households should stay home if one member tests positive for Covid-19. These guidelines, however, are only recommendations. On Monday afternoon, the prime minister and his cabinet held an emergency meeting to discuss the possibility of introducing new official restrictions, but ultimately decided not to announce binding new curbs quite yet. All this comes just days after the Guardian published a photo from a May 2020 garden party at Downing Street where Johnson and his partner can be seen apparently breaking lockdown rules. Guardian science correspondent Nicola Davis tells Michael Safi that while trust in the government has suffered, the public has consistently demonstrated a desire to adhere to measures for the collective good. Listen to the latest Today in Focus episode here. The NHL will begin a leaguewide shutdown on Wednesday amid an increase of positive Covid-19 test results among players across the league, ESPN confirmed on Monday night. Beginning the annual holiday break two days early means five additional games will be postponed, bringing the total this season to 49. The league and NHL Players’ Association on Sunday said in a joint statement they were attempting to avoid a leaguewide shutdown and were making decisions on a team-by-team basis. The latest shift gives all 32 teams an extended break before players, coaches and staff can gather again Sunday to skate and undergo coronavirus testing. Read the full story here. It’s been a busy day with announcements from global health bodies and governments changing course on Covid plans. Here’s a wrap-up of the day’s news so far. The Omicron variant is spreading faster than Delta and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has rejected a return to Covid lockdowns. New Zealand has announced a suite of measures to strengthen its defence against the Omicron variant, including pushing back the start of its quarantine-free border reopening for its citizens returning from Australia to the end of February. Singapore has detected a cluster of three Covid-19 cases linked to a gym, its ministry of health said late on Monday. The White House says US president Joe Biden had close contact with a staff member who later tested positive for the coronavirus and is experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. Health officials in Texas say the state has recorded the first death related to the Omicron Covid variant. It is believed to be the first known recorded Omicron death in the United States. Omicron is now the dominant version of the coronavirus in the US, federal health officials said on Monday, racing ahead of Delta and other variants and accounting for 73% of new infections last week. Los Angeles has called off its New Year’s Eve celebrations as the Omicron variant sweeps across the US. The World Health Organisation declared 2022 to be the year ‘we end the pandemic’ while sounding a new warning about the Omicron variant, arguing some events over the festive period should be postponed. Australian prime minister Scott Morrison has rejected a return to Covid lockdowns. Ahead of a national cabinet meeting, Morrison told reporters: We have to move from a culture of mandates to a culture of responsibility.” We’ve got to get past the heavy hand of government and we’ve got to treat Australians like adults.” State and territory leaders will hold a snap meeting before Christmas to discuss the issues posed by the Omicron variant. Morrison has been urging state leaders to avoid lockdowns and mandates. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has also issued a statement of reassurance while cautioning the country is “not out of the woods yet”. “We’re not out of the woods yet. But we’ve got your back, and we can get through this,” Trudeau said in a tweet on Monday evening local time. “We’ve secured enough boosters for adults across Canada, we’ve got enough vaccines for kids over 5 to get their first shot, and we’re sending more rapid tests to the provinces and territories.” US president Joe Biden has addressed Omicron concerns in a series of tweets on Monday evening. “Folks, Omicron cases are on the rise in the United States. I want to give you all a sense of where we are and what we know,” the president said, adding that vaccines are working. If you’re an adult choosing to be unvaccinated, you will face an extremely difficult winter for your family and community. Omicron cases will increase in the coming days—even among fully vaccinated individuals. If you’re vaccinated and boosted, you may still get a breakthrough case but doctors say you will likely have no symptoms or mild ones. We still need to take precautions and remain vigilant. Listen to the advice from doctors: even if you’re fully vaccinated, you should wear a mask when indoors in a public setting. It will help protect you and others—especially kids under 5 who can’t get vaccinated yet. We are working around the clock to increase testing capacity, vaccine availability, and support for our hospitals. I’ll have more to say on this tomorrow. In the meantime: Get vaccinated, get boosted, wear a mask. And keep the faith. We’ll get through this together.” South Korea is reporting 5,202 new confirmed coronavirus cases and 52 deaths over the last 24 hours. A total of 1,022 people are believed to be in critical condition. The country now requires its citizens over the age of 18 to present a quarantine pass, or proof of Covid vaccination or negative PCR test, in order to access indoor sports events, movie theatres or concert halls. Singapore has detected a cluster of three Covid-19 cases linked to a gym, its ministry of health said late on Monday. The variant was found in two men, aged 24 and 21, and an 18-year-old woman. Two cases have reportedly tested preliminarily positive for the Omicron variant and the result for the remaining case is pending. All three cases are fully vaccinated and have mild symptoms. The health ministry is now pursuing contact tracing, it added. “All three cases had no recent travel history. Our epidemiological investigations found that they recently visited Anytime Fitness (Bukit Timah Shopping Centre) between 15 December and 17 December 2021,” the statement read. There have been 71 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Singapore so far, with 65 imported cases and 6 local cases. The White House says US president Joe Biden had close contact with a staff member who later tested positive for the coronavirus and is experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. Press secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Monday night that the staff member tested positive earlier in the day. The statement read: On Monday morning, a mid-level staff member, who does not regularly have contact with the President, received a positive result for a Covid-19 test. Three days earlier, on Friday, that staff member had spent approximately 30 minutes in proximity to the President on Air Force One, on the way from Orangeburg, South Carolina to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. This staff member is fully vaccinated and boosted, and tested negative prior to boarding Air Force One, as is required for everyone traveling with the President. This staff member did not begin to experience symptoms until Sunday, and was tested on Monday.” Psaki added that Biden, 79, is tested regularly for the virus and has had two negative tests since Sunday. She says he will be tested again Wednesday. Los Angeles has called off its New Year’s Eve celebrations as the Omicron variant sweeps across the US. Organisers of the New Year’s Eve party planned for Grand Park in downtown LA nixed plans for an in-person audience, saying the event will be live-streamed instead, as it was last year. The event, which is operated by the Music Center, had been slated to include an invite-only audience of the county’s front-line workers and first responders. “Given the recent uptick in Covid-19 cases in the county, the Music Center/Grand Park team determined the safest route to continue with this popular annual tradition would be to eliminate a live audience,” event officials said, the Los Angeles Times reports. New Zealand has announced a suite of measures to strengthen its defence against the Omicron variant, including pushing back the start of its quarantine-free border reopening for its citizens returning from Australia to the end of February. Our reporter Eva Corlett has the full story below. The government will also accelerate the booster vaccine roll-out by shortening the gap between second and third shots, meaning 82% of the vaccinated population will be eligible for it by the end of February. The Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins announced travellers returning to the country will now be required to provide a pre-departure Covid test 48 hours before travel and the government is temporarily lengthening the time of stay in managed isolation and quarantine from 7-10 days. Read the full story here. Hipkins said: “All of the evidence so far points to Omicron being the most transmissible Covid-19 variant yet and public health advice says that soon, every case that comes into MIQ will be Omicron.” “Covid-19 keeps throwing new curve balls and we have to respond in a way that continues to protect lives and livelihoods without putting in place restrictions and lockdowns unless absolutely necessary.” Hipkins said the re-opening delay will be disappointing for those who had made travel plans over summer, but added that waiting until the end of February to open would increase New Zealand’s overall protection and slow Omicron’s spread. Cabinet also confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine will be rolled out to 5-11 year olds from January 17. The Omicron variant is spreading faster than Delta and is causing infections in people already vaccinated or who have recovered from Covid, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a Monday briefing: There is now consistent evidence that Omicron is spreading significantly faster than the Delta variant. And it is more likely people vaccinated or recovered from COVID-19 could be infected or re-infected. WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan added it would be “unwise” to conclude from early evidence that Omicron was a milder variant that previous ones. “... with the numbers going up, all health systems are going to be under strain,” Soumya Swaminathan said. The variant is successfully evading some immune responses, she added, meaning that the booster programmes being rolled out in many countries ought to be targeted towards people with weaker immune systems. “Although we are seeing a reduction in the neutralisation antibodies, almost all preliminary analysis shows T-cell mediated immunity remains intact, that is what we really require,” WHO expert Abdi Mahamud said. “Of course there is a challenge, many of the monoclonals will not work with Omicron,” she added. Health officials in Texas say the state has recorded the first death related to the Omicron Covid variant. It is believed to be the first known recorded Omicron death in the United States, according to a statement from Harris County health officials. The victim was reportedly a man in his 50s, who was unvaccinated and had underlying health conditions. The statement read: The death reported this afternoon was of a man between the ages of 50-60 years old who was unvaccinated and had been infected with Covid-19 previously. The individual was at higher risk of severe complications from Covid-19 due to his unvaccinated status and had underlying health conditions.” County Judge Lina Hidalgo made the announcement during an afternoon news conference. “My phone was ringing, I’m sure you guys noticed, and it was our public health director telling me we just had our first Omicron-related death,” she said. Omicron is now the dominant version of the coronavirus in the US, federal health officials said on Monday, racing ahead of Delta and other variants and accounting for 73% of new infections last week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention numbers showed nearly a six-fold increase in Omicron’s share of infections in only one week. In much of the country, Omicron’s prevalence is even higher. It’s responsible for an estimated 90% of new infections in the New York area, the south-east, the industrial midwest and the Pacific north-west. Since the end of June, the Delta variant has been the main version causing US infections. As recently as the end of November, more than 99.5% of coronaviruses were Delta, according to CDC data. Read the full story here. The World Health Organisation sounded a new warning about the Omicron variant, arguing some events over the festive period should be postponed. “All of us are sick of this pandemic,” said WHO director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. The fastest way to do this, he said, could mean potentially cancelling or delaying holiday events. “An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,” he said. The WHO says there’s now consistent evidence that the Omicron strain is spreading faster than the Delta variant Watch the video from Monday’s briefing below. The world must pull together and make the difficult choices needed to end the Covid-19 pandemic within the next year, the World Health Organization’s director general told reporters in Geneva. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus offered some hope to ending the pandemic, which already killed more than 5.6 million people worldwide, saying: 2022 must be the year we end the pandemic.” WHO pointed towards the development of second and third generation vaccines, and the further development of antimicrobial treatments and other innovations. The WHO’s top emergency expert, told the briefing: (We) hope to consign this disease to a relatively mild disease that is easily prevented, that is easily treated. If we can keep virus transmission to minimum, then we can bring the pandemic to an end.” As end-of-year festivities approach, the UN health agency chief said countries should rein in national events linked to the holidays because allowing crowds to gather would be a “perfect platform” for Omicron to spread. WHO warned that holiday festivities would in many places lead to “increased cases, overwhelmed health systems and more deaths” and urged people to postpone gatherings. “An event cancelled is better than a life cancelled,” Ghebreyesus said. It would be better to cancel events now and celebrate later “than to celebrate now and grieve later”, he added. Since it was first reported in South Africa in November, Omicron has been identified in dozens of countries. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you for today’s Covid blog as we countdown until the holiday break. First up, some positive news to share with you. The World Health Organization (WHO) has offered some hope to ending the Covid-19 pandemic, which has so far killed more than 5.6 million people worldwide. “2022 must be the year we end the pandemic,” WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Monday. “(We) hope to consign this disease to a relatively mild disease that is easily prevented, that is easily treated,” Mike Ryan, the WHO’s top emergency expert, added. “If we can keep virus transmission to minimum, then we can bring the pandemic to an end.” Over in the US Omicron has been found to be the dominant version of the coronavirus, federal health officials have said, racing ahead of Delta and other variants and accounting for 73% of new infections last week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) numbers showed nearly a six-fold increase in Omicron’s share of infections in only one week. Omicron is responsible for an estimated 90% of new infections in the New York area, the south-east, the industrial midwest and the Pacific north-west. Here’s a quick roundup of what’s been happening so far: The UK government held off announcing further Covid restrictions but its prime minister, Boris Johnson, warned further measures remain on the table, with data on the threat of Omicron monitored “hour by hour”. Johnson was accused of failing to follow scientists’ advice on the need for immediate restrictions while leaving millions of people and businesses in limbo after a two-hour cabinet meeting ended with no decision on Monday. Schools, bars, gyms and cinemas in Quebec will close as of Monday as public health officials race to slow the spread of the Omicron variant. All non-essential workers are being asked to work from home and restaurants will have to reduce their capacity to 50% and limit their hours from 5am to 10pm. London’s New Year’s Eve celebration event in Trafalgar Square will not take place because of the surge in cases of the Omicron Covid variant in the capital, the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, has said. The European Union’s drugs regulator has given the green light to a fifth Covid vaccine for use, granting conditional marketing authorisation to the two-dose treatment made by the US biotech company Novavax. Donald Trump was greeted with boos from a live audience after revealing he has received a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot. The former US president dismissed the crowd’s negative response and claimed his administration was responsible for developing the coronavirus vaccines. Moderna said a booster dose of its Covid vaccine appeared to be protective against the fast-spreading Omicron variant in laboratory testing and that the current version of the vaccine would continue to be Moderna’s “first line of defence against Omicron”. Britain reported 91,743 new Covid cases on Monday, the second-highest figure since the start of the pandemic, as the Omicron variant continues to spread rapidly. The number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test was 44. Queen Elizabeth will celebrate Christmas at Windsor instead of her usual choice of Sandringham over Covid safety fears, according to a palace source. The monarch usually spends the festive holiday at her estate in Norfolk and sources have said the decision was “a personal one after careful consideration and reflects a precautionary approach”. The Russian maker of the Covid Sputnik V vaccine is due to submit its latest data by the end of December, with manufacturing site inspections expected to follow in February, a World Health Organization official said. Panama has detected its first case of the Omicron variant of Covid, the Central American country’s health ministry said."

          "headline": "‘Like a freeway in traffic’: America’s busiest ports choked by a pandemic holiday",
          "bodyText": "The holiday season at the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, America’s busiest shipping complex, has always been hectic. But 2021 is a year unlike any other. A pandemic-induced buying boom and supply chain crisis led to an unprecedented backlog of ships lingering offshore and towering stacks of colorful containers clogging the entirety of the dockyard. Inside the port, thousands of workers are laboring around the clock to unload these containers one by one, sending the televisions, bicycles, medical supplies and more that they contain out to trains and waiting truckers, whose rigs stretch into nearby residential neighborhoods. The goods eventually make their way to warehouses and stores and into the arms of eager consumers. “It’s like being on a freeway in traffic”, Danny Miranda, the president of ILWU Local 94, the union that represents dockworkers, said of the port complex. “There’s nowhere to go. Every space is being utilized.” The frantic holiday season caps an unprecedented year for the port. Climbing consumer sales, worker shortages and the slowdown of major transportation hubs during the pandemic created a crisis in the global supply chain, leading to increasing costs and shortages of goods and containers. In June, the Los Angeles port became the first in the western hemisphere to process 10m container units in a 12‑month period. Month after month, the complex has regularly seen record-breaking numbers of cargo ships stuck waiting in nearby waters. The backlog, which left some ships idling in the waters outside the ports for weeks, churning out pollutants, is creating challenges for consumers and retailers alike, particularly amid the holiday season. “The last quarter of the year is always busy. You get out of the summer, bathing suits and lawn chairs and you get into the normal Christmas flow of cargo,” said Miranda, who started working at the port in 1978. “Never before have we had this much cargo come to our port in my experience.” Local officials and the Biden administration are working to reduce the backlog, including moving to 24/7 operations. But with a shortage of truck drivers to transport the goods and warehouse space to hold them, a return to normal levels of traffic is still far. As the pandemic took hold in the US, it brought lockdowns and restricted access to services, which sent consumer spending on goods surging. Americans are continuing to spend significantly more on goods than ever before and the supply chain is struggling to keep up. “Americans are buying 20-25% more containers from China. If you have a system that is designed to grow between 2-4% and you ask it to grow overnight by 25% … It’s not feasible,” Edward Renwick, vice-president of the Los Angeles board of harbor commissioners, said at a recent board meeting. The increased consumer demand, along with supply chain issues and a steady backlog of ships outside the ports which together move 40% of container imports in the US – are certain to affect holiday shopping this year. Experts expect to see shortages of items such as bicycles, toys and personal electronics and long delays for home appliances. “I think there’s gonna be quite a few things that are not going to be available for Christmas,” said Bill Michels, vice-president of operations, Americas at Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. “I don’t think people will be able to get the kinds of gifts they were intending to get. There’s gonna be less choices.” Retailers have encouraged consumers to buy early this holiday season. Meanwhile, the port complex has been working for months to address the backlog, teaming up with the Biden administration to find solutions, expanding working hours, pushing companies to clear out empty containers more quickly and securing additional storage space. In the early days of the pandemic, the ports were almost at a standstill, Miranda recalled, as imports slowed dramatically with Covid-19, creating supply chain issues around the world. Infections, too, slowed things; at one point earlier this year, before the widespread availability of vaccines, just over 5% of the 15,000 dockworkers at the two ports were infected with the coronavirus. Twenty-two workers have died of Covid over the course of the pandemic. “The pandemic created a lot of different things. People want their next day delivery. Amazon created that model and now we’re all stuck with it,” Miranda said. “People stayed home bunkered down during the pandemic and started utilizing online shopping. That’s where I think it started.” Port employees are moving more cargo than the complex has seen in more than a century of operation. Marine terminals are operating above 100% capacity to handle the surge, Gene Seroka, the LA port executive director, said at a recent meeting of the Los Angeles board of harbor commissioners. “There is no one lever that we’re gonna pull that simply gets all this cargo moving out of anchor as quickly as anyone would like,” Seroka said. “It’s all of these succinct efforts in unison that will continue to free up our docks to move more cargo.” Reducing the backlog at the port complex will ultimately require more truck drivers, experts warn, and a decrease in consumer demand. America needs about 80,000 more drivers than it currently has, according to the industry’s main trade body – a shortage fueled by low pay, long hours and challenging work conditions. California has increased the weight of loads truck drivers are allowed to carry on state highways and expanded the department of motor vehicles’ capacity to hand out commercial licenses. But without significantly more drivers to transport goods, the backlog will remain, said Katheryn Russ, an economics professor at UC Davis. “The only thing that will solve this, is having more truckers,” Russ said. “The most effective thing [would be] a boost in trucking wages and that lies with the trucking companies.” Supply chain issues can also serve as a wakeup call for consumers to consider their buying behavior, Russ said. “It gives me a reminder of the excess in my daily life,” she said. “That’s not the case for everybody but for a lot of us, we have too much stuff, so it’s a great reminder of how we can be gentler to the environment.” Miranda and port officials are hopeful that the $1.2bn infrastructure bill recently signed by Joe Biden will help alleviate long-term issues, with $17bn set to go to ports. Investments in the rail industry will also expand capacity, which will allow goods to move out more quickly. But in the meantime, the best approach to eliminate supply chain shortages, Russ said, is mitigating the spread of Covid-19, increasing the availability of rapid testing and resolving the pandemic. “Everyone who is complaining about supply chain shortages, whether it’s top of the government or people on the street doing the shopping, we should all be thinking what can we do to stop the pandemic,” she said. “There are things we can all do: masks, we can wash our hands, we can get vaccinated. “Those are all things we, as individuals, can do and should do as a patriotic duty to help the world to mitigate the virus and that will help our economy and prevent these supply chain related shortages.”"

          "headline": "The Guardian view: help us to help those on the climate frontline",
          "bodyText": "In August 1965, the German-born, Oxford-educated economist EF Schumacher published an article in the Observer. Titled “Help them to help themselves”, it criticised the prevailing model of aid to the developing world and proposed a new emphasis on regional planning and “intermediate technology”. If the west would give up trying to impose the latest production methods, he argued, it could instead unleash the “power of self-help”. That article led to the creation of a charity today known as Practical Action. The approach it pioneered, of supporting local people to make incremental changes to improve their lives, lies at the heart of the Guardian and Observer’s 2021 charity appeal. All over the world, as our recent “Living on the frontline of global heating” series showed, climate breakdown is having disastrous consequences for the people and communities who (along with their ancestors) have contributed least to the problem of global heating. Practical Action and the other three charities that we are supporting cannot stop carbon emissions. But they can, and will, help people in some of the hardest-hit areas and communities to adapt, survive and thrive. Practical Action does this by supporting farmers – for example, by supplying climate-resilient seeds and helping them to develop new practices. It also funds schemes that provide flood warnings, repair damage and develop clean energy. The Global Greengrants Fund UK, with whom we have partnered before, has overlapping aims, but a different focus: it identifies grassroots climate projects, including those led by indigenous people and focused on their rights, and awards micro-grants. In 2019, it channelled £250,000 donated by Guardian and Observer readers to rainforest protection groups in the ecologically critical Amazon basin. The Environmental Justice Foundation (EJF) campaigns for climate refugees, who lack status and protection in international law. In rich western countries, particularly those with temperate climates, we have so far been relatively protected from the most dangerous effects of the climate crisis. But all over the world, people are brutally exposed by environmental degradation, including deforestation, overfishing and water shortages. In the two decades since it was formed, the EJF has worked in some of the world’s least-accessible countries, using film and other tools to shine a light on human rights abuses linked to environmental insecurity. Finally, Kew is famous for its stunning gardens and botanical collections – one in London, another at Wakehurst in Sussex. But the Royal Botanic Gardens also has an important presence in Madagascar, one of the world’s diversity hotspots, where Kew scientists have worked for 40 years. The island is experiencing terrible droughts and cannot afford to build the pipeline that it needs to protect both nature and livelihoods, as was highlighted by its environment minister in Glasgow. The Kew charity will use its share of this year’s fundraising total to develop agricultural systems and restore denuded land (sometimes called rewilding) in such a way as to support people and protect their country’s extraordinary nature. The shortfall in the climate finance package promised by rich countries to poor ones is among the many grave failures of climate diplomacy. Our appeal cannot, of course, fill that huge gap. But thanks to the generosity of our readers, and despite the cancellation of last weekend’s telethon, we can make a meaningful difference to the lives of some of the people on the frontline of the climate crisis."

          "bodyText": "This year will go down in history as the year I went bald. Well, actually, 2018 went down as the year I went bald. But still, 2021 will go down as the year that I stopped fastidiously brushing three long wisps of cobweb over my scalp in the berserk belief that it somehow made me look less bald. I am bald now. Hello. Obviously, being bald is rubbish. A bad roll of the genetic dice means I am now conclusively unattractive in the eyes of most of the world. Of course I am – I’m 85% forehead now. I can never go out and commit a crime, because a witness would only have to draw a face on their thumb and show it to the Photofit guy and I’d be in handcuffs by teatime. In the end, I embraced baldness out of practicality. In the middle of 2020, bound by lockdown, I bought a £10 electric razor from Argos and started cutting my own hair. I was terrible at it. The sides I could do, because it was just like mowing a lawn. But I could never figure out what to do with the strands on top. So this spring, I gave up and shaved everything the same length. When I finished, I looked in the mirror and was greeted by the sight of scalp. Nothing but scalp. Where did the scalp stop? There was no longer any identifiable demarcation. Did my face count as scalp now? You expect a big moment like this to have some impact in the world. Double takes in the street. Awkward conversations with friends. Screams of horror from people who wrongly assumed that they were being stalked by Phil Mitchell. However, to my almighty surprise, nothing happened. I went bald and nobody batted an eyelid. In retrospect, this was because everyone in the world had accepted that I was bald long before I did, and they were relieved that they no longer had to suspend their disbelief about the ratty candyfloss cloud I was trying to pass off as a haircut. What I’ve learned from baldness is this: choose your role models carefully. For a while, mine was Stanley Tucci, but in reality Tucci does the bald a disservice. He is too charming, too handsome, too well dressed. We might think that we can harness our inner Tucci, but it’s impossible. He is a movie star, with a movie star’s presence. The rest of us could hire a stylist and train for a month and we would still look like someone who would beat you up in a Wetherspoon’s. Instead, I found myself glomming on to Larry David, who has this year become my uncontested bald oracle. Nobody on Earth seems to understand the bald experience like David. It was he who, upon winning an Emmy in 1993, strolled up to the podium and sighed: “This is all very well and good, but I’m still bald.” And it was he who, in March 2000, wrote a New York Times column headlined: “Kiss my head.” In the piece, which I have read and reread so often of late that I almost know it off by heart, David lays out the proper way in which a man should embrace baldness. Don’t hide it underneath a cap, he says. “Have you ever seen the looks on people’s faces when the bald man takes the cap off? They’re dumbfounded.” A cap-wearing bald man, according to David, is ultimately delusional. “You’ve tried to come off as a hair guy,” he chides. “You’ve lied, bald man.” David’s big lesson is that the bald man has to compensate somehow. “We have to have a little more going for us than the hair man,” he writes. “And we do. Have a conversation with a bald man sometime. Go ahead. Do yourself a favour. Tell me you don’t walk away impressed.” You just have to look at Larry David to see how true this is. As the seasons of Curb Your Enthusiasm have progressed, he has taken more and more pride in his appearance. His unconstructed blazers have grown sharper, his layering more complimentary. His ring of hair has grown out, too. And for all his apparent misanthropy, the Larry David smile is something to behold. When Larry David smiles, you’re blinded by charm. It’s a Julia Roberts smile. Only bald, so worse. This, I now realise, is the path I have to follow. Despite repeated attempts, Larry David did not respond to requests to be interviewed about this subject. Which makes sense. Nobody wants to round out their year by discussing their most visible physical flaw. But that’s OK. “Bald men love other bald men,” he wrote back in 2000. And that’s true. I love Larry David. I couldn’t have picked a better role model."

If you’d like to receive it in your inbox every week, just pop your email in below – and check your inbox (and spam) for the confirmation email. This week we’re taking a critical look at one of the most popular games in the world – one you’ve probably never played. If you’ve got any children in your life, you’re going to have heard of Roblox, a virtual world where you can dress a crude Lego-like character up and play random games like cops and robbers with other people. It is absurdly popular, with more than 200m players a month, and the developer behind it hit the headlines last year when it floated on the stock market and generated a $47bn frenzy. It is also pretty baffling for adults. A co-worker told me the other week that her daughter once presented her with a laptop and asked, “Mum, can you just spend an hour serving these pizzas for me? I need the Robux.” I’m going to be honest: I have never liked Roblox. I have kept my kids away from it, because I find it boring and ugly and I would rather they play Mario Kart with me. But I am a grown-ass woman, and Roblox is not for me. It is not a good game, at least not by any definition that makes sense to me, but its young players really love it, as evidenced by the literal billions of hours that they spend in it (not to mention the millions of YouTube videos that they make and watch). It is, essentially, a social space where kids hang out with each other, as many parents discovered over the course of the pandemic. Kids and teens form and find communities there, in the same way I did on game forums in the early 00s. They explore their identities, or learn about making games. I do not begrudge the kids their fun, and I’m not going to sit here and belittle the joy and meaning that they find in Roblox. It’s a strange venue for it, but it’s real. It turns out, however, that Roblox has a more troubling way than usual of making money from its players. Players earn Robux, the in-game currency, by making and playing games – and that currency has real-world value. Roblox shares some of the money that it makes off its players’ creations, but only a small percentage. And the thing is, kids’ creations are the ENTIRETY of Roblox; the company relies on kids to create stuff for other kids. Essentially, the company is profiting off the labour of children. Earlier this year, YouTube games journalism channel People Make Games released a video outlining how Roblox Corporation could be seen to be exploiting young games developers, going into huge detail on the sketchy economy that drives it and revealing just how difficult it is for any player to make money from Roblox. The video caused quite a stir, garnering nearly 1m views, and unsurprisingly elicited a furious response from Roblox itself. A follow-up video dropped last week, going further into the platform’s problems with child safety, the dodgy nature of its in-game economy, and the black market that’s sprung up around it. I talked to Quintin Smith, the reporter behind People Make Games’ investigations, about what he found when he started to dig deeper into a game that, despite being one of the biggest in the world, is poorly understood. “It was Roblox going public on the stock market in March of 2021 that first made me start paying attention,” he says. “Like a lot of people, I had this notion that Roblox was a silly, janky platform that kids sometimes liked to play on, and then overnight it was valued at almost $40bn.” Smith was shocked to discover the stock market-like collectibles system that drives Roblox’s economy: basically, kids can buy and sell items with fluctuating prices in the in-game marketplace, potentially making and losing thousands of Robux. “Broadly speaking, Roblox is getting away with stuff that other games publishers have been ruined for. And that’s the opposite of how it should be – Roblox should be under more scrutiny than other games publishers because of how extraordinarily young their users are. Nobody is taking children’s video games seriously … What this showed me is just how little time parents and market analysts have spent looking at Roblox. Apparently in today’s society you can be a tech company that’s floated on the stock market without anyone having even a semi-serious grasp on your business. That’s a terrifying thing to find out about our society!” Video games are absolutely plagued with vaguely immoral monetisation – whether that’s the free-to-play model, which relies on maximising profits from a small percentage of players who are willing to pay; or randomised loot boxes, a hopefully soon-to-be-banned way for games to extract money from players based on paying for the chance of acquiring some desirable virtual whatsit. (Let’s not even get into NFTs in gaming, a topic for another day.) Roblox is hardly extraordinary in this respect. But let’s remember: 50% of its users are under 12 years old. With all this in mind: should you ban your kids from Roblox? Like banning your kids from social media, that might prove both futile and detrimental to their social life. But that doesn’t mean you can’t educate yourself and your kids about what they’re playing. “It’s not necessarily the wrong move, but you’re pruning back something that their peers use to socialise,” says Smith. “What I would say is that parents should ALL know more about how Roblox works. You should know where the platform’s goals with regards to the safety of their audience don’t match up to reality. You should warn kids about scammers, abusers and the collectibles market, and they should know that if they decide they want to make games or cosmetics for Roblox themselves, that they should not expect anything resembling financial success.” It troubles me that Roblox’s model of play and monetisation – where games are increasingly dependent on their users spending more and more time and money on the platform – is seen as aspirational in the games business. It might make billions, but it’s ethically troubling – and it never seems to result in good art. What to play OK, look, this isn’t a game, but if you have a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S then you really must download The Matrix Awakens: An Unreal Engine 5 Experience, a free technical demo featuring Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, thousands of cars that you can drive around a New York-esque city, and the most jaw-droppingly realistic and detailed video game graphics I have ever seen in my life. I am not a game developer and instantly fall asleep as soon as anyone starts delving deeply into the technical side of gaming, but if you’re into that, there are all kinds of settings to tinker with to explore what this new-generation gaming technology can do. I’m happy to just sit there and gawp at it, idly changing day to night like an omnipotent god, and wish that I could show the 11-year-old version of myself who first watched The Matrix how incredible our virtual worlds and characters would look 20 years on. Available on: PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X. Approximate playtime: 1 hour What to read CNET’s Mark Serrels goes into how the Australian mining industry – which, for years, funded a lump-of-coal mascot to teach children about crossing the road and brushing their teeth – is now using video games such as Minecraft to ingratiate itself to young Aussies. Though we are thankfully no longer in the dark days of the 00s, when basically every single game character was either a gruff white dude or a cartoon animal, video games still have a diversity problem. Non-white protagonists are still quite rare, and so Kotaku’s Isaiah Colbert was disappointed to discover that the star of Square-Enix’s forthcoming fantasy game Forspoken appears to be “an amalgamation of Black stereotypes”. This is an important lesson on why it’s important to have a diverse workforce working on your games’ characters. Question Block We’re about to head into some fun/fraught festive weeks in the company of our families. So I asked comedian, Twitch streamer and longtime games journalist Ellie Gibson: what are the best games to play at Christmas? Picking family games to play at Christmas really depends on the kind of family you have. If you all get along marvellously and cruise through the festive season in a joyous bubble of harmony and camaraderie, try a game that requires teamwork like It Takes Two, Overcooked or Moving Out. If, however, you have a normal family, release pent up aggression and resolve decade-old grudges with classic racer Mario Kart or a modern fighter like ARMS. If you want something to suit all the generations, Just Dance requires zero gaming skills (and very little dancing ability, to be honest) so it’s great for getting everyone on their feet, even if Uncle Nigel’s had one too many sherries. But perhaps the most important game of all is the one you play when you need to escape from your family. I’d recommend Animal Crossing or Everdale for transporting yourself to a beautifully calm, ordered world where you’re in control, and nobody is arguing about whose turn it is to be the Top Hat.” What to click Strange, horny game ads are flooding social media.

          "bodyText": "Australia could have 200,000 new Covid cases a day by late January or early February under a “worst-case scenario” included in Doherty Institute modelling to be discussed at national cabinet. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will discuss the spike in Omicron cases and the vaccine booster program with state and territory leaders on Wednesday. The Doherty modelling suggests that without low-to-medium restrictions, Australia could reach 200,000 cases a day in just over a month’s time, Nine newspapers reported on Tuesday evening. A senior source who has seen the complete modelling told Guardian Australia that figure would only be reached “if we do nothing”. That scenario was based on people not altering their behaviour, no change to the booster schedule and only basic public health restrictions being in place. Nine newspapers reported the Doherty modelling suggested the high case numbers could lift hospitalisation rates to 4,000 a day and see between 8,000 and 10,000 patients admitted to intensive care units. Models provide information on a wide range of scenarios, and governments and health officials rely on dozens of models, never just one. No model predicts the future with certainty and Covid models that look at worst-case scenarios are usually wrong. But they are useful as they allow authorities to see what might happen if nothing was done to control an outbreak. Stricter mask mandates are on the agenda as state and territory leaders scramble to limit hospital pressure in the face of the spiking transmission of Omicron ahead of Christmas. At national cabinet on Wednesday, they will be presented with expert advice recommending mask requirements be in place over the festive period in jurisdictions that have not yet tightened Covid restrictions. Face masks will again be mandatory indoors in the ACT from Wednesday due to an increase in Omicron infections. They are also mandated in Queensland and Tasmania. Victoria has not ruled out tightening indoor mask mandates but will not make wholesale changes to restrictions for Christmas gatherings and major events to limit Omicron cases. Australia’s chief medical officer, Prof Paul Kelly, has urged all state and territory chief health officers to mandate masks in all indoor settings, citing rising case numbers for the new Covid variant. Victoria’s acting premier, James Merlino, says Victoria will take Kelly’s advice on board before making a decision on reintroducing compulsory masks in hospitality and entertainment venues. “Mask wearing is a prudent commonsense measure. It can be inconvenient but it’s a small inconvenience for a significant public health benefit,” Merlino told reporters on Tuesday. “There are no restrictions on getting together with loved ones, with family and friends to celebrate Christmas, to celebrate New Year, to enjoy the summer. None of those things are changing.” No change will be made to the unlimited crowd cap for the Boxing Day Test at the MCG, despite fears it could become an Omicron super-spreader event. “The contract with people of Victoria [was] get vaccinated and that means an end to lockdown, it means enjoying events,” Merlino said. In the ACT, masks will be required across indoor retail and hospitality venues as well as aged care, workplaces and on public transport. Aged care restrictions will also be reintroduced, with a limit of five visitors each day. The mask mandate will continue over Christmas and the new year period before it is reviewed in January. “Wearing a mask indoors is a small price to pay to keep your family and friends safe,” the ACT’s acting chief minister, Yvette Berry, told reporters. The national capital recorded 16 new infections on Tuesday and residents faced lengthy queues for testing. Some testing clinics were forced to close early after reaching capacity. Nearly 6,000 results were processed on Monday as demand for tests reached levels not seen since August. Half of the ACT’s 124 active Covid-19 cases have been identified as the Omicron strain. Three virus patients are in hospital but none have that variant. The chief health officer, Dr Kerryn Coleman, expected Omicron to become the dominant strain in the ACT. “We anticipate we will see an escalation in cases similar to that in NSW,” she said. “The unexpected emergency at this time of Omicron is posing an increasing risk to our community, and it’s why we have made the decision to reintroduce mask wearing.” Meanwhile, in NSW – where the premier, Dominic Perrottet has resisted calls to reintroduce stricter mask mandates and other restrictions as cases spike – symptomless residents have been urged to reconsider going to Covid testing clinics as a pre-Christmas surge caused delays. Clinics at Stanmore and the international airport in Sydney turned people away on Tuesday morning despite some waiting three hours. “It’s just frustrating,” Mitchell Jones, who went to both clinics before giving up, said. “I wanted to be safe as I’m needing to see elderly family in Newcastle over Christmas. I had run out of RATs [rapid antigen tests], and figured they were like gold now.” Extreme demand at Northern Beaches hospital’s drive-in testing clinic stopped hospital staff getting to work and led the management to stop testing asymptomatic people unless they were close contacts or needed to be swabbed for work. “Please be kind to our staff – they’re doing their very best in this time of high activity, as well as having some colleagues absent from work due to being community close contacts,” the hospital chief executive, Andrew Newton, said on Monday. NSW pathology labs have processed more than 700,000 tests since Wednesday evening with more than 12,800 coming back positive. The state reported 3,057 new local cases on Tuesday along with two deaths, with 284 people in hospital and 39 in intensive care. Perrottet on Tuesday said his government would tailor its settings to the current circumstances. “But we’ll make those changes based on facts not fear,” he told reporters, adding NSW would look at the new Doherty modelling to be presented to national cabinet. “This [Omicron] is just another challenge … I understand different people have different opinions from time to time but we are standing firm here in NSW and we remain strong.” Victoria reported 1,245 cases on Tuesday with six deaths. There were 392 people in hospital and 73 in ICU. The head of the AMA, Dr Omar Khorshid, said Omicron was spreading around the world like wildfire and the “threat is real”. “Our message to the states is focus on what you can do,” he told reporters. “You can require masks to be worn in indoor venues. You can keep some sensible limits on people getting together in indoor venues to try and minimise the impact of Omicron while we wait for extra data … it is a no-brainer in the view of the AMA.”"

          "bodyText": "For decades, scientists warned that urban encroachment on pristine habitats would unleash dangerous new viruses. Covid-19 should not have been a surprise – and, since viruses always mutate, neither should Omicron have been. Just as Omicron replaced Delta, something else will replace Omicron. It might be a fresh variant of Covid; it might be something completely new. “[A]nother pandemic is coming,” says Debora MacKenzie in her book Covid-19: The Pandemic That Never Should Have Happened, “and no one can predict which pathogen will cause the next one.” That doesn’t mean we can’t prepare. Even as we deal with Omicron, we need a long-term strategy, so that we’re not caught unawares countering each fresh outbreak. Here are four necessary (though perhaps not sufficient) slogans to arm ourselves with. 1. Make vaccines free, everywhere and for everyone In the 1950s, when a journalist asked virologist Jonas Salk who owned the polio vaccine, he replied, “Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?” Humanity eradicated smallpox by treating vaccines as a public good, created (for the most part) by publicly-owned agencies and distributed on the basis of need. But that was before big pharma, in what journalist Alexander Zaitchik calls “a profoundly undemocratic expression of concentrated corporate power”, pushed for the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) of 1994, an agreement that transformed vaccines into private intellectual property. Thanks to Trips, the horror of Covid-19 delivered a massive payday for pharmaceutical corporations like Pfizer and Moderna, even as they declined to license the technology to manufacturers in developing nations, arguing, controversially, that the lack of expertise, resources and manufacturing capacity in those regions makes doing so pointless. To date, the world’s poorest nations have received only a woeful 0.6% of available Covid vaccines, an obscene disparity and one that creates a pool of permanent illness in which the viral mutations can develop. As the People’s Vaccine Alliance (an organisation backed by Amnesty International and a stellar array of former and current world leaders) says, no one’s safe until we’re all safe. A pandemic in which more than two million people have died should not be a cash grab. Patents must be abolished. If the corporations can’t deliver vaccines to everyone, they should be nationalised and replaced by institutions that will. 2. Rebuild health and science The Covid-19 crisis revealed the international consequences of underfunded and neglected health services. Medical staff have performed heroically during the pandemic but everywhere they are burnt out and exhausted. Governments must invest massively in medical resources, reversing the austerity of the last decades and creating the specialised facilities – from purpose-built quarantine centres to emergency wards to stockpiles of protective equipment – that will be needed. That means more frontline staff in every setting from hospitals to old age homes; it also means more researchers and scientists. In Australia, the university sector continues to collapse, having lost a staggering 20% of its pre-pandemic workforce. Ongoing budget shortfalls threaten both teaching and research. Medical expertise and research capability can’t be created overnight. We must start rebuilding now. 3. Create community-driven, health-focused responses Pandemics disproportionately affect the poor, the marginalised and the oppressed. The people most at risk from viruses tend, in other words, to be those who fear or distrust the authorities. That’s why the response to a medical emergency should not centre on police and soldiers. Many governments reacted to the emergence of Covid-19 with punitive measures such as curfews, military patrols and new criminal laws. But a health crisis is neither a war nor a policing operation. There’s a much better model to follow. The remarkably successful campaign against HIV/Aids was spearheaded by activists from communities directly affected by the pandemic. It was they who disseminated information, offered services and induced behavioural change, even as they fought against prejudice and discrimination. With a frightening disease spreading, agency and outcome can’t be separated. A population that takes charge itself, that translates health messages into its own idiom, that collectively decides on what to do and how, will deliver far better results than the sternest policeman. Because a pandemic exposes social inequality, the best responses will necessarily entail a fight for social justice – and, as such, they will be led by the oppressed themselves. 4. End the war on nature We can and should plan to mitigate the effects of novel viruses. But we will only reduce their frequency if we curtail the ecological destruction that contributes to pathogens crossing into human populations. As cities expand into previously uninhabited wilderness, habitat loss brings animals and birds into unnatural proximity with people, allowing viruses to find human hosts. The impoverished fringes of sprawling metropolises, and the industrial agriculture associated with them, provide an ideal setting for mutations – and in a globalised world, an infection in one place becomes an infection everywhere. That’s why scientists worry so much. As MacKenzie warns, there are lots more coronaviruses out there – and plenty of fresh horrors we’re yet to encounter. We can’t keep playing whack-a-mole with each new crisis. We know what’s coming. If we don’t plan to counter it, tomorrow will be like today, except much, much worse. Indeed, Covid-19 should be understood not as an additional disaster piled upon a calamitous heap of fires, floods, heatwaves and tornadoes, but as a specific manifestation of a broader environmental emergency.In a way, that might even be good news (or, at least, as close as we get now), since the fight against the pandemic isn’t a distraction from the fight against climate change. Rather, the two represent two facets of the same campaign, an increasingly desperate struggle to salvage the future."

          "bodyText": "Almudena Grandes, who has died of cancer aged 61, achieved the rare feat of being both a very popular and a highly serious writer. A bestselling novelist, newspaper columnist, radio commentator and outspoken leftwinger in her native Spain, she became the main literary voice of a mass movement to recover her country’s historical memory. The government of José María Aznar in the early 2000s encouraged rightwing revisionism that falsified the history of the Spanish civil war and prettified Franco. In response, anti-Francoists and their descendants began to speak out against the murders, torture and imprisonments of the dictatorship. Even today, disgracefully, over 114,000 victims of Franco still lie in unmarked graves. “Spain is the only democracy in Europe,” Grandes wrote, “that turns its back on its own anti-fascist tradition.” She embarked on the ambitious project of a series of six novels with the title Episodios de una Guerra Interminable (Episodes in an Endless War), to record the forgotten struggles and suffering of anti-Franco fighters, especially women. Five of the six have been published, selling some 1.3m copies between them. The first, Inés y la Alegría (Inés and Happiness), came out in 2010. It is the story of the communist invasion of the Vall d’Aran in the Pyrenees in 1944, told not in heroic terms of military prowess, but mainly through Inés, cook for the partisans. The fourth, Los Pacientes del Dr García (Dr García’s Patients, 2017) won the Spanish government’s national narrative prize. Grandes’ model was Benito Pérez Galdós (1843-1920), Spain’s pre-eminent realist novelist, whose Episodios Nacionales (National Episodes) covered most of the 19th century. Like Galdós, Grandes focused on the lives and feelings of ordinary people trampled by history. Both were writing historical fiction in order to change the present and shape the future. She also appeared regularly on radio programmes and in 2008 took over the Monday back-page column that Manuel Vázquez Montalbán had made famous in the newspaper El País. She was a supporter of the political coalition United Left and took part in election campaigns, movements against male violence and for women’s rights, and campaigns against repressive legislation. One of four children of Manuel Grandes, who ran a plumbing business, and his wife, Benita Hernández, Almudena was born and brought up in Madrid. She told how she was a fat child who never got a part in the Christmas play. Her intimate revenge was in reading and dreaming of becoming a writer. She studied geography and history at Madrid’s main university, the Complutense – to please her parents, she said, though she would have preferred Latin. Belonging to the generation that came of age in the new post-1977 democracy, she plunged into the Madrid Movida, the youth explosion of freedom following the grey, repressed years of the dictatorship. After graduation she worked as a writer of encyclopedia texts. The research and time limits gave her, she said, the discipline to write. Her first completed book was the taboo-breaking Las Edades de Lulú (1989, translated as The Ages of Lulu, 2005), which won the Sonrisa Vertical (Vertical Smile) prize for erotic fiction. Not just literary porn, the novel explored the difficulties and joys for women in the new Spain, though many feminists saw it as a fantasy for men. Its unexpected success (more than 1m copies sold in 20 languages) gave Grandes the confidence and cash to write full-time. Her 1990s novels were mainly stories of young women finding their feet in the whirlwind of 80s Madrid. Los Aires Difíciles (2002, translated as The Wind From the East, 2006) is a saga of family conflict and secrets revealed, set mainly in Rota, on Andalusia’s Atlantic coast, where Grandes herself spent her summers for 30 years. Like most of her novels, it is long, packed with stories and characters and is almost a typical beach-read blockbuster; but it is slower, with deeper psychology, more like a fine 19th-century novel. Grandes entertained with powerful stories; and also wanted her readers to think. El Corazón Helado (2007; translated as The Frozen Heart, 2010) deals with a family shattered and split by the civil war. It opens with a young woman whom no one knows appearing at the funeral of a wealthy man. This device borrowed from sensationalist novels at once pulls in the reader. Like subsequent novels, it is a sweeping epic, covering decades of history and, in the case of The Frozen Heart, geography from Russia in wartime to contemporary Madrid. Six of her 13 novels have been made into films, including The Ages of Lulu, which was directed by Bigas Luna with Javier Bardem in his first starring role. Grandes is survived by her husband, the poet Luis García Montero, whom she married in 1996, their daughter Elisa, her son Mauro, from a previous relationship, and her stepdaughter, Irene. • María de la Almudena Grandes Hernández, novelist, born 7 May 1960; died 27 November 2021"

          "bodyText": "Off he stomps in his union jack socks, the pantomime John Bull who caused so much damage by doing his master’s bidding. As David Frost, the former Brexit minister, departs in a self-important huff, his reasons for going illuminate the strange decline of a once great election-winning machine. Frost’s resignation letter – which takes aim at Covid restrictions – usefully captures the Tory party’s deranged state of mind. Its call for “a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy” brims with a primal yearning to liberalise health, safety and food regulations, and workers’ rights. Recently he warned that Brexit will fail if “all we do is import the European social model”. Of all the airily out-of-touch Conservative party conference speeches, his was the wildest: “The British renaissance has begun!” He walks away just as all the world can see the consequences of Brexit: acute job vacancies, supply blockages, daffodils set to rot in the fields, pigs incinerated on farms and the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showing £12bn lost in EU trade in October alone. Frost was a bellicose negotiator who lacked the cunning, tact or subtlety for the job, reneging on the Northern Ireland protocol in his own deal: his value was slavish obedience to Boris Johnson, who plucked him from obscurity at the Scotch Whisky Association, after he had left a career at the Foreign Office. But he’s a useful emblem for the state of a party whose fact-denying Brexit disease now infects every other policy. These irrationalists, like the court of King Canute, think the waves of Covid can be commanded by cabinet fiat, defying Sage’s dire warnings that the NHS will be overwhelmed without stronger restrictions now. Ten cabinet ministers, a third, are reported to be resisting. Though Frost’s letter calls for a post-Brexit Britain at the “cutting edge of modern science”, these eccentrics deny science, evidence, probability and numbers. After “freedom day”, where were their preparations for this variant – or the next? They share Johnson’s contempt for the precautionary principle, despite the public seeing security as any government’s first duty: will voters ever forgive him for an NHS meltdown or more preventable deaths after his capitulation on Monday? Look at how out of kilter this party is with most opinion. “High on their own supply,” as one pollster tells me, their ideologies are not shared by Tory voters, or even Tory members, as Prof Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London, finds. The party has lost the ballast of those “men in grey suits” who used to get a grip on the guy ropes. Now even Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee of Conservative backbenchers, is damning current restrictions as a “disastrous assault on liberty” that evoke the Soviet Union. In contrast, the pollsters at Savanta ComRes find half of voters support a two-week lockdown and 64% would ban large events. The public is not blase about this disease. Meanwhile, in the Sunday Telegraph, a flurry of hand-wringing rightwingers beseech: “We need to return to our core beliefs and remember what makes us Conservatives.” (Danny Kruger MP, co-author of that article, was stood down by Michael Howard as a Tory candidate after calling for “creative destruction” in public services.) Old Labour hands will laugh knowingly at Tories responding to public rejection by diving deeper into their more obscurantist true religions: that’s usually the far left’s affliction. People in Westminster normally worry about getting “cut-through” to voters; everything is upside down when voters see how little cut-through their own views have with the party in power. When exactly did the Tories lose their chameleon talents? Labour used to despair of the party’s skill at remaking its image with whatever it took to tune into the public mood. Remember David Cameron’s pre-2010 brand, his hugging huskies, his “big society” – disguising the austerity axe to come. That self-preserving instinct deserted them the day they set aside caution and chose Boris Johnson, knowing his every fault, his reckless life of alternative truths and his unfitness for any responsible job. The Faustian pact yielded them gold in the 2019 election – but now the price is paid. Their punishment is disaster after disaster. Much worse may happen if the unexpurgated tapes of former No 10 spokesperson Allegra Stratton emerge. Long recordings of her rehearsals exist, reports the Mail on Sunday, where she is thrown all the unanswerable questions about Johnson’s “love children”, “mistresses”, his money and every lifelong wrongdoing. No wonder they scrapped those press conferences. If Downing Street parties took place, 63% of people say the prime minister should resign. The Guardian’s picture of his cheese-and-wine event in May 2020 was taken when the rest of us could meet just one person outside for a single hour, two metres apart. The Tories steel themselves for a possible brutal verdict from Sue Gray, the new head of the inquiry into whether several parties took place in Downing Street and elsewhere (she is dubbed the “battleaxe” by nervous insiders). If the Tories purge their leader, they’ll install someone infected by yet more unpopular small-statery. It’s in their nature. But it’s those who chose Johnson who are the problem, too many of them are the fanatics and fantasists who brought us the great Brexit delusion. Look how Steve Baker just “cancelled” the culture secretary, Nadine Dorries, from his 100-strong Clean Global Brexit WhatsApp group of MPs to see quite how divided and factious they are; how remote from voters. Can they recover from this frenzy in time? Never underestimate their focus on power, but what would it take to revive a party that lionised David Frost, and basks in all this outlandish Steve Bakerism? Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": " Stormzy among Black Britons celebrated in schools competition ",
          "bodyText": "Kelly Holmes, Stormzy, Mary Seacole and the violin virtuoso George Bridgetower are some of the inspirational figures honoured in a competition that set children and young people the challenge of creatively celebrating great Black Britons. The winning entries in one of the biggest ever school competitions celebrating Black British history included pictures, poems and videos. The initiative, whose sponsors included the National Education Union (NEU), was run by Every Generation Foundation, a social enterprise aiming to promote the history of diverse communities, founded by the Windrush campaigner Patrick Vernon. He was also co-founder of the 100 Great Black Britons campaign, and the competition entrants were asked to base their submissions on one or more people from that list. Vernon said: “I am just amazed with the fantastic response and quality from entries which were completed during the last Covid lockdown by schools and children. This is one of the biggest school competitions supporting and celebrating Black British history to date. This demonstrates the appetite and hunger for learning and for more inclusion of Black history in the national curriculum.” Lisa Death, from Suffolk, the winner in the preschool category, created a collage paying tribute to Mary Seacole. The Crimean war nurse, who topped the first list of 100 Great Black Britons, based on a public vote, in 2003-4, was also the subject of a poem by the winner in key stage 3, Holly Hicks, from Berkshire. Trevor Sterling, chair of the Mary Seacole Trust, said it was “an incredibly important competition, raising awareness of great Black Britons, which educates and inspires young people”. Scarlett O’Conner was a winner in the key stage one (KS1) category, with her picture of Kelly Holmes, who won the 800m and 1500m gold medals at the 2004 Athens Olympics – a feat still unmatched by any female British runner. Another winner in KS1 was Theo Woodhouse, from south London, who created a model of a racetrack, replete with hurdles, to honour another one of Britain’s greatest ever athletes, the former 110m hurdles world record-holder Colin Jackson. In the oldest category (16-25), Molly Marshall, from Suffolk, won for an essay she wrote on the importance of sport to combatting racism in Britain. She highlighted how the likes of Lewis Hamilton, Dina Asher-Smith and Raheem Sterling are “trying to promote change, which will hopefully make the world of sport and, more importantly, the world a more equal society for Black people”. Mahithi Krishna, from London, was the winner in key stage 2, for her depiction of Edward Enninful, editor-in chief at British Vogue, the first Black person to hold the role. Her school, Kensington prep, said Mahithi was “over the moon and is very proud that she has been able to contribute towards recognition of talented individuals from a Black British background”. Bethany Higgins, from south London, was a runner-up in key stage 4 for her homage to Stormzy. On top of two chart-topping albums, the grime MC has spoken out on issues including the Grenfell Tower fire and police brutality. Last year, he announced he would donate £10m to Black British causes over this decade. A musician of a very different ilk inspired the winning entry in key stage 4. Caitlyn Bailey, from Hertfordshire, created a poster paying tribute to George Bridgetower, a violinist for whom Beethoven wrote the Kreutzer Sonata. Caitlyn said the competition had been “a great opportunity to research in more detail individuals who have made an impact on history but perhaps remained unnamed”."

          "headline": "Gabriel Boric vows to ‘fight privileges of the few’ as Chile’s president",
          "bodyText": "Gabriel Boric has vowed to unite Chile, fight “the privileges of the few” and tackle poverty and inequality after winning a decisive victory over his far-right opponent to become the South American country’s youngest president. The 35-year-old leftwing former student leader won 56% of the vote in Sunday’s second-round presidential election, cruising past his ultra-conservative opponent, José Antonio Kast, who took 44.2%. The triumph of Boric, who belongs to a generation deeply opposed to the extreme economic model bequeathed to Chile by the Pinochet dictatorship, comes two years after a rise in metro fares triggered huge protests and demands for drastic changes to the political and economic system. The president-elect, who will be sworn in on 11 March, said the time had come for a radical overhaul of Chilean society and its economy. “Men and women of Chile, I accept this mandate humbly and with a tremendous sense of responsibility because we are standing on the shoulders of giants,” he said in front of a vast crowd packed into a Santiago boulevard. “I know that the future of our country will be at stake next year. That is why I want to promise you that I will be a president who will take care of democracy and not jeopardise it, a president who listens more than he speaks, who seeks unity, who looks after people’s daily needs, and who fights hard against the privileges of the few and who works every day for Chilean families.” Boric said his generation wanted to have their rights respected and not be treated “like consumer goods or a business”, adding the country would no longer allow Chile’s poor to “keep paying the price” of inequality. He added: “The times ahead will not be easy … Only with social cohesion, refinding ourselves and sharing common ground will we be able to advance towards truly sustainable development – which reaches every Chilean.” The new president said he would be “the president of all Chileans … and serve everyone”. Boric also highlighted the progressive positions that launched his improbable campaign, including a promise to fight the climate crisis by blocking a proposed mining project in the world’s largest copper-producing nation. He also called for an end to Chile’s private pension system – the hallmark of the neoliberal economic model imposed by Augusto Pinochet. Boric thanked each candidate in turn – including Kast – and reinforced his commitment to Chile’s constitutional process, a key consideration for many as the country embarks upon this latest chapter in a turbulent period of transition. The new administration is likely to be closely watched throughout Latin America, where Chile has long been a harbinger of regional trends. It was the first country in South or Central America to break with US dominance during the cold war and pursue socialism with the election of Salvador Allende in 1970. It then reversed course three years later when Pinochet’s coup ushered in a period of rightwing military rule that quickly launched a free-market experiment throughout the region. Kast won the first-round vote on 21 November by 2 percentage points, but Boric was able to prevail on Sunday by expanding beyond his base in Santiago and attracting voters in rural areas. In the northern region of Antofagasta, where he finished third in the first round of voting, Boric trounced Kast by almost 20 points. Ghosts and old divisions returned to haunt the bitterly fought campaign, during which Kast – who has a history of defending the military dictatorship – sought unsuccessfully to caricature his rival as a puppet of his Communist party allies who would upend Latin America’s most stable, advanced economy. However, Kast proved unexpectedly magnanimous in defeat. After tweeting a photo of himself congratulating his opponent on his “grand triumph”, he visited Boric’s campaign headquarters to see the new president. Kast, a father of nine, also said: “Gabriel Boric can count on us.” Chile’s outgoing president, the conservative billionaire Sebastián Piñera, held a video conference with Boric to offer his government’s full support during the three-month transition. In Santiago’s subway, the flashpoint for the 2019 protests, young supporters of Boric waved flags emblazoned with the candidate’s name while jumping and shouting as they headed into the city centre for his victory speech. “This is a historic day,” said Boris Soto, a teacher. “We’ve defeated not only fascism, and the right wing, but also fear.” On a sweltering day in Chile, voting was marred by public transport difficulties across the country, although the government claimed it had done everything in its power to guarantee voters could reach polling stations. Turnout for the vote – in which 1.2 million more people cast their ballots than in the first round – was nearly 56%, the highest level since voting ceased to be mandatory nine years ago. Boric will become Chile’s youngest modern president when he takes office, and only the second millennial to lead in Latin America, after El Salvador’s Nayib Bukele. Only one other head of state, Giacomo Simoncini of the city-state San Marino in Europe, is younger. “It’s impossible not to be impressed by the historic turnout, the willingness of Kast to concede and congratulate his opponent even before final results were in, and the generous words of President Piñera,” said Cynthia Arnson, the head of the Latin America programme at the Wilson Center thinktank in Washington. “Chilean democracy won today, for sure.” The markets reacted less enthusiastically, with Chile’s peso falling and its dollar-denominated stock index slumping 10% on Monday. The peso’s 2% fall left it down nearly 20% since Chileans elected a constitutional assembly dominated by leftwing and independent representatives in May to redraft the country’s market-oriented constitution. • The headline and first line of this article were amended on 21 December 2021 to correctly refer to the “president” of Chile, rather than the “premier” as an earlier version said.

          "headline": "Fast, furious and futuristic – Extreme E looks to turn a corner",
          "bodyText": "As his engineers tinkered away with the car parked in the tent just behind him, the former Formula One world champion Nico Rosberg looked down the mud-splattered paddock and said: “For all sports in the world, this is the direction we need to go in.” Rosberg, now a full-on sustainability entrepreneur since hanging up his racing gloves, was back competing, albeit this time as founder and chief executive of RXR racing. “This is the first motorsport ever to be built on a social cause. We are a global role model for sport.” His new role has brought him to deepest Dorset in the middle of winter for the final race in the inaugural season of the innovative Extreme E championship, an FIA-sanctioned series for electric off-road SUVs. This new concept of racing is designed to shine the spotlight on the climate crisis by holding races in remote parts of the world affected. After events in Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Greenland and Sardinia, the season should have ended in Patagonia but for pandemic reasons it’s being held at Bovington Army camp on the south coast of England. This race has been named the Jurassic X-Prix, certainly not a reference to any dinosaurs, more a nod to the famous coastline nearby. Just a few tents down from Rosberg’s was the car belonging to a very familiar foe and the only one that could stop him from lifting this year’s title – the purple liveried X44 team, formed by Sir Lewis Hamilton. “How cool is this?” the German said. “Not only are we fighting for a championship, we’re also in it for a good cause. The more intense our battle, the more impact we’ll have, the more awareness we can raise – that’s amazing.” All weekend, much like the rest of the season, the two teams had dominated, going head to head down to the final lap of the season (stop me if you’ve heard this one before). In the end the X44 car was by far the strongest on this course, driven by Cristina Gutiérrez of Spain and the seven-time world rally champion Sébastien Loeb of France. It put them level on points with RXR, who finished fourth here, but Rosberg’s team claimed the title by having more race victories. Agony for Hamilton’s team (again). The paddock was full of motorsport celebrities. Jenson Button was there, in charge of his team JBXE, while the former rally world champions Carlos Sainz and Loeb were both driving. Jutta Kleinschmidt, the first female Dakar Rally winner, was there too, as was Jamie Chadwick, the first winner of the all-female W Series in 2019, who followed up with victory again this year. This is because gender equality also plays a major part in Extreme E’s philosophy. Unique in the world of motorsport, each team has to field one male and one female driver, with equal roles to both. Catie Munnings, the 24‑year‑old British driver for the Andretti United team, only made her debut in the world rally championship last year but this year she has been racing against heroes such as Loeb. She is the unofficial face of Extreme E and even represented them at the recent Cop26 in Glasgow. Button is fully behind the mixed‑gender racing of Extreme E. “Motorsport has been a male‑dominated sport for decades,” he said. “But this brings a lot of awareness to female drivers, which is great. It means we’re going to see more girls at a young age get interested and that will filter up.” Each of the nine teams has one car, a fully electric SUV named Odyssey 21. These futuristic machines are nearly identical, the only alterations the teams are allowed to make are with the bodywork. The batteries have been developed by Williams Advanced Engineering, designed to withstand the extreme temperatures, conditions and terrains. They can produce a maximum power output of 470kW (equivalent to approximately 630bhp) enough to project the 1,780kg SUV from 0-62mph in 4.5 seconds at gradients of up to 130%. To power up the batteries, Extreme E is using pioneering hydrogen fuel cell technology which will enable its race fleet to be charged using zero emission energy. This innovative, off-grid solution from AFC Energy uses water and sun to generate hydrogen power. Not only does this process emit no greenhouse emissions, its only byproduct is water, which is utilised elsewhere on site. The racing for this X-Prix was held over three days, rather than two for the others, due to the shortage of daylight, with two sets of qualifying on the first two days followed by semi-finals and then a five‑car final on the Sunday. There was also a “crazy race” thrown into the mix, a kind of repechage, in which the slowest qualifiers vie with each other to win the last spot in the final. Every race consists of three laps of the 3.8km circuit: two laps by one driver then a quick changeover in a designated “switch zone” before one lap by the other. It’s fast, furious and futuristic. The defining feature of the course is the 5.4metre “knife edge” jump, which features a 23‑degree slope, making the cars airborne. The noise from the cars is a mix of electric screeching, much a like a pig squealing, and the clatter of stones sent flying. One of the key components to Extreme E’s global adventure is docked in Poole harbour for the duration of this round. Instead of using carbon-heavy air freight to transport all the kit for the championship around the globe, the organisers transformed the former Royal Mail ship, St Helena, which had been serving in the South Atlantic for 26 years. She isn’t fully electric yet, as she proclaims in bold down the side of her hull, instead running on a low-sulphur marine diesel, known as “champagne” in the industry. At every venue for an X-Prix this season Extreme E’s scientific committee has selected a legacy project, a chance to highlight and provide help with a local environmental issue. In 2022 the National Trust is hoping to reintroduce beavers for the first time in 400 years to the Little Sea area near Studland, in the wetlands at the heart of its dune system. Wetlands are particularly vulnerable areas when it comes to changes in climate and biodiversity, but beavers act as nature’s water engineers. This weekend’s final race was held in front of no spectators, just a small gathering of sponsors witnessing the action. This was a decision by the organisers to keep fans away and reduce the carbon footprint their attendance produces. As soon as the race had finished in Dorset, the usual motor-racing rituals had to be played out. Then, once all the champagne had been sprayed and post-race interviews completed, Rosberg and his two ecstatic drivers jumped into the quagmire together and rolled around with delight."

          "bodyText": "Gabriel Boric, a leftist former student leader, will become Chile’s youngest president after storming to a resounding victory in a run-off vote against his ultra-conservative far-right opponent, José Antonio Kast. With nearly 97% of the vote counted, the 35-year-old claimed 55.8% to take a 12 percentage point lead over Kast, who quickly accepted his defeat and called Boric to congratulate him. “We are a generation that emerged in public life demanding our rights be respected as rights and not treated like consumer goods or a business,” Boric said in front of a vast crowd packed into a Santiago boulevard. “We no longer will permit that the poor keep paying the price of Chile’s inequality.” Boric has vowed that he will oversee a youth-led form of inclusive government to attack nagging poverty and inequality, which he has pinned on the free market economic model that was imposed during the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship. His progressive campaign promises included fighting climate by blocking a proposed mining project in the world’s largest copper producing nation and ending Chile’s private pension system — a hallmark of the Pinochet neoliberal model. “The times ahead will not be easy,” Boric said on Sunday. “Only with social cohesion, re-finding ourselves and sharing common ground will we be able to advance towards truly sustainable development – which reaches every Chilean.” His relative inexperience was regularly highlighted by his rivals, but on Sunday night Boric was fluent and assured as he reiterated his campaign pledges before the raucous crowd of supporters. He thanked each candidate in turn - including Kast - and reinforced his commitment to Chile’s constitutional process, a key consideration for many as the country embarks upon this latest chapter in a turbulent period of transition. “Just, truth and respect,” Boric said as he signed off to deafening cheers. “We will continue.” Kast, a father of nine, said earlier outside his campaign headquarters: “Gabriel Boric can count on us.” The air on Sunday night was split by the sound of car horns and the jubilant chants of Boric’s supporters, who thronged the street corners, plazas and wide boulevards of downtown Santiago. “This is such a massive win – I still can’t quite believe it!” exclaimed Communist party congresswoman Karol Cariola outside Boric’s campaign hub in downtown Santiago. Kast won the first round vote in 21 November by two percentage points, but Boric was able to prevail on Sunday by expanding beyond his base in Santiago and attracting voters in rural areas. For example, in the northern region of Antofagasta, where he finished third in the first round of voting, he trounced Kast by almost 20 points. In Santiago’s subway, where a fare rise in 2019 triggered a wave of nationwide protests that exposed the shortcomings of Chile’s free market model, young supporters of Boric waved flags emblazoned with the candidate’s name while jumping and shouting as they headed downtown for his victory speech. “This is a historic day,” said Boris Soto, a teacher. “We’ve defeated not only fascism, and the rightwing, but also fear.” On a sweltering day in Chile, voting was marred by public transport difficulties across the country, although the government claimed it had done everything in its power to guarantee voters could reach polling stations. Boric, who comes from Punta Arenas in the far south of Chile, has enjoyed a meteoric rise from student politics to be the next occupant of La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace. He has changed his image markedly since his participation in 2011’s student movement, emerging from a group of young student politicians to serve two terms in the national congress before running for the presidency. At 35, he will become Chile’s youngest ever president when he is sworn in on 11 March. His term lasts until 2026 and will encompass a period of social and political transformation for the country, which is currently rewriting its constitution – the result of the 2019 mass a protests.

          "bodyText": "Top story: ‘Public want to know government has got a grip’ Hello and welcome to this, the penultimate Guardian morning briefing of 2021. After tomorrow’s final edition, the plan is to come back on Monday 4 January 2022. It’s Warren Murray taking you through today’s news. Boris Johnson has been pictured with wine and cheese alongside his wife and up to 17 staff in the Downing Street garden during lockdown, raising questions over No 10’s insistence a “work meeting” was taking place. It follows the denial last week that there was a social event on Friday 15 May 2020 including wine, spirits and pizza inside and outside the building. The picture shows bottles of wine, a lack of social distancing and 19 people gathered in groups across the Downing Street terrace and lawn. Even in light of the new picture, it is understood No 10 maintains that it was not against regulations. A spokesperson said on Sunday: “Work meetings often take place in the Downing Street garden in the summer months. On this occasion there were staff meetings after a No 10 press conference. Downing Street is the prime minister’s home as well as his workplace. The prime minister’s wife lives in No 10 and therefore also legitimately uses the garden.” It comes as Sajid Javid says fresh Covid restrictions may be imposed before Christmas. They could include a cap on the number of families that can meet, or even hospitality closures. Government advisers have warned that without tougher measures, hospitalisations across England could be set to peak at between 3,000 and 10,000 a day, and deaths at between 600 and 6,000 a day. Javid hailed the fact that a record 906,656 booster jabs were delivered in England alone on Saturday. A No 10 source played down the chances of an imminent announcement, arguing that “plan B was only implemented a week ago, and we’re getting huge numbers coming forward for their boosters”. The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, said the public needed to hear “practical steps … The public want to know the government has got a grip but, tragically, Boris Johnson is so distracted by his own internal party pressures that he’s unable to provide the leadership this country needs.” * * * New Brexit big cheese – The foreign secretary, Liz Truss, is to take over responsibility for Brexit after the government’s chief negotiator with the EU resigned. David Frost’s departure dealt a body blow to an already weakened Boris Johnson, reeling from scandals and the loss of the byelection in North Shropshire. Frost said plan-B coronavirus measures prompted his decision, as well as tax rises and the cost of net zero policies. Truss will have to try to sort out problems with the Northern Ireland protocol. It comes as City of London firms are predicted to revive plans to shift staff to the EU once travel restrictions ease in 2022. Of the 222 largest UK financial services firms monitored by accountancy EY since the 2016 referendum, 44% have confirmed they are relocating staff or operations to the continent – up from 41% in January 2020, in the latest sign of the impact of Brexit on the UK economy. * * * Boric roars to power in Chile – A leftist former student leader has stormed to a resounding victory to become Chile’s president-elect. With nearly 97% of the vote counted, Gabriel Boric claimed 55.8% to take a 12 percentage point lead over his far-right opponent, José Antonio Kast, an ultra-conservative. Boric declared to a vast crowd packed into a Santiago boulevard: “The times ahead will not be easy.” Boric, 35, will be sworn in next March as Chile’s youngest-ever president, having amassed more votes than any presidential candidate in history. He comes from a radical generation of student leaders determined to bury dictator Augusto Pinochet’s bitter legacy once and for all. “Chile was the birthplace of neoliberalism, and it shall also be its grave!” he once declared. * * * Fast to free Nazanin – Women around the world will take turns to fast for 24 hours each in an attempt to put pressure on the UK government to secure the freedom of Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe from detention in Iran. The campaign follows the 21-day hunger strike by Nazanin’s husband, Richard Ratcliffe, outside the Foreign Office in London. Lisa-Marie Taylor, the chief executive of campaign group FiLiA, said women from the UK, India, Morocco and Iran had already signed up to take part. * * * Space telescope tinselled up – Final preparations are under way for the launch of the James Webb space telescope, built to peer back through space and time to the first stars and galaxies that lit up the universe. Regarded as the successor to Nasa’s Hubble space telescope, the mission is scheduled to blast off on Christmas Eve from Europe’s spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. More than 30 years in the making, Webb will orbit the sun, unlike Hubble, which circles the Earth. Its destination is the second Lagrange point, or L2, where the balance of gravitational forces will hold it in place between the Earth and sun.

Lunchtime read: His biggest role yet In 2019, the actor Volodymyr Zelenskiy rode a protest vote and was elected president of Ukraine, telling his supporters he would jail corrupt politicians and negotiate directly with Vladimir Putin to end Russia’s war in east Ukraine. Nearly three years later, Zelenskiy is staring down the threat of a Russian invasion, while he rallies western powers to his side and calls for aid. Sport Pyrrhic victories and pointless triumphs were all England had to hold on to on a sometimes comical day four of the second Ashes Test, leaving Joe Root’s team with it all to do if they are to stave off defeat on the final day in Adelaide.

          "headline": "Who is Gabriel Boric? The radical student leader who will be Chile’s next president",
          "bodyText": "Four months ago, 35-year-old Gabriel Boric confounded the polls to claim victory in a presidential primary he had barely been old enough to compete in. But on 11 March next year, he will now be sworn in as Chile’s youngest ever president – having amassed more votes than any presidential candidate in history. Boric is the driving force behind Chile’s abrupt changing of the guard. He belongs to a radical generation of student leaders who are grimly determined to bury dictator Augusto Pinochet’s bitter legacy once and for all. “Chile was the birthplace of neoliberalism, and it shall also be its grave!” he shouted from a stage the night of his primary win, his forearm tattoo peeking out from beneath a rolled-up sleeve. General Pinochet’s brutal dictatorship bestowed Chile with its extreme economic model, and Boric and his influential cohort of student leaders have taken it upon themselves to dispose of it. “I know that history doesn’t begin with us,” he declared on stage on Sunday night as president-elect before a baying crowd. “I feel like an inheritor of the long trajectory of those who, from different places, have tirelessly sought social justice.” Boric was born in Punta Arenas in 1986 and is fiercely proud of his home region, Magallanes, below the Patagonian ice fields. In 2011, as he entered the final year of his law degree, Boric became a leader of education protests across the country, in which thousands of students took over their campuses and faculties across a long, cold winter, spilling out into the streets to demand free, high-quality education for all. The protests were quelled with a modest compromise, allowing some students to study for free. Several of the movement’s young leaders later ran for office and joined the country’s congress or took up positions in local government. Boric never completed his degree, instead winning election to Chile’s congress in 2013 and serving two terms as a deputy, becoming one of the first congresspeople to come from beyond Chile’s two traditional coalitions in the process. But since narrowly losing the presidential first round to José Antonio Kast, a far-right supporter of General Pinochet, he has moderated his programme markedly, appealing to the centrist voters who have now propelled him into La Moneda. Unlike his firebrand days at the front of the marches, Boric is now neatly groomed, humble and serious – while he often wears a smart blazer covering his tattoos. His girlfriend Irina Karamanos joined him on stage on Sunday night after the results. He has pledged to decentralise Chile, implement a welfare state, increase public spending and include women, non-binary Chileans and Indigenous peoples like never before. But it is Boric’s ultimate goal of extricating the country from the binds of Pinochet’s dictatorship that will define his legacy. The next four years will see this process begin, as the 2011 student generation led by Boric, take on an even more important role than before."

          "bodyText": "JP Delaney (one of the pseudonyms used by the prolific author Tony Strong) writes well-paced thrillers with a great hook. Like Salman Rushdie and Fay Weldon, Strong was originally an ad man at Ogilvy &amp; Mather and his books are the kind you can read with half your brain somewhere else (in an airport lounge, hospital waiting room or booster queue) with no harm done. The Girl Before (BBC One) is the first of his Delaney books to be brought to the screen, and it has neither gained nor lost anything in translation. This is not a complaint. Solid storytelling is a great and needed skill, especially at this exhausting time of year and at the end of this particularly exhausting year or two (or three, four or five … ). I mean merely to manage your expectations, so you match material to mood and have as good a time as possible. The story comprises two alternating timelines. The first (chronologically speaking) involves a young couple, Emma (Jessica Plummer) and Simon (Ben Hardy), who move into One Folgate Street, a beautiful ultra-minimalist, fully automated house, designed and built by owner-landlord and enigmatic architect Edward Monkford (David Oyelowo, unerringly treading the fine line between self-possessed and creepy), in the wake of a traumatic burglary of their own home. All potential candidates are vetted by a questionnaire (sample queries: what are your only truly essential possessions; would you sacrifice yourself to save 10 innocent people; is your spider-sense tingling yet; why don’t you just play it safe and head over to Rightmove now?) and then interviewed by Edward. Despite Simon not wanting to live there because they are naturally messy and Emma promptly proving this by spilling her coffee over the blueprints on Edward’s desk, Edward (who seems – and I think we’ll formally capitalise this to make it as clear as it is in the book and on screen – Strangely Drawn to Emma) nevertheless accepts them as tenants. They have to sign a special contract that precludes, among other things, children, pets, rugs, ornaments, books, anything being left on the bed or floors or any new plants in the garden, and which allows inspections to make sure the 200 rules are being followed. Sure, you reason, as Emma crams the single wardrobe provided with every garment she owns and they immediately get a coke-fuelled, wine-spilling, candle-wax-dripping housewarming party underway, nothing can go wrong here. The second timeline involves a new tenant, Jane (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), who has also agreed to the exacting house rules, having made Edward’s grade. She is the first, the agent tells her, to do so in the three years since the last lot left and is also moving in the wake of a trauma. She also looks almost exactly like Emma, but surely this is just a massive coinkydink, yes? No. But again, no harm done. It’s the red flags that make it fun. Jane is savvier than Emma and Simon, and interrogates her landlord about the hows, whys and wherefores of her extremely affordable rent and his decision not to live in his own house. He explains that the electronic housekeeper system gathers information on “the user experience” – that’s you, Jane. Here, take this red flag. Don’t plant it in the garden, you’re not allowed, but take it please – and the data (“Almost nothing that Google or Facebook don’t know about you”) is in place of market rent. Oh, and he doesn’t live there because his wife and baby were killed by a collapsing wall on a site visit during the build. Anyway, sign here. Bouquets of flowers are left on her doorstep in the days after she moves in. Eventually, she catches the man leaving them. It is Simon. Why the flowers, bucko? Why, to mark the third anniversary of his wife’s death. Didn’t Jane know the previous tenant died there? For some reason, Simon does not remark upon the unmistakable resemblance between Jane and Emma, but fortunately the interest of Jane’s colleague is struck by the death-in-situ news and pulls up a picture of her online. Jane and friend agree they look very similar indeed. Anyway, sleep well in your rugless, bookless, clutter-free bedroom, subject to inspection at any time, Jane. Edward, who we see in his office moving a little Jane figure round a scale model of the house on his desk as he talks to her on the phone, asks her out later. She says no, then yes. By this point the red flags are floating in a pool of the brain matter that has peacefully deliquesced over the last hour and leaked gently out of your ears. That too is part of the fun."

          "bodyText": "In a jewellery shop close to Istanbul’s Taksim Square, Seda unzips an elegant black leather pouch and piles her gold jewellery on the counter to discuss selling it all. The shop owner gently places gold chains, rings and a pendant on a small scale, before immediately calling a trader to discuss the latest rates. “I used to look at the price of gold once a week. Now I look roughly 50 times a day,” says the owner, who asks that his name is withheld. He advises Seda to wait – perhaps the price will stabilise. Turkish citizens like Seda, who declines to give her surname, are frantically trying to find ways to cope as the lira continues a downward slide. The currency lost half its value against the dollar this year, falling almost 30% in November alone. Those without foreign currency or gold to sell are finding other ways to cut down, avoiding buying meat or turning to government-subsidised bread stands for sustenance. While the value of their money plummets, inflation has soared to 21%. Yet the president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has responded with a series of cuts to the base interest rate – in defiance of economic convention. After slashing it from 19% at the start of September to 15%, it was trimmed again to 15% on Thursday, driving the lira to a new lows. Erdoğan has framed this approach as an “economic war of independence” needed to drive up exports, foreign investment and job creation, but many citizens are struggling to adapt and survive to this new reality. Seda says she is looking to sell her gold to buy a house. “My husband said we should get the gold assessed. We’re undecided about what to do because the price of everything is fluctuating,” she says. “We can’t get a loan to pay for it as we can’t trust what will happen with the currency. I don’t know what to do.” “My husband is into crypto,” she adds. “I’m honestly trying to make him stop, it’s causing fights between us. He completely ignores the Turkish lira, he thinks crypto is the future.” Erdoğan spoke at the weekend about how he had lowered Turkey’s inflation to 4% before and promised to again achieve that 2011 level soon, but most economists see his approach as reckless and predict a rate above 30% next year. Many of Turkey’s leading financial figures agree, and the country has had four central bank chiefs in the past two and half years, while former finance minister Lütfi Elvan quit at the beginning of December. “The central bank has been purged of all sensible people, they’ve either been sacked or departed voluntarily,” said Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at the London-based Capital Economics. “It’s similar to the finance ministry, Elvan was seen as the last sensible person on policy and he was replaced by another Erdoğan loyalist.” Insisting that his “new economic model” will eventually bear fruit, Erdoğan told the public earlier this month: “We know what we are doing. We know how to do it. We know where we are going. We know what we will achieve”. He repeatedly encouraged Turks to take their money out from under their mattresses and put it into banks. Despite economic reforms intended to lower labour costs and spur exports, Turkey also raised the minimum wage. As the lira plummeted, gold traders have begun to sell in ever-smaller increments. One vendor on Istanbul’s busy Istiklal shopping street holds up their current most popular items, tiny ingots weighing two grams, one gram and a miniature half-gram bar, the latter on sale at that moment for 480 lira (£22). Another gold and currency trader, Hakki Liça, says his shop has removed the gold from the front of the kiosk because he was irritated by so many people coming to ask the latest prices, but not buying. If customers have lots of cash to offload through gold sales, he says, he calls traders in Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar and arranges a private sale. Most of his customers prefer dollars, so much so that some are changing Turkish marriage traditions and pinning foreign currency to brides rather than the traditional gold coins. “It’s more affordable I guess. Fifty dollars is better than gold,” he says. “About 70% of the customers are Turks, buying in panic. Maybe they have debts they want to get rid of,” he adds, leaning in to whisper: “Turks are buying a lot.” The lira declined 8% on Friday, while the central bank declared they had intervened to prop up the currency for the fifth time in a month. Turkey’s stock market, the Borsa, was twice forced to halt trading to prevent further losses. “Foreign exchange interventions might continue but they are neither a good strategy nor sustainable,” says Selva Demiralp, a professor of economics at Koç University and a former economist at the US Federal Reserve. “In Turkey, the root cause of the financial turmoil is the loose monetary policy itself. So unless the central bank switches to a tighter stance, demand for dollars will continue.” The government’s decisions are increasingly felt in the pockets of the average person. “Everything is expensive right now, we barely make ends meet. My family has moved in with my father-in-law to avoid paying rent,” says Gunay Akil, standing outside a supermarket known for its low prices. “There’s jobs but no money,” she adds, explaining that her husband’s firm that manufactures kitchen interiors is paying their employees in half-month increments, leaving most of them in arrears. She points to her shopping that day, a kilo of onions and a large cabbage. “This is what’s for dinner tonight – bread, yoghurt, and cabbage soup.” Akil was pessimistic about the coming year: “I have no hope that this inflation will stop.” The government’s promises of an economic boom are proving increasingly unpopular with the Turkish electorate, and appear likely to affect an election anticipated in 2023, if not before. Demiralp, who partnered with political scientists to research voting intentions, phrases it carefully. “Our preliminary research using November data shows that among those people who had voted for AKP [Erdoğan’s party] during 2018, there is a significant relationship between economic dissatisfaction and a reduced likelihood of voting for the current government.” At the gold seller’s, Seda is unwilling to say how she intends to vote, but offered a cautious prediction – “I believe some things are going to change.” Additional reporting Gökçe Saraçoğlu."

          "headline": "Strictly exclusive! Winner Rose Ayling-Ellis on the glitterball, Giovanni and the joy of being deaf",
          "bodyText": "When she was a small child – too young to remember, though her mother has told her this story – Rose Ayling-Ellis was once so delighted to be at the park, she excitedly climbed on to a bench and started dancing. People stopped and, unable to resist her infectious happiness, clapped and cheered along. Two decades later, millions more were clapping and cheering (and, I suspect, sobbing at times) as Ayling-Ellis and her partner, Giovanni Pernice, became 2021 Strictly Come Dancing champions in the most emotional and joyous finale I can ever remember. Yet, for once, it felt as if there were no losers: the runners-up, John Whaite and his partner Johannes Radebe, would have been easy winners any other year, as would AJ Odudu, who had to pull out of the final after an injury, but Ayling-Ellis had something extra – the show’s first deaf contestant, she had to work harder than anyone else, although the effort never seemed laboured. She is a beautiful dancer, light and agile and emotive. She radiates pure joy. “I was so shocked,” says Ayling-Ellis of the moment her name was announced, when we spoke briefly by Zoom, joined by a sign-language interpreter the morning after the final. “It was really weird – it felt like I was out of my body for a moment.” She is tired and happy – “We celebrated last night. There was a bit of prosecco, and dancing” – but she says it hasn’t really sunk in yet. It was emotional behind the scenes, she says; she had to get her makeup redone at least twice before the trophy announcement. But this probably helped when it came to being crowned champion: “I was crying so much beforehand that I ran out of tears,” she says – though as soon as she hugged her mum – who was sitting in the audience with Ayling-Ellis’s boyfriend – she “burst into tears and couldn’t stop”. Despite a strong series, with some of the best couples the series has seen, Ayling-Ellis, 27, was always a favourite. She was the first to get the perfect score of 40, which she did in week six. Her acting skills – she’s in EastEnders – are a given, but the expressiveness in her body (or “musicality” as the judges would put it), when she cannot really hear the music, is extraordinary. One dance, Ayling-Ellis and Pernice’s “couple’s choice”, was a powerful, celebratory routine that featured a silent section halfway through, in tribute to the deaf community. When they performed it again for the final, it lost none of its power – I watched it with goosebumps. “I love it so much,” she says of the show, when we spoke a couple of weeks earlier, after a long day in which she had been trying to perfect the American Smooth. “I love all the ballroom,” she says. “It’s the Latin I’m terrified of – it’s fast, there’s a lot of counting, it’s a bit more solo, you’re not really [dancing close] together. With ballroom, I don’t have to think as much.” She doesn’t “feel the vibrations” of the music, as has been claimed, but instead commits each step to muscle memory and counts them out in her head. “If I had to start thinking about vibration, it would distract me.” Also, she points out, there is a big difference in sound between the live band on the night and the recorded music played in rehearsals. Ayling-Ellis can hear some aspects of music, using her phone to Bluetooth it directly to her hearing aids (when, one day, she forgot to bring spare batteries, she and Pernice couldn’t rehearse). Part of the pleasure of watching the pair dance was Ayling-Ellis and Pernice’s affectionate partnership. “Giovanni has been incredible,” she says. “He really supports every single step – and I mean every single step: even when I’m doing stuff on my own he, off-camera, is giving me timing.” Learning the choreography is difficult for a hearing person; for Ayling-Ellis, it must have been a giant task. There have been days, she says, when she has struggled. “There are a lot of ups and downs and some dances are harder than others. But Giovanni is such a good teacher, and he’s really adapted to the way I learn, rather than making me learn it in his way.” Being on the show, she says, has “been life-changing. I try not to think about it ending too much because it makes me feel really sad.” How has it changed her? “I feel more confident. On the first week, I was really shy, but now I can be myself, and I definitely feel more comfortable in my own skin. The first week, I was like, ‘Everyone’s going to be expecting a deaf person to dance really badly.’” She smiles. “But I definitely proved a lot of people wrong.” When we speak before her eventual triumph, she says while winning would be great, “what is more important is breaking the barrier, proving that deaf people can do anything. I feel that I’ve achieved that, so even if I don’t win, I still feel like I’ve won.” Since Ayling-Ellis has been on Strictly, online searches for British sign language courses have gone up by 300%, and one training company told the BBC that the number of people enrolling had gone up by 2,000%. She has had lots of messages from deaf people, and parents of deaf children, who have said how much watching her has meant to them. “That’s made me quite emotional,” she says. “It’s 2021, and, finally, they’ve got something like that. It’s really good that it’s happening – but why has it taken this long? I didn’t have that growing up, and a lot of deaf people didn’t have that. So it’s really nice that we’ve got somebody out there.” She smiles, and adds: “I can’t believe it’s me.” She is thrilled that appearing on Strictly has challenged perceptions. “Hopefully, it will change the way people look at deaf people. That if they come for a job interview, they won’t freak out about it and will be more excited. I’m glad that it’s happening. We’ve been fighting for so long.” Were there people who were surprised she was going on a dance show? “Yes, because I think a lot of people probably …” She pauses. “I think, for deaf people, the thing we have to live with is that people have such low expectations of us. So when you do things that are normal, it’s like, ‘Wow!’. So I knew that me being on Strictly, a lot of people were probably thinking, ‘How’s she going to hear music, how is she going to dance?’ I always felt like I have to give 120%,” she says, “so that I can seem capable of doing it the same as everyone else.” Ayling-Ellis grew up in Hythe, Kent, and has an older brother; after her parents’ divorce, she lived with her mother. She had ballet lessons when she was a child, but not for long – and that was about the extent of her dance training. “In a home video, you can see all the kids with perfect timing and I’m trotting along behind trying to copy what they were doing,” she says. “I remember my first day with Giovanni, he was really shocked at my posture. He still tells me off for it.” She was, however, a very creative child, “always in my own bubble. I love art and making things, and I communicated a lot with my family through drawing.” She wanted to be an artist. At school, she says, it was the popular kids who did drama. “And I wasn’t very popular, so I never thought about doing drama.” At Ayling-Ellis’s school, there were only a handful of deaf students. “I didn’t get bullied, I still had a good time at school but I had to fight for my education,” she says. “They only had three notetakers, and [the deaf children] were in different classes, so most of them went to a classroom with no interpreter, no notetaker. My mum really fought to make sure I had a notetaker and interpreter with me at all times. I was lucky, but it was ridiculous. Unfortunately, that’s a normal life for many deaf children – they are in mainstream schools with no access.” The hard work was a real test, she says, “because that’s what life is going to be. You always have to fight for your access.” Not having to struggle for this made all the difference on Strictly. “I have an interpreter with me so I can understand what’s going on all the time. If I didn’t have an interpreter there, and I was trying to concentrate, trying to understand what everyone’s saying, I can’t be me, I can’t be myself.” Ayling-Ellis remembers realising for the first time she was different from others around her, when she was around four. “In nursery, we had this special deaf unit. I remember playing with other deaf kids, and looking out the window and it was all the hearing children outside. I thought, ‘Why am I not over there? Why am I in here?’ I genuinely thought everyone was deaf. “I feel really glad that I knew who I was from a very early age. I never ever once thought: ‘I wish I could hear.’ Because if I was hearing, I’d be a completely different person. I wouldn’t have the life experience that I have. I’d just be really normal.” She laughs. “I don’t want to be normal – that’s boring.” Being part of the deaf community “is very special”, she says. “It is the one place I can be where I fully understand everything. In the hearing world, I’m constantly having to lip-read and trying to understand what’s going on. Sign language is so beautiful. It gives you a strong identity, something to be very proud of – the community, the culture. I love the deaf community.” Ayling-Ellis’s family became involved with the deaf community quite early on, and her mother learned sign language. “They’re really supportive, and I love my family to bits, but I did feel, growing up, that I would love to have a deaf brother or sister, or someone deaf in my family. I was very lucky I had deaf friends and deaf people around me. But I wish I’d had a deaf role model.” One weekend, as a teenager, Ayling-Ellis went away on a film-making course with other deaf children. She was interested in animation, but tried it and didn’t like it. “They said I should try acting,” she says. “It was such a safe space, so you felt really safe to be yourself.” She fell in love with acting. She had been a confident child, “quite extrovert”, but had become self-conscious as a teen. With acting, “I felt a lot of freedom. And I realised I was not bad at it.” The director who was running the weekend, Ted Evans, asked Ayling-Ellis to be in his short film. But, she says, “I didn’t think it was something that I could do full-time – I didn’t see any other deaf actors out there.” Instead, she went to university to study fashion design, but kept acting with the Deafinitely Youth Theatre, and her career grew. Ayling-Ellis did theatre work, and had roles in Casualty and the Stephen Poliakoff drama Summer of Rockets before joining EastEnders last year, playing Frankie Lewis. Up to this point, she says being deaf has given her an advantage as an actor, because she is usually always considered whenever a casting director is looking for a deaf actor. “The problem is when it’s not a deaf role – that’s where I’ve found it really hard,” she says. “I’ve gone for auditions and they’ve said, ‘I really liked you, but we’re going to find a smaller role for you somewhere.’ But why can’t I play that role, a character who just happens to be deaf? EastEnders works really well, because the storyline isn’t about me being deaf – she’s just a character.” The conversation about diversity on television isn’t always that inclusive. “You see so many different races and sexualities – and it’s brilliant, it’s what it should be – but where are the disabled people? I can’t see many. It is changing, but very slowly, and in very small ways.” What would it have meant to see a Rose Ayling-Ellis on mainstream TV – in two of the BBC’s biggest shows – when she was growing up? “A lot. It’s not just for me, but also for my parents. When they first had a deaf child, they had never met anybody deaf before.” For parents who may be anxious about a baby’s diagnosis, or not know what it could mean for them, seeing Ayling-Ellis might make them think, she says, “that ‘my child can do whatever they want to do, because she can do that’.” Did she grow up thinking there was anything she couldn’t do? “I grew up knowing there’s always a way around things,” she says, smiling. “I just always knew that other people think I can’t do it, and that was a bigger barrier for me.” She has, with each joyous step, proved what she’s capable of. “It’s so much more than the glitterball,” she says with the immensity of her win still sinking in. “It feels like acceptance for a deaf person to achieve something like that. It means so much, and I know it means a lot for the deaf community, and for anybody who feels a bit different – to never think that you can’t do it, because it is achievable when you are given the opportunity.”"

          "headline": "No longer the prime minister’s man, David Frost has unfinished business",
          "bodyText": "On what would prove to be his penultimate day as Boris Johnson’s Brexit minister, during which he spoke with his EU counterpart, Maroš Šefčovič, for one last time, David Frost was disappointed. He was disappointed with the state of the talks over the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. He was disappointed with the EU for failing to finalise the UK’s involvement in its €95.5bn Horizon Europe research and innovation programme. It is understood that he was also pretty disappointed with those who had suggested that he had done a great big U-turn in recent days on Britain’s approach to the European court of justice in Northern Ireland. Actually, he had done it in the House of Lords the previous month but no one had been listening. Such is the lot of our peers of the realm. But, according to Frost’s letter of resignation, when it came two days later, he had become mostly disappointed with two big government policies of late: the reinstatement of Covid restrictions and the hiking of taxes in order to pay the country’s way out of the pandemic. These issues had clearly been on Frost’s mind for a while. He had indicated his displeasure over the government’s economic policies in a recent speech in which he had echoed Margaret Thatcher’s famous Bruges speech. “We have not successfully rolled back the frontiers of the European Union from Britain with Brexit, only to import that European model after all this time,” he said. But those who have known Frost well over the years suggest that there may have been an overarching disappointment bearing down on the ministerial mind. He was the prime minister’s man. Brought into government by him from relative obscurity. Promoted by him to the cabinet. When Frost had decided that he did not want to be national security adviser, a position he had been due to take up at the start of the year, Johnson had acquiesced, giving him his preferred job leading the way on EU issues. But, today, the prime minister is in trouble, both within his parliamentary party and among the membership. Frost is an ambitious man, with every reason to believe he should have a political career beyond this administration. His approval ratings among Conservative members ranks behind only the foreign secretary, Liz Truss. But he remained, until today, all too identifiable with the prime minister. Frost’s resignation letter, while not overtly critical of Johnson, did quite a bit to correct that. “I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change,” Frost wrote. Sources helpfully informed the Mail on Sunday that such concerns chimed well with the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, who Frost had explicitly namechecked and praised in his November speech. Those who have worked alongside Frost, 56, who is married to Harriet Mathews, the Foreign Office’s deputy political director, describe him as a “workaholic” and a “machine”. This was highlighted recently by his late-night Twitter spars with Ireland’s foreign minister, Simon Coveney. Part of Frost’s drive, it is suggested, has been a determination to prove his naysayers wrong. His solid career in the Foreign Office had culminated with his appointment as ambassador to Denmark, before returning to Whitehall as director of strategy. He quit in 2013 to become chief executive of the Scottish Whisky Association, a well-known outlet for those of a certain standing leaving the Foreign Office. But there appears to have been a sense of unfinished business. In a speech in Brussels at the start of the negotiations over the trade deal, he referenced his old boss, the former head of the diplomatic service, Lord Kerr, who had suggested that Frost was merely “good at doing what he is told”. It was, Frost had said in response, “as if no member of the UK foreign service could possibly have the same view of the European Union as our current prime minister without having been instructed to do so”. It may be the end of “the Great Frost”, as Johnson referred to his minister, in the negotiating rooms in Brussels for now. But Frost is a man on a mission. And you do not work within, and in opposition to, the EU institutions without learning a little about strategy."

Mikes005 I have a sneaking suspicion that, in 500 years, humans will have proved that intelligence does not reside in us. We have a planet tailor-made for the survival of all life on the planet, including ours.

It’s been there for thousands of years. Arguing about who owns it is stupid.” That’s the metaphor that describes humanity today, as smart as that rock is. Rcamejo We must dismiss the idea there was a widespread belief in a flat Earth 500 years ago. An interesting and sometimes surprising window on educated medieval perspectives on the cosmos is provided by Dante’s The Divine Comedy, written during the early years of the 14th century and entirely conceived within a spherical-Earth model of the universe. Hell is a huge funnel-shaped structure, centred under Jerusalem, descending tier by tier to its deepest point, which is located at the centre of the planet. Purgatory is an oceanic island in the southern hemisphere, at the antipodes of Jerusalem. Dante frequently makes reference to, for example, how midday on the Tiber equals sunset on the Ganges. Most remarkable of all, when Dante and his guide, Virgil, descend to the deepest pit of the inferno, where Satan stands waist-deep in a frozen lake, and they continue their journey by climbing down Satan’s shaggy pelt into a cavern below the lake, Dante is dumbstruck suddenly to find himself alongside Satan’s gigantic legs, which are now upside-down. Virgil patiently explains to him that he should not be surprised, as they have passed the centre of the Earth, to which all objects are drawn by gravity. Uppsalaman Neoliberalism is a theory well beyond its use-by date now, never mind in 500 years’ time! DiogenesPithos Materialism: the weird idea that consciousness somehow emerges from matter. PlatonicThoughts It’s not so much a matter of what will be (dis)proved, but what will be acceptable. Back in 500BC, Pythagoras postulated that the moon and the Earth were spherical, based on observation and logic. Then, in 240BC Eratosthenes noted that, at midday in one town in Egypt, the sun shone directly down into a well, whereas, at a distant town, at the same time of day, the light arrived at an angle. He used this, and the distance between the two towns, to calculate the diameter of the Earth – and made a pretty good fist of it, too. How did he measure the distance between the towns? This was in the days before Google Maps, so he paid somebody to walk between the two towns and count how many paces it took. That is the painstaking attention to detail, and the endless quest for truth, that epitomise the scientific method. Did the wider world pay any attention? No, because it didn’t fit in with the extant received wisdom that the Earth was flat, a “fact” that was obvious to anyone who looked at the horizon. Then along came Copernicus and, of course, Galileo, whose heliocentric models contravened the doctrine (and dogma) of the all-powerful church. The church ignored their postulations and proofs and insisted on its own – totally unproved – “model”. That is the painstaking attention to superstition and control of the masses, and the endless quest to suppress inconvenient facts, that epitomises virtually all major religions. So, it’s not a matter of being right; it’s a matter of being accepted. Maybe the best we can hope for is that, long before 2521, humankind (if it still exists) will have outgrown the need for religions. LewisWinders Almost none of the above is actually true. In rejecting Galileo’s model, the church was siding with the majority scientific opinion of the day. There was not, as yet, sufficient evidence for heliocentrism. Geocentrism wasn’t a simple superstition, but a well-established system that was able to predict astronomical events quite accurately. The Catholic authorities believed, quite reasonably, that as long as it did that then there was no reason to reject it. Galileo’s own definitive proof of heliocentrism – that the tides are caused by the Earth sloshing about in its orbit around the sun – was, of course, not only unconvincing but flat-out wrong. Moreover, much of the evidence supporting heliocentrism was gathered over the course of the 17th century by Catholic astronomers, particularly Jesuits, who were as committed to evidence-based science as any hard-nosed atheist. JonathanCR Science cannot find a proof for time; there is no experiment that shows that time exists. As a fairly rudimentary aspect of our lives and a fundamental aspect of all applied mathematics and sciences, it might be nice to solve that one.

Here’s looking at Euclid. flinders 1) That capitalism is a valid – and in any way morally acceptable – way of structuring our economic activity and distribution of resources. To paraphrase Captain Picard: “Our 20th-century ancestors, with their primitive economic systems!” 2) That nation states are a reasonable structure in which to invest sovereignty. 3) This one may be wishful thinking – the idea that the speed of light is unable to be exceeded. If the idea is sound, I hope the Alcubierre drive or something similar is plausible. The idea that we will never be able to explore the rest of the universe is one I find crushingly depressing. BostonMatt The theory that time travel is impossible. I’ve just nipped back 500 years from a post-Covid world to post this comment. FYI, the scientists ran out of Greek letters before we got to the “new normal” in the 2030s. galvinonthewing Five hundred years? By then, I suspect there will be a plethora of theories about the ancients (or aliens) who built cities and mastered arcane sciences such as manufacturing glass, flying machines and creating artificial light, along with generating and transmitting energy. Then there will be the inevitable fables about what happened to them. AwakenstoEmptiness"

          "headline": "Lord Rogers of Riverside obituary",
          "bodyText": "Richard Rogers, who has died aged 88, changed the face of urban Britain more than any other architect of the late 20th century. He was author of the groundbreaking Lloyd’s building in the City of London and the Pompidou Centre in Paris, but his impact was manifest less in his own buildings than in his influence on public policy, which saw a fundamental shift in the perception of inner cities away from being something to endure or escape, to being something desirable to enjoy. He ushered in the era of “regeneration”, seeing British cities adorned with canal-side apartments and cafe-lined squares, if sometimes at a cost to existing communities. Shortly after New Labour came to power in the landslide election of 1997, Rogers was appointed to chair the Urban Task Force, a quango charged with identifying the causes of urban decline in England and recommending practical solutions to bringing people back into cities and putting an end to suburban sprawl. The findings, published as Towards an Urban Renaissance in 1999, called for a new generation of “compact cities”, advocating the redevelopment of post-industrial brownfield land with high-density flats, shops and cafes, along with investment in public transport, public spaces and public facilities. Five years later, housing densities had risen from an average of 25 to 40 dwellings per hectare, and 70% of development was on brownfield land. Rogers’ principles would define the model of urban regeneration for the coming decades, for better and worse. His vision was presented as one of inclusivity and equality, but it would also foster greater displacement and division, producing a form of investment-fuelled development that saw his own practice design some of the most expensive housing ever built. While the socialist Labour peer argued for a city for all, his office was designing the fortified luxury apartment schemes of One Hyde Park, Neo Bankside and Riverlight, stacks of investment units that became symbols of London’s extreme inequality. Rogers often credited his urbane, cosmopolitan outlook to his Italian upbringing. He was born in Florence, in an apartment with a view of the Duomo. His father, Nino, was a doctor, whose own father, a dentist, was a British émigré to Italy. His mother, Dada (nee Geiringer), was an art-lover, who became a potter. She was the daughter of an architect and engineer from a notable Trieste family, and had once been taught English by James Joyce. They moved to Britain in 1939 to escape the rise of fascism, finding lodging in a single room in a boarding house in Bayswater with a coin meter for the heating and a bath in a cupboard. Cold, smoggy London at a time of rationing was a culture shock for the young Rogers. As he later recalled, “life switched from colour to black and white”. He was sent to Kingswood House boarding school in Epsom, a place he described as “brutal and unfair”, where he was regularly beaten and bullied, an experience that prompted him to become a good boxer. He grew in confidence at St John’s school in Leatherhead, where he discovered sporting ability, but he struggled with dyslexia and left school in 1951 without A-levels. It was during these years, Rogers later wrote, that he realised there was more strength in working as a group than being a solo high achiever, an outlook that would go on to inform his collaborative model of practice. During a major retrospective exhibition at the Royal Academy to mark Rogers’s 80th birthday, the curators admitted that they struggled to find a single drawing by the man himself. Rogers spent his national service stationed in Trieste, which proved to be a formative period. While on leave, he worked in the office of his cousin Ernesto Rogers, the feted architect of the Torre Velasca in Milan, which inspired him to apply to study at the Architectural Association on his return to London. He was an enthusiastic, if inconsistent, student. A tutor’s report in 1958 described his work as “chaotic and inarticulate”, but he impressed the examiners with his final project, a school for children with special educational needs in Wales, using locally grown timber and designed so that the pupils could participate in building. One of Rogers’s tutors, the brutalist architect Peter Smithson, noted his “capacity for worrying about the effect the building will have on people and a concern for shape on the inside,” which would prove to be a constant theme. Rogers met Su Brumwell in his third year. She was studying sociology at the London School of Economics and her parents were socialists, with deep roots in the Labour movement, giving Rogers early exposure to the political left. They married in 1960 and travelled to Yale the following year on a Fulbright scholarship, after Rogers spent a short spell working at Middlesex county council’s architects’ department. At Yale he met Norman Foster, and was taught by Paul Rudolph, whose designs for Yale’s Art and Architecture Building would have a great influence on his own designs for the Lloyd’s building years later. After graduating, he worked briefly in the San Francisco office of the corporate firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, which provided a useful lesson. “I quickly came to realise,” he wrote, “that working in someone else’s architectural practice was not for me.” On returning to the UK, Rogers, Brumwell and Foster, along with Foster’s wife Wendy Cheesman, set up a practice, Team 4, and began by designing a house for Brumwell’s parents in Cornwall, called Creek Vean. It was a steep learning curve. It took six years, almost bankrupted both the designers and their client, and saw Rogers and Foster summoned to the Architects Registration Council for practising without a licence. Their factory in Swindon for Reliance Controls, built in 1967, had a smoother ride. In its use of standardised industrial components, this elegant shed presaged the direction Rogers’ work would go on to take. The following year, after Team 4 split up, he and Su developed the ZipUp House, a prototype home designed to be assembled quickly and cheaply from insulated panels of the kind used for refrigerated trucks. “Buying clothes off the rack is the norm,” Rogers wrote. “We wanted to do the same for the house – an affordable, speedy kit of parts.” The concept was never realised, but the thinking influenced Parkside, the modular house he built for his parents in Wimbledon. A model of the ZipUp house, a streamlined yellow pod on bright pink legs, stood in the foyer of his office for decades to come, as the original high-tech, factory-assembled dream from which all else would be spawned. Rogers’ technology-driven production line principles would soon be explored on a much larger scale in a project that would change his career forever. In 1969 the French president, Georges Pompidou, announced a competition for a new multidisciplinary cultural centre on the vacant site of the Plateau Beaubourg in Paris. Rogers teamed up with the Italian architect Renzo Piano, to whom he had been introduced by his doctor, and, together, they dreamt up the most radical proposal of their lives. Their scheme for the Centre Pompidou was to be a great oil refinery of art, a mechanical transformer of a building, inspired by the comic book fantasies of Archigram and Cedric Price for a new kind of robotic architecture that would respond to changing needs, with plug-in components and moving floors. Huge digital screens would entertain crowds on a great sloping piazza outside, while escalators in glass tubes would shuttle people up the building’s facade, forming a dynamic backdrop to the mime artists and musicians down below. It was saturated with colour, its exposed pipes and ducts painted in the bright reds, blues and greens of the media age – a feature that would continue in Rogers’s work for years to come. The point, he said, was that “culture should be fun”. Their winning sci-fi vision met with a frosty reception in Paris. The architects were booed at the press conference, where balls of paper were hurled, along with accusations that they were building a low-brow supermarket of culture, an ocean liner run aground in the Marais, and a jungle gym for King Kong. Pompidou died and his successor cut the budget. The screens were dropped, the floors did not move and fire regulations curtailed some of the more daring ideas. Pressure groups filed lawsuits against the project, the Guardian’s art critic said the “hideous” object should be covered with Virginia creeper, while Robert Delaunay’s widow Sonia said she would rather burn his paintings than have them exhibited in the building. But the architects were vindicated by the public reaction: visitor numbers were five times those predicted. Around seven million people visited in the first year, more than the Louvre and Eiffel Tower combined. The Pompidou Centre marked a watershed: it was both a late flowering of 1960s utopianism and a premonition of the city-boosting “iconic” cultural architecture that would define urban regeneration in the decades to follow. The Parisian cultural tanker set the aesthetic and ideological agenda for the Richard Rogers Partnership, later Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, which Rogers founded in 1977 on his return to London. Structure would be exposed and express what it was doing, in as didactic a way as possible. It would be jauntily coloured too, matching Rogers’s vivid wardrobe of neon braces and acid-hued shirts. The ambition was to make buildings lighter and more flexible, to minimise structure while maximising space and light, and reduce demands on energy and the natural environment, in pursuit of a kind of technological sublime. In London, the thrilling potentials of this high-tech age were first proved in the new headquarters for the insurance giant Lloyd’s of London, completed in 1986. Formed of three towers around a 60-metre high atrium, lit by a huge barrel-vaulted glass roof, its most radical move was to place the service cores outside the building. This freed up more floorspace for desks, and provided Rogers with a chance to revel in the sculptural forms of staircases, glass lifts and toilet pods on the facade, composing a vertical symphony of polished stainless steel. It suffered a similar critical reception to the Pompidou at the time – it was subjected to accusations of “bowellism”, for presenting its innards on the outside – but it has since been recognised as one of the most significant buildings of the 20th century, in 2011 becoming the youngest structure to be Grade I-listed. Two years later, RSH+P completed the Leadenhall Building across the street, a tapering behemoth almost three times the height of Lloyd’s, known as the Cheesegrater, which followed similar principles, placing services to the north to free up the floors and creating an animated ballet of lifts on the facade. In a nod to creating more public space, the tower was raised on legs, 30 metres up in the air, although the heavily-managed plaza beneath has the feeling of a high-security lobby. The 1980s also saw Rogers begin to take a more prominent role in public life. In an exhibition at the Royal Academy, titled London As It Could Be, he set out ambitious plans for the capital, together with Foster and James Stirling, including burying the road along the Victoria Embankment to create a pedestrian-friendly public riverside, introducing new lightweight footbridges across the Thames and banishing traffic from the north side of Trafalgar Square – some of which ultimately happened in different forms. Rogers increasingly saw it as his duty to defend the cause of contemporary architecture against more conservative forces. In a series of high-profile speeches throughout the 1980s, the Prince of Wales launched a tirade of attacks on modern architecture, famously describing a proposed steel and glass extension to the National Gallery as “a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much-loved and elegant friend.” In a speech to the Corporation of London’s planning committee in 1987, referring to Rogers’s proposals for Paternoster Square, he said: “You have to give this much credit to the Luftwaffe: when it knocked down our buildings, it didn’t replace them with anything more offensive than rubble.” So the style wars began. Rogers responded with a long article in the Times, rejecting the Prince’s “Disneyland approach” of bolting on “disposable symbols like decomposed classical columns, pediments and cornices, or flimsy Gothic turrets and Egyptian palm trees,” and attacking his misuse of royal privilege to intervene in the planning system. Rogers maintained that the Prince’s interventions behind the scenes cost his firm work on a number of major projects throughout his career, including the transformation of the Royal Opera House and, most contentiously, his masterplan for Chelsea Barracks, which was shelved in 2009 after Prince Charles contacted the Qatari royal family. If the Prince wielded power behind the scenes, Rogers himself enjoyed a very public platform. He set out his vision for a new generation of sustainable compact cities in the Reith Lectures in 1995, published as Cities for a Small Planet two years later. In 1996 he was made a Labour peer, as Lord Rogers of Riverside. As the chair of the Urban Task Force, he argued for densely populated hubs linked by public transport, walking and cycling, and championed “the urban environment’s capacity to emancipate and civilise, rather than segregate and disempower”. With the establishment of the Greater London Authority in 2000, and the election of Ken Livingstone as the first mayor of London, Rogers was appointed to head up the new Architecture and Urbanism Unit, charged with improving design quality in the capital. “Ken wanted us to influence more than policy,” Rogers wrote. “He wanted us to make things happen.” The A+UU published design guides on streetscape, housing, density and green space, mapped high streets and town centres to identify opportunities for infill development, and launched a plan for 100 new public spaces across London. Only a few of these flagship projects were ever completed, but the A+UU played an influential role in putting design at the top of London’s political agenda – something that was swiftly removed by the next mayor, Boris Johnson, much to Rogers’s fury. While the built output of his practice never quite matched the visceral thrill of the Pompidou or Lloyd’s again, Rogers continued to produce elegant and engaging public buildings, from the law courts in Bordeaux and Antwerp to the National Assembly in Wales, where an image of transparency and public accessibility were always central. His tensile white tent for the Millennium Dome, while deemed a failure at the time, has gone on to house one of the most successful live performance venues in the world, in the form of the O2 Arena. Rogers was awarded the RIBA gold medal and Pritzker prize, and won the Stirling prize twice, for the Barajas airport, Madrid in 2006 and the Maggie’s Centre at Charing Cross hospital in 2009. The former is a rare thing: an airport that does not make you want to escape as soon as you have entered. With its undulating bamboo roof floating above an avenue of branching rainbow-coloured columns, it is a calming place that soothes the stress of international travel. It took just eight years from conception to completion, a stark contrast to Rogers’ scheme for Heathrow Terminal 5, which was subjected to the longest public inquiry in British history and took 19 years to be built. As a result, it seemed outdated by the time it opened. Outside the office, Rogers’s home life was a constant whirlwind of family and entertaining, conducted in a magnificent Georgian house on Royal Avenue in Chelsea, which he gutted to form a vertical stack of spaces around one gigantic triple-height room, nicknamed the piazza. Decorated with artwork by Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly and Philip Guston, it was a lively social hub where he and his second wife, Ruth (nee Elias), co-founder of the River Cafe, whom he had married in 1973, hosted parties and charity benefits for their extensive network of friends. It was a welcoming place, where nosy guests were encouraged to feel at home and explore, discovering everything from the bright green Lino in the loo to the neatly ordered rainbow landscape of Rogers’s sock drawer – which once inspired a dedicated article in the New Yorker. While he lived in a converted Georgian terrace, Rogers always espoused a future of modular homes that could be built on a production line, although he never quite achieved his goal. The main prefab housing scheme he realised was a group of suburban homes for Taylor Wimpey at Oxley Woods in Milton Keynes, in 2007, which were plagued by leaks and legal claims. The practice also developed a “Homeshell” concept for prefabricated flat-pack housing, which they trialled on several sites in London, but have yet to succeed in scaling up. By contrast, his office enjoyed huge success in the luxury apartment sector, producing gleaming glass towers of flats across London, Monaco and Taipei. “Our society has decided … that we will tolerate this worsening level of inequality, despite the fact that it is socially corrosive and economically inefficient,” Rogers wrote in his 2017 memoir, A Place for All People. “Our politics cannot be made a slave to the narrow interests of the super-rich.” As time went on, the gulf between what he espoused for the greater public good, and what his practice actually did for the elite few, grew ever wider. Nonetheless, he will be remembered for a series of radically innovative buildings, which still have the power to shock 40 years on, and for putting the importance of sustainable, liveable cities at the top of the political agenda. He is survived by Ruth and their son Roo; and by three sons, Ben, Zad and Ab, from his first marriage, which ended in divorce; and by 13 grandchildren. His youngest son, Bo, died in 2011. • Richard George Rogers, Lord Rogers of Riverside, architect, born 23 July 1933; died 18 December 2021"

          "bodyText": "Mass lateral flow testing cut the number of people needing hospital treatment for Covid by 32% and relieved significant pressure on the NHS when the measures were piloted last year, a study has shown. Liverpool conducted the first city-wide testing scheme using rapid antigen tests in November last year, amid debate about whether or not lateral flow tests (LFTs) were accurate enough to detect the virus in asymptomatic carriers. It expanded the project to cover the whole of the Liverpool region, offering people LFTs whether or not they had symptoms. Key workers did daily tests before going to work to show they were not infectious. Now an analysis has shown that it was more successful than Liverpool’s scientists and public health teams had anticipated, after they compared Covid cases and outcomes in the region with other parts of England. Professor Iain Buchan, dean of the Institute of Population Health, who led the evaluation, said: “This time last year, as the Alpha variant was surging, we found that Liverpool city region’s early rollout of community rapid testing was associated with a 32% fall in Covid-19 hospital admissions after careful matching to other parts of the country in a similar position to Liverpool but without rapid testing. “We also found that daily lateral flow testing as an alternative to quarantine for people who had been in close contact with a known infected person enabled emergency services to keep key teams such as fire crews in work, underpinning public safety.” The Covid-Smart project ran from December 2020 to July 2021, and 668,243 people – about 45% of the region’s 1.5 million residents – took part. Key workers saved 8,292 work days by taking the rapid tests instead of isolating. Of 34 Covid cases, only three were missed by LFTs. Buchan said that the results demonstrated that LFTs could be used to help keep the NHS functioning during the Omicron wave. Ministers have adopted a similar model to avoid a “pingdemic” as infections have soared. Last week the government announced that double-vaccinated contacts of someone testing positive could avoid isolating if they took a daily LFT for seven days and continued to test negative. Buchan said: “As the more infectious Omicron variant sweeps through communities this winter, access to rapid testing will be important for keeping key emergency, social care and NHS services afloat with test-to-release or daily contact-testing schemes. “To make testing useful, communities need to understand how to use a test and what the results mean. Timing is critical – you can become infectious very quickly, so taking a test the day before you mix with other people is not as useful as taking the test just before you meet up. “And the more you encourage those you mix with to ‘test before you go’ the more risk you will take out – this kind of crowd-sourced health security is the new normal.” In October, researchers from University College London found that LFTs were more than 80% effective at detecting a Covid-19 infection of any level, and 90% effective at detecting those who were most infectious. PCR tests are often described as the gold standard of testing, and they can spot genetic material from the virus within the body several weeks after a person stops being infectious. LFTs only detect material from the surface proteins of a virus which are found when someone is infectious."

          "bodyText": "The health secretary impressed parliament last week when he said daily Omicron infections were estimated at about 200,000. This was classic “number theatre” – pulling a big statistic out of a hat without supporting evidence. Although the Health Security Agency (UKHSA) later briefed the press, it only publicly revealed its workings on Thursday: it had estimated 23,000 Omicron infections on 7 December, then assumed exponential growth with a doubling time of 1.9 days. We will have to wait for infection survey estimates to know if this is accurate. Exponential growth simply means something increases in proportion to its current value – the bigger it gets, the more it increases each day. This does not necessarily mean “fast” – a savings account has this kind of growth, even with a 0.1% compound interest rate. Doubling times are, unsurprisingly, how long it takes for a value to double. A popular trick in finance is to estimate the doubling time by dividing 72 by the annual interest rate, provided it is low. A 4% compound interest rate (remember that?) would mean your capital doubled in around 72 divided by four, or 18 years. Note: 72 is chosen as it is easy to divide and roughly equals 100 times the natural logarithm of two, as given by a standard mathematical model. The UKHSA was assuming a somewhat faster doubling time for infections, of about two days, which implies the numbers of infections were increasing by 41% a day, since 1.41 times 1.41 is roughly double. This is an extraordinarily rapid and worrisome rise. Exponential growth phases inevitably end, through changes in behaviour, prior immunity or simply running out of people to infect, although turning points remain hard to predict. UKHSA has warned against extrapolating this curve further – it would mean 18 million infections by Christmas Day. There is an old joke about fitting an exponential curve to the number of Elvis Presley impersonators, reckoned to reach a third of the world’s population by 2019. This did not happen. Exponential growth can’t go on for ever, so treat such projections with suspicious minds. • David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

          "bodyText": "Brexit minister Lord Frost’s late Saturday night resignation prompted frenzied reaction on social media including a lively row on a Conservative party Whatsapp group ending with culture secretary Nadine Dorries being deleted by former chair of Brexit supporting backbenchers in the European Research Group. Some welcomed Frost’s departure, others immediately went to leadership questions. Here’s what they said: Nigel Farage, former head of UK Independence party and Brexit leader: “Lord Frost is leaving the government because he is a conservative and true Brexiteer. Boris Johnson is neither” – Twitter Dominic Cummings, former adviser to Boris Johnson: “Frosty built a great team, with great officials &amp; spads working harmoniously, to do an outstanding job in extremely tough circumstances given the [PM] wd smash &amp; crash hourly, promise us Churchillian resolution then collapse, &amp; wd never read the papers” – Twitter And that Tory WhatsApp group row: The row on the Whatsapp Conservative Party Whatsapp group, Clean Global Brexit, as revealed by Sky News’s Sam Coates. Theresa Villiers, former Northern Ireland secretary: “Very worrying that Lord Frost has gone.” Andrew Bridgen, backbencher and Brexiter: “Worrying? It’s a disaster. Lord Frost was concerned about the policy direction of the gov. So are most of the Conservative backbenchers.” Marcus Fysh, backbencher, in reply: “Frost is a hero and 100% right on this. The whole point of Brexit is radical supply side reform and moving away from the EU model, yet ministers are happy just to give hard won power put in their hands to achieve this to officials who will do the opposite.” Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, backbencher, in response: “This is a further hammer blow to the PM. He desperately needs a really strong adviser at No 10 who he can trust. Probably from the Brexit team. A leadership challenge is not the answer at the moment because all the same underlying problems will be there.” Culture secretary Nadine Dorries, in response: “The hero is the Prime Minister who delivered Brexit. I’m aware as someone said today that regicide is in the DNA of the Conservative party, but a bit of loyalty to the person who won an 83 majority and delivered Brexit wouldn’t go amiss.” Steve Baker, former chair of the ERG, then deleted Dorries from the group, saying: “Enough is enough.” Andrew Bridgen: “About time, thanks Steve.” Andrew Bridgen again: “The Prime Minister is running out of time and out of friends to deliver on the promises and discipline of a true Conservative Government. “Lord Frost has made it clear, 100 Conservative backbenchers have made it clear, but most importantly so did the people of North Shropshire.” – Twitter Simon Hoare, chair of the Northern Ireland affairs committee: “I can’t say I’m sorry. He was unsuited to the “doing of politics”, never understood the need for personal rapport or the importance of trust. I hope whoever takes over will be from the Commons where we can all question directly.” – Twitter Nikki da Costa, former former director of legislative affairs at No 10: “Lord Frost is one of the most disciplined, focused, and strategic individuals I have ever met. A formidable brain but also a leader who, with Oliver Lewis, brought together talented officials to deliver the impossible. He has nerves of steel and somehow gave us faith to wait.” – Twitter Lady Hoey, former Labour MP and Brexiter fighting Northern Ireland protocol in the courts: “Terrible news. The only Minister who understood the protocol couldn’t work. Brilliant in the Lords with the many many EU zealots and Rejoiners Calm and thoughtful. A big blow to Government – shows how far they have moved away from Taking Back Control over Protocol.” – Twitter. Arlene Foster, former DUP leader: “The resignation of Lord Frost from the cabinet is a big moment for the Government but enormous for those of us who believed he would deliver for NI. Wishing him all the best.” – Twitter Julian Smith, former Northern Ireland secretary: “The interests of Northern Ireland – across community now has to be the priority as the government finalises its negotiations with the EU. Pragmatism and solutions for both unionists and nationalists is key. Dogma has run its course” – Twitter Lionel Barber, former editor of the Financial Times: “So farewell, Lord Frost You did a lot of damage in a very short time. Your timing is as opportunistic as ever (E.J Thribb)” – Twitter"

          "headline": "A Clockwork Orange at 50: Stanley Kubrick’s biggest, boldest provocation",
          "bodyText": "Throughout his career, Stanley Kubrick never cared much about ingratiating himself to the audience, so it’s an achievement that A Clockwork Orange, his controversial adaptation of Anthony Burgess’ 1962 novel, is the most repellent film of his career. That’s not to say it isn’t an audacious and frequently brilliant film, but watching it can feel like getting into a 136-minute argument – with Kubrick, with yourself, and with a society that wrestles imperfectly (and often unjustly and tragically) with issues of law-and-order and individual rights. There’s something here to infuriate people on both ends of the political spectrum, and even if you accept it as a satire that has no ideological allegiances, that can be infuriating, too. And this is to say nothing of its extreme unpleasantness. Yet we should neither run from difficult arguments nor hide from art that confronts us as seriously as Kubrick always did, and while A Clockwork Orange has settled into the pop-culture firmament – multiple references in classic episodes of The Simpsons will do that to a film – it still feels dangerous and vital 50 years later. As his previous work, 2001: A Space Odyssey, has settled appropriately as the great monolith of screen science fiction, A Clockwork Orange continues to be a moving target, liable not only to provoke you differently at different points in your life, but also from scene to scene. If it were released today, it would be a Three Mile Island-level event for the take industry. In broad strokes, A Clockwork Orange continued Kubrick’s career-long worries about power and the morally bankrupt people who are corrupted by it, from the decadent Romans of Spartacus to the careerist French military brass in Paths of Glory to deranged stewards of our nuclear arsenal in Dr Strangelove. Set in near-future Britain – or near enough that the soundtrack to 2001: A Space Odyssey is available alongside microcassettes of unlistenable pop hits – the film warns of a society lost to authoritarian rule, where an experimental campaign to curb criminal behavior leads to a deplorable form of social engineering. But Kubrick doesn’t limit himself to that issue alone, and as his agenda expands, so do the possible sticking points for an audience. The backdrop for A Clockwork Orange is loaded with the interior bric-a-brac of its own period, like projecting the hippest, least comfortable living rooms of the early 70s would gain a permanent foothold. But there’s a key tension here between technological advancement and societal decay: for the elite, there are sports cars and modern homes, but for everyone else, apartment buildings and other public spaces crumble from neglect, leaving packs of young marauders to scavenge sick pleasures from “a bit of ultra-violence” and “a little of the old in-out, in-out”. Kubrick does not need to press much to suggest the root of their destructive impulses. One of these marauders is Alex DeLarge, the only charismatic and fully human character in the film, played by Malcolm McDowell, whose role three years earlier in Lindsay Anderson’s If…. had codified him as Britain’s rebel without a cause. In Burgess’ made-up slang – which translates here beautifully in context, no glossary required – “droogs” like Alex, drunk on the intoxicating liquor of a “milk bar,” seek out opportunities for rape, robbery, and assault, or some combination of the three. Alex’s one concession to high culture is his love of “Ludwig Van”, the ninth symphony especially, and his passion leads to a rift between him and his fellow droogs that widens. The gang is shown beating up an intellectual (Patrick Magee) and raping his wife, but one night, when Alex murders a “cat lady”, they smash him in the head and leave him for the police to find. From there, A Clockwork Orange shifts into the punishment phase, where Alex, sentenced to 14 years for murder, has a chance to go free if he participates in an experimental rehabilitation program. This “Ludovico technique”, touted by the interior minister, trains Alex to have a severely negative physical response to his violent impulses – and, by accident, it makes his beloved Ludwig Van repulsive to him as well. It renders him a docile animal, incapable even of defending himself, and when he reemerges as the model of a reformed man, he becomes a target for old victims and adversaries, and a lightning rod for political controversy. Of the prominent criticism against A Clockwork Orange, Pauline Kael had the most compelling, asserting that Kubrick rigs his argument in favor of Alex’s essential humanity by making his victims repulsive, thus blunting the full horror of his crimes. This is a difficult point to deny – though Alex’s debasement of Singin’ in the Rain is an unpardonable act of violence in itself – but the “clockwork” of Kubrick’s grand design requires Alex’s own dehumanization to sync with that of society at large. The solution to the crime problem is a reflection of the times, and Kubrick is asking the audience to consider what happens when authoritarian institutions are themselves machines. But even that’s not close to the limit of what Kubrick is exploring here. One fascinating sliver of A Clockwork Orange is how it comments on the nature of rehabilitation itself, and what people expect of it. Turning Alex into a machine or a symbol is offensive to some because it feels like an injustice for him not to be punished for his crime – those he had wronged, including two droogs who have now become cops (perfect touch, that), don’t care if he’s “cured”. They want him to suffer, and the Ludovico technique spoils the punitive aspect of being in prison. His sadistic warden, for one, is absolutely incensed by the Ludovico program until he sees a demonstration of its results, and leaves secure in the knowledge the Alex will suffer forever. Every layer of A Clockwork Orange is its own nasty provocation, including the dispute Kubrick had with Burgess himself over a redemptive final chapter of the novel that wasn’t included in either the film or the American edition. No other director was as skilled as making films as texts to be examined and re-examined through myriad lenses for as long as the medium exists. His reputation as a perfectionist, on full display in every decision he makes here, belies the fact that his films exist to scramble your orientation and question your responses to them. They’re machines that expose our messy humanity."

          "bodyText": "A Philadelphia mother has given birth to what is believed to be the world’s first Tesla baby: an infant delivered in the front seat of an electric smart car while it was driving on autopilot. The remarkable delivery, reported by the Philadelphia Inquirer, took place in September while Yiran Sherry, 33, and her husband Keating Sherry, 34, were taking their three-year-old son Rafa to pre-school. Yiran Sherry’s waters broke while the family was stuck in traffic. With contractions increasing rapidly and traffic barely moving, the couple realized they were not going to make it in time. Keating Sherry placed the vehicle on autopilot after setting the navigation system to the hospital, 20 minutes away in the western suburb of Paoli. He said he laid one hand gently on the car’s steering wheel as he attended to his wife. “She was squeezing my hand to the point where I thought she was going to shatter it,” Keating Sherry told the Inquirer. “I was [saying] ‘Yiran, OK, focus on your breathing.’ That was advice to myself, as well. My adrenaline was pumping.” Yiran Sherry said the decision over whether to try to wait to give birth until they reached the hospital was an agonising one. However, she said, she kept glancing at their estimated arrival time and saw it was barely moving. “Should I push or should I hold? Should I push or should I hold? Fuck it, let’s do this,” she recalled telling herself, according to People magazine. She gave birth to her daughter as they arrived at the hospital, whispering: “Oh, my God, Keating. She’s out.” Nurses cut the baby’s umbilical cord over the car’s front seat. Keating Sherry said: “Once the pediatrician said, ‘She’s healthy, congratulations,’ that was quite the sigh of relief.” Once she was in hospital, Yiran said, nurses kept coming into her room to see the “Tesla baby”. “[They would ask] ‘Are you the one who delivered the baby in the car?’” Yiran Sherry said. The couple named their daughter Maeve Lily, after briefly considering Tess, in tribute to the car manufacturer. “Thank you genius Tesla engineers for your brilliant design of autopilot,” Keating Sherry said. The baby’s delivery is a good news story for Tesla, which has been plagued by bad publicity over safety concerns and workplace abuse. This week a taxi company in Paris discontinued use of Tesla Model 3 cars after a fatal crash. Tesla previously faced a lawsuit in Florida over an accident involving the death of a teenager in a Model S in 2019. Co-founded by the world’s richest man, the PayPal and SpaceX entrepreneur Elon Musk, in October the company was ordered to pay $137m damages to a Black employee who was racially abused. Tesla also faces sexual assault allegations from numerous women. Tesla did not immediately respond to Guardian request for comment."

          "bodyText": "It has been another week of soul-searching for football. What is the game, what is it for and who does it belong to? With nine Premier League matches postponed in the past week and Dr Nikki Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, suggesting that attending games is a needless risk, a return to reduced attendances, closed-doors matches or even a suspension have become distinct possibilities. The return to Project Restart protocols may be enough to quell the spread of the virus among players but if it is not, keeping going cannot be justified. Brentford’s Thomas Frank has already called for a circuit-breaker but potentially pushing the end of the season into the summer is not easy because of the truncated close-season to accommodate a November World Cup. In football, as in so many other spheres, the pandemic has exposed the dangers of greedy short-termism and bodge-job solutions to systemic problems. What is clear is the desire for football. During the 100-day suspension in the first lockdown, just as in the second world war when the league shut down, only for local competitions to open up within a month, the need for football as an entertainment and distraction, as a communal event to give us something to discuss, rapidly became apparent. CS Lewis observed that we read to feel less alone; in the modern age football serves a similar function. That’s the romantic justification for football’s domination of modern media and culture. And there is something remarkable in that, all over the world, people will be tuning in to Tottenham v Liverpool on Sunday afternoon. Express scepticism about Cristiano Ronaldo or José Mourinho and the abuse will come from all corners of the globe. Football really is universal. But that also makes it both potentially lucrative and influential – and that is why so much of the game is so distasteful. Hearing the self-interested bleating from various top-flight clubs after the fan-led review called for an independent regulator made laughable the idea that any owner has the wider good of the game at heart. And that’s been the other theme of this week: the grim consequences of football’s appeal as a tool of soft power. First there was the news that Abdullah Ibhais, the former media manager at the Supreme Committee of delivery and legacy for the 2022 World Cup, has been jailed in Qatar for three years. He was initially convicted and sentenced to five years in April for bribery after a confession he says was extracted under duress. No evidence was presented at his trial and he claims he was denied access to a lawyer. He appealed and was released, but then rearrested just before he was due to speak to the Norwegian state broadcaster NRK. The magazine Josimar has reported how his initial arrest came after he had refused to spin a story about migrant workers going months without pay in a WhatsApp exchange with senior members of the Supreme Committee. Quite apart from the personal horror of Ibais’s story, the WhatsApp messages cast doubt on official claims about the safety and treatment of migrant workers. Nobody should believe next year’s World Cup represents anything other than football being used as a status symbol by a repressive state in which homosexuality remains illegal and women’s rights are severely restricted. Then there was the news that US cryptocurrency speculators plan to invest in Bradford City, offering a new model of ownership based around non-fungible tokens. For all the sentimental talk of “community storytelling”, that community is the global investors, not the local fans who have supported the club for decades – another civic asset sold off to an investor with no feel for Bradford, its history or its environment. Sunday, meanwhile, will see the first meeting of Newcastle United and Manchester City since that game became a battle of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. There should be outrage that two proud local institutions have been taken over by foreign states (OK, a foreign state and a public investment fund that is definitely, categorically not the same as the state and the Premier League has legally binding guarantees to prove it) for reasons of diplomatic posturing. But so far have we retreated into self-absorbed tribalism that fans welcome their distant overlords, despite their hideous human rights records, because they promise high-class football. The price of a fan’s soul? The appointment of Eddie Howe and the whiff of James Tarkowski. To blame fans, though, is to address only the most visible symptom. There is a problem inherent in football: if you win you get more prize money and more people want to watch you, which in turn increases revenue through gate receipts, television rights, merchandise, sponsorship and advertising. More money means better players means more success means more money and, without salary caps, unless there is some form of redistribution, a self-fulfilling cycle until only a handful of clubs can compete. The only way for an outsider club to bridge the gap is by the intervention of a sugar daddy, and so they are welcomed as implausible anti-capitalist disruptors even if they have bonesaws in their pockets. So unpalatable is the present crop of owners that the hedge funds have come to seem like the good guys; it’s enough to make you yearn for the cynical hauliers and scrap-metal dealers of old. But these two aspects, the mass popularity of the game, the need for the game as a common touchstone, particularly in a time of global crisis, and the deals football has done with the disreputable, are intrinsically linked. If football weren’t so popular, it would hold less appeal to the very rich or those seeking to launder their reputations. The result is that on the one hand there is a global army of social media warriors enthusiastically doing the job of bot farms, propagandising for faraway states. And on the other, as the Omicron crisis intensifies, the need for our fix of football, that habitual burst of fantasy and narrative, becomes ever more acute. Welcome to modern football: it stinks but we need it. • This article was amended on 19 December 2021. In an earlier version, an image caption misidentified Sulaiman Al-Fahim as “Sheikh Mansour”."

          "headline": "Deserted stores, less choice … has shopping changed for ever?",
          "bodyText": "After nearly two years of disruption, Covid-19 has changed how we shop for ever. It has altered not only what we buy, but how we buy it. Big purchases involve clicks, not shopping trips, and remote working has turned the home interiors market into the new fast fashion. It has also signalled the end of overwhelming choice for consumers, analysts say, as gaps on shelves and long delivery times for items such as cars and sofas become a frustrating fact of life. Lifestyle changes due to health or environmental concerns are also helping new services get off the ground. Investors are pouring billions into rapid grocery delivery, while buying secondhand clothes and renting furniture is entering the mainstream. On high streets, cheaper rents are starting to attract independent stores. Here is a look at some of the big changes taking place. Grocery shopping The pandemic has caused major upheaval in the UK’s £212bn grocery industry. The return of the weekly shop during the strictest periods of lockdown looked as though it had saved the big supermarkets from a midlife crisis, only for an army of rapid grocery delivery firms, such as Getir, Gorillas and Jiffy, to emerge with the promise of delivering your groceries in less than half an hour. The IGD, the trade body for the food and consumer goods industry, says this so-called quick commerce has “exploded” on to the scene and is now a “channel in its own right”. It estimates 13% of UK shoppers now use these services, with sales hitting £1.4bn this year and on track to double within five. Bryan Roberts, an analyst at Shopfloor Insights, says the health crisis has created the kind of market conditions where people are “willing to pay a delivery fee for a 20-quid, 15-minute, delivery experience”, although he adds: “Time will tell if these models are going to be sustainable.” The expanded online services offered by the big chains have also won millions of new customers during the pandemic, but with inflation running at a 10-year high, the sands are shifting again, with discounters such as Aldi and Lidl the likely winners in the coming months as Britons seek out cheaper stores. There may be more ways to shop these days, but the supply chain problems in the background have prompted the major grocery brands to take a leaf out the discounters’ book and reduce their ranges to become more efficient. Richard Wilding, professor of supply chain strategy at Cranfield School of Management, says that the “abundance of choice we’ve had is going to change”. “You used to be able to buy 60 different types of pasta in the supermarket: then, during the pandemic, manufacturers started rationalising their ranges so all of a sudden you could only get 20 types,” he says. “Having new and interesting products has traditionally been a way of creating consumer demand, but companies are basically saying ‘we’ve got to focus on the higher-margin things’.” Working from home The shift to home working has had such a profound impact on how we live that it has become a retail super-trend in its own right. It has altered spending priorities, as money usually spent on foreign holidays or commuting is ploughed into home furnishings and revamps. Being home 24/7 has also resulted in an acceleration of the shift to online shopping. It took eight years for online sales to double their share of spending to 20%, but within just nine months during the pandemic, that figure touched 36% last year. This year’s easing of restrictions saw it fall back to a still substantial 26%. “Working from home has changed both the pattern of shopping and the pattern of demand,” says Richard Hyman, an independent retail analyst. “The shape of markets like fashion, food, beauty and homewares have changed, but the question is: have they alighted on a new, permanent position? It’s still very fluid because no one knows what proportion of people are going to continue working from home.” The profile of consumer spending has changed dramatically: for example, shoppers have spent an extra £503m in DIY stores this year, according to figures from retail data firm Kantar. Britons also took up new pastimes: 1.2 million new gardeners spent an extra £51m on plants and related paraphernalia. “Not everybody’s job is home-based but generally the way we are socialising and shopping is much more centred around the home,” says Joanna Parman at Kantar. “We are travelling less far at the weekend for shopping trips or to eat out. So we’re much more likely to be visiting local or independent stores than before.” She adds: “Lots of people are divested in how they look and invested in how their home looks so it is Instagrammable and is looking nice in the background when you’re on your phone or video call. They are investing a lot more in their homes and you could argue we are seeing some ‘fast homewares’ trends coming through.” Fashion Britons have swapped style for comfort during the pandemic: witness the 88% increase in loungewear sales last year. The closure of high street stores for long periods forced shoppers to buy the clothes they needed online and there may be no going back. The data firm Retail Economics estimates that half of the £51bn spent on clothing this year will have been bought on websites. Come 2025 it thinks that figure will be two-thirds of the total. This is already the case for electricals, which has been one of the fastest markets to move online. “What’s clear from the pandemic is that we as a nation have been able to adapt and shift our behaviours, sometimes overnight,” says Parman. “There’s not a lot of policy saying we shouldn’t socialise but people have already stepped back from eating out. We drive a lot of the change in our habits and the longer they are in place, the more likely they are to stick.” There are other big forces at work in this market too. The fashion industry is a big polluter and under growing pressure to get itself on a more sustainable footing, so more companies are experimenting with selling secondhand clothes or even renting them out, a model that has previously focused on outfits for special occasions. The UK’s biggest clothing retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer, is running a small trial to test demand for renting its dresses and coats – a trend that is more advanced in furniture, where the likes of John Lewis are renting out sofas, sideboards and desks. As always, fashion-conscious teens got there first and are already spending their cash on secondhand clothes sites such as Depop and Vinted, which are reporting big sales increases. Parman thinks the clothing rental market is a “trickier” model but predicts the pre-loved fashion market will take off even more in 2022. Cars The secondhand boom has already arrived in the car market, where soaring used car prices, up 31% since April, are stoking inflation. Usually about 2.5 million new cars a year are registered in the UK but that number sank to 1.6 million in 2020 with a similar figure expected this year as a shortage of computer chips hits production. This shortfall is one of the factors pushing up secondhand prices. Ian Plummer, commercial director of the Auto Trader marketplace, says Covid has forced a reluctant industry to embrace the web. Buyers want to be able to do more of the legwork online, from getting a valuation for their current car to applying for finance. However, given the cost involved – in expenditure terms, a car is second only to a home for the average household – “seeing, touching, smelling” your chosen vehicle remains an important final step. There has been some upside to the tumult, with the most recent figures showing a doubling of sales of electric vehicles. Almost 22,000 pure electric vehicles were registered in November, more than double the figure in the same month of 2020. “A new electric vehicle launched every 10 days in the course of 2021 and there are even more cars coming next year,” says Plummer. “It’s a big shift in the market: more supply, more marketing, creating more excitement, which has been spurred on by the fuel crisis.” Stores The rapid spread of the Omicron variant has been devastating news for store-based retailers as shopper numbers tail off on what are among the most important trading days of the year in the run-up to Christmas. With the Covid crisis seemingly far from over, the jury remains out on what the long-term consequences will be for the high street. The stream of household names that failed pre-Covid was accelerated by the lockdowns. Recent British Retail Consortium data shows the number of empty stores sitting at a record high of 14.5%. The crisis has pulled down rents but eye-watering business rates remain a big problem that the government seems reluctant to deal with. There are glimmers of hope, though, with the same data pointing to a declining vacancy rate in some regions, as independents move in to fill the spaces left by defunct chain stores. But there is, without question, more painful change to come. Hyman points to the £90bn of non-food sales that have moved online over the past 20 years, a period when there has been no “meaningful” reduction in store space. “The cost of selling something in a shop is now much more expensive because you’ve got a high fixed cost base and lower sales,” he says. “When all this is over, we are still going to have too many shops and too many websites.”"

          "headline": "North Shropshire proves progressive parties must work together to beat the Tories",
          "bodyText": "Politics is always both complex and very simple. The North Shropshire byelection, if we needed any reminder, proves it. The Liberal Democrats won big in this safest of safe Tory seats. And yet in six out of the past seven general elections, it was Labour and not the Lib Dems that came second here, so shouldn’t it have been the progressive’s choice? How do we answer that, and what does this result tell us about the chances of a non-Tory government? The Lib Dems know how to finesse byelection campaigns; it’s their specialist Mastermind subject. Their people flood in from across the whole country, putting bodies on the line. Perhaps critically, their vote share can generally enjoy higher highs and lower lows than Labour’s. It can soar like yesterday or plummet like it did nationally in 2015. But in this seat Labour’s vote was arguably already at its ceiling at around 30% in 2017, and so somewhat counterintuitively the third-placed Lib Dems were best placed to win. Just think about any safe Tory seat – like North Shropshire was supposed to be. If Tory voters are going to kick their party, who are they going to use to do the kicking? Labour, or the more centrist and safer Liberal Democrats? Even under that nice Mr Starmer, it’s an obvious choice for them. As of the last general election, there are 80 Tory seats where the Liberal Democrats are second to the Tories. Labour can either step aside in these seats, or split the vote and let the Tories win. Attacking the Lib Dems for not always being as left as Labour on every policy issue is electoral suicide – whereas giving them room to win over soft Tory voters can help Labour into power. But to some key people in the Labour party, the Lib Dems will always be the enemy to be crushed. This is a tragic misreading of history – not least, of 1997, when cooperation with the Lib Dems helped Labour to victory. It is also a misreading of Labour’s historic win in 1945, when its whole programme was based on the economic and social liberalism of Keynes and Beveridge. Attacking the Lib Dems along with the Greens locks the country into a Tory future. Labour needs to win an impossible-seeming 125 seats just to achieve a majority of one in the Commons. But only 40 seats would need to change hands to progressive parties to deny the Tories a majority. No power, or the largest share in power: the example of North Shropshire poses a stark choice for Labour. Of course, for some in Labour there is a strategy to get Tory voters to jump straight to them: it’s to follow the 1990s New Labour model. Back then “New” sent the signal to Tory voters that New Labour was in reality “Not” Labour. Tony Blair made it safe for millions of Tory voters to back him, precisely because he offered no challenge to their way of life or values. Inevitably this stirred up trouble in Labour’s backyard – it sowed the deep seeds of Brexit, the loss of vital Scottish seats and then red wall seats, and four straight Tory general election victories. It is not a place Labour should go back to. Let’s return to North Shropshire. Labour’s campaign was a mess. It seems likely that a deal had been done on the quiet between Keir Starmer and Ed Davey that divided up Old Bexley and Sidcup for Labour, and North Shropshire for the Lib Dems. We can assume this because Starmer didn’t go to North Shropshire once, whereas Davey visited umpteen times. But locally, Labour ignored this and still campaigned robustly. They very well could have split the vote. Luckily the voters knew better. This is the politics of both hypocrisy and failure: the party leaders do a deal, pretend they haven’t and confuse everyone. At a byelection there is enough noise for progressive voters to work out who has the best chance to win. But project this on to a national election and it’s a recipe for chaos. Meanwhile, Labour keeps on supporting first past the post, despite its members overwhelmingly wanting change to the antiquated voting system that shores up the Tories and punishes progressives by splitting their votes. And for good measure, if any Labour member says, “Vote Lib Dem to beat the Tories”, they get expelled. For the Labour machine, maintaining the “two-horse race” feels more important than winning. So, some home truths. First, while the Liberal Democrats can outperform their national showing at byelections, they often fail to hold the same seats at a general election. A byelection strategy is no replacement for a political strategy. The Liberal Democrats should enjoy their moment, but not kid themselves. They have a lot more work to do. Second, Boris Johnson will either recover from this blow or be replaced. Tory politics won’t remain static. They are ruthless and determined. If they are to be denied a record fifth victory at the next general election, then all progressive parties are going to have to do better individually and collectively, not least to find a way to reward the Greens, who are now potentially king- or queen-makers for Labour or the Lib Dems in up to 30 seats. Here, then, is the simple bit. The electoral map is crystal clear. It is progressives versus the Tories. All progressive parties need to do is work together to create a national mood for change, and then get out of each other’s way at the next general election. If local constituency decisions can be made for one-off “stand-asides” to beat the Tory candidate, along with an agreement that the next government would implement proportional representation, then progressives might stand a chance of both dislodging the Tories, and creating a new kind of politics. Last night voters showed this is what they want. The alternative doesn’t bear thinking about. Neal Lawson is director of the progressive alliance campaign organisation Compass"

          "bodyText": "Amid all the noise, glitter and razzle-dazzle, the most iconic moment of this year’s Strictly Come Dancing took place in complete silence. The music paused for several seconds while deaf actor Rose Ayling-Ellis and her dancing partner Giovanni Pernice continued to glide elegantly across the floor. The dance was intended as a tribute to the deaf community, but it has resonated far more broadly: as well as receiving a perfect score, the couple’s performance has been labelled the “greatest ever” on the show, while an official BBC clip has been viewed 1.7m times on YouTube. There has been a resounding (silent) cheer for Ayling-Ellis’ success from the deaf community, who see her as a rare on-screen role model capable of inspiring deaf young people, who often struggle with pressures to fit into mainstream schooling, to embrace their deaf identity and pursue their passions on their own terms. The show has also prompted a huge increase in interest in deaf culture and learning British Sign Language (BSL), with the Institute of British Sign Language and other providers saying they receive a rise in inquiries every time Strictly airs. Paula Garfield, the founder of Deafinitely Theatre, the UK’s first deaf-led theatre company that runs the prestigious youth theatre Ayling-Ellis trained at, said she has seen a surge in interest from budding young deaf performers. “Rose is so important as a positive role model. She’s deaf, but she has a community, culture, language and pride in those – she’s not trying to hide her deafness. She’s saying, ‘Don’t be shy, you shouldn’t be ashamed of using your first language, BSL, because it’s beautiful and rich.’ That’s opening a lot of doors. She’s saying deaf people can do anything they want to do,” she said. Garfield, who grew up in the 1970s, hopes that seeing people such as Ayling-Ellis on TV will spare deaf young people her experience of being pressured to learn to speak instead of being allowed to learn sign language, which resulted in her leaving school at 17 with a reading age of eight. “We felt invisible, it was a dark and depressing time.” She said attitudes in theatre had shifted over the past 10 years with BSL-led performances becoming more common and mainstream productions increasingly integrating actors who communicate via BSL, such as Deafinitely alumnus William Grint, who is touring with the Royal Shakespeare Company. However, many drama schools remain inaccessible to deaf students, she said. Garfield added that there is much mainstream theatre can learn from deaf culture, including the expressive nature of sign language, the increased emphasis on physicality and movement, and the use of a visual vernacular. She underscored the importance of deaf-led “safe spaces” for young people to build the confidence to aim high. This is an approach shared by Hamilton Lodge, the specialist school for deaf children that appeared on Strictly to give a signed message of support to Ayling-Ellis. “Children are often discouraged from using BSL. I’ve been working in education for 20 years and I’ve seen children damaged from traumatic experiences in the wrong placements. They have a very negative attitude about being deaf, and we repair that. It’s really important that they develop their deaf identity and all our children leave as confident and happy individuals. Maybe with Rose at the forefront of people’s minds that will permeate society and education,” said Juliet Grant, head of school. Hamilton Lodge, in Brighton, also emphasises building deaf awareness in the hearing population, since 11 million people in the UK are deaf or hard of hearing. Sam Caiels, deaf studies coordinator, has appreciated how Pernice has shown a “positive attitude” in finding creative ways to communicate with Ayling-Ellis. Since this season of Strictly started she has noticed people responding to her differently, for instance lowering their face masks to enable her to lip-read. “Now Rose is on TV the hearing and deaf worlds are not colliding but merging,” Caiels said. Reframing deafness as something to be celebrated rather than a deficiency has a huge influence on how the school’s pupils see themselves. Caiels recalled one student who arrived anxious about drama as she had never been picked for plays in her mainstream school. Within a year she had built the confidence to take up a role, and gave a “stunning” performance. This chimes with the experience of Empress, a year 10 pupil who was among those to deliver the message to Ayling-Ellis. “I went to mainstream school, where I had lots of barriers and breakdowns in communication. When I got to Hamilton I received so much support and lots of deaf role models,” she said. Empress is pleased to add Ayling-Ellis to that list of role models. “It’s about time – finally – that there is a deaf person on a high-profile programme,” she said. “I’ve always avoided things like drama in the past, but I’ve looked at Rose and thought ‘my god, she can do it, she’s in EastEnders, why can’t I give it a go?’”"

          "bodyText": "In Britain it’s alcohol, in Canada it’s maple syrup, while in Australia it’s a crucial additive for diesel trucks, and in New Zealand it’s brown sugar. These are just some of the many shortages affecting consumers and businesses around the world as industry experts warn that the supply chain crisis prompted by the coronavirus pandemic could last for many more months and even up to two years. Although there are signs that some bottlenecks are easing, the onset of the Omicron Covid variant could lead to new shutdowns, sending another disruptive spasm through the global system. The gravest appears to be an outbreak of Covid this week in the Chinese manufacturing hub of Zhejiang, which is home to the world’s largest cargo port, Ningbo-Zhoushan. Tens of thousands are in quarantine under China’s strict zero-Covid policy and some local authorities have urged workers not to travel home “unnecessarily” for lunar new year festival in February. “Further supply chain disruption is a significant possibility,” economic analysts at Capital Economics said in a note. Industry experts and economists believe the problems could persist as the finely calibrated network of world trade, already weakened by months of shipping backlogs, labour shortages and geopolitical tensions, remains “discombobulated”. Maersk, one of the big three shipping companies, said the worst delays were still on the US west coast where ships were waiting four weeks to unload due to the lack of workers on land. This creates a chaotic “ripple effect” around the world with ships locked into tight deadlines and a glut of containers in some ports in the US and Europe, but not enough in ports throughout Asia. “With winter, year-end holidays in North America and Europe, Chinese new year in Asia, the already stretched supply chain will get even further stretched as workers, truckers and terminals are off for holidays,” a Maersk spokesperson said. “Normally we can absorb these seasonal impacts fairly quickly, but when already stretched, it just becomes a multiplier,.” “We do not see major improvements as long as we have line of sight, which is into 2022 ... Very likely that it continues thereafter and for North America even longer.” In Felixstowe, the UK’s biggest container port, the dockside remains clogged with containers waiting to be emptied, meaning that empty containers coming back on trucks from inland warehouses have to be diverted to other ports. Robert Keen, of the British International Freight Association, said driver shortages were being felt all over the world with port infrastructure not keeping pace with the container vessels. Covid was “an ongoing problem”, he said. Flavio Macau, an associate professor specialising in supply chains at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia, said that fine-tuning could take years and that the world economy was still suffering from a kind of “high blood pressure” as it lurched from one disruption to another. “Lockdowns are hopefully a thing of the past outside China, but there are still all kinds of restrictions in place to the movement of people, including workers with in-demand skills. “My view is that supply chains still have high blood pressure, consistently showing arrhythmia. It will take to mid-2024 to get back to “normal’.” As well as the possible shortages of Christmas drinks and sugar for festive treats, economies such as the UK and US are facing rising inflation across a range of goods from energy to apples as a torrent of demand puts pressure on insufficient supply. Shipping accounts for the movement of at least 90% of goods around the world and the cost of transporting things by sea has rocketed in the past year. For example, the Drewry world container index measuring the cost of moving a 40ft container is 170% higher than it was a year ago. The price on some particularly in-demand routes such as Shanghai to Rotterdam has increased by almost 200%; in the case of the Dutch port to New York, the cost has risen by 212%. Basic consumer staples are spiralling in price because of higher shipping costs and heightened demand from consumers stuck at home for months and unable to spend any money on treats such as holidays and nights out. Coffee prices have doubled over the past year, according to current data, as has the price of oats. Lumber, cotton, wheat and palm oil have all risen by more than 30%. Not surprisingly, inflation has touched decades-long highs in western economies such as the US, Britain and Germany, bringing calls for an end to the ultra-loose monetary policies pursued by central banks since 2008. Roy Cummins, who has worked in logistics for 30 years and until recently was chief executive of the Port of Brisbane in Australia, said there was some sense that things were improving but he estimated that constraints on the international shipping network were unlikely to be alleviated for the next two years. His point is illustrated by the bottleneck of giant containers that has built up off the west coast of the US. With so many ships unable to dock and unload, more than 80% of the 434,000 20ft containers exported out of the Port of Los Angeles in September went out empty. Shipping companies can make up to eight times more money taking goods from China to the US, so it made sense to get the containers back to Asia rather than wait for them to be filled. This has fulled huge imbalances throughout the system, he said: “The supply chains were discombobulated. Shipping capacity was quickly exhausted at the start of the pandemic because everyone planned for a big decline in demand but in fact there was a surge because people wanted to buy things. Then the supply side was hit hard with ports, warehouses and truck companies all short of workers. “But you can’t flick a switch and get new capacity back on. New ships are not ready until 2023. Shipping supply should normalise within a year but does the economy normalise?” Tiffany Compres, a partner at international law firm FisherBroyles based in Florida, said: “It will take time to get better, for companies to adjust, and for the legal framework to adapt. To add to the challenge, this is very much a political issue, and nations will need to cooperate to really get us to a new sustainable way of operating the supply chain. It seems to be a tall order in our polarized era.” Before the pandemic struck, the shipping industry had driven down the cost of transporting goods and had perfected the celebrated “just-in-time” system whereby commodities and spare parts were moved seamlessly around the globe and delivered exactly when and where they were needed. This reduced corporate costs dramatically, for example by reducing or completely eradicating the need for on-site warehousing. If the uncertainty continues and consumers carry on with online shopping splurges, Cummins says, “you will see ‘just-in-time’ becoming ‘just-in-case’ as companies build up inventories to guard against disruptions”. Dennis Unkovic, a US corporate lawyer, trade expert and author of Transforming the Global Supply Chain, says the Covid crisis had shown that the system was dependent on a just-in-time model designed to run perfectly, “but that’s not what’s happened”. The deterioration in relations between the US and China which led to trade tariffs and loss of trust was also having a bigger impact than hitherto recognised, he says, dislocating the mechanics of world trade that have been taken for granted for many years. Cyber-attacks and robotics have also made companies review their supply chains and source materials closer to home. “For anyone expecting the post-pandemic world to return to ‘normal’, forget it. Whatever was considered normal before the pandemic is not coming back. “Companies have to make the supply chain a priority,” he says. “If it breaks down we can’t say we didn’t see it coming.”"

          "headline": "Northern Ireland: what are EU and UK proposing and will deal be done?",
          "bodyText": "Is Brexit done? The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020 and all EU rules fell away at the start of 2021. Soon after, a row broke out over the Northern Ireland protocol, the tortuously negotiated agreement to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market and customs union. The UK demanded a rewrite of the protocol in July. At first the EU said it wasn’t prepared to do more than tinker around the edges, but by October the European Commission had offered some substantial changes including scrapping customs red tape. After weeks of non-stop talks, each side has now taken a step towards agreement. What is the EU proposing? The commission revealed on Friday it was prepared to rewrite EU law on medicines to ensure stable supplies of generic and life-saving drugs in Northern Ireland. Without changes, Northern Irish patients risk losing access to hundreds of generic medicines available on the NHS. The problem arose because Northern Ireland should follow EU rules on medicines that require quality-control tests to be done in the single market, heaping costs on British manufacturers of generic medicines that could cause many to abandon the Northern Irish market. What is the UK move? The British government has climbed down in its demands on the European court of justice (ECJ), a bete noire for Brexiters. The UK has signalled the ECJ is no longer its first priority in negotiations on the Northern Ireland protocol, as it seeks to focus on customs and health checks in the Irish Sea border that are having the biggest impact on UK business and Northern Irish citizens. The government has also been clearer that it is ready to accept an arbitration system, with a continuing role for the ECJ in settling disputes over EU law. So, an agreement is close? Far from it. The UK sounds positive about the EU proposals on medicines, but says it needs to check the details. But the role of the European court in policing the protocol is a big sticking point. While the British are ready to concede a role for the ECJ, thecommission has flatly refused to discuss a new governance model, partly because it opposes reopening an international treaty agreed barely two years ago. And the two sides remain far apart on customs, plant, food and animal health checks. Does that mean a return to ‘sausage wars’? While the ban on importing meat from Great Britain into Northern Ireland captured headlines, the disagreement is bigger than a few bangers. The sausage issue looks relatively straightforward to solve now the EU has proposed an exemption for “iconic” British products, allowing such items to be imported into Northern Ireland with the right certification. More broadly, the UK has complained there has been little progress on “burdensome” customs and SPS checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The EU thinks it has made a generous offer that would mean, for example, a lorry transporting meat, fish, dairy, fruit and sweets from Great Britain to Northern Ireland would need just one certificate rather than one per product type. The UK says the EU’s numbers are less than meets the eye and that a claimed 80% reduction in health checks does not stand up. What next? Unlike the Brexit trade deal, there is no looming end-of-year deadline. The UK would like an agreement before elections to the Northern Ireland assembly, due by May 2022. The commission hopes its medicines proposal will be a “catalyst” for a broader agreement early next year but has declined to match the UK timetable, saying it is “not in the business of artificial deadlines”. Talks will resume in 2022. • This article was amended on 19 December 2021 to change a reference to Britain, when Great Britain was intended."

          "bodyText": "An uneasy Christmas truce has been called over the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, even as the EU said it would not negotiate over a key British demand in the rancorous talks. Maroš Šefčovič, the EU Brexit commissioner, said there was “momentum” behind discussions after a major British U-turn, but refused to offer quid pro quo concessions. Downing Street has conceded in recent weeks that it will prioritise removing barriers to trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland over other constitutional issues that have bedevilled the talks. Talks will be suspended until after Christmas. But in a blow to the British government, the commissioner on Friday refused even to engage with its demand for any renegotiation over the role of the European court of justice (ECJ) in the enforcement of EU law in Northern Ireland, despite a UK concession that the court could retain a role in the protocol. “It was not disputed at all until the summer of this year and therefore the topic we are not ready to include in our discussions,” said Šefčovič, the EU commissioner in charge of UK relations. Under a protocol of the withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland in effect remains within the EU’s single market and the bloc’s customs border is drawn down the Irish sea. The EU court is the final arbiter of disputes. The British government, however, wants an independent arbitration system rather than giving the ECJ the last say, although in recent days it has accepted the court in Luxembourg will resolve questions about EU law if issues come to arbitration. A potential solution exists in the post-Brexit trade agreement and the EU’s deal with Switzerland. But the European Commission said on Friday that this model was not feasible – yet. A senior EU official said the protocol was “completely different” to the EU trade agreement with Switzerland, because the Northern Ireland agreement was based on “the direct application of reams of EU legislation”, rather than “elements of EU law, which are referred to or paraphrased” as in the deal with Berne. “It was judged that this arbitral solution was not sufficient, and that you needed the full powers of the court of justice,” the official said. Another barrier is that the commission refuses to reopen an agreement that was signed by Boris Johnson little more than two years ago. There is agreement to extend a standstill arrangement beyond 1 January to avoid the full implementation of customs on meat and agricultural imports. But Brussels remains mistrustful of the British government. “The fundamental stumbling block is that we need the UK to move back into a logic of the implementation of an agreement that it negotiated, signed and ratified,” said a senior official. The two sides are also at odds over the process of the talks. While British officials have spoken of “a staged approach”, where issues are agreed one by one, the EU would like a single agreement. Customs and health checks remain a major stumbling block in the talks. While the EU considers it has made a generous offer to cut red tape, the UK argues that its claims to remove 50% of customs checks and 80% of health checks do not stand up. The EU announced on Friday it would rewrite its rules on medicines to ensure life-saving treatments and everyday drugs remained available in Northern Ireland, after threats to supply emerged. Without a change to the rules or grace period, medicine manufacturers based in Great Britain had warned they could cease supplying products to Northern Ireland, because of the extra costs imposed by red tape. Hundreds of medicines used by the NHS in Northern Ireland were at risk. The commission has now proposed that new medicines for Northern Ireland can be authorised by the UK, even if they have yet to be approved by the EU regulator. Under the proposals, quality control checks, so called “batch testing”, would not need to be repeated in Northern Ireland, if they had already been carried out in Great Britain or the EU. The proposals have to be agreed by EU lawmakers and ministers before coming into force. Meanwhile, the French EU minister Clément Beaune said Paris would “in the coming days” begin proceedings against the UK over fishing licences it said Britain still owed a small number of French boats to allow them to operate in British waters. “The next step will be to ask the commission in the coming days to convene the partnership council, as provided for under the Brexit trade deal to settle a problem,” Beaune said, adding that the procedure would target “the most urgent” cases."

          "headline": "‘It’s a fraught moment’: Omicron puts brakes on US return-to-office plans",
          "bodyText": "Large US companies are now pulling back on plans to return to in-person work in light of the Omicron variant’s rapid spread across America. Employers planning to call remote workers back into the office in the new year are now pausing those efforts, and they are wary of setting new return dates only to push them back once again in the face of continued uncertainty and risks from the pandemic. The pandemic is also driving changes in how in-person employees work, with a renewed push for strikes and unionization across several industries where workers have frequently faced long hours and unsafe conditions. Alphabet’s Google, Meta, Apple, Uber, Lyft, Ford, DoorDash, DocuSign and Fidelity are among the companies that have delayed returns to the office. “It’s warranted, given the uptick that we’ve seen in cases,” Bradford Bell, director of the Center for Advanced Human Resource Studies at Cornell University’s ILR School, said. The delays also depend on where the offices are located, he said. “They’re very much looking at this on a location-by-location basis.” Apple CEO Tim Cook told employees in a memo on Wednesday that the partial return to offices, planned for 1 February, was now pushed to a “date yet to be determined”, after several other delays over the past two years. Cook offered employees a $1,000 bonus to help improve their home offices. Apple’s offices remain open and employees are still going in to work in countries with lower Covid rates, he said. But he specifically pointed to the global rise in cases and the emergence of the Omicron variant as a cause for concern. Google and Uber were among the first to announce the indefinite delays in early December after planning for early January returns. Google planned to reopen offices fully no later than 10 January, but has now delayed that deadline indefinitely, though offices in several places have already reopened. Meta was planning to open early in 2022 but is now allowing workers to come back as late as June. Janelle Gale, the company’s vice-president of human resources, said “some aren’t quite ready to come back”. In contrast, Twitter went fully remote forever in October. Lyft’s offices will open in February, but workers can stay remote for the entirety of next year – one of the longest delayed returns, partly due to worries over Omicron and other variants that may emerge. Fidelity Investments said on Monday it was pausing its return-to-work plans. DocuSign has delayed its fourth attempt to return. DoorDash’s corporate employees were going back to the office in 2022 in a hybrid approach, but now the company is waiting to see what the new plan should be. Ford planned to return with a hybrid work model for employees working at the headquarters in January, but that is now planned for March. Notably, hourly employees at Ford returned to in-person work in May 2020. And gig workers at Uber, Lyft, DoorDash and elsewhere have continued working through the pandemic, despite frequently feeling unsafe on the job. About half of full-time workers surveyed in the US said their jobs could be done remotely, according to a Gallup poll. And nearly one-third of the workers said they never wanted to work in the office; the majority wanted a hybrid model. In September, 45% of full-time employees were working remotely some or all of the time, with nine out of 10 remote workers wanting to continue that way, according to a Gallup poll. One-third of employees who could work remotely are doing so, according to a survey from Willis Towers Watson, a global advisory firm. That number was expected to decline in 2022, before the advent of Omicron. One of the challenges for companies is “trying to build momentum in terms of getting people back into the office”, Bell said. Companies are worried that if they open their offices before employees are ready, the momentum will stall – and they’re wary of forcing anyone back with office mandates. “So they’re waiting for the right time to really make that happen,” Bell said. The pandemic could bring lasting changes to the ways we work – for those who have jobs that can be done remotely. “It’s certainly a real issue” for those who can’t work remotely, Bell said. “I think that’s why we’ve seen an uptick in strikes and other things over the last several months where people are wanting – not necessarily a level playing field, but want their sacrifices recognized by their employers.” In-person employees should continue to have support for working safely, including masking, distancing and vaccination mandates. “All those things matter,” Bell said. The US is experiencing record-low unemployment even as cases surge. “It’s a fraught moment, and it’s a time where I think the power dynamic has really shifted, with the Great Resignation and the labor shortages,” Bell said. “It’s put labor in the driver’s seat,” with moves like the first Starbuck union, in Buffalo, New York, he said. “Employees realize that they, to a certain degree, have the upper hand and so can really start bringing these issues to the forefront.”"

          "headline": "Will this year be a white Christmas in the UK? We ask the expert",
          "bodyText": "Seeing streets lined with fluffy white snow on 25 December was already a rarity. So in a year that saw extreme weather catastrophes (from wildfires in Canada to severe floods across Europe), what is the future for Britain’s white Christmases? I asked Prof Lizzie Kendon from the Met Office. I normally start these interviews with some weather-based chitchat, but I guess it doesn’t have the same effect with someone from the Met Office. Actually, we’re all quite enthused about the weather, though some people get more talk than they bargained for. I’m game! What makes a white Christmas, a white Christmas? The official definition is one snowflake observed on 25 December, somewhere in the UK. In that case I’m happy to be observed. Get it? Because I’m a millennial snowflake? OK, moving on – one snowflake doesn’t seem much. I’m sure I saw snowflakes last Christmas. Technically, 2020 was a white Christmas: eight stations recorded snow falling and five recorded snow on the ground. But it is a lenient definition and not people’s perception of a white Christmas, which is lying snow. The last white Christmas like that was in 2010, although that was very unusual. Why’s that? Since the 60s, the UK’s winters have become less snowy; overall, it’s because of the warming of our climate. It’s no coincidence that 2020 was one of the least snowy years on record and one of the warmest. It doesn’t only affect snow, it also affects rain. Last year was also the fifth wettest. Hmm, “I’m dreaming of a wet Christmas” doesn’t have the same ring. Does that mean winter is disappearing, or is it that the seasons still occur but at different times? It snowed in April this year. In the climate model projections I run, we’re seeing evidence of a change in seasonality, particularly the sort of summer downpours that are driven by convective events. Convective events? Convection is a process in the atmosphere where warm air rises then cools and condenses, forming storms, which release a lot of rainfall in a short period of time. There’s evidence that there’s a lengthening of the convective season. So we might start to get the intense summer downpours in autumn. Seeing snow in April is not related to that, though. We will still get cold events, just less frequently. Cold enough for snow? The projections of a warmer, wetter winter don’t preclude us from having a cold one. In terms of snow, though, we are expecting decreases. It depends on greenhouse gas emissions, but if we follow a high-emission scenario, we could get almost an entire loss of lying snow over many low-lying regions. What! That means no more white Christmases for parts of the UK! How many years do we have until they’re gone? What about our Cop26 commitments? I can’t really answer how many years. What I can say is the scenario I’m talking about is a 3C warming for the UK by the 2070s – so higher emissions than the targets set at Cop26. But looking at the pledges being made, it’s fair to say that the likelihood of keeping below 1.5C is fading. Here’s hoping for some strong gales of merriness this year, in spite of it all. Thanks, Lizzie – I can’t wish you a white Christmas, so I’ll wish you a merry one instead. Merry Christmas!"

          "headline": "bell hooks’ writing told Black women and girls to trust themselves",
          "bodyText": "Having just the right words to explain what’s happening keeps you from feeling, well, crazy. When the world learned of the passing of bell hooks, the renowned feminist, public intellectual, author, and professor on Wednesday, at her home in Berea, Kentucky, it was the value and accessibility of her words that resonated with Black women, whose understanding of themselves and their own work was transformed by hooks. One day in her 20s, the right words came to Natalie Bullock Brown. Her then boyfriend gave her copy of Sisters of the Yam: Black Women and Self-Recovery (1993), which made her feel seen and loved. Through tears and hard swallows, Bullock Brown, now a documentary film-maker and interdisciplinary studies professor at North Carolina State University, revealed how the world broke open when she first inhaled those pages. hooks “inspired and motivated me to want to understand what I was experiencing,” said Bullock Brown, describing the ways she had come crashing into sexism and racism as a girl, then a woman. “I felt pricked. I felt like, ‘Oh my, God, she’s talking to me.’ I wanted to heal. That’s really what Sisters of the Yam is about.” For so many, the beauty of hooks, known for such titles as Ain’t I A Woman? (1981), All About Love (1999), and Teaching to Transgress (1994), was her ability to bring philosophy to the people, said Saida Grundy, a feminist sociologist of race and ethnicity and a professor at Boston University. “There is this idea that of all the humanities, philosophy is sort of the most erudite, the most prestigious or the most inaccessible, and what she’s doing is inviting Black people in particular but really marginalized people [in general] into this space of thinking about their own experience in ways of critical thinking or esoteric exercise,” Grundy said. In empowering people “to have some command over how you think about yourself”, hers was a language that radically changed how Black women process their lives, Grundy said. “There is nothing that should be inaccessible about marginalized people being able to make thought of their own lives. That’s powerful.” kihana miraya ross, a professor of African American studies at Northwestern University, said hooks’ writing had gripped her as a graduate student. “Her writing is so powerful and so important, but it’s also so clear. She has always been a role model for me in that way: no shade to people who don’t write like that, but I think that when you can say things clearly it means you understand what you’re saying.” The accessibility of hooks’ words was exactly what Bullock Brown said she needed at a time when she felt all over the place. “I didn’t really realize my value,” she said. “I didn’t recognize the issues that are specific to Black women and the ways that I was experiencing them. It was like a beautiful, really loving way to just kind of help me to begin to be centered and grounded in some reality and truth that may have taken me longer to really reconcile.” Like me, Bullock Brown grew up in what I describe as “the remnant aura” of the civil rights movement in my book US Civil Rights Trail: A Traveler’s Guide to the People, Places, and Events that Made the Movement (2021). Surrounded by Black striving and excellence, there was a palpable energy that suggested to Black girls that it was up to us to make good on the opportunities won by that movement. I’ve realized I grew up bound up in a sense of duty to excel but also a requirement to know my place. This surfaced in big and small ways, like on Sundays when my teen cousin, Reginald, would stop by for dinner, and my grandmother would order me to set a plate at the head of the table for him. I didn’t mind feeding him, but resisted the social programming to promote him to a place of honor simply because he was born male. Similarly, Bullock Brown said she spent years unpacking the social messages to conform to specific, and limiting, ideas of what a woman is supposed to be – married with children – messages imparted in particular by her father. “Part of the reason why I needed language is because there was a way my potential, my ability, even my own brilliance, to whatever extent that might exist, was muted because I’m a woman, because I was a girl,” she said. “A part of that experience was also not being encouraged to trust my own thoughts.” A bespoke language created by hooks helped Bullock Brown learn, grow, and forgive. hooks matters because she helped so many of us Black women and girls to trust ourselves and articulate why. “Our experiences as Black women and femmes is not going to be universal in the sense that we all go through the same thing; we’re not a monolith,” Bullock Brown said. “And yet, there’s a way that I think bell describes our experience that is both universal and specific.” Deborah Douglas is the co-editor in chief of The Emancipator, a collaboration between Boston University and the Boston Globe, set to begin publishing original commentary in 2022"

          "headline": "Could Deion Sanders tip college football’s power balance toward Black schools?",
          "bodyText": "Deion Sanders is the ultimate jack of all trades. As a college athlete at Florida State he starred at football, baseball and track. Selected fifth in the 1989 NFL draft Sanders instantly proved a triple threat as a cornerback, special teams returner and situational wide receiver. When he wasn’t dazzling on the gridiron he wowed Major League Baseball as a bag-swiping outfielder, becoming the only player to appear in a World Series and Super Bowl. Throughout Neon Deion crackled with charisma and swagger – delighting the masses with his brash fashions, touchdown dances and gift of the gab. In retirement he continued to enthrall as a television analyst, preacher and reality TV star. Still: when the football hall of famer decided to try his hand at coaching football, it felt like a gig too far. Although he gathered some experience at the high school level in Texas, Sanders looked ill-prepared to make the jump to Jackson State – a south-central Mississippi outpost at quite a remove from the spotlight. A historically black college (or HBCU), Jackson State competes in the shadow of the Alabamas and Michigans of the land and operates under an anemic athletic budget. Sanders’s bold move looked like a bored celebrity trying his hand at coaching and threatened to go down like his attempt to run a charter school, an abject failure. But in less than a year Sanders has established himself as a whiz at this job, too. This fall he led the 11-win Tigers to their first conference title in 14 years, and was named as one of the nation’s best college football coaches. On Saturday the Tigers play South Carolina State in the Celebration Bowl — the de facto championship game for HBCUs. His son Shedeur, the Tigers’ star quarterback, was recognized as one of the nation’s best freshmen. All the while the Tigers broke attendance records, averaging more than 42,000 spectators. The star power of Coach Prime – that’s his name; don’t leave out the “coach” part – has turned out to be an effective lure for top-shelf talent. On Wednesday he shocked college football by signing Travis Hunter, the nation’s top-rated high school prospect. A multi-talented player in the Sanders mold, Hunter chose Jackson State after committing to Florida State, the college where Sanders made his name. Clips of Hunter’s dramatic commitment reveal were quickly followed by images of Florida State fans burning Sanders’s jersey. This wasn’t a one-off. This was a turning point. This was the first year the NCAA allowed players to profit from their name, image and likeness. Sanders, a shrewd businessman who once ranked among pro sport’s highest earners, pledged to get his players paid as soon as the rule went into effect. At midnight on 1 July Tigers defensive tackle Antwan Owens was first to cash in. (Although Sanders has shot down speculation that the potential for endorsements is what put Hunter’s commitment over the top.) This year also saw ESPN add historically black college games to its broadcast slate, a major coup for schools that held a monopoly on Black talent until the 1970s, when the best high-school players started to commit to well-funded programs where the student and staff body are overwhelmingly white. The tipping advantage has had coaches as well as players in the Black football community reconsidering HBCUs as a viable career path. Recently, former NFL head coach Hue Jackson and Heisman trophy winner Eddie George took jobs at Grambling and Tennessee State, respectively. Where Sanders breaks from the herd is that he’s a bona fide celebrity, one who not only resonates with young athletes – and, unlike many coaches, enjoyed playing success at the very highest level – but meets them where they are. He has social media clout too; a few weeks ago Sanders opened his program to a buzzy Jackson State alum named Brittany Renner, an Instagram-famous model with a self-styled reputation for dating athletes for money rather than love. (A recent post-partum uncoupling from Charlotte Hornets forward PJ Washington has made her regular gossip blog fodder.) It’s difficult to imagine Nick Saban convening a similar clinic. On a recent episode of his podcast, 21 and Prime, Sanders said, “if I had her in my ear, if I had been sitting in that room at Florida State and had her come and lay it out like she laid it out, if I had I would be at least $20m richer.” Still: for as much as Sanders is out there, the spotlight has a way of finding him – not the other way around. For all of his flash as a player, his work ethic and commitment to his craft were unassailable. When he decided to abandon his baseball career to focus on the NFL, he swung the fortunes of the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys, helping them to Super Bowl victories. At the ebb of his career in Washington and Baltimore, Sanders was a celebrated mentor. At Jackson State, Sanders gives lie to the idea that coaches can either win the press conference or win the locker room. Not surprisingly, the ease with which Sanders has found success has led to considerable speculation about his future. He has reportedly interviewed for multiple jobs with teams from the Power Five, the elite level of college football. The longer he stays in Jackson, it seems, the more likely his rivals will be circling to halt his progress by any means necessary, not least uncovering potential NCAA violations. For the moment Coach Prime is firmly in his element. Who knew he’d be a master of this one."

          "headline": "Bradford City receive cryptocurrency group bid but deny takeover close",
          "bodyText": "Bradford City have confirmed they have received a bid for the club from an American consortium which plans to fund a takeover using cryptocurrency but deny a sale is imminent. The League Two club received an offer from the investor group WAGMI United on Thursday. It aims to raise capital and funds through the sale of non-fungible tokens, known as NFTs, and intends to rely on data and analytics to make key decisions about running the club. Its goal, it says, is to use the model to take a club to the Premier League. The group, whose backers reportedly include the president of the NBA franchise Philadelphia 76ers, Daryl Morey, publicly stated its intention to buy an EFL club on Thursday without naming Bradford, who are owned by the German businessman Stefan Rupp. Rupp confirmed on Friday that Bradford were the club in question but said: “Despite various reports claiming a change of ownership is imminent, I can confirm it is not. Yesterday, I received an email from a representative of the WAGMI United group with an offer to purchase Bradford City AFC. That is all I have received, nothing more, and no further action has taken place.” The Guardian has been told any deal is a long way from completion, with serious doubts over whether it will go through. WAGMI United has conceded it has little knowledge of the intricacies of English football. The volatile nature of cryptocurrency, which can fluctuate in price dramatically and quickly, has caused some concern among the Bradford fanbase about the plans, which would be the first of their kind in the sport. WAGMI has been contacted for comment. Rupp bought the club in the summer of 2016 and the Bantams reached the League One play-off final in 2017 but were beaten by Millwall. Two seasons later they were relegated to League Two, where they remain. The fan mood towards Rupp’s ownership has been hostile for a number of years, with Rupp based in Germany and seldom seen at games, particularly of late because of Covid restrictions. Some supporters shared their excitement at the news of a potential takeover on Thursday when the consortium held a live Twitter Spaces event, but others were far more cautious."

          "headline": "The Repair Shop: the idyllic show that brings me to tears",
          "bodyText": "Nothing but good happens in The Repair Shop, a thoroughly commendable television show in which pleasant men and women bring beloved but damaged objects to a team of equally pleasant craftspeople who will repair them and make them like new. At the start of every show we see an ancient thatched barn as Bill Paterson’s reassuring voice sets the scene. This is a place where “precious and faded treasures are restored to their former glory”; where “heritage craft skills passed down the generations” are exercised; a place where, not least, the conversation between owners and restorers “unlocks the story” inside every object. Inside the barn, the craftspeople are already at work: sandpapering, sawing, sewing, stuffing, burnishing, painting, soldering, hammering, chiselling. The barn is real enough. It was built in around 1700 for a farm in Hampshire and relocated 40 years ago to the Weald and Downland Living Museum in West Sussex, where the series is filmed. But as real barns go, the Repair Shop is unusually smart, its wooden frame robust, its reed-thatch immaculate, and its interior beautifully lit. There is a slight suggestion of Hansel and Gretel or even Wagner. Something mythic. The barn sits among trees. No cars or roads can be seen. Customers, three or four of them to every episode, walk like pilgrims along stony paths that wind to the front door, where they show their broken keepsakes to the workshop’s gaffer, Jay Blades, who wears heavy-rimmed spectacles and a distinctive (because permanent) cloth cap. The object is unwrapped and Blades, a cabinetmaker-cum-community worker by trade, summons one of the show’s specialists – a furniture restorer, say, or a soft-toy repairer – to advise on how it can be repaired. It might be an accordion that no longer squeezes, a rocking horse that no longer rocks, a ventriloquist’s dummy with its mouth clamped shut, a stained watercolour, a stopped clock, a half-wrecked liner made of matchsticks, a model locomotive minus three of its wheels. Britain has a cornucopia of damaged goods. After a diagnosis, the object is taken in, rather like a patient. Blades shakes hands with the customer and promises to see them soon. More sandpapering, stitching and soldering follows. Words are few. “Hi, Will, take a look at this,” says Jay. “Brilliant!” says Will. Nobody shows off; everyone behaves with dignity. This isn’t the real world. These dedicated artisans never break a promise, never say, “It’s 300 quid with VAT included but I’ll take 100 off if we’re talking cash.” Money never needs to be mentioned. The wages are paid by the production company (Ricochet, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers) that makes the series for the BBC. Nonetheless, in their reticence and friendship, the workers in The Repair Shop seem closer to ordinary life than the players in the average TV reality show. Or at least closer to ordinary life as some of us like to imagine it is – or was once and might be again – which is to say more collaborative than competitive, less selfish and less greedy. In Antiques Roadshow, the luckiest participants gasp when they’re told the value of what they hold in their hand. The Repair Shop’s customers are spiritual in comparison. “Amazing!” they say when the cloth is pulled from their refurbished heirloom. “How fine it looks. If only Uncle Bill could’ve seen it – he’d have been so pleased.” Wisely, the programme makers decided against a notion, raised at an early planning meeting, that the value of a piece would be estimated before and after restoration. Profit on the one hand and fond memories of Uncle Bill on the other (this was his stuffed crocodile, after all) don’t sit comfortably together. I like The Repair Shop. I like the shots of trees, pastures, ponds and birds that are spliced with the scenes inside the barn. I like the absence of cars, the light pizzicato on the soundtrack (a sure sign nothing bad can happen), the seductive artifice that has created William Morris’s utopia in West Sussex. Millions of us watch it. A show that began life early in 2017 as a series of cheap half-hours for BBC2’s daytime schedules now has a 60-minute slot during the evening peak on BBC1. More than 250 episodes of varying lengths have been made (some have still to be shown) and another 50 are at different stages of production. New episodes (there are many repeats) achieve average audiences of between 3 million and 4 million. The formula has been sold in half a dozen countries. “Really good stories, told cost-effectively” has been the basis of the sales pitch. We come to the business of crying. Another reason to like The Repair Shop is that nobody in the show, so far as I know, has asked the question that TV journalism currently finds irresistible. “How did you feel when … your cancer was diagnosed/your little daughter died/your house vanished in the tsunami?” The tears on this show come unprompted. Some customers are tearful and others not, which must also be true of the audience. In a September episode, Pamela from Devon arrived with a chipped, discoloured musical box in which almost no moving part worked. It looked like a souvenir from Venice, mid-20th century in style and attractive in its unabashed souvenir-ness. Pamela’s older sister, Vera, had been the original owner, until she died 50 years ago aged 15 after a long illness. The two girls had been close; for years they shared a bedroom. The music box was a reminder of her sister and the fun they’d had. The only reminder, in fact, because everything else of Vera’s had been destroyed in a terrible fire that gutted the house some time later. An awful tragedy had been revealed in few sentences. Two craftsmen, Will Kirk and Steve Kember, set to work on the box and restored it beautifully, so that when Pamela came back to the barn she could open the lid and hear Around the World in 80 Days. She said it was “amazing” and “incredible” and “thank you so much”, but thankfully she didn’t cry. There comes a point when tears can look like exploitation, both of the subject and her audience. When the great Irish nationalist Daniel O’Connell read of the death of Little Nell in The Old Curiosity Shop, he is said to have thrown away the book in disgust, shouting, “You should not have killed her!” Dickens had been laying it on too thick. Television can do the same. Pamela didn’t cry, but I did. A capricious, wayward thing, crying, and never to be mistaken as a guarantee of sincerity or depth of feeling. A certain combination of music, words and images can bring it on. I cried at neither of my parents’ funerals, and yet I can cry at several points in It’s a Wonderful Life, not least in its last few moments, when James Stewart reads the inscription in the copy of Tom Sawyer that Clarence the Angel has given him: “Remember no man is a failure who has friends.” Clarence the Angel! Hiroshima and Nagasaki had been obliterated only eight months before Frank Capra began filming in 1946; Belsen had been liberated exactly a year before; as a bomber pilot, Stewart himself had been helping to flatten German cities as recently as 1944. Covid will probably cancel our seasonal excursion to see It’s a Wonderful Life this year, but The Repair Shop has a Christmas Special (unpromising phrase) on BBC1 next Friday. Common to both is the occasionally tearful pleasure of escapism in difficult times. Ian Jack is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "‘Extraordinary’ restoration of Roman rock crystal jar from Galloway hoard",
          "bodyText": "When the Galloway hoard was unearthed from a ploughed field in western Scotland in 2014, it offered the richest collection of Viking-age objects ever found in Britain or Ireland. But one of the artefacts paled in comparison with treasures such as a gold bird-shaped pin and a silver-gilt vessel because it was within a pouch that was mangled and misshapen after almost 1,000 years in the ground. Now that pouch has been removed and its contents restored, revealing an extraordinary Roman rock crystal jar wrapped in exquisite layers of gold thread by the finest medieval craftsman in the late eighth or early ninth century. About 5cm high, it may once have held a perfume or other prized potion used to anoint kings, or in religious ceremonies. It had been carefully wrapped in a silk-lined leather pouch, reflecting its significance. The hoard, which included about 100 objects, was buried around AD900 and contained artefacts from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms, Ireland and as far away as Asia. It was unearthed by a metal detectorist on what is now Church of Scotland land in Kirkcudbrightshire. After a fundraising campaign to raise £2m, it was acquired by National Museums Scotland in 2017. Dr Martin Goldberg, NMS’s principal curator of early medieval and Viking collections, described the jar as “really beautiful” and all the more exceptional because his research has led him to conclude that the rock crystal carving was in fact Roman. It was perhaps 600 years old by the time it was transformed into a gold-wrapped jar. He said: “So it’s a really surprising and unique object.” Dr Leslie Webster, former keeper of Britain, prehistory and Europe at the British Museum, said: “Rock crystal is unusual in itself. It … was greatly prized in the antique world for its transparency and translucency, and so it’s associated with purity. So it was, I think even in its time, very, very special … “I’ve seen a lot of Anglo-Saxon finds over the years in my professional career, some of them amazing. But this absolutely knocks them all into a cocked hat.” The restoration has revealed an unexpected Latin inscription on the jar’s base. Spelled out in gold letters, it translates as “Bishop Hyguald had me made”. This is crucial evidence that some of the hoard’s material may have come from a church in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria, which included Dumfries and Galloway and stretched as far north as Edinburgh and as far south as Sheffield. At the start of the 10th century, Alfred the Great was pushing back the Danes, laying the foundations of medieval England and Alba, the kingdom that became medieval Scotland. It is unclear whether the hoard was buried by a Viking – Norse sagas refer to riches being buried to be accessed in the afterlife – or someone fearing Viking raids at a time when ecclesiastical treasures were being robbed from monasteries. Goldberg said that silk was then a particularly luxurious and exotic material: “It’s come from Asia, so it’s travelled thousands of miles. It’s an example of how precious they thought this object inside was,” he said. Although Bishop Hyguald may have been a prominent figure in Northumbrian ecclesiastical circles, church chronicles of the period are incomplete, partly because of the Viking invasions. Goldberg expressed excitement at finding the name. “So much of the past is anonymous, especially when you’re looking at very early history,” he said. “There are very few names to work with. But this is adding new information, building a much richer picture.” The rock crystal design resembles the capital of a Corinthian column, with carved lobes that look like foliage, he realised. “It’s almost a perfect model of a Corinthian column, but the scale is minute,” he said. There is the possibility that this jar still bears trace elements of the potion it once held and that its precise chemicals can be revealed. Goldberg said: “The type of liquid that we would expect would be something very exotic, perhaps a perfume from the Orient, something’s that’s travelled in the same way that the silk has. There were certain types of exotic oil that were used in anointing kings and ecclesiastical ceremonies.” Ninety-seven of the hoard’s artefacts are included in a touring exhibition, titled The Galloway hoard: Viking-age treasure. It is at Kirkcudbright Galleries, near the site of its discovery, until 10 July, transferring to Aberdeen Art Gallery from 30 July to 23 October. The jar is undergoing final work but, from Monday, a new film and digital model will be featured."

          "headline": "Ten board games that your teens might actually play with you this Christmas",
          "bodyText": "The last decade has seen an explosion in the popularity of board and card games that aren’t just the traditional Christmas assortment. Families seeking interesting, actually fun alternatives to Monopoly and Trivial Pursuits have embraced the German-designed classics Catan and Carcassonne, as well as a growing range of exuberant, highly social card games exemplified by the irrepressible Exploding Kittens and the frighteningly timely Pandemic. And now, with successful, critically acclaimed video games such as Slay the Spire and Wildermyth drawing key design principles from board games, it’s the perfect time to tempt the most stubborn console and PC owners away from their screens. Recently I asked video game designers on Twitter for their favourite board and card games to add to my own recommendations. Here then, are 10 examples worth investing in for the festive season, most aimed at teenagers and adults but all fabulously entertaining whether your players are veterans of Cluedo or Call of Duty. Dungeon Mayhem (Wizards of the Coast, £15, 2-4 players) From the creators of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, this is a simple but enjoyably competitive card combat game in which players choose one of four characters and then battle other participants with a range of attack and defence cards, as well as devastating power moves. It’s easy to learn, fast-paced and more tactical than it sounds, and there are expansion packs to add variety later on. The Quacks of Quedlinburg (Schmidt, £35, 2-4 players) When I asked video game designers for their favourite board games, this one came up most often. Each player takes on the role of a quack doctor trying to create the ultimate healing potion. Everyone must blind draw ingredients from a pot to add to their mixtures, but while some additions increase the value of their potions others will eventually explode, so each draw is a gamble. It’s a really fun game, with lots of tension and a clever “catch-up” mechanic to help quacks who’ve fallen behind. Escape the Dark Castle (Themeborne, £25, 1-4 players) Designed to capture the look and feel of early 1980s tabletop role-playing adventures, escape the Dark Castle is a cooperative game in which up to six characters (each with different stats for Might, Cunning and Wisdom), must break out of the eponymous building while avoiding deadly traps and deciding together the best course of action. Each turn, a chapter card is played, which gives a little narrative and a set of options – like a “choose your own adventure” book. I love the visual style of the game, and the fact that it’s cooperative makes a nice change for families prone to board-tipping tantrums. Codenames (Czech Games Edition, £16, 2-8 players) If you like team-based deduction games but are a bit bored of Pictionary or Heads Up!, this is a really fun alternative. Twenty-five word cards are placed on the table and team leaders must attempt to describe the words belonging to their own side without accidentally helping their opponents. It’s filled with social interaction so great for parties. Alternatively, try Monikers (CMYK, £25, 4-20 players), which can get even more loud and lively. Colt Express (Ludonaute, £30, 2-6 players) Another popular choice with video game designers, this Wild West adventure has competing bandits attempting to hold up the same train, shooting and punching each other in their rush to get rich. In a similar style to turn-based strategy games such as XCOM and Into the Breach, players have to pre-plan their actions, utilising the special abilities of their characters. It’s fast-paced and accessible, and with its 3D locomotive model, it has real visual appeal. Incan Gold/Diamant (Sunriver Games, £30, 3-8 players) Combining luck, gambling and bluffing, and a setting that’ll be familiar to anyone who’s watched an Indiana Jones film over Christmas, Incan Gold (also available under the name Diamant) has players exploring a series of ruined temples, going deeper and deeper in search of valuable jewels. The further you explore, however, the more likely you are to encounter a deadly snake or mummy, so you need to know when to get out with the spoils. It’s all played with cards, so you don’t need tons of space, and it’s really well-balanced for family game nights. A nice alternative to this might be Saboteur (Mayfair games, £10, 3-10 players) – a treacherous gold mining card game with a hint of Among Us. Santorini (Spin Master, £30, 2-4 players) If you love world-building strategy sims such as Populous or more recently Islanders or Valheim, this is the one for you. The players are Greek gods competing to construct a city for their followers, using various strategies to create the tallest buildings. The board comes with lovely little building blocks to make the 3D towns, and although the instructions are very simple, the structure allows for a huge array of tactics and outcomes. A cool alternative is the Japanese city-building game Machi Koro. Downforce (Restoration Games, £30, 2-6 players) If you have lots of driving game fans in your household, Downforce should appeal. Players bid on six F1 cars taking part in a race, then “drive” their vehicles by placing cards which have instructions on how many spaces they can move. It sounds simple, but there’s also a mid-race betting mechanism to add extra tension, and to win you need to plan your racing strategy very carefully. Like a board game version of Mario Kart, the whole family can play, and last minute changes in fortune will have you all yelling at each other – in a good-humoured way obviously. If you’re not into cars, try Camel Up, a similar concept but with, um, camels. Azul (Plan B, £35, 2-4 players) One of the most gorgeous looking titles on our list, Azul is billed as an abstract strategy game in which everyone competes to build beautiful mosaic designs from a range of tiles bought from centrally placed factories. In order to earn points, players must complete rows of matching tiles and then transfer the pieces to their wall. There are similarities with block matching video games such as Bejeweled and Candy Crush Saga but in a more refined and thoughtful environment. Starship Samurai (Plaid Hat, £35, 2-4 players) There are lots of branded sci-fi board games out there with Star Wars, Star Trek and Alien all well represented, but I’m recommending this entertaining space war title instead, mostly because it has giant samurai battle mechs. Players represent different races attempting to control a distant galaxy through conflict and cunning. The mech figures are lovely and there’s an expansion pack if you get completely addicted. Honorable mentions There are so many more board games that will capture the imagination of video game fans. Among those suggested to me by multiple game developers were: Splendour, Organ Attack!, Railroad Ink, Century Spice Road, Cutthroat Caverns, Forbidden Island, The Quest for El Dorado, Skull and King of Tokyo. • Many thanks to Matt Jarvis from board gaming site Dicebreaker for his help with this article."

          "headline": "Warmer winters can wreak as much havoc as hotter summers, say scientists",
          "bodyText": "As climate scientist Kai Kornhuber walks around New York City this winter, an eerie feeling creeps into his body. It’s warm enough for a T-shirt in December, and the birds are chirping loudly. The temperatures tell birds and trees that it’s time for action, but the systems are out of sync for December, says Kornhuber, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University’s Earth Institute. “It’s not right, there’s a disconnect between how it should be and how it is.” Kornhuber said. Warmer winters are happening across the globe, and leading to some big impacts: 2021 brought the planet’s 16th-warmest February since records began. While the popular imagination might associate the climate crisis with scorching summers and their attendant droughts, wildfires, hurricanes and heat waves, milder winters can also be drivers of catastrophic weather events and profound changes. They range from shifts in agricultural use, triggering changing weather patterns to boosting the likelihood of violent events, like the swarm of tornadoes that wreaked havoc in the American midwest and south over last weekend. “One of the truisms in climate science is that cold places and cold times of year warm faster than the warmer places and warmer times of year,” says Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at UCLA studying how extreme events are changing on a warming Earth. “Not only is the actual rate of warming faster in colder seasons and places – like the Arctic, which is warming three times faster than other places – but also a lot of impacts that are associated with warming are amplified.” Swain points to one specific threshold where temperature has a huge impact: whether precipitation falls as liquid rain or frozen snow depends on just a single degree difference. And in the west of America, where there was a gigantic snow drought until just a few days ago, that has huge impacts. “There was wildfire risk up until last week, even at 8-9,000ft in elevation,” says Swain. “That has directly to do with the lack of snowpack.” When precipitation falls as snow, it sticks around for longer, creating runoff moisture for the spring season – it’s often referred to as the bank of future water for moisture-strapped places. But when it falls as rain, it runs off immediately. “Winter warming affects the frozenness – or not – of things, which is ecologically important for the accumulation of snowpack and the water supply,” explains Swain. Warm spells in winter can create extreme heat waves later in summer. Unseasonal warmth can lead to a premature snow melt and vegetation growth, which lowers soil moisture and amplifies the likelihood of extreme and persistent heat waves throughout the summer, says Kornhuber. He points to the chain of events that led up to a heatwave that rocked Siberia in 2020 and was associated with wildfires that lasted the whole summer and caused record breaking carbon emissions. In that event, late-winter heat in February and March sucked moisture from the soils at a time when vegetation was also taking up moisture – and parched soils can lead to summer heat waves, says Kornhuber. “Low soil moisture is one of the most important ingredients of mega heatwaves.” Climate model projections for the United States indicate that overall there will be an increase in the likelihood of conditions favorable to severe storms as the planet warms, says Chiara Lepore, an associate research scientist at Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University. Lepore published research last month predicting 14-25% increase in severe storms per every extra 1C degree of future global temperature increase. “The main driving mechanism is warming temperatures and increasing moisture, which are some of the major ingredients in storm updrafts.” She adds that that number represents the increasing frequency of conditions favorable to severe weather occurrence – not actual storms – and only some of these storms will produce tornadoes, she says. “The uncertainty is still large.” Swain says the climate crisis evidence is weaker for tornadoes than for other huge storms, but that’s mainly because it hasn’t been studied as much. “The vertical instability – which is likely with more warming – would create an increase in tornado-producing environments,” he says. “So it’s pretty clear that climate change will begin to increase the likelihood of severe convective weather.” Warmer winters can also impact agriculture, as some crops require a threshold of chill hours to achieve optimal outcomes. Cold temperatures that many orchard crops need could decrease by as much as 60% in California’s Central Valley by 2100. Researchers say apples, cherries and pears, which require the longest period of cold weather, could be hit the hardest. Late-winter heat can also wreak havoc on crops, if they get the biological signal to flourish, only to be knocked down by frost soon after budding. “It goes to show that relatively small amounts of global warming can have big effects in certain places and certain times of year,” says Swain. There is even evidence that climate change is at the heart of freak events like the cold snap that left Texas in a deep arctic freeze last February, causing hundreds of deaths and billions of dollars in damage. A weak polar vortex became divided and brought a big gush of cold air to the southern United States – and the vortex is more unstable than in the past. Kornhuber says that winter warming is essentially another form of saying that the summer season extends more and more, while the spring and fall transitions squeeze out what we used to think of as wintertime. “As temperatures increase, moderate climate zones just will not have winter the way we know it anymore.”"

          "headline": "Surface Pro 8 review: Microsoft’s best Windows tablet gets big upgrade",
          "bodyText": "Microsoft’s category-defining Windows 11 tablet finally gets the design and feature upgrade Surface Pro fans have been clamouring for, but it comes with the sting of price hike. The Surface Pro 8 starts at £999 ($999/A$1,649), without the essential £160 ($160/A$260) keyboard, which is £100 more for the tablet and £35 more for the keyboard than last year’s equivalent models. It’s the biggest upgrade since 2014: the design has been revamped to match the more modern-looking Surface Pro X, with rounded corners, slimmer bezels and a switch from magnesium to aluminium for the body. It is 116g heavier and 0.8mm thicker than the last model but looks and feels great. At 13in on the diagonal, the screen is bigger than the 12.3in of its predecessors. It is still compact compared with a laptop, but the larger screen makes working with multiple windows a bit easier. The display supports a faster refresh rate of up to 120Hz too, which is common on smartphones, high-end tablets and found on Apple’s latest MacBook Pro. Disappointingly the 120Hz screen is a feature yet to be fully realised. The Pro 8 is waiting on a firmware update due next year to enable variable refresh rates, which allows the screen to automatically adjust its speed depending on the content on display, saving battery for static images while being super smooth for fast moving animations. For now it is set to 60Hz by default to save battery life. Specifications Screen: 13in LCD 2880x1920 (267 PPI) 120Hz Processor: Intel Core i5 or i7 (11th generation) RAM: 8, 16 or 32GB Storage: 128, 256, 512GB or 1TB Graphics: Intel Iris Xe Operating system: Windows 11 Home Camera: 10MP rear, 5MP front with Windows Hello Connectivity: Wifi 6, Bluetooth 5.1, 2x Thunderbolt 4/USB-4, headphones, Surface Connect Dimensions: 287 x 208x 9.3 mm Weight: 891g (without keyboard) Faster and quieter The Pro 8 ships with new 11th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 chips (as tested), which are 10%-15% faster than previous models in benchmarks and matched the performance of the Surface Laptop 4. A cooling system upgrade keeps the machine silent for most of the time, requiring the fans a lot less frequently than previous versions, which was a very welcome change. Microsoft has finally adopted Thunderbolt connectivity too, kitting out the Pro 8 with two USB/Thunderbolt 4 ports, which is a big, modern upgrade for connecting to displays, high-speed drives and docks, as well as charging. However, the useful microSD card slot and USB-A socket of previous models have been removed. Battery life remains very similar to previous models with only about seven hours of work between charges, which is less than half the 16 hours of the market-leading MacBook Air. Sustainability Microsoft does not provide an expected lifespan for the Pro 8’s battery; those in similar devices typically maintain at least 80% of their original capacity for in excess of 500 full charge cycles. The tablet is generally repairable with an out-of-warranty service fee of £424.02 and a battery replacement fee of £280.44. The tablet contains no recycled materials, but Microsoft operates recycling schemes for old machines, publishes a company-wide sustainability report and a breakdown of each product’s environmental impact. Windows 11 The Pro 8 runs the new Windows 11, which is the same as the Go 3 tablet, but is much snappier because of the faster chips. Windows 11 is a better fit for a tablet, with a more touch-friendly interface and significantly improved touchscreen keyboard. Windows 11 is still a little rough around the edges but is improving rapidly. Those transitioning from Windows 10 will find it mostly works the same with a few design changes such as the central Start menu. Signature keyboard and Slim Pen 2 The Pro 8 tablet is only half the equation. It supports Microsoft’s updated Signature detachable keyboard, which is stiffer and flexes less when you type than its predecessor. The keys and trackpad are still great. The new Slim Pen 2 stylus has a small vibrating motor in it, which activates when you drag the it across the screen to provide the sensation of pen-on-paper. It won’t miraculously give you artistic talent, but it really adds to the experience of drawing or writing on glass. Some apps can make the pen feel like it is clicking, too, when you activate certain functions or menus. The Slim Pen 2’s haptics only work in apps that support it, such as Microsoft’s Word, Journal, Whiteboard and PowerPoint, Adobe Fresco and a small handful of others so far. Observations The speakers are decent and can get quite loud, but lack bass. The screen is very reflective, which could make using it outdoors in direct light a challenge. Price The Microsoft Surface Pro 8 starts at £999 ($999/A$1,649) with an Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and is available in various different memory and storage combinations. Versions with the Core i7 chip start at £1,499 ($1,599/A$2,399). The Signature keyboard costs £159.99 ($159.99/A$259.95) on its own or £259.99 ($279.99/A$429.95) with the Slim Pen 2. For comparison, the Surface Laptop 4 starts at £799, the Surface Go 2 costs £369, the Samsung Galaxy Book Pro 360 costs £1,199, the Apple iPad Pro 12.9in costs £999, the MacBook Air costs £999 and the MacBook Pro costs £1,899. Verdict The Surface Pro 8 is Microsoft’s best tablet PC yet, finally adding some much-needed modern upgrades to an already winning formula. The more rounded, sleeker design feels great. The larger, better screen with smaller bezels helps productivity. It has the latest Intel chips, runs much quieter and finally has Thunderbolt connectivity for docks, drives, displays and much more. Battery life is just about good enough for a day of work, but miles behind market leaders. The 120Hz display will be a great feature once it is fully realised with an update. The removal of the microSD card slot is slightly disappointing, but the modular SSD is very welcome. The real starting cost of £1,160 with keyboard is slightly more than the equivalent standard laptop. If you want a compact and adaptable Windows 11 machine that can turn from a solid laptop replacement to a creative tablet in an instant, the Surface Pro 8 is unrivalled. Pros: great screen, good performance, Thunderbolt4/USB-4, excellent keyboard (essential additional purchase), excellent kickstand, Windows Hello, solid build, great stylus (optional purchase), removable SSD. Cons: fairly expensive, keyboard should be included, no USB-A port, no microSD card slot, waiting for an update to enable the variable refresh rate of the screen.

          "headline": "Banks should be forced to service all ‘law-abiding businesses’, inquiry finds",
          "bodyText": "Banks should be forced to provide services to all “law-abiding businesses”, including export industries such as coal and live animal exports, a parliamentary inquiry has concluded. The inquiry, chaired by Nationals MP George Christensen, also called for treasury to examine “activist pressure” on banks in relation to lending to the resources industry and “if necessary develop options to address this issue”. Labor and the Greens have rejected the conclusions of the inquiry, saying incoherent climate policy, not banks, is to blame for job losses. The trade and investment standing committee report, tabled on Friday, is a mixed bag: on the one hand demanding regulators consult the resources sector more on climate change risk guidance, while on the other recognising net zero emissions will create investment opportunities. The report reflects the diversity of its members’ views, from Christensen, a fierce critic of financial institutions for their refusal to lend to resource projects, to Liberal MP Katie Allen, a proponent of net zero emissions. Banks had told the inquiry they needed to actively manage climate risk because governments and regulators required it, and because the investor community was “increasingly transitioning its focus towards a net zero emissions economy”. In his foreword, Christensen claimed that climate risk was “ill-defined” and amounted to “a veneer” for decisions made by “political and public relations considerations”. “The committee was concerned to learn that profitable and law-abiding companies in some of the country’s main export sectors – predominantly coal but also live animal exports – face the threat of losing access to essential services such as transactional banking, finance and appropriately priced insurance,” he said. Christensen accused companies of “thinly veiled corporate wokery”, bowing to “bad press” and “minority but noisy shareholder activism”. The majority report of Coalition MPs urges the government ensure “at a minimum” that banks provide transactional banking services to law-abiding businesses, a wide-ranging recommendation that could also benefit sex workers and gun shops refused banking services. It recommends the government “direct the banks to prepare a regulatory impact statement that outlines the real impacts of a policy setting … such as job losses and economic impacts, and detailing industry feedback … before withdrawing funding from any export project”. The inquiry asked the government to consider laws requiring shareholders to be consulted before decisions “to withdraw funding from export-focused projects”. It asked government to work with the resources industry to “create a self-funding insurance model”, which the Greens labelled “oxymoronic” and warned could lead to taxpayers being on the hook to underwrite such a scheme. In addition to the treasury review of activist pressure, the inquiry called for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to investigate whether refusing loans or insurance to the resources industry breaches competition law, which bans companies from acting “in concert”. The government should then “consider options to ensure that viable, profitable and lawful businesses can access reasonably priced finance and insurance services”, it said. On Thursday the reserve bank labelled climate change a “systemic risk” for the financial sector, a fact that tends to suggest banks are responding to the same imperative to mitigate risk rather than acting in an anti-competitive fashion. In their dissenting report, Labor MPs and senators said the recommendations would “impose a substantial material risk to the Australian economy”, warning of increased costs of insurance, business loans and even residential mortgages. The Labor report said the finance sector was anticipating lower coal export prices and volumes in the future and the “widely recognised” risks of climate change itself. In a separate dissenting report, Greens senator Dorinda Cox said the inquiry was a “barely concealed PR campaign for the fossil fuel industry”. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Cox said the inquiry was premised on the idea “regulators and banks are not making a rational assessment of the threat posed by the climate emergency … [that] those whose job it is to assess risk by the trillions have all got it wrong”. The move to blame “activists” ignored “the fact that the global transition to net zero is already under way whether the Morrison government likes it or not”, she said."

          "headline": "Indigenous Voice model revealed – but no national representation until after 2022 election",
          "bodyText": "Scott Morrison has denied breaking a promise after the new model of Indigenous Australians’ Voice to parliament was revealed to be a series of local bodies and a national body that will not be set up until after the election. On Friday, Morrison sidestepped a question about whether the national body will be legislated after the Indigenous Australians minister, Ken Wyatt, released the model for Indigenous Voices to provide input into both the Australian government and parliament . The government has sought further input by 30 April. No legislation will be introduced before the 2022 election. Instead, it will begin by starting 25 to 35 local and regional Voice bodies, working with states, territories and local governments to form the consultative groups that would eventually have input into representatives on the national body. The proposal is controversial not just for its timing, but also because a legislated body does not fully implement the recommendation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart for the Voice to be constitutionally enshrined. The shadow Indigenous Australians minister, Linda Burney, marked the announcement as “a fail”, noting the government had called the Voice a priority but “on the eve of an election” had rolled out a model bearing “little resemblance to the Uluru Statement”. Burney said the Uluru statement promised “an enshrined voice, a permanent voice, to the parliament” but the government was not even clear if it would be legislated. “There may be legislation, there may not be,” she told ABC TV. Before the 2019 election Wyatt had promised a legislated voice, but Morrison later clarified he wanted consensus on a model and was prepared to “take as long as is needed” to achieve it. On Friday Morrison said he had committed “to follow the co-design process” and delivered that commitment, without directly answering a question about whether he would legislate the body. “What I’m trying to do here is ensure that we can hear the voices of Indigenous people on the ground because I want to close the gap,” he told reporters in Sydney. “This is not some political exercise.” “This is about listening to local Indigenous communities and that’s where the voice must start.” Wyatt told Guardian Australia local input into the national body was part of a “continuing co-design of the Indigenous Voice [that] will ensure the greatest chance of its success”. The model, produced by a co-design process that began in October 2019, proposes two levels of Voice bodies at the local and regional, and national level – although the structure and selection of each is yet to be determined. Boundaries for local and regional groups are also still unclear. A discussion paper suggested the national body could be directly elected in each state and territory, or selected by regional Voice bodies, or picked by state and territory assemblies. The national body “could” consist of up to 20 members, with guaranteed gender balance of members and inclusion of youth and disability advisory groups, it said. The national body would report to both the Australian parliament and government, a “dual advice function reflects the different roles of government and parliament in making laws and policies”, the final co-design report said. The interaction would be two-way “with each able to initiate advice or commence discussion around relevant policy matters”. “The Australian parliament and government would be ‘obliged’ to ask the National Voice for advice on a defined and limited number of proposed laws and policies that overwhelmingly affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.” In their final report the co-chairs of the design panel, professors Marcia Langton and Tom Calma, said the proposal “could be the most significant reform in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs for generations”. The pair said there was “strong feedback that an Indigenous Voice must be secure and enduring, and appropriately protected”. “While consideration of legal form was outside our co-design responsibility, we were not surprised by the growing support for constitutional enshrinement that was particularly evident in submissions.” They noted the arguments that constitutional enshrinement would protect the Voice against abolition, “enhance its effectiveness and recognise the unique place of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in our nation”. In November Calma told Guardian Australia he was “very keen” to see voice created “before the election”. Despite the Uluru statement’s call for constitutional entrenchment, Wyatt has been frank that a legislated voice is the most pragmatic solution in the short term because a referendum is “too important to fail”. On Friday, Wyatt said the government had “delivered” on its 2019 election commitment to develop models and options for an Indigenous Voice, and the proposal follows “an extensive co-design process involving more than 9,400 people, communities and organisations” “It’s important to get this right,” he said. “And, for the Indigenous Voice to work, it must have a strong foundation from the ground up. That’s why we’re taking the next step and starting with the local and regional Voice.” “The local and regional Voice will contribute to achieving the closing the gap outcomes by providing avenues for Indigenous voices to be heard, including to provide feedback to government.” Labor supports a constitutionally enshrined Voice as a “modest and gracious request” from First Nations people, and has promised to hold a referendum if it wins government. “Our precondition for support is that any proposition has the support of the First Nations people and so we think that the denial of a constitutionally enshrined voice is the denial of the Australian instinct for a fair go,” Anthony Albanese said earlier this year."

          "headline": "Widow of Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet dies age 99",
          "bodyText": "Lucía Hiriart, the widow of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, has died at her home at the age of 99. Hiriart – an intensely divisive figure in Chile – had rarely been seen in public in recent years and her health has been kept a closely guarded secret. Cristián Labbé, a former government secretary who was an agent of Pinochet’s feared secret police and remains close to the family, confirmed Hiriart’s death to Chilean daily La Tercera on Thursday. The news came three days before the second round of Chile’s most divisive presidential election since the country returned to democracy in 1990. Voters will choose between the leftwing former student leader Gabriel Boric – who promises to rid Chile of Pinochet’s socioeconomic legacy – and far-right politician José Antonio Kast, an outspoken supporter of the dictatorship. Chile’s uncomfortable relationship with its recent past was at the centre of mass protests in 2019 and 2020 in which demonstrators called for an overhaul of the country’s neoliberal economic model and the rewriting the country’s constitution, drafted during the dictatorship. As news of her death broke on Thursday, crowds gathered to celebrate in Santiago’s main plaza – the epicentre of months of protests last year. Hiriart’s death only sharpens the focus on the choice facing voters on Sunday – and the deep and persistent divisions within Chilean society. She was seen by some as a philanthropist who dedicated her life to the service of the Chilean people. For others, she was a reviled and enduring symbol of the dictatorship and its bitter legacy in Chile. Boric tweeted that Hiriart “died in impunity, despite the deep pain and division she caused in our country”. Since 2014, a Twitter account called “Has the old woman died?” has intermittently posted the word “No”. On Thursday, it tweeted the word “yes”, receiving tens of thousands of retweets. Hiriart was born into a wealthy family in the coastal city of Antofagasta in northern Chile in 1922. Her father was a politician who briefly served as Chile’s interior minister in the 1940s. She was married to General Pinochet from 1943 until the former dictator died in 2006 without ever facing justice for the crimes committed under his 1973-1990 dictatorship. During his 17-year reign, more then 3,000 people were killed or disappeared and tens of thousands tortured. In his memoirs, Pinochet wrote that Hiriart had helped persuade him to participate in the 1973 coup against the democratically elected government of Salvador Allende. “One night, my wife took me into the bedroom where my grandchildren were sleeping and said: ‘They will become slaves because you are not able to make a decision,’” he wrote. According to several biographers, she held uncommon sway in La Moneda, Chile’s presidential palace. While Chile’s first lady, Hiriart founded several foundations and charities, including the Cema-Chile foundation, whose assets she was accused of embezzling to fund General Pinochet’s living expenses while under house arrest in London in 1998. Hiriart was sued by two Communist party politicians and a group of the dictatorship’s victims’ families in 2016, alleging Cema had been engaged in tax fraud, embezzlement and misappropriation of public assets. In 2005, she was sued by Chile’s inland revenue service for tax evasion, and was arrested alongside her five children in 2007 in a separate embezzlement case. Hiriart is survived by her five children."

          "bodyText": "UK food and drink exports fell by 16% in the first nine months of 2021, according to industry figures that revealed the devastating impact of Brexit and the pandemic on the value of trade. The Food and Drink Federation (FDF) said the sector’s exports declined by £2.7bn between January and September compared with pre-pandemic levels, a drop it blamed largely on a 24% decrease in sales to EU countries. Labour said the decline in sales to the 27 member states would harm the UK’s ability to create well-paid jobs in export industries, adding that the decrease also undermined the government’s claim of improving Britain’s global trade ambitions. Dominic Goudie, the FDF’s head of international trade, said it was essential ministers worked constructively with the EU to improve relations, “otherwise this downturn will be here to stay”. Food manufacture is one of Britain’s biggest employers and the largest single manufacturing sector, ahead of carmaking and the chemical industry. Exports of food and drink to Germany fell 44.5%, and by 43.3% to Italy. Exports to Spain were especially hard hit, more than halving (50.6%). The FDF said global exports of whisky and salmon started to recover this year, with sales of both products up 21% compared with 2020. All other major products, including beef, cheese and pork were down, falling 18.4%, 13.2% and 5.7% respectively. Non-EU markets racked up healthy percentage gains, though from a much lower base than exports to the EU. Demand for UK goods in China and Taiwan pushed their growth rates to above 20%, while exports to Japan were up 10.6% and those to Singapore rose 5.4%. The FDF said imports were also badly hit, with sales from the EU down nearly 11% in the nine months to September compared with pre-Covid levels. The £2.5bn fall affected the Netherlands, Ireland and Germany the most. Goudie said: “It is extremely disappointing to see how badly our trade with the EU has been affected, with our smallest exporters hardest hit. It is vital that the UK government and devolved nations continue to work with industry to put in place a new model of partnership to support food and drink exporters.” “They need government to clear the obstacles and help them take advantage of new opportunities,” he added. Gareth Thomas, the shadow minister for international trade, said: “Ministers need to accelerate support to food and drink exporters to reverse this decline in sales to France, Germany and other European countries otherwise we risk seeing others take long-term trade opportunities away from British businesses putting good jobs and firms at risk. “Sorting out urgently a veterinary agreement, putting long-term solutions in place for the supply chain crisis including on HGV drivers, and helping more firms navigate new customs rules are essential.” The government was contacted for comment."

          "headline": "The climate crisis is killing migrants trying to cross the US border, study finds",
          "bodyText": "Undocumented migrants who attempt to cross the border from Mexico to the US are disproportionately dying in a harsh stretch of desert that is becoming deadlier due to the climate crisis, a new research has found. Migrants and asylum seekers trying to enter the US are often forced to traverse the harsh environment of the Sonoran desert in order to avoid border patrols and fortified crossing points. This hazardous journey is putting many of them under severe physical stress, according to researchers, with many dying in the heat due to dehydration and organ failure. This risk will only intensify as the world heats up further due to human activity, with the research finding that in the next three decades migrants will become so dehydrated in the desert that they will have to carry 34% more water with them in order to survive. “Crossing the border across these extreme environments is really dangerous for humans to do and in the next 30 years, with rising temperatures, it’s going to become even more extreme and push those levels to even further beyond what humans can actually sustain,” said Hallie Walker, a researcher at the University of Idaho and co-author of the research, published in Science. “It is incredibly dangerous.” In the year to 30 September, US border agents apprehended more than 1.7 million people attempting to cross from Mexico into the US. Many of those who avoid arrest do so by taking on the daunting journey across the Sonoran desert, a rocky, scrubby expanse of land in Mexico and the southwestern US that oscillates between scorching heat in summer to freezing conditions in winter and contains more species of rattlesnake than any region in the world. An estimated 350 people a year, many fleeing violence and persecution at home, die attempting this crossing, with some of these deaths due to suicide, exposure or car accidents. Researchers found, however, that a significant risk is the loss of fluids in a region where summer temperatures can reach 48C (118F). Using a model that factored in the physical toll of making a journey from Nogales, a Mexican border city and Three Points, Arizona, the study found that people can succumb to the conditions within just a few days, with migrants often ill-prepared for the journey. The stress is highest for pregnant women and children, with the research finding that a pregnant women needs nearly 12 liters of water a day to survive making the trek in June. Many do not get the adequate water and rest required, leading to deaths. The study found a “significant correlation between high levels of predicted evaporative water loss and the density of deaths” which “strongly implicate temperature and water availability as major contributors to broader patterns of migrant mortality during summer”. The loss of water can cause disorientation and hallucinations, before becoming potentially fatal. The research cites interviews with migrants who explain how their toenails fell off during long hikes over the desert’s mountains or how they lost their eyesight and suffered chest pains as they struggled onward. “Essentially the US is funneling individuals into places that they experience such extreme physiological stress that I, as an evolutionary biologist, couldn’t get approval from my university to put animals through the sorts of stresses that individuals are being put through,” said Shane Campbell-Staton, a researcher at Princeton and lead author of the study. “That’s how extreme these physiological stresses are.” Migrants crossing the US’ southern border have become a political target in recent years, with Donald Trump instituting punishing detention and child separation policies, as well as a system known as “remain in Mexico”, which expels people back to Mexico as their claim to stay in the US is considered. Joe Biden opposed this plan but recently reinstated it following a legal challenge from two states. This sort of deterrence is unlikely to completely halt people from seeking refuge in the US, particularly those increasingly fleeing intolerable conditions in Mexico and Central America that are being worsened by the climate crisis. A series of droughts and storms have wreaked havoc upon communities, particularly farmers, forcing them to seek livable alternatives further north. “We knowingly kill them at the border. And yet we ignore them once they’re here, when they’re doing the jobs that Americans don’t want to do,” said Jason De Leon, an anthropologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was also involved in the study. “I think we were about to live in a climatic version of the book Children of Men, where instead of a fertility issue, we’re dealing now with a global climatic issue. We are seeing people having to leave their homes because of climate change,” he added. “And I think that we can no longer disentangle those two things, that they’re intimately related and it’s only going to get worse, unfortunately for a lot of people around the globe.”"

          "headline": "MEPs rebuke Slovenian government over attacks on media",
          "bodyText": "The European parliament has rebuked Slovenia’s government for “attacks, smear campaigns and slander” against journalists and critics, in a vote that underlines rising alarm about the threat to media freedom. MEPs backed a resolution condemning the Slovenian government for a “climate of hostility, distrust and deep polarisation” and seeking to weaken independent prosecutors and interfere with state-funded media. The resolution did not name Slovenia’s prime minister, Janez Janša, but is clearly aimed at the rightwing nationalist politician, who has called journalists liars and “presstitutes”, attacked investigative reporters and promoted conspiracy theories. While the resolution is non-binding, it shines an uncomfortable spotlight on Slovenia in the final weeks of its six months holding the EU’s rotating presidency. MEPs from the parliament’s centre-right European People’s Party, which counts Janša as a member, largely voted against the text, although a handful abstained. The resolution was passed with 356 votes in favour, 284 against and 40 abstentions, having secured the backing of the centre-left, liberal, radical left and green groups. An amendment drafted by a Belgian nationalist MEP congratulating Slovenia for a “successful” presidency of the EU council and noting that its institutions function well failed to win support. The parliament’s investigation was triggered by Slovenia’s delay in nominating prosecutors to the European public prosecutor’s office, a new body tasked with investigating fraud against the EU budget. Two people were nominated in November, but the government has since described these as temporary and sought to change the rules on the appointment of public prosecutors, meaning they could be dismissed. Slovenia’s emergency Covid rules have also come under scrutiny, with MEPs voicing concerns about the “continuing practice of rule by decree” without parliamentary scrutiny. One of the strongest concerns was freedom of the press, after government pressure on the Slovenia News Agency (STA). Janša’s government withheld the legally mandated state subsidy for most of 2021, bringing the agency to the point of bankruptcy. Most of the money has since been paid, but at least €507,000 remains outstanding, according to the European parliament. Similarly, MEPs called for Slovenia’s government to secure “sufficient funding” and “cease all political interference and pressure” on the public television network RTV Slovenia. Following the model of Viktor Orbán’s government in Hungary, Janša has sought to curb the independence of publicly funded media. He has called the Slovenian news agency a national disgrace and tried to remove its director general. On Twitter he accused an RTV Slovenia journalist of lying when they compared health spending with military spending. Unnamed Slovenian public figures and members of the government also stand accused by the European parliament of smear campaigns, slander against critics and using lawsuits to suppress public interest journalism. Slovenia is ranked 36th in the World Press Freedom Index compiled by Reporters Without Borders, down four places on its 2020 ranking. The NGO has raised concern about the criminalisation of defamation and “slanderous verbal attacks” from politicians, a trend it says worsened after Janša became prime minister in March 2020. Janša, who was in Brussels on Thursday for a summit of EU leaders, has yet to respond to the vote. When MEPs visited Ljubljana on a fact-finding mission in October, Janša described some as “Soros puppets”, in a tweet referring to the Hungarian philanthropist George Soros that fits into antisemitic conspiracy theories. The image embedded in the tweet, later deleted, was said to have come from a radical hate blog, and pictured several prominent MEPs from the Netherlands including Sophie in ‘t Veld, who led the parliament’s fact-finding mission. The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, condemned the tweet “in the strongest possible terms” and the Slovenian ambassador was summoned to hear the same message. Janša responded by calling on Rutte and In ‘t Veld to “protect your journalists from being killed in the streets”, an apparent reference to the crime reporter Peter de Vries who was fatally shot in central Amsterdam in July."

          "bodyText": "Vegan barbecue is still an oxymoron for many, but as greater numbers of Australians turn to flexitarian diets, if not fully vegetarian or vegan, the meatless summer barbie is upon us. I’ll admit, the idea of barbecue without a prime cut, or even a simple snag, is a compromise I’ve not yet made. But I love veggies, their versatility, how you can transform them with fire and coals, and I’ve increasingly favoured them as a predominant element of dishes, so now feels like the time to make the change to meatless, if only some of the time. Kit-wise, when doing a vegetarian barbecue, you may want to consider a model that has both a flat plate and a grill – it’ll make it easier to cook both faux meat and raw veggies. Tofu, meet marinade Suzy Spoon started her Vegetarian Butcher back in 2012, first as a stall at Sydney’s Marrickville markets, before making a bricks-and-mortar commitment of a shopfront in nearby Newtown. Spoon says there are many great brands of sausages and burger patties and different seitan and gluten-based products that you can “jazz up”, but getting started with a meatless barbecue is as simple as a pack of tofu and a good marinade. Slicing up your tofu a couple of centimetres or so thick and putting it on paper towel allows you to push out some of the water, then when you put it in the marinade, the tofu soaks it up. “You know, like that old Colgate ad: like liquid into the chalk,” laughs Spoon. For the time poor, it could be a case of a quick dip for the tofu and straight onto the grill, but longer is always better when it comes to a marinade. Spoon’s easy take is as simple as a measure of olive oil to a measure of soy sauce in a jar, shaken well into an emulsion. You could add a little bit of Dijon mustard, she says, using the marinade on tofu, mushrooms, eggplant or cauliflower. Picking your veggies You may grill asparagus, cauliflowers and the like whole, but skewers are a good way to prep in advance. At standing events, things on sticks are always a good move. Load them with veggies and then marinate them on the skewer. There’s a category of veg that we could term underrated or unexpected when it comes to the barbecue. If I say leeks, you may think tarts or soups, but barbecued they’re charred and crisp on the outer skin, smokey throughout and deliciously sweet and soft at their core. I’d also add the likes of baby cos lettuce and brussels sprouts to that list. The magic of mushrooms shouldn’t be forgotten, often used in vegan products to mimic “meatiness”. The portobello in its natural form was a faithful burger substitute for decades before the likes of the Impossible Burger hit our consciousness. Cooking faux meat Not all meatless products are created equally. Spoon’s products – available throughout Australia – are made with beans or legumes, like a polenta sausage made with yellow split pea and polenta, flavoured with sun-dried tomato and basil. “You don’t need to be vegan or vegetarian to eat that,” Spoon says. “You just need to like nice food. It’s a great sausage for flexitarians that just want to have something that’s not a piece of meat at their barbecue.” Alejandro Cancino was executive chef of Brisbane’s three-hatted Urbane restaurant before he founded Fenn Foods, the makers of Veef products. “We want to mimic meat,” he says. “Our pulled products are made with shiitake mushrooms, and the burger is made with soy and Australian pea protein.” While the product may mimic in look and taste, there are differences that should be considered, says Cancino, to get the best result from a plant-based patty or sausage. Eat it while hot, he says, as the texture changes as it cools. Further, plant-based meat products, compared with real meat patties and sausages, have a lesser fat content, meaning they release less oil, he says. So when you put them on the barbecue they tend to stick, and sausages may tear. Brushing them with a little oil will avoid that sticking. Get creative Finally, I’d implore home cooks to experiment. We’ve all got fridges, cupboards and pantries crammed with oils, condiments, herbs and spices that sit waiting for the recipe that never comes. It’s hardly technical advice, but have a play, and marinate to your own palate. If you taste as you go, it’s unlikely to be a disaster."

          "bodyText": "The fast fashion group Boohoo has warned that full-year profits and sales will be lower than expected after being hit by more customers returning clothes, delivery disruptions and surging costs. Shares in the online clothing retailer plunged 15% in response to its second warning in four months, despite its insistence that the current difficulties facing the business were mostly related to the pandemic and therefore “transient in nature”. Boohoo said that while overall demand had grown since the first and second quarter, it was suffering the effects of global shipping delays, rising costs linked to the pandemic, and “exceptionally high” levels of returns linked to an increase in sales of dresses that forced the group to slash full-year expectations for sales growth to just 12-14%. It was down from previous guidance of 20-25% sales growth in the year ending 28 February. The group said profit margins would also be hit by the return rates and lower than hoped for sales overseas. “This reflects our expectation that the factors impacting our performance in the period persist through the remainder of the financial year, and recent developments surrounding the Omicron variant could pose further demand uncertainty and elevated returns rates particularly in January and February,” Boohoo said in a trading statement on Thursday morning. In the UK, Boohoo said net sales were up 32% in the three months to November, compared with a year earlier, reflecting “exceptional” local demand. However, returned items were up 12.5% on an annual basis, and 7% higher than before the pandemic due primarily to selling more dresses, which are more fitted than the comfy clothing in vogue during the first year of the pandemic and so customers are more likely to buy several sizes and send some back. The company’s acquisition of brands including Coast and Karen Millen, which sell higher priced dresses, has heightened the impact of those shopping patterns. That trend is likely to have continued into December, as Christmas and end-of-year parties are cancelled due to the spread of the Omicron variant. Boohoo – which also owns the Debenhams, Burton, Wallis and Dorothy Perkins brands – is among a raft of retailers struggling during the pandemic due to global shipping delays. Some ships have failed to dock at ports due to local lockdowns or staff shortages, creating a ripple effect that has affected deliveries internationally. However, the fast fashion group’s UK business has been partly shielded from those effects, due to local warehouse storage that has made it faster to ship clothing to British consumers. “The group has gained significant market share during the pandemic. The current headwinds are short term and we expect them to soften when pandemic-related disruption begins to ease,” the Boohoo chief executive, John Lyttle, said. “Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the strong performance in the UK, which clearly validates the Boohoo model,” he added. “Our focus is now on improving the international proposition through continued investment in our global distribution network.” Caroline Gulliver, an analyst at Stifel, said: “With multiple profit warnings across the retail industry in recent weeks the factors behind Boohoo’s warning are not a surprise, but the magnitude of the slowdown and hit to [profit] margin is, given the confidence the company had three months ago.” She said the problems were likely to continue beyond February as freight capacity had not bounced back as quickly as hoped and it could take at least a year for Boohoo’s US and European distribution centres, which would reduce the need for shipping from the UK, to be finalised."

          "bodyText": "When John Purnell’s 10-year-old son was diagnosed as autistic, he knew exactly how to respond. “I’ve always been fascinated by research, by detail, by finding out everything there is to find out about something,” he says. “So I did a really deep dive.” As he pored over academic papers and delved into medical science – including how many autistic people have a propensity and appetite for copious research – an unexpected realisation crept into his mind. “I was reading about the traits of an autistic person, the difficulties they often have in social situations, the need for order and planning: and suddenly I thought: this person they’re describing isn’t just my son – it’s me.” Purnell is far from alone in discovering that he’s autistic as a result of his child being diagnosed. Viewers of a recent BBC One documentary, Our Family and Autism, saw the same thing happen to the model Christine McGuinness, whose three young children with her television presenter husband, Paddy, are all on the autistic spectrum. In recent years, the number of people diagnosed with autism has rocketed; a study of diagnosis trends, published in August, found the median age for diagnosis is 10 for males and 13 for females, and there was a 787% exponential increase in its recorded incidence, in the 20 years to 2018. An unexpected result of the greater number of children being diagnosed has been that many parents have discovered that they are autistic, too, often by figuring it out for themselves, as both Purnell and McGuinness did. There are no exact figures, says Professor Simon Baron-Cohen of Cambridge University, Britain’s leading academic on autism, but it is a phenomenon. And it’s not that there are suddenly more autistic people, but that diagnosis in the past was inadequate and medicine is catching up. Often, says Baron-Cohen, these autistic adults do not necessarily need a formal diagnosis. “The key question is: are autistic characteristics interfering with your ability to function?” While he welcomes the more accurate picture, he doesn’t want the new numbers to dilute the understanding of what it means to be autistic. “It’s a medical diagnosis and you only get it if the symptoms you have are causing distress,” he points out. Purnell, managing director of a successful business, has adapted well – on one level at least. “Now I understand my autism, I can see how helpful it has been through my working life,” he says. In a letter to colleagues after the diagnosis, he wrote: “Among the many benefits I see for being autistic is that I’m incredibly organised and get a lot done. I also have a very strong attention to detail, can take into account a lot of information quickly and see relevant patterns that help me make good decisions.” The condition also explains behaviour his colleagues might have found unusual. “There have been times when I’ve said to people I work with: ‘I really don’t care what anyone thinks of me.’ And they have said: ‘Really? Do you really not care?’” All his life, Purnell has found socialising very stressful and his teenage years were extremely difficult: he battled depression, anxiety and anger, which he now knows are linked to his condition. In the McGuinness family documentary, Christine comes close to tears after receiving her diagnosis from Baron-Cohen. It’s such a relief, she says, to realise she wasn’t just being difficult. Like so many autistic people, John included, the hardest thing has been trying to fit in with societal norms established by neurotypical people. The important takeaway for society as a whole, Baron-Cohen believes, is that it’s the world that needs to get used to autism – not autistic people who need to get used to the world. The reason children are more likely to be diagnosed now is down to increased awareness among parents and teachers; and the reason it’s likely to be diagnosed at 10 and 13, is that it usually coincides with the move from primary to secondary school. “Having to navigate a much bigger and more complicated social scene often makes autism more apparent,” says Baron-Cohen. A spin-off from the phenomenon of a parent’s diagnosis, after the child’s, is that it has drawn more attention to the fact that autism also affects women. “You get a lot of women who have been diagnosed with an eating disorder because they were very fussy with their food – but it wasn’t an eating disorder, it was autism,” says Baron-Cohen. Preferring a range of very specific, often bland, foods is another trait of autism – Christine McGuinness describes it in the documentary as “eating beige food”. Kiri-Lynn Gardner, 40, was also diagnosed as a result of her child’s autism: her son Finn, now 17, was diagnosed when he was five. She noticed similarities between her own experiences and his, and sought a test. “My son was very typically autistic – he likes lining things up, he’s highly organised. I could relate to so much in his behaviour.” Getting her own diagnosis in 2016 was still a shock, but she immediately realised there were benefits. “The specialist I saw understood me in a way I’d not been understood before.” Her mother had endured a lifelong struggle with mental health issues, not autism-related, and Gardner feared she had the same difficulties. “I always assumed it was just how things were and how they would always be,” she says. “But unpicking it has meant I’ve learned about the really quite small things that can make a huge difference to my life. Things like realising I don’t have to attend a social event – not because I don’t want to be part of it, but because there’s too much sensory overload. I used to feel guilty about missing things, but now I make allowances for myself, and my family and other people around me do the same. So, for example, when we go on holiday I’ll often have a bit of a meltdown because the place doesn’t look exactly like it does in the brochure. In my head, I’ll have been expecting it to be just the same. But now I know why, and my family expects it, it’s fine.” Lockdown, Gardner thinks, would have been nigh-on impossible without her diagnosis: autistic people need structure and tend to struggle a lot with uncertainty and different routines. She even credits the diagnosis with keeping her marriage together. “I think we might have got divorced if I hadn’t known. My husband can now understand that my behaviour is the condition I’ve got.” Purnell’s marriage has benefited, too. His wife, Paula, has worked with children – he describes her as the yin to his yang and, while all good marriages need that, it’s even more important for autistic people because a partner can take on some of the activities the autistic person finds difficult – organising a social life, for example. Perhaps, too, it’s easier for men to find “caring” partners than it is for women, another reason it can be harder for women with autism to cope with adult life. Paula says a big plus of John’s diagnosis is that they understand some of the difficulties, and can now work around them. “I used to feel guilty about going out with my friends without him, but now I can go out and he stays at home,” she says. “Before, I’d organise nights out with other couples and he’d come along grudgingly – I’d think he was just being difficult.” A game-changer for adults with autism is the Autism Act 2009 (this is the only condition with its own act of parliament) which gives people the right to a diagnosis, regardless of age. “There is now a requirement on the part of local authorities to provide an adult diagnostic pathway,” says Tim Nicholls, head of policy at the National Autistic Society. Yet many people, of all ages, wait far longer than they should for an assessment. This was noticed before the pandemic, and is almost certainly worse now. That is important for many reasons, not least that while autism is not a mental health disorder, people who have it may be more prone to anxiety and depression. Baron-Cohen says two thirds of the adults who come to his clinic have had suicidal thoughts, and a third have attempted to kill themselves. For Gardner, diagnosis has been bittersweet. On one hand, she is pleased that her experience is useful to Finn – like Christine McGuinness, she feels she is a positive role model, and is living in a way that proves autistic people can have a job or career, and a relationship (Baron-Cohen points out that 85% of autistic adults are not in employment). On the other hand, Gardner mourns the childhood and adolescence that she might have had. “It’s disappointing that I didn’t have the help I needed growing up, especially now I know that small things can make a huge difference,” she says. Purnell’s son, who prefers not to give his name, says his father’s experience has brought him benefits, too. “Diagnosis and personal research helped him and, in turn, helped me to understand autism and mental health better,” he says. It’s clear that, in general, increased parental diagnosis is linked to genetics and, indeed, says Baron-Cohen, science has found there are definite chromosomal factors. Recognising a diagnosis because of a child isn’t always down to genetics, though. Kevin Chapman, 39, who lives in Northampton, was diagnosed after he met a new partner, whose son – now his stepson – was found to be autistic, aged eight. That led Chapman to do an online quiz – the AQ or autism spectrum quotient that the McGuinnesses did in the documentary – and his score indicated that he is within the autistic range. “I’ve not finished the formal process, but a lot of things have fallen into place for me,” he says. “I’ve always found it hard to make friends, always thought of myself as an outsider. I tend to get obsessively interested in things – computer coding, for one.” There are many ways in which life can be improved for adults who find they are autistic, says Baron-Cohen. “A lot of autistic people find noisy environments difficult, and they have sensory difficulties. They need a calmer environment, and getting a diagnosis is a good way to say to an employer: ‘I need a reasonable adjustment to my work surroundings, which you’re entitled to do under the Equality Act’.” In fact, as he points out, making life easier for people with autism is all about acknowledging that they are different in the same way that people are different in terms of gender and ethnicity. “What’s really good is that people are realising that neurodiversity is part of a person’s identity in exactly the same way these things are,” he says. What about autistic adults who don’t have children to flag up their issues? Baron-Cohen says other reasons for adults coming forward to be tested for autism include a long history of difficulties in maintaining relationships – friendships and intimate partnerships – and a history of difficulty in getting on with people at work. “I see people, for example, who keep ending up in industrial tribunals, and that prompts them to think: why is this happening to me?” he says. But for some adults, the stigma of being labelled “autistic” is still offputting. It’s incumbent on us all, says Baron-Cohen, to help reduce this stigma: increased diagnosis is good for everyone, not only autistic people. One of John Purnell’s favourite quotes is from Mary Temple Grandin, an American scientist who was diagnosed as an adult. What would happen, she asked, if autism didn’t exist? Her answer: “You’d have a bunch of people standing around in a cave. Chatting and socialising, yes – but not getting anything actually done.”"

          "headline": "The US postmaster appointed under Trump is still raising alarm – but can he be stopped?",
          "bodyText": "Joe Biden this month took another step toward the removal of the controversial postmaster general Louis DeJoy, even as the Trump-era appointee continues to make his mark on the embattled postal service, rolling out new plans to slow down delivery and close postal stations around the country. DeJoy, a Republican logistics executive, caused a national furor last year over his attempts to slow down mail delivery before the 2020 presidential election, in which millions of Americans voted by mail. Biden has not said outright whether he wishes to oust DeJoy, although his press secretary, Jen Psaki, has said she is “deeply troubled” by his leadership. Even so, the president lacks the authority to dismiss the postmaster general. That power rests with the USPS Board of Governors, a nine-member panel that can remove DeJoy with a majority vote. There were three vacancies on the board when Biden took office, and he filled those vacancies with Democratic allies earlier this year. Now the president has taken a further step toward reshaping the board by nominating two new governors to replace those whose terms are expiring. His decision not to renominate the Democratic board chairman, Ron Bloom, is significant, since Bloom was one of DeJoy’s biggest allies on the board and earlier this year said he considered DeJoy “the proper man for the job”. Indeed, the postmaster general bought as much as $305,000 in bonds from Bloom’s asset management firm earlier this year, according to DeJoy’s financial disclosure paperwork. Bloom has said he doesn’t benefit from the purchase. The asset purchases and Bloom’s continued support for DeJoy led some Democratic senators to say they wouldn’t support Bloom’s renomination. Even as Biden appears to inch closer to ousting DeJoy, the embattled postmaster general has begun to leave his mark on the agency. DeJoy abandoned his initial attempts to slow down mail delivery ahead of the 2020 election after he faced lawsuits and backlash, but soon after he announced a significant reduction in the agency’s 60,000-member administrative workforce. DeJoy also released in April a 10-year plan for revamping postal operations. Some provisions are supported by unions and postal advocates, such as a $40bn investment in the agency’s vehicle fleet and logistics network, and modernizing thousands of retail post offices. The plan also calls for an end to a mandate that requires the USPS to fund retiree health benefits decades in advance, which postal management has decried for years as an unnecessary burden on its finances. DeJoy’s plan would attempt to fill the postal service’s $160bn funding hole through a wide variety of cost-cutting measures. The most significant change in the plan is the slowdown of first-class mail delivery, which took effect on 1 October. Under the new rules, long-distance mail can take up to five days to reach its destination before it’s considered late, up from the previous maximum of three days. DeJoy says these changes will improve the agency’s on-time performance and reduce what he says is an expensive reliance on air freight. The changes affect almost 40% of first-class mailpieces. The postal service has achieved only modest performance improvements since rolling out the new standards in October. According to the agency’s most recent statistics, 91% of first-class mail deliveries have arrived on time since the launch of the new standards, up 2.5% from the previous quarter. Nevertheless, it isn’t clear how much of the agency’s recent improvement is the result of DeJoy loosening the agency’s on-time standards. “Great plan, loosen the standards so you can more easily reach the goal,” said Bob Dolan, a retired carrier from New Hampshire who spent more than 40 years with the agency. “I bet I could be a 90% free-throw shooter if they moved the free-throw line to five feet.” Current postal workers who spoke with the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said that the changes hadn’t had much effect on their day-to-day workload over the past few months. The biggest challenge of the job at the moment, said one carrier who delivers in rural New York, was the ever-increasing package load that began with the pandemic. “I talk to carriers all over the country and they have been delivering [a] holiday volume since the pandemic started,” said the carrier from New York, who asked to remain anonymous because postal employees are prohibited from speaking to the media. “Whole offices are down due to injuries, Covid, and the labor shortage. People do not want this job and the process to hire anyone still takes for ever.” A postal service spokesperson told the Guardian that the USPS had taken extensive steps to bolster its delivery network ahead of the holiday rush. The agency has hired more than 40,000 seasonal employees, leased overflow space for package operations, and installed more than a hundred new package sorting machines. “The postal service’s steady performance so far through the holiday season is proof that the significant investments and operational changes being made under [DeJoy’s 10-year plan] are working,” said David Partenheimer, a representative for the Postal Service. The slower delivery standards don’t affect packages, which make up a greater share of postal revenue than ever and which DeJoy hopes will become the centerpiece of the USPS’s business model going forward. The new delivery standard may have a more significant impact for small businesses that rely on the USPS. An analysis by the Washington Post found that states west of the Rocky Mountains and those at the nation’s geographical extremes would suffer the most under the new standards, with states like Nevada seeing an average increase of a full day in their mail delivery times. The other controversial part of DeJoy’s plan is a proposal to close or reduce hours at dozens of low-traffic post offices around the country. This plan revives a previous “consolidation” proposal drafted under the Obama-era postmaster general Patrick Donahoe, who served from 2010 to 2015. The USPS paused that plan after a wave of backlash from unions and advocates. Multiple rural postal workers told the Guardian that reviving the plan could have wide-ranging impacts for customers in rural areas, many of whom rely on the USPS for deliveries of medicine and other essential goods. “Consolidating stations adds quite a time and distance burden on [rural] customers,” said Tim Apley, a retired carrier who delivered for about 25 years in rural Spokane, Washington. Customers in rural areas would have to drive much farther if they needed to buy postal supplies or pick up packages that couldn’t be delivered, he said. “Meanwhile,” he added, “a lot of the savings from a consolidation are offset by the delivery routes driving much further each day.” Even if the board of governors does replace DeJoy, it will be hard for the new postmaster general to fix the agency alone. Postal leadership lacks the unilateral authority to increase its prices or raise money with new initiatives like postal banking, meaning that whoever is in charge, Congress will need to step in to help the agency regain its financial footing."

          "bodyText": "Real-life villains don’t come more sharply drawn than Alex Murdaugh, a greedy and ghoulish personal injuries lawyer who casts a haunting shadow over the state of South Carolina. For nearly a century, his father and grandfather were the prosecutors for a five-county district while also running a powerful private law firm. But it wasn’t until the small hours of 24 February 2019 that the dark veil over the Murdaugh family’s dealings began to slip. That’s when Alex’s son Paul is alleged to have plowed the family’s 17-foot bay boat into a bridge abutting Parris Island, the nation’s largest Marine recruit depot. Among the three people cast overboard was an ebullient 19-year-old former high school soccer player named Mallory Beach. She was found dead in the murky tidewaters near the crash site after a seven-day search. Before an investigation could prove whether Paul was at the tiller and boating under the influence or confirm witness testimony that Alex obstructed the crash investigation, Paul, 19, and his 52-year-old mother, Maggie, were found shot to death at the family’s 1,800-acre hunting estate on 7 June. Three months later the narrative was further confounded by conflicting reports that Alex had been shot in the back of the head and left for dead on the side of the road. He has since admitted the scene was staged to grease a $10m insurance payout for his other son, Buster – himself rumored to be involved with the unexplained death of a 19-year-old nursing student named Stephen Smith in 2015. This was all before Alex’s partners cut ties amid allegations that he had embezzled the family law firm out of millions, allegedly to fund an insatiable opioid addiction. After that bombshell dropped, Alex was charged with stealing millions more from a settlement meant for the children of his former housekeeper, Gloria Satterfield, who died in a 2018 alleged trip-and-fall accident on their property. Shockingly, these are just the highlights. Today Murdaugh sits in a maximum security jail cell in Columbia, South Carolina, where he faced 53 charges for the faked shooting attempt and for defrauding his clients and could be sentenced to 508 years in prison if convicted on all counts. He also had his law license suspended and remains a named party in six related lawsuits and the focus of at least seven investigations – one led by the FBI and another exploring possible ties to a stateside drug trafficking scheme that was prosecuted by current South Carolina governor Henry McMaster. All the while, the mystery of the murder of his wife and son still hangs over Murdaugh – a person of interest, according to his attorney; Murdaugh denies any involvement in that crime. No weapons have been recovered (although police have confirmed that Paul and Maggie were killed with different guns), and no attackers charged or identified. Most troubling: Murdaugh’s profound influence on the state legal system casts considerable doubt on the prospects for a fair trial. At a 13 December hearing, where a $7m bond was set, the 53-year-old Murdaugh finally spoke. “Things were moving really quickly and really negatively,” he said, explaining the murder-for-hire scheme. “My world was caving in as much as it had three months prior to that particular day … I was in a very bad place.” In less than three years Alex Murdaugh (rhymes with “Relic Sherlock”) has gone from legal specter to leading man in a whodunnit that’s only just beginning to unfold. And there’s no question that the scrutiny on him would be nowhere near this intense if it weren’t for Mandy Matney, the meddling reporter who kept a harsh spotlight trained on the Murdaugh family until they became impossible for anyone to ignore. Murdaugh she wrote “My life turned upside down on 7 June,” Matney tells me on the chilly November evening we meet in downtown Beaufort. The Friday night begins with dinner at Luther’s, the pub where CCTV cameras caught Paul Murdaugh downing lemon drops and Jaeger shots just before taking to the water (ostensibly to circumnavigate roadside DUI checkpoints) and ends with digestifs and coffee on a twinkling restaurant deck off Waterfront Park – the last place those same cameras spied Mallory Beach alive. Around these parts Matney, who turned 31 three days before the Murdaugh double homicide, is our Jessica Fletcher – steadfastly connecting all the dots at FITSNews, the Carolina news hub where she is editorial director. Her hit podcast, Murdaugh Murders, has enthralled the country and has Hollywood scrambling to spin off their own versions of this epic true crime story. When I ask her about the podcast’s weekly production process, she likens it to “putting a puzzle together in a hurricane. I go into my office thinking I’m gonna do a deep dive on the Stephen Smith investigation. And something with the Satterfield [the housekeeper] will pop up. Or something with the boat crash.” The boat crash is how Matney landed on the Murdaugh beat. In February 2019, she was working as the breaking news editor for the 16,000-circulation Island Packet, the Lowcountry’s reluctant paper of record, owning the story even as the Packet’s executive editors failed to see the point. “I’ll never forget being in a meeting in March 2019 my boss saying, ‘I’m sick of the boat crash stories,’” she says. “And what was crazy about that was the boat crash stories were bringing in way more page views than anything else.” Matney thought that her editors’ lack of interest in pursuing the Murdaugh was largely due to the paper’s business model of chasing low-effort clicks, but in retrospect, it’s hard not to wonder if, at best, the paper was cowed by the powerful family or, at worst, they simply didn’t get it. Now that the story is unavoidable, their coverage has been noticeably sympathetic to the Murdaughs. A different journalist might have kept churning out stories about shark sightings (another Matney specialty at the Packet), or bolted for a larger market. But for Kansas City native Matney, who joined the Packet in March 2016, lured by the prospect of working from the beach, local reporting was an opportunity to set down roots. “It wasn’t like she was here for a few years,” says Liz Farrell, a former Packet editor and Day 1 collaborator of Matney’s on the Murdaugh beat. “She embraced the community.” But after a demotion to reporter in 2019, despite leading the paper in page views with a 200,000 monthly average, Matney was finally forced to consider the unthinkable: giving in to her bosses and leaving the Murdaugh story behind for the sake of her career and sanity. Connecting the dots “It became pretty clear to me early on that Mandy not only had a heart for the truth of the story, but also was not intimidated by these powerful people,” says Will Folks, an unlikely ally. A Palmetto State politico with a reputation as a hell raiser, Folks was a spokesperson for former governors Mark Sanford and Nikki Haley – with whom he alleged to having an “inappropriate physical relationship” during her 2010 gubernatorial campaign. (Haley, who went on to be Donald Trump’s ambassador to the UN, has forcefully denied Folks’ claims.) In 2006 Folks launched FITSNews – a kind of subscription-based local Drudge Report that has blossomed into an all-purpose read. On the Murdaugh beat Folks found himself competing with Matney for scoops so often that he would kiddingly offer to hire her away. After her Packet demotion, they stopped joking. She signed on in January 2020, lured by a commitment she never got at the Packet – free rein. “I pride myself on being the first person to openly say that there are three deaths connected to this family,” Matney says, referencing the cases of the nursing student Smith, the housekeeper Satterfield, and boat-crash victim Beach. “That was a scary thing to do, and I got shit for it immediately.” Subsequent investigations didn’t just prove her right; they thickened the plot. Matney was first to publish the department of natural resources case file that provides the most complete picture of the events surrounding the boat crash. She tag-teamed with Folks to break the roadside shooting story and on the subsequent twist that police had traced the knife used to disable Murdaugh’s car back to him, upsetting the alibi his legal team was scrambling to establish. Matney also was first to report the reopening of the Satterfield death investigation and the family’s claims of insurance fraud, which led to yet another news break on 27 new charges against him. Meanwhile, she has owned every recent development in the unsolved death of Stephen Smith, which his mother connects to his being gay. Among other scoops, Matney reported the 40 times the investigation file mentions the Murdaughs. Besides shoe-leather legwork and an indefatigable work ethic, the thing that truly distinguishes Matney is empathy. When she was 7 her 9-year-old brother died suddenly from brain complications related to the flu, a loss that still smarts. A botched appendectomy nearly stole her life at 23. Three years later she was diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, the less serious form of skin cancer – and all because “I was a stupid teenager who tanned a lot,” she wrote in 2017. And this after her mother had beaten melanoma two years earlier. For another reporter, tarrying in so much morbidity might exact a psychic toll. For Matney, “It’s kind of therapy,” she says. “Hearing from grieving mothers like Sandy Smith. I see my mom in her all the time. I feel like I can approach the story in a way that a lot of other people don’t with the level of sensitivity that I do.” With Matney leading on the Murdaugh beat, FITSNews has grown to a robust 1.5 million monthly visitors. Still, Matney couldn’t shake the sense that there was much more story to tell. David Moses, Matney’s fiance, needled her to start a podcast. Matney initially scoffed at the idea of hard journalism as a production. But he was undeterred and forged ahead. He set her up with a mic at their kitchen table, surrounded by a nest of files and their chatty rescue dog, Luna. While Matney focused on the narrative, Moses taught himself how to use free audio editing software. On 22 June, absent fanfare or cover art, the Murdaugh Murders debuted with an episode titled South Carolina’s Chappaquiddick. By episode nine it was the No 1 podcast on Apple. A southern gothic “I just always go back to some time this summer when we were top 100 of all podcasts,” Matney says. “I thought we were peaking then.” The Murdaugh story has always had the elements of a southern gothic. So it figures that Matney’s turf has been crowded by Good Morning America, Nancy Grace and others in the mainstream media who can’t help but ask if she’d mind “getting us up to speed”. When those newcomers aren’t angling to copy her homework, they’re getting spun by Murdaugh protectors like Bakari Sellers – the CNN contributor, Democratic party prodigy and longtime friend of the family – which he described as “salt of the earth” in an interview with People, one in the horde of outlets racing to develop Murdaugh content for the screen. Before a September bond hearing, Dick Harpootlian, the South Carolina state senator and Democratic party operative leading Murdaugh’s defense, wondered aloud to a court gallery that largely consisted of reporters if Matney – who was not present – was Folks’s “alter sexual ego”, drawing big laughs. “Forget about what he said,” Folks says. “Focus on what he was trying to do. He was trying to knock her down a peg.” In addition to the assaults on her credibility, Matney absorbs regular abuse from listeners whinging about everything from her “vocal fry” to the FITSNews paywall to her habitual reminders that much of what we know about the Murdaughs is because of her. “People think she’s saying only she can cover this news,” Farrell says. “But so many [competitors] shortcut their work based on what Mandy had done. It is very frustrating for her to see media that had ignored this story and, suddenly now that it’s profitable for them, they’re going after it. Her whole point is to say, I was doing this when it meant nothing … because we need to keep corruption from happening.” The constant churn of the story has had its affects. “The summer got dark,” says Matney, always flirting with a full-on burnout. “I remember telling Liz that I don’t give a shit if I get money off of all this. It’s just too hard and not worth it. And then to have to channel all that to create a podcast … it was hard to get motivated.” It also wasn’t worth the increasing risk to Matney’s personal safety, something she hadn’t considered until receiving a terse email from a friend of Buster Murdaugh’s over the summer. “The investigation keeps getting scarier,” she says. And even though she has taken measures to protect herself – such as not posting her whereabouts on social media in real time any more – the legion of fans who spring for coffee and mimosas to keep her going still worry about her oversharing. But what they might not appreciate is that “documentation and being in the public eye are my biggest safety net”. Even as the adversities on the Murdaugh beat increase, Matney is determined to stick with this story. For Matney, the proud moments are the small ones that come when the waitress who “got out of” Hampton county thanks her for shining a light on the corruption there, or when a victim’s relative calls to check in. Accountability journalism wasn’t something Matney ever thought she’d fall into. “I was always so afraid of it,” she says. Now, it’s the corrupt among South Carolina’s power brokers who should be afraid of her. • This article was amended on 17 December 2021.

          "bodyText": "Police are considering appealing against the sentence given to the former model Katie Price after she avoided a jail term for drink-driving following a crash near her home. Price, 43, was handed a 16-week suspended sentence at Crawley magistrates court on Wednesday after she admitted drink-driving while disqualified and without insurance. District judge Amanda Kelly told Price she was unable to send her to prison because she had complied with requirements of the court, including attending a rehabilitation centre, adding: “The public may be appalled to hear that I can’t send you to jail today.” Supt James Collis, the head of roads policing for Sussex police and Surrey police, said officers were looking into whether an appeal could be launched over the sentence. He said the sentencing, “as the judge explained, could have and should have been much worse and, in our view, Price is extremely lucky not to be spending Christmas behind bars”. “Given the circumstances and her history of motoring offences, it’s clear she did not consider the risk of her actions to the wider public or the implications for her own family,” he added. “We are now exploring whether we can appeal this sentence.” The sentence was criticised on the front page of the Sun newspaper on Thursday under the headline “What Price justice?” Jonathan Karani, prosecuting, told the court that Price was involved in the collision on the B2135 near Partridge Green, West Sussex, on 28 September. Police arrived shortly afterwards and she admitted she should not have been driving, the court heard. Price admitted the offences in a hearing at the same court on 29 September. At that hearing, her sentencing was adjourned on the condition that she have treatment at the Priory Centre, not commit any further offences, and be banned from driving in the interim. Price was given a 16-week jail sentence suspended for 12 months, a two-year driving ban, 100 hours’ unpaid work, 20 sessions of rehabilitation work with probation, and was ordered to pay £213. Kelly told the court that Price already owed £7,358 in relation to previous offences. She told the defendant: “You appear to think that you are above the law. “You have one of the worst driving records I have seen. You have been banned from driving on five occasions. “The public may be appalled to hear that I can’t send you to jail today. But the law says that when a person has complied with the terms of their release then you have a legitimate expectation not to be sent to prison today, even though you deserve to spend Christmas behind bars.”"

Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, the most-popular decentralized digital currency, have a notoriously large carbon footprint (bitcoin mining alone consumes about half as much electricity in a year as all of the UK). So to leverage a cheap source of energy to run their bitcoin mining operations, Lochmiller and Cavness found themselves partnering with oil companies to repurpose a byproduct, primarily methane, that’s typically vented or burnt off in flares. “We flipped the switch and saw all the bitcoin mining servers light up green, and you could see the flare physically shrink a little bit,” said Lochmiller, a self-described “city kid” who had never before set foot in an oilfield. “It was kind of a Frankenstein moment, like ‘Oh my god, it’s alive!’” Their creation is part of a niche wave of tech startups that are now eyeing the oil and gas industry to help power the cryptocurrency boom. Lochmiller and Cavness, who started a bitcoin mining company called Crusoe Energy, see their fix as a marriage between two problems capable of “solving” one another: the wasting of gas flaring that contributes to the climate crisis, and the need for cheaper energy as crypto increases in popularity. Climate experts, however, warn it’s a “false solution” so long as oil and gas production is allowed to continue. The world’s leading authority on climate science concludes that only a dramatic reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will help avert a climate calamity; merely finding alternate uses for “waste gas” doesn’t confront the dire need to curb fossil fuel consumption. If anything, researchers warn, oil companies may feel incentivized to drill even more. “At the end of the day, they’re still burning natural gas,” said Arvind Ravikumar, a methane researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, who deemed flare mitigation and companies proposing similar technologies a “scam”. Lochmiller and Cavness, however, say their work helps the industry produce oil in as clean a way as possible, buying time, or “extending the runway” for the energy transition. Their company has attracted high-profile investors, including Bain and Winklevoss Capital, raking in $125m for their second round of fundraising in April. They plan to roll out 100 bitcoin mining data centers by early 2022, up from the 65 units already in place. Crusoe has trademarked its solution as “digital flare mitigation”. They install fleets of data centers that hum in shipping container-like structures next to remote oil rigs. Oil producers are then paid for the waste gas they otherwise wouldn’t use because it’s cheaper to burn than to pay to transport to market. In return, Crusoe can use the byproduct to power energy-intensive computing operations on-site. The data centers burn through enormous amounts of energy because there’s no centralized “bank” that holds cryptocurrency. Instead, new coins are created by solving complex equations that require heavy computing power to authenticate. The currency is then tracked on a decentralized ledger, known as the blockchain, which is also resource-intensive to maintain. The new technology comes amid a “great mining migration” that’s currently underway in the United States after China banned crypto mining in September. And with renewed global focus on cutting the highly-potent greenhouse gas, methane, which is the primary “waste gas” in flaring, the model is particularly in vogue. Oil-friendly regulators, elected officials, industry groups and financial services giants have been taking note. Commissioner Jim Wright of the Texas Railroad Commission, the state agency charged with regulating oil and gas, told the Guardian that modular mitigation setups like Crusoe’s are “most appealing”. Texas senator Ted Cruz is also a fan. Meanwhile, North Dakota lawmakers on both sides of the aisle passed a law this year making oil producers eligible for a tax credit if they employ onsite flare mitigation. Crusoe, which is based in Williston, North Dakota – the heart of the Bakken shale – worked closely with legislators to pass the bill. According to Paasha Mahdavi, a political science professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who co-authored a 2020 paper on methane mitigation measures, new technologies that stop flaring at the source do seem like they would reduce emissions. But in practice, he said, projects designed to capture otherwise flared or vented gas have resulted in an overall increase in gas production. After all, they create a new source of demand. “It’s like if you had a leaky gasoline pipeline and, instead of fixing the problem, you plugged in a Humvee next to the leak and left the engine on in perpetuity with the A/C on full blast,” Mahdavi said. *** Cavness, the chief executive of Crusoe Energy who goes by “Electron Cowboy” on Twitter, grew up envisioning himself jumping on the family bandwagon. He would get an internship with Shell, and follow in the footsteps of his father and grandfather to carve out a career in the oil and gas industry. But then Cavness landed at Middlebury College, a prestigious liberal arts school in Vermont with a reputation as the alma mater of global climate campaign, 350.org founders, and home of the university fossil fuel divestment movement. “Climate was the whole conversation,” Cavness said, noting that he felt pressure to downplay his oil and gas roots. After going down the climate rabbit hole at Middlebury, and spending a year after graduation studying the “morality of energy”, Cavness’ job was troubling his conscience. He’d been losing sleep thinking about the unfathomable amount of gas the industry was wasting. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) in 2020, 142bn cubic metres of gas was flared – the energy equivalent of providing electricity to 49m homes. When Cavness reunited with Lochmiller in 2018 during an 18-hour hiking trip in the Rocky Mountains, they hatched a plan: Lochmiller, an MIT graduate based in San Francisco, had recently left a position as a partner at a cryptocurrency investment firm, while Cavness was with a separate firm that invested in oil and gas. Together, they would combine their worlds of bitcoin and big oil. Unsurprisingly, the bitcoin flaring option is enormously appealing to the industry. Crusoe’s data centers are set up without cost to producers, who earn money on gas they otherwise wouldn’t. “It’s essentially a free offering to the oil company,” Cavness explained earlier this year at Hart Energy’s Developing Unconventional Gas virtual conference for the Bakken and Rockies regions. Cavness and Lochmiller say they’re on the cusp of the latest climate research. But critics warn their company sits squarely within the techno-optimistic ecosystem of Silicon Valley, where the hunt for innovative solutions may blind even the most climate-literate entrepreneurs. Climate experts warn Crusoe’s outlook, and it’s proposed “fix”, reflects a selective understanding of the science. Even the most conservative forecasts say oil and gas exploration must stop immediately to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis, including unnecessary loss of human lives. But despite Crusoe’s climate-focused branding, Lochmiller confirmed the company supports ongoing exploration and drilling. As Cavness sees it, even after his now-infant daughter grows old or reaches the end of her life, fossil fuels will still be around. If the oil industry will be “required to sustain life on the planet” anyway, Cavness asks, why not drill in the cleanest way possible? *** While the Crusoe chiefs say their digital flare migration technology is buying time for new clean energy sources, some fear their strategy is more like placing a Band-Aid over a gaping wound. Nine out of ten climate experts who responded to requests for comment, including top methane researchers, political scientists, and climate analysts, said that oil and gas exploration and new drilling – even if equipped with methane mitigation technologies – is not in line with a future in which warming is curbed in accordance with global climate pledges. Of this group, the one dissenting voice, an academic and co-founder of a greenhouse gas monitoring company, said continued exploration and drilling can “probably” happen in a clean way. Climate experts are more split over the degree to which cryptocurrency operations should be allowed to consume renewable energy. Three out of ten climate experts the Guardian spoke with were intrigued by one element of Crusoe’s model. Similar to waste gas operations, the company has a set of data centers slated to run on wind farms designed to tap energy available when gigawatts generated exceed those demanded. Crusoe’s ability to pay for that energy, according to the company, will enable renewable developers to underwrite new fleets. But not all are optimistic. Heather Price, an atmospheric chemist and professor at North Seattle College, worries that flare mitigation technology is little more than a greenwashing tactic meant to spin fossil fuels in a positive light. “I have no faith that this use of flares for crypto would be a temporary situation,” she said. “The fossil fuel industry and crypto companies should not get a ‘cookie’ for this move.” This story is published as part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of news outlets strengthening coverage of the climate story"

          "bodyText": "John Leiper, Chief Investment Officer at Titan Asset Management, says the Federal Reserve’s decisions are broadly as expected. “Expectations running into today’s FOMC meeting were for the Fed to double the pace of taper, an end to QE in March and three rate hikes next year. It’s not like Jerome Powell to disappoint the market, and that’s pretty much what we got. The US dollar index is up on the news. Remember, the US cannot go it alone. Co-ordinated global monetary policy easing, in response to the pandemic, requires co-ordinated retrenchment. Without it we could see a massive rally in the US dollar, placing a severe burden on dollar debtors globally, undermining the economic recovery. Interestingly, that’s also what we are seeing in the US Treasury curve which continues to flatten.” Seema Shah, Chief Strategist at Principal Global Investors, points out that the Fed is also forecasting three rate rises in 2023, on top of three next year: “The Fed apparently just woke up to the inflationary pressures consuming the US economy. With CPI in touching distance of 7%, it should be of no surprise to see the Fed accelerating tapering and the median forecast showing three interest rate hikes in 2022. Price pressures may well ease next year, but inflation will settle at a level uncomfortably high for the Fed – this is transitory plus. “The big question for markets now is: can the US economy digest this pace of hikes without ending up with a stomach ache? After the 20 months we’ve had, perhaps six hikes over a two-year period looks overwhelming. But compared to previous hiking cycles - most pertinently 2004 to 2006 when the Fed made 17 consecutive hikes - we are tentatively confident that the US economy can handle it. Not only that, but US inflation needs it.” Here’s Richard Flynn, UK Managing Director at Charles Schwab: “As expected, the Fed made no formal interest rate adjustment. Instead, the Fed announced it will accelerate the taper of balance sheet purchases. In other words, the Fed is withdrawing its stimulus programme at a faster rate than planned. The shift is a response to the United States’ persistent rate of inflation. Last month’s CPI Index recorded the largest annual gain in inflation since 1982. The Fed will hope that accelerated tapering puts downward pressure on demand, encouraging supply to catch up and cooling price rises. Markets know that the Fed’s accelerated tapering does not amount to tightening monetary policy. As long as the Fed is buying bonds, it’s still running a loose monetary policy Some late news: The US Federal Reserve has decided to end its pandemic stimulus programme more quickly, as it reacts to the surge in inflation. America’s central bank will taper its asset-purchase scheme by $30bn per month from January, having previously trimmed $15bn off the programme in November and December. That would wrap up the bond purchases, which had run at $120bn/month, by next March. Federal Reserve officials also now expect to raise interest rates by 25 basis points three times next year, according to its new ‘dot plots’ where policymakers predict borrowing costs. That’s a hawkish change on three months ago, with the Fed signalling that its inflation goals have been met (CPI hit a 39-year high of 6.8% last month). The FOMC committee say: With inflation having exceeded 2 percent for some time, the Committee expects it will be appropriate to maintain this target range until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Committee’s assessments of maximum employment. In new economic projections released following the end of a two-day policy meeting, Fed officials also forecast that inflation would run at 2.6% next year, compared to the 2.2% projected as of September, and the unemployment rate would fall to 3.5%. The Fed also warned that the path of the economy continues to depend on the course of Covid-19. Progress on vaccinations and an easing of supply constraints are expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation. Risks to the economic outlook remain, including from new variants of the virus. Here are all today’s stories, starting with inflation: The pandemic: The latest Brexit trade developments: The energy crisis: And also: Asking workers to stomach a below-inflation pay rise is never popular. Asking them to do so when their day job is forecasting the cost of living is really asking for trouble. And so it has proved at the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. A strike ballot opened on Wednesday for members of the Unite union after the NIESR’s management offered a basic pay deal worth 2%. It comes after wages were frozen last year. With the latest official data showing the cost of living was up by 5.1% in year to November, the union is confident its members will vote to shut down their computers and stop working on their spreadsheets.... The US Federal Reserve is expected to accelerate an end to the central bank’s pandemic-era support of the US economy on Wednesday night, in a major shift that could herald a series of interest rate rises next year. The expected measures are a signal that US central bankers no longer view rising inflation as a “transitory” nuisance caused by supply chain problems meeting pent-up consumer demand, but an issue that now requires firm management to avert lasting damage to the US economy. At the end of a two-day meeting in Washington, the Fed is anticipated to announce it will reduce its monthly $120bn (£90bn) spending on government bonds designed to lower long-term interest rates at twice the rate that chairman, Jerome Powell, outlined just six weeks ago. Officials are also expected to forecast that they will raise short-term rates that have been set at near-zero for close to two years. A forecast for a series of rate rises next year is, again, a departure from indications offered by central bankers just three months ago when the Fed forecast one rate increase in 2022. The UK’s blue-chip stock index has closed lower tonight, as anxiety over omicron and inflation weigh on the markets. The FTSE 100 lost 48 points, or 0.66%, to 7170 points, its lowest level in a week. Chilian copper producer Antofagasta fell 5.3%, followed by a string of UK-focused companies including airline group IAG (-5.1%), retailer Next (-4%), and hotel chain Whitbread (-3.6%). On the smaller FTSE 250 index, Cineworld crashed by 39% after losing that court battle with rival Cineplex over their aborted takeover, while electricals retailer Currys lost 9% after reporting a sales slowdown. Restaurant Group shed 6.5%, cruise operator Carnival lost 5.8% and budget airline Wizz Air fell 5%. Covid fears were rife, as UK cases hit record levels and the head of the UK Health Security Agency has called the Omicron variant “probably the most significant threat” since the start of the pandemic amid warnings over a coming surge in hospitalisations. Danni Hewson, AJ Bell financial analyst, says nerves over tomorrow’s Bank of England interest rate decision are also high: “What do you get when you add Covid nerves to hot, hot, hot inflation numbers? It’s a question that’s troubling central banks, investors and consumers alike. Last month’s unexpected decision by the Bank of England to stick with the status quo unsettled London markets, investors thought they had Andrew Bailey’s measure, now they’re wondering if their view of the current situation is accurate. A change tomorrow would be unexpected, and the one thing markets hate more than a rate rise is one they’ve not priced in. “The FTSE’s had a pretty torrid day, consumer facing stocks battered by concern about the rising cost of living and concern that Plan B might give way to C or even D before the year is out. The owner of viral content publisher LADbible has made a solid start on the London stock market. Shares in LBG Media have closed 14% higher tonight, after the company floated on the AIM market in a IPO which valued the group at £360m. Things are moving fast for the British economy, our economics correspondent Richard Partington writes: Inflation has soared to the highest level in a decade, breaching 5% months earlier than expected. The headline figure masks much steeper rises for everyday items – the cost of apples and pears is up 25% in a year. Meanwhile, consumer confidence is evaporating as the coronavirus Omicron variant spreads through the population with unprecedented pace. Both will be front of mind for the Bank of England on Thursday as it weighs up whether to raise interest rates in the week before Christmas. With the economy appearing to blow hot and cold, and the outlook shifting by the day, it could be the toughest call in the rate-setting monetary policy committee’s 24-year history. Official figures for November show the consumer price index measure of inflation jumped to 5.2%, surpassing City expectations to hit the highest rate since September 2011. For most people, wages are not rising anywhere near as fast, which means a rapidly worsening cost of living crisis across the country... But with omicron cases rising sharply, and the UK’s covid-19 cases hitting a record 78,610 today, can the Bank raise interest rates tomorrow? More here... Over in Canada, inflation has stuck at its highest level in 18 years. The Canadian CPI rate stuck at 4.7% per year in November, a little lower than the UK’s 5.1%, and less pacey than America’s 6.8% inflation rate. Google has told its US staff they must be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the middle of January or face serious repercussions including a pay cut and ultimately the loss of their job. Employees were told they were required to have declared their vaccination status and uploaded proof of it, or to have applied for a medical or religious exemption, by 3 December, according to an internal memo obtained by CNBC, which first reported the story. After that date, Google said, it would start to contact workers who were unvaccinated or had not uploaded proof of vaccination, or whose exemption requests had not been approved. Trade news: The UK has delayed the introduction of imminent trade checks on goods moving from the island of Ireland to Britain, as both sides sought to take the sting out of the rancorous talks over post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland. The Brexit minister, David Frost, signalled his acceptance that the negotiations with the EU would continue into the new year, issuing a statement saying the checks due to come into force on 1 January would be postponed as an act of “good faith”. “The government believes that this pragmatic act of goodwill can help to maintain space for continued negotiations on the protocol,” Lord Frost said. “It also ensures that traders in both Ireland and Northern Ireland are not faced with further uncertainty while the protocol arrangements themselves are still under discussion.” The boss of Currys has urged the government not to impose further restrictions on high street retailers as he revealed a slowdown in sales amid increasing fears over the spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant and product shortages. Alex Baldock, the chief executive of the UK’s biggest electrical goods retailer, which formerly traded as PC World, Carphone Warehouse and Dixons, said there was “zero evidence of public health risk” in stores and the government would need an “unanswerable public health case” to close them in another lockdown, given the implications for jobs and the wider economy. Baldock said: “We are in a good position to power the recovery and are not asking for handouts. We just want to trade.” The retail boss made the comments as he revealed a 3% slide in sales at Currys UK and Irish business, excluding new store openings and permanent closures, in the six months to 30 October. Matt Britzman, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, says Curry’s is suffering from Covid uncertainty, supply chain challenges and softening demand in the run-up to Christmas. Rising inflation could hurt Curry’s too, he adds: Today’s inflation news adds another headache. If inflation remains persistent, consumers will have less disposable income to play with. New TVs and expensive washing machines are likely to be some of the first items to go if spending gets reigned in. Stock markets are a little weaker today, as traders brace for tonight’s Federal Reserve decision. In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 100 points, or 0.3%, to 35,443 points. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite is down 0.4%. Stocks have pushed lower in London too, with the FTSE 100 index down 47 points or 0.66% at 7170 points, its lowest in over a week. Copper producer Antofagasta (-4%), retail chains Next (-4%) and JD Sports (-3.2%), and airline group IAG (-3.3%) are among the fallers. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics argues that today’s inflation report shouldn’t panic the Bank of England into raising interest rates tomorrow... ...although some investors think a rise is more likely than a few days ago: In the City, shares in Cineworld have plunged by over a third after the company was ordered to pay £750m in damages following the aborted takeover of rival Cineplex. Cineworld, the world’s second-biggest cinema chain, lost a court case against Canada’s Cineplex, which had accused the UK group of breaching its obligations by pulling out of a deal agreed in late 2019. The Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled in Cineplex’s favour, dismissed a counter-claim from Cineworld, and said Cineworld should pay Cineplex C$1.23bn plus C$5.5m of lost transaction costs. Cineworld disagrees with the judgment and says it will appeal the decision. The ruling is a heavy blow on top of the sales lost in the pandemic already, with the omicron variant also threatening trading. Its share have slumped by nearly 38% to 28.8p, the lowest in over a year. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould says Cineworld’s hunger for growth has come back to haunt it, and warns the company is losing credibility with investors, fast. “Pre-pandemic the company had expanded through acquisitions including taking on considerable debt to plant a flag in the US via the purchase of Regal Entertainment. “Despite having borrowings up to its eyeballs, Cineworld then chased more growth by striking a deal in December 2019 to buy Canada’s Cineplex. That was a bold move, and many people suggested its eyes were bigger than its belly. “The timing couldn’t have been any worse. The pandemic struck and it looked like Cineworld’s only way to survive this crisis was to bail out of the Cineplex deal, given that it had massive debt repayments and suddenly no income. “Cineworld argued that Cineplex had breached certain parts of the agreement and so it pulled out of the deal. This resulted in a legal battle which has now ended in favour of the Canadian party. “It means Cineworld is now facing a C$1.2 billion bill for damages. This ruling threatens to put significant financial pressure on the business if its appeal is unsuccessful. Andrew Sentance, a former Bank of England policymaker, also warns that UK inflation is heading to 6% soon - meaning more pain for struggling families. Professor Costas Milas, of the Management School at University of Liverpool, has pulled together an interesting model to predict Thursday’s Bank of England interest rate decision. It includes an “infectious disease equity market volatility tracker”, which monitors how often newpaper articles include economic terms such as “economy” and “financial”; stock market terms; volatility terms such as “uncertainty” and “risk”; and infectious disease terms such as “epidemic”, “pandemic”, “virus”, “flu” and “coronavirus”. It also factoring in whether inflation is on track, and how fast the economy is running compared to its long-run equilibrium level. This model recommends a small rise in interest rates tomorrow -- although if omicron keeps spreading fast (as seems highly likely), it would tilt back to ‘no change’. Professor Milas explains, in an article on The Conversation: As for the MPC’s upcoming decision, the model is “recommending” a policy rate of 0.2% – in other words, a slight increase from today’s 0.1% rate. Without the disease tracker built in, the model would instead be calling for a 0.5% rate, so it shows how growth fears are weighing on its advice. Of course, if market expectations are correct and the MPC leaves rates unchanged, we will conclude that these fears were weighing on them even more. The danger with such an approach is that growth fears are potentially being overdone right now. There is evidence that the UK economy has managed to adapt to past COVID restrictions. And the latest annual inflation reading of 5.1% will make it more likely that inflation in two years’ time will be higher than the current 2.2% prediction – putting additional pressure on the MPC to act. Then again, with the speed at which omicron is moving through the population, the infectious disease tracker could well soon jump back to 2020 levels. Were that to happen, the model would recommend that interest rates remain at 0.1%. It all serves to highlight why it is a very difficult time for the MPC to make a decision, and why, particularly during the pandemic era, it is useful to look at the monetary rule for guidance. More here: I’ve fine-tuned a tool that advises the Bank of England what interest rates to set – here’s what it says Reuters’ Andy Bruce has rather neatly drawn together all the factors pushing the cost of living in the UK higher: After surging to 5.1% last month, UK inflation is now heading towards 6%, says Deutsche Bank’s senior economist Sanjay Raja. He says inflation surprised to the upside today, including a ‘staggering’ rise in the retail prices index to 7.1%, with core CPI inflation rising to 4%. These are the highest prints we’ve seen in a decade. And to be sure, for core CPI and RPI, these are the highest prints we’ve seen since the MPC was given its independence in 1997. Raja has now recalibrated his models, and his inflation projections have ticked up further. We now see headline CPI peaking above 6% in April-22, easily marking the highest annual rate of inflation since the Bank of England’s independence. And we see headline RPI pushing to 7.7% y-o-y. That would be three times the Bank of England’s target of 2%, and mean that UK real wages were falling again [as wage growth has slowed to around 4%]. The UK energy price cap likely to rise sharply next April when Ofgem next adjusts it. And inflation risks – at least for the very near term – could remain tilted further to the upside, Raja adds: Changes to inflation weights will only serve to amplify the rise in core goods, energy, and food inflation, with the 2022 consumption basket likely to be skewed more towards non-services. The good news, if any, is that as pressures rotate away from goods to services, we should see a more amplified drop in headline inflation – something we still envisage will come late next year. The weak US retail sales growth in November followed a busy October, where spending surged by 1.8%. That may show that consumers bought early this festive season, on fears of supply shortages.... ... while rising inflation may have deterred some consumers from spending. In the US, retail sales have risen by less than forecast, suggesting that consumer demand may be cooling. Spending at retailers and food services outlets only rose by 0.3% month-on-month in November, much weaker than the 0.8% gain expected thanks to Black Friday and early Christmas spending. Spending at gasoline stations jumped 1.7% during the month, as higher prices hit US motorists (as in the UK). But electronics and appliance stores saw a 4.6% drop, while department store sales tumbled 5.4%. Punch Pubs has been bought by the private equity investor Fortress in a deal for almost 1,300 British pubs thought to be worth as much as £1bn. The company’s pub landlords employ about 20,000 people, although Punch employs only 280 people directly. Punch owns more than 90% of the freeholds of its properties, making it an attractive target for private equity owners. It is also focused on rural and suburban pubs which have been less affected by absent commuters than city centre-focused chains. Fortress is backed by Japan’s Softbank and also owns Majestic Wine, a British chain of off-licences that it bought in 2019. Its latest purchase comes after it lost out in a protracted bid battle to acquire Morrisons in the autumn, being narrowly outbid in an auction for the British supermarket chain by its US private equity rival Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice... The surge in the cost of living in the UK suggests that the inflationary threat has intensified, warns Silvia Dall’Angelo, senior economist at the International Business of Federated Hermes. But it could still make sense for the Bank of England to leave interest rates on hold tomorrow, she argues, until it knows how the Omicron variant will hit the economy, “The UK inflation’s surge has been extraordinary, going from below 1% in Q1 of this year to well above the 2% target in the last four months. The longer realised inflation remains elevated, the higher the risk it affects expectations and wages, thus becoming engrained. Today’s report suggests the inflationary threat has intensified further, and therefore puts considerable pressure on the Bank of England. The outcome of the upcoming policy meeting on Thursday has always been a close call, and today’s CPI report implies a deterioration of the trade-offs the Bank is facing. At the margin, the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the new Omicron variant will likely prevail and the Bank is likely to keep policies on hold on Thursday. “The Bank could well use few more weeks to get more clarity about Omicron’s implications for the outlook and to see whether the recently adopted government’s measures are sufficient to contain its fast rise in the country. The BoE will have noted that government ministers have been warned we could see major shortages across industry, hospitality and healthcare, as rail companies cancelled services and Royal Mail said it was experiencing high staff absences. UK energy suppliers will face new financial stress tests from January to see if they can handle the rocketing market prices for gas and electricity which are driving the cost of living higher in the UK and abroad. The move is part of a series of plans from the industry regulator to boost the sector’s resilience after dozens of suppliers collapsed, my colleague Jillian Ambrose explains: Ofgem will test providers against a range of scenarios and set an improvement plan for companies showing signs of financial weakness that could put their customers at risk. The regulator also plans to toughen existing financial rules for suppliers and introduce new conditions by the spring, which could include checks on senior energy company bosses. In some cases, Ofgem may bar a provider from taking on new accounts before reaching certain milestones, such as 50,000 and 200,000 customers, until it is satisfied that they are financially resilient. The planned regulation shake-up comes as Ofgem faces deepening criticism over the collapse of 26 energy suppliers in the last four months, which has left almost 4 million customers in need of a new supplier. Here’s the full story: Here’s our Q&amp;A on inflation, and what it means for your finances: More from Victoria Scholar of ii: Inflation is eroding the value of cash savings. But major UK banks have agreed to join forces and share services to help people and businesses to continue to be able to access cash. Barclays, HSBC UK, Lloyds Banking Group, Nationwide building society, NatWest, Santander UK, TSB and Danske Bank have agreed to the new approach, with some other firms also considering joining up. The collaboration, achieved through the Access to Cash Action Group, signals a long-term commitment to ensuring widespread cash and banking access for communities where services are limited. It means that, from Wednesday, if a bank involved in the initiative decides to close a branch, it will inform the ATM network Link. The oil price has dipped this morning, as traders anticipate that Omicron will hit demand for energy. Brent crude, the international benchmark. is down 1.5% at $72.65 per barrel. Brent hit a three-year high of $86/barrel in October, as prices of diesel and petrol reached record highs in the UK. Its recent losses may bring some relief to motorists. A year ago, Brent crude was trading around $50 per barrel, before the easing of lockdown restrictions thanks to vaccine rollouts boosted demand. UK house prices dropped by 1.1% in October, according to the latest Land Registry figures. This pulled the average UK house price down to £268,000, but still left prices 10.2% higher than a year ago (meaning the average property has risen by £24,000). London remained the region with the lowest annual growth at 6.2%, but it was also the only area where price rose during the month. Prices in the capital had weakened during the pandemic, as many office staff worked from home and some families looked to move to larger, rural houses. The easing of restrictions this year may have spurred people to buy in London again. Nicky Stevenson, Managing Director at national estate agent group Fine &amp; Country, says: “The big story here is that London prices have seriously begun to rebound after a quiet period caused in large part by the pandemic. “We always expected prices in the capital to make a comeback as people returned to work and the months ahead will be crucial as the government seeks to deal with the effects of Omicron. “A successful roll-out of the booster jab programme could see London experience the same boom as other parts of the country.” The surge in UK inflation to 5.1% piles the pressure on the Bank of England as it weighs up whether to raise interest rates from their current record lows of 0.1% tomorrow. James Lynch, fixed income investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, says this week’s data makes a strong case for a hike -- but the omicron variant may encourage the BoE to hold off. Also, the Bank may not want to spook consumers and businesses just before Christmas. Lynch says: “Another big inflation number in the UK today, CPI hitting 5.1%. This is more than economists and the BoE were expecting by some margin. We are almost getting used to big inflation numbers now, but this will not sit easy with the policymakers at Threadneedle street. “This is especially the case as it comes straight off the back of stronger than expected labour market news. The unemployment rate is down at 4.2, and wages are rising by 4.3%, again all better than what the BoE had been forecasting. “Given this is the type of data MPC members were focusing on to make the call to raise interest rates at the 16th Dec meeting, a policy move should have been all but a foregone conclusion. The only reason a move is now not going to happen would be is due to the value in waiting to see how the Omicron wave of infections affects government policy and economic activity in January. “The reality is, it should not be a medium- or long-term consideration for inflation, if anything it may add to the inflation problem we already have. However I am sure the optics of raising interest rates a week before Christmas, along with a potentially very high covid infection wave which may involve more restrictions on economic activity, is something they are very aware of.” UK interest rate futures are suggesting there’s a greater chance that the Bank hikes rates from 0.1% to 0.25%, as Victoria Scholar, head of investment at interactive investor, flags: But, many economists still expect the BoE to stay on hold again on Thursday, because of the potential impact on economic growth of rapidly rising cases of the Omicron coronavirus variant. Jeremy Batstone-Carr, Raymond James European Strategy Team, predicts a rate hike has been pushed ‘into the long grass’. “A month ago, it was safe to assume that interest rates would rise at December’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, and when October’s employment figures banished any fear of a post-furlough jobs crisis, it was all but certain that a rate rise was on the cards before the end of the year.” “However, the Committee is now confronted by a new spectre of uncertainty: Omicron. The new variant has thrown the country back into a world of WFH, and the potential economic fallout is even swaying hardline Committee members to change course. The previously hawkish Michael Saunders looks to have swung into the dovish camp, albeit temporarily, implying that, irrespective of the strength of the UK’s labour market or inflation, there will be no pre-Christmas rate hike from the Bank.” The BBC’s Faisal Islam points out that the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation has hit a 30-year high, at 7.1%. And although RPI is discredited (stripped of its status as a national statistics), it is still used to set many costs - including student loans, as well as being the basis for some union pay claims (see here). UK inflation jumped to 5.1% in November as the price of petrol reached a record high and a computer chip shortage continued to push up the cost of cars. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the increase, which exceeded City forecasts of a rise to 4.8%, took the consumer prices annual rate to its highest level since September 2011, when it stood at 5.2%. Analysts said the increase in inflation from 4.2% in October is expected to put further pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates when it meets on Thursday, although the spread of the Omicron variant may deter policymakers from taking such action until the new year. Last month, Bank officials were predicting that inflation would rise more gradually and exceed 5% by next April, when a price cap on gas bills is expected to be lifted by the energy regulator Ofgem. Unions and anti-poverty campaigners said the jump in prices would hit household living standards without further action from the Treasury. Labour market figures on Tuesday showed wage increases moderated in October to below 4%, indicating that despite rising employment and a widespread vacancies, workers are likely to see a fall in disposable incomes in the run-up to Christmas. More here: The TUC has called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to fully fund real pay rises for public sector workers to help them handle the jump in inflation to 5.1%. TUC general secretary Frances O‘Grady says: “Households are facing the most difficult Christmas in nearly a decade. Many families will struggle to keep up with basic living costs, let alone Christmas celebrations. Fuel and electricity costs are soaring, and the Chancellor’s cut to universal credit could not have come at a worse time. “We need an urgent plan from the government to get real wages rising. Trade unions should have greater access rights to workplaces to negotiate improved pay. The Chancellor must fully fund real pay rises for public sector workers. And the minimum wage should go up to £10 immediately.” Digging into today’s inflation data, its clear that prices have risen across the board in the last 12 month, although there are some exceptions. Food prices have risen 2.4% per year, including a 5.1% rise in ‘beef and veal’, a 6.9% leap in ‘lamb and goat’, a 5.7% rise in whole milk, and a 8.9% jump in butter prices. Fruit rose 4.5%, while yoghurt rose 6.7%. Crisps are up 7.3%, while ice-cream and edible ice prices have risen 9.1%. But flour and other cereals fell 10.3%, pizza and quiche prices are down 7.6% on a year ago, and pasta and couscous was 5.2% lower -- all staple items during last November’s lockdown. Among alcohol products, wine rose 3.3%, including fortified wines which jumped 8.3%, while beer rose 2%. Tobacco prices were up 6.8%, following tax increases. Clothing prices jumped 3.8%, with infant and children’s garments costing 4.8% more than a year ago. Households have also faced a 13.7% increase in the cost of materials for repairs, and a 23.2% surge in energy costs after the price cap was lifted. Household furniture has jumped by 12.2%, with carpets and rugs costing 6.5% more. Household appliances have also become pricier, with refrigerators, freezers and fridge-freezer prices jumping 10.3%, washing machines, tumbledriers and dishwashers up 8.3%, and cookers costing 4.5% more. In transport, used-car prices rocketed by 27.1% (details here), new cars rose 3.6%, and bicycles are 15% more expensive than a year ago. Motorists also saw inflation at the pumps, with diesel up 27.5% and petrol costing 29.5% more, as prices hit record levels. Railway journeys cost 4.8% more, while air travel was 14.1% more expensive, following the easing of travel restrictions. Within recreation, games, toys and hobby prices rose by 3.7%, while camping equipment costs 14.5% more than a year ago, and garden products rose 12.7%. Pets are 3% cheaper, but products for our furry and feathered friends cost 4% more. Going out costs more too -- with cinemas, theatres, concert visits costing 13.6% more, while attending recreational and sporting events is 8.4% more expensive. Book prices have risen by 5.5% (with fiction costing 12.7% more). Within catering, restaurants and cafes will set you back 4.2% more than in November 2020, while canteens are 9.4% pricier (demand will have been lower in last year’s lockdown). Accommodation services costs have risen by 8.3%, as hotels, hostels and campsites have reopened after the lockdown earlier this year. It was led by a 17.5% jump in prices at holiday centres, camping sites and youth hostels. Hairdressing prices for women have risen 3.9%, although only by 3.3% for men and children. Jewellery prices have risen 2.7%, while repairing jewellery, clocks and watches will cost 7.5% more. But insurance bills have dropped by 1.9%, led by a 6.7% fall in house contents insurance (although health insurance is up 6.2%). And the charges set by banks and post offices are down 2.4% over the last year. Second-hand car prices increased by 3.1% in November, and have jumped by over 27% in the last year. Indeed, prices of used cars have surged by 31.3% since April, when last winter’s lockdown began to ease, as this chart shows: Rising demand from people looking to avoid public transport in the pandemic, supply chain problems hitting new car production, and a shortage of second-hand cars are all factors. The ONS explains: These latest movements come amidst reports of increased demand as dealers opened following the most recent national lockdown, together with a global semiconductor shortage affecting the production of new cars and resulting in consumers turning to the used car market. Additionally, there are reportedly concerns in the trade about the supply of second-hand cars because of a variety of factors. These include fewer one-year-old cars coming to the market now because of a fall in new car registrations last year, and the extensions of lease contracts and fewer part exchanges caused again by delays in new-car supply. Here’s a breakdown of how prices have risen, driving the UK’s CPI inflation rate to a decade high of 5.1%: Food and non-alcoholic beverages: +2.5% Alcoholic beverages and tobacco: +4.8% Clothing and footwear: +3.5% Housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels: +7.0% Furniture, household equipment and maintenance: +6.1% Health: +1.4% Transport: +12.5% Communication: +1.2% Recreation and culture: +3.3% Education: +4.5% Restaurants and hotels: +5.2% Miscellaneous goods and services: +1.5% Pensioners face a cost of living squeeze next year too. The state pension is set to rise by September’s CPI inflation rate, of 3.1%, next April, some way below the current inflation rate. The government chose to freeze its pension ‘triple-lock’, after wage growth hit 8% this summer due to pandemic distortions. Sarah Pennells, consumer finance specialist at Royal London, says: “The surge in the consumer prices index to 5.1%, 3.1% above the Bank of England’s target couldn’t come at a worse time for consumers, with less than two weeks until Christmas. Rising prices will have an unwelcome impact on household budgets already feeling the squeeze. “Savers will be hoping the Bank of England lifts their spirits by increasing the base interest rate in an attempt to rein in inflation at Thursday’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting. However, with inflation running as high as it is, interest rates on savings accounts have some way to go to catch up. “Concern among those on fixed incomes, like pensioners, will also be mounting. The suspension of the triple lock means they are in line for an increase of 3.1% in their state pension – or an extra £5.55 a week - next April. Today’s figures make that look less and less generous.” The Unite union says it will continue to push for pay rises to at least match the Retail Prices Index measure of inflation. RPI, which includes housing costs, jumped to 7.1% in November, ahead of the consumer prices index which rose to the ten-year high of 5.1%. Unite’s general secretary Sharon Graham says the union will continue to base claims on the RPI figure rather than CPI because it better reflects the actual price rise experienced by Unite members. “Today’s figures mean our members must fight for wage rises above the current rate of inflation, as measured by the RPI. Otherwise, they will be facing a calamitous drop in their standard of living. Current estimates suggest that costs for the typical UK family will jump by £1,700 in 2022. Workers did not create this cost-of-living crisis so why should they pay for it?” [RPI is no longer an official national statistic, and is being replaced by CPIH which includes housing costs. It rose to 4.6% in November] Inflation is rising much faster than the Bank of England had forecast, just as policymakers prepare to set interest rates tomorrow. The BoE predicted last month that inflation would peak at 5%, but not until early 2022. Paul Dales of Capital Economics says November’s jump gives the Bank enough ammunition to raise interest rates tomorrow. But it is more likely, he suggests, to wait until it knows more about the Omicron situation. Some of the rise in inflation was due to one-off factors. The 5.1% month-on-month rise in fuel prices is unlikely to be repeated now that oil prices have fallen back. And the 4.2% m/m rise in tobacco prices was mainly due to the hike in tobacco duties in October’s Budget. Finally, the rise in clothing inflation from -0.4% in October to +3.5% in November had more to do with the unusual fall in prices last November rather than any unusual strength this November (i.e. it was due to base effects). Even so, there is some evidence of more persistent price pressures. The rise in food inflation from +1.2% to +2.5% may go further as it probably reflects the previous increase in costs. The increase in second-hand car inflation from +22.8% to +27.1% suggests there’s been no let-up in shortages of cars. And housing rents inflation crept up again, from 1.8% to 1.9%. Core inflation jumped from 3.4% to 4.0%. The cost of goods jumped by 6.5% per year in November, driven by rising demand and supply chain problems following the pandemic. Services inflation was more muted, up 3.3%. Ian Stewart, chief economist at Deloitte, explains: “Goods inflation is running at the highest level in 30 years, fuelled by pandemic-related dislocations between supply and demand. But price rises for services are at much lower rates, pointing to more muted domestically-generated inflation. “Just as happened during the UK’s last inflationary surge, in 2011, earnings lag behind inflation. Today’s bout of inflation is more likely to play out as another squeeze on incomes than a runaway wage-price spiral.” Pat McFadden MP, Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, says: “These figures are a stark illustration of the cost of living crisis facing families this Christmas. “From the energy price cap going up, soaring food costs and fuel prices hitting another record high - the list of price crunches as inflation continues to rise goes on and on. “Instead of taking action, the government are looking the other way, blaming ‘global problems’ while they trap us in a high tax, low growth cycle. “Unlike the Conservatives, Labour wouldn’t be hitting working people with a tax hike, and as heating bills rise, we’d cut VAT on domestic energy bills now for the winter months, to help ease the burden on households.” With prices rising faster than wages, the UK faces a nationwide living standards squeeze, warns Jack Leslie, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation: Fuel price inflation is at its highest level on record, going back to 1989, with prices rising 28.5% on a year earlier. And with factory gate inflation still rising, inflationary pressures will continue to build in early 2022, while pay packets continue to shrink. “It’s too early to say how much affect the Omicron wave will have on inflation – and the extent to which falling demand will be offset by further supply chain disruption, which could push prices in either direction. “But early 2022 is likely to marked by acute economic pain for some parts of the economy – notably hospitality – alongside a nationwide living standards squeeze.” UK factories are also facing inflationary pressures, and lifting their own prices sharply higher in response. The input prices paid by manufacturers surged by 14.3% per year in November, due to pricier raw material prices. Firms hiked their output prices by 9.1% year-on-year, suggesting consumers will see higher prices in the shops in coming months. Petroleum products jumped the most (up 85%, following the rise in crude prices this year), but the cost of metals and machinery (+13%), chemicals and pharmaceuticals (+12%), paper (+7.7%) and food (+4.5%) at the factory gate also rose sharply.. Some snap reaction: Transport made a large upward impact on inflation, the ONS says, with motor fuel prices jumping 5.1% during the month. The price of petrol rose by 7.2 pence per litre between October and November 2021, the largest monthly rise on record (since 1990). Second-hand car prices kept rising, lifted by increased demand following the end of the most recent national lockdown, and delays to new car supplies due to semiconductor shortages. Clothing and footwear also provided a large upward contribution, the ONS says: The upward contribution was spread across most of the detailed classes, with the largest effects coming from a broad range of women’s and men’s clothing. Food and non-alcoholic beverage prices rose too: The largest came from sugar, jam, syrups, chocolate and confectionery, where prices of chocolate products in particular rose this year but fell a year ago. And alcohol and tobacco prices increased, partly because tax changes kicked in, the ONS says: The largest effect came from tobacco, where duty rates increased as announced in the Autumn 2021 Budget. There were also smaller upward contributions from spirits, wine and beer. Rising energy bills have also pushed up inflation to a 10-year high, after the price cap was lifted in October (and also back in April). Electricity prices are 18.8% higher than a year ago, while gas is 28.1% more expensive. These are the highest annual rates for these classes since early 2009, the ONS says. A wide range of price increases drove UK inflation to a ten-year high last month, says ONS chief economist, Grant Fitzner: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Inflation in the UK has soared to 5.1%, a ten-year high, as the cost of living squeeze gripping the country tightens. Prices jumped in November at the fastest annual rate since September 2011, the Office for National Statistics reports this morning, up from 4.2% in October. This surge is higher than economists had forecast, and more than double the UK’s 2% inflation target. In November alone, the Consumer Prices Index rose by 0.7%, as price pressures hit families in the run-up to Christmas. Prices surged across the economy, with transport, including motor fuel and second hand cars, food, energy, other housing and household services, clothing and footwear costs all rising. Inflation is now rising faster than pay, meaning people face falling real wages again. Basic pay growth slowed to 4.3% per year in August-October, yesterday’s labour market report showed. This is putting pressure on living standards, as the Resolution Foundation points out: Also coming up today Inflation is also a hot problem in the US, where consumer prices jumped 6.8% in the year to November, the fastest in almost 40 years. Goods and services producers lifted their prices by nearly 10%, as supply bottlenecks kept pushing up costs. Faced with this inflation surge, the US central bank is likely to decide to wrap up its bond-buying stimulus programme faster, when policymakers meet today. That would free the Federal Reserve up to raise interest rates faster next year, if needed. Fears that the Fed will announce a faster ‘taper’ tonight hit stocks on Wall Street yesterday.

          "headline": "Is Ofgem up to the job of sorting out the energy crisis?",
          "bodyText": "Ofgem wants to close the stable door after the horse has bolted. The regulator now feels it would be an excellent idea if the retail energy market was not littered with failed companies – 26 at the last count, in the space of three brutal months. It wants to ensure such a thing cannot happen again. The ingredients of reform are not hard to identify: outsiders have been telling Ofgem about them for months, or years. And, to be fair to the regulator, a loose version of most can be found in the draft proposals it published on Wednesday. Suppliers will be subjected to “stress testing” to ensure they are “adequately hedged or hold sufficient capital to manage a wide range of scenarios”. There will be “enhanced monitoring” of companies. Key individuals at companies will have to pass fit and proper tests. Consumers’ credit balances will be better protected to stop them being used for general financing purposes. And the price cap will probably be reformed; one option is to switch to quarterly adjustments rather than six-monthly. All worthwhile ideas, but the big worry is Ofgem’s ability to make the reforms stick and to enforce them. Confidence is not improved by its chief executive, Jonathan Brearley’s, tiresome habit of talking endlessly about the “unprecedented” rise in global energy prices while glossing over Ofgem’s failure to model for extreme events (which have always happened in commodity markets). Come on, the crisis was a gross failure of regulation. Ofgem, undoubtedly under pressure to increase competition, counted success by the number of new entrants. It missed the wider picture. Even now, Ofgem’s four-paragraph description of its proposed stress tests – the critical idea, borrowed from the banking sector – reads sketchily. A series of “what if” scenarios is fine in outline but the regulator candidly admits it will be “learning lessons and adapting over time”, which doesn’t sound as if it has the details nailed down. As with the banks, the skill lies in ensuring the system cannot be gamed. Maybe the details will be in place for the final version in January, but the comparison with the banking sector is instructive. After the financial crash of 2007-09, the Financial Services Authority was swept away, discredited by its loose-touch approach, its timidity and its failure to anticipate events. The stakes are smaller in retail energy regulation, even if an estimated clean-up bill from company failures of £90 or so for each household is chunky, but the question needs to be asked: is the regulator up to the job of ensuring the desired “resilient” market? All the latest proposals, remember, could have been adopted at any time. Indeed, Ofgem conducted a review of its licensing regime as recently as 2019 but opted for tweaks rather than a thorough job. If one studies Brearley’s words carefully, one can find a couple of gentle references to how Ofgem will adapt its “organisational approach” in response to the crisis. None of it, though, screams radicalism or urgency. A question of credibility hangs over these reforms. Twist in the plot for Cineworld “The directors are of the view that no material liability will arise in respect of this claim,” said Cineworld the last time it spoke about the litigation from Cineplex, the Canadian rival it was trying to buy – and then, crucially, didn’t – as the pandemic struck. If the directors believed that, they were presumably dumbfounded by Tuesday’s twist in the plot. The Ontario superior court of justice has ruled that Cineworld must pay its rival C$1.23bn, or £720m. That definitely counts as a material liability. Cineworld’s market capitalisation was £622m before the judgment. After it, it was 39% less. Cineworld will appeal against the ruling, and understandably so. As the company relates the tale, the award of damages to Cineplex is based on “lost synergies”. This seems an odd way to view events since the aborted C$2.8bn bid was in cash. The appeal will take a year or so, and in the interim Cineworld expects to pay nothing. That is scant consolation, however. The company entered the pandemic in a hideously over-borrowed state – a function of the acquisitions it did complete – and still had net debt of $8.4bn (£6.3bn) at its last balance sheet, once lease liabilities are included. Before this ruling, Omicron’s threat to the revival in cinema-going habits was the chief risk. Now Cineworld has become a litigation play."

          "headline": "Putin assures Xi he will go to Winter Olympics in show of unity",
          "bodyText": "Vladimir Putin has confirmed he will attend the opening of the Winter Olympics in Beijing, an event that Boris Johnson and other western leaders have boycotted in protest at human rights abuses in China. Putin made the pledge during a video call with the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, as he said that a “new model of cooperation has been formed between our countries, based on other matters of principles such as non-interference in [each other’s] internal affairs”. Russia and China are facing increasing pressure from the US and western countries as regional conflicts and human rights abuses have led to growing tensions. The US, UK and Australia have said high-level officials will not be attending the winter Games owing largely to China’s abuses of Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang and crackdown on the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. Putin is seeking support in his growing conflict with the west over his military buildup near Ukraine. During their conversation, Putin and Xi voiced shared concern over the trilateral Aukus security pact between Australia, the UK and US. In return, Xi had said he supported Putin’s demands for new security guarantees in Europe, according to Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov. “He understands what concerns Russia has with regard to its western borders,” Ushakov said. Putin’s promise to attend the Olympics would mark a rare trip overseas for the Covid-shy Russian president. He has travelled abroad only twice since the outbreak of the pandemic – to Geneva in June to meet Joe Biden, and to New Delhi to meet the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. Xi has not publicly left China since 2019. “As agreed, we will hold talks and then participate in the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympic Games,” Putin told Xi during the meeting. While the two leaders are not allies and compete with one another for influence, they have found a common cause in resisting pressure over how they govern their countries. The pledge came as a senior US official arrived in Moscow for talks with Russian diplomats. The US assistant secretary of state, Karen Donfried, had earlier travelled to Kyiv, where she told officials that under no circumstances would Washington press Ukraine into making concessions to Russia. In Moscow she met the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov. The meeting lasted an hour, during which Ryabkov said he would formally propose the “security guarantees” that Russia has sought from the US and Nato countries. In particular, Moscow has demanded guarantees that Ukraine will not join Nato and will not serve as a base for the military alliance’s infrastructure. “There has been a substantive discussion of security guarantees in light of the ongoing attempts of the United States and Nato at changing the military-political situation in Europe in their favour,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a brief statement that gave no other details about the meeting. Donfried also reportedly met with Dmitry Kozak, a Kremlin official seen as curating Russia’s policy for east Ukraine. The meeting indicated that Russia was interested in pursuing high-level contacts as soon as possible concerning the conflict. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov later said that Putin may speak with Joe Biden by the end of the year. In a public statement, Donfried said that she would share Russia’s proposals with US allies in an effort to provide transparency to Washington’s negotiations with the Kremlin. “Ryabkov asked to meet with me to share Moscow’s proposals on European security. I will take these ideas back to Washington and also share them with our allies and partners,” she said."

          "bodyText": "The former model Katie Price has received a 16-week suspended jail sentence and been banned from driving for two years after she admitted drink-driving while disqualified and without insurance after a crash near her home in Sussex. Price, 43, flipped her car on the B2135 near Partridge Green, near Horsham, at about 6.20am on 28 September while driving to see a friend. The following day, she admitted all charges at Crawley magistrates court, where she was sentenced on Wednesday. After the collision, Price told police: “I took drugs, I should not be driving, I admit it all.” She was arrested at the scene and taken to hospital. A drugs wipe gave a positive reading for cocaine and a roadside breath test was positive for alcohol, the court heard. An image shared by police from the scene showed a car flipped on its side. The district judge Amanda Kelly described Price’s behaviour as “incredibly selfish” and said she was lucky to not be going to prison. Kelly said she showed “no concern for the lives of others” and she “could have easily killed somebody”. “You appear to think you are above the law,” the judge told Price. Kelly also said Price, who has been banned from driving on five previous occasions, had “one of the worst driving records I have seen”. As well as a suspended sentence and driving ban, Price was also given 100 hours of unpaid work, 20 sessions of rehabilitation work with probation and ordered to pay £213 in costs. She already owed the court £7,358, the court was told. Price admitted the offences at a previous hearing on 29 September. At that hearing, her sentencing was adjourned on the condition that she had treatment at the Priory Centre and did not commit any further offences. She was also banned from driving in the interim."

          "bodyText": "I found Charlie through a life modelling website, and it wasn’t until I showed this image to my PhD tutor that I discovered he is the son of Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour and kind of famous. I have been interested in feminism and gender issues since I was young. I’m currently studying at the Royal College of Art in London. When I started there I was using Tinder for dating, and was intrigued by the gender dynamic. For example, how men would swipe right a lot more than women did. I started getting interested in the male and female gaze and thought it would be interesting to use the app to find men for my photographs. I messaged a lot of men, but most of them ignored me. Or if they replied they would want something else. I chose the men partially because of personal preferences, but also, I didn’t want to photograph very stereotypically masculine men. In art history, we already have a lot of those. Eventually I stopped using Tinder after the whole process of talking to people on it, going to their homes and photographing them became very repetitive. And then I got banned from it – I had a solo show in Sweden and the gallerist thought it would be interesting to invite people to the opening via Tinder, but you’re not allowed to promote anything through the app. I think getting banned was actually quite a nice, funny end to the whole thing. I try to show men’s vulnerability in these photographs. I don’t want to portray them in a degrading way, and I don’t want to simply reverse the gender roles. I try to be the one who is in control, but this is a fantasy, because my power is never guaranteed. Even when I put myself in my work, it’s not like one person is definitely the subject and the other is definitely the object. In one of the images, I recreated Fuseli’s 1781 painting The Nightmare, in which there’s a woman lying on the bed, there’s a demon sitting on her belly, and the demon is trying to have sex with her while she sleeps. In my version, it was me sitting on a naked man. I made a picture called the Feast with a group of naked men, inspired by old paintings of groups of naked women. Half of them were life models and half were friends. I was trying to make a cornucopia of men, with different kinds of bodies. This picture was inspired by The Dream of the Fisherman’s Wife by the Japanese artist Hokusai. His work is a very erotic scene of a naked woman with a small octopus and a gigantic octopus. Tentacles have always seemed to me very phallic. I woke up at four in the morning to get the octopuses from Billingsgate market in London. I got the biggest one I could find, although it’s a lot smaller than the one in Hokusai’s painting. I had to buy a whole box of the small ones which I then gave to Charlie and the other model on the shoot. I find the octopus so fleshy, so slimy, and really erotic. Some of my pictures, like this and others inspired by paintings, are in a way, me acting out my fantasies. I don’t think it was very pleasant for Charlie though. In fact, I guess it was a bit disgusting, but he didn’t complain. I think most of the men in my shoots have enjoyed them. I have made some video work with video chats in which I asked them to do something mundane for me to watch – like chopping carrots – but naked, and some of them really wanted to be looked at, and enjoyed it. I found that very interesting. I like the domestic space, that they are not doing something very obviously sexual or erotic. They’re just doing something from everyday life, but at the same time, there’s something a bit strange. That’s what I tried to achieve. I get obsessed with technical things, and I love the texture and the quality of analogue film. And because some of my work is directly related to the internet, it’s nice to have the contrast of shooting with film. I think some people find my work humorous - a sort of dry humour, and I’m quite happy to hear that, although I wasn’t trying to make these images funny. Yushi Li’s CV Born: Hunan, China, 1991. Trained: MA in photography and Phd in Arts and Humanities (present) at the Royal College of Art, London. Influences: Sophie Calle, Jeff Wall, John Berger, Jacques Lacan, Édouard Manet.

          "headline": "Netherlands announces €25bn plan to radically reduce livestock numbers",
          "bodyText": "The Dutch government has unveiled a €25bn (£21bn) plan to radically reduce the number of livestock in the country as it struggles to contain an overload of animal manure. A deal to buy out farmers to try to reduce levels of nitrogen pollution in the country had been mooted for some time, and was finally confirmed after the agreement of a new coalition government in the Netherlands earlier this week. But the plan, the first of its kind in the world, faces a huge backlash from farmers who have staged big street protests in recent years over the prospect of tough regulation and farmer buyouts. They fear permanent damage to food production in the country if too many farmers are forced to quit. “We don’t want the system to collapse,” said Utrecht dairy farmer Marije Klever, from the Dutch young farmers’ union. She said farmers would oppose any nonvoluntary measures. “I am a land owner, so a critical question is whether the government are allowed to push farmers out of the land. It can’t be The Hague telling farmers they must go, you need an agreement.” While being lauded internationally as the “tiny country that feeds the world” and the continent’s biggest meat exporter, the Netherlands has been struggling at home with a pollution crisis caused by an excess of farm animals. “We can’t be the tiny country that feeds the world if we shit ourselves,” said MP Tjeerd de Groot, from the Democrats 66 party, which is part of the coalition government in the Netherlands. The country has the highest density of livestock in Europe – more than four times that of the UK or France – with more than 100 million cattle, chickens and pigs in total. The animals produce manure which, when mixed with urine, releases ammonia, a nitrogen compound. If it gets into lakes and streams via farm runoff, excessive nitrogen can damage sensitive natural habitats. The highest Dutch administrative court found in 2019 that the government was breaking EU law by not doing enough to reduce excess nitrogen in vulnerable natural areas, due to farming and industrial activities. The 13-year multibillion-euro plan, published today, includes paying some Dutch livestock farmers to relocate or exit the industry, and helping others transition to more extensive (as opposed to intensive) methods of farming, with fewer animals and a bigger area of land. It will start as a voluntary programme, with compensation offered to livestock farmers asked to leave. “In the end, it might be necessary to stop negotiating as a last resort, but the basis is voluntary,” said de Groot. The end result is expected to be close to a one-third reduction in the numbers of pigs, cows and chickens in the country. “We don’t have to feed the world, but we could show how to do it in a more sustainable way,” said organic dairy farmer Jaring Brunia, from Friesland in the north of the country. But farming groups said they would only accept voluntary measures and want time to reduce emissions through technological innovations. “Cars were very polluting but they had a chance to make cars less polluting with innovation. That is what we want,” said MP Caroline van der Plas, founder of the Dutch farmers party BoerBurgerBeweging (BBB). Support for her party in rural communities has soared since it was founded two years ago, as farmers told the Guardian they felt sidelined by politicians. “For my son, where can he find a living and know what will be allowed in 10 years? We are known as the best farmers in the world for our innovation, but if you push us all away we will have less innovative power. We need some positivity,” said Erik Stegink, a pig farmer in Bathmen, in the east of the country. “The problem does not go away when I go away, it goes to another country,” added dairy farmer Geertjan Kloosterboer, who said farmers were ready to protest on the streets again against the measures. Some farmers appeared more resigned to the changes, saying there was no future for intensive farming in the densely populated Netherlands. “We farm in the back yards of the city and everything is watched,” said dairy farmer Heleen Lansink-Marissen, from Haaksbergen in eastern Netherlands. “We can’t fight for the past. We need a plan for the future and how to make money through biodiversity, carbon offsetting and a little bit less milk,” she added. De Groot, who has previously called for a halving of livestock numbers in the Netherlands, said the government had dithered for too long on dealing with the nitrogen crisis. “The message now is that this needs to be fixed, no matter what,” he said. “We have to move away from the low-cost model of food production. This industry is causing damage to the farmers’ business model and the environment. It’s time to restore nature, climate and air, and in some areas that may mean there is no more place for intensive farmers there.” Brunia said many farmers wanted to change, but were locked into intensive systems with a lot of animals and debts to pay. He urged the government to spend money on helping all farmers transition, rather than for just a few to quit. “We are used to pumping around a lot of money, milk and poo, but what is good for economics is not good for the Earth,” said Brunia. The Netherlands is not the only country in Europe facing a crisis over livestock emissions, with observers suggesting Denmark, Belgium and Germany may soon have to consider similar action. The UK is reportedly on track to miss its own 2020 ammonia emissions reductions target by 20% and is likely to face legal challenges from environmental health campaigners. “We have been very good at feeding the world,” said Derk Boswijk, a Christian Democrats party MP and spokesperson for agriculture. “We can be proud. But it didn’t work out for us, so we have to change. I hope other countries will learn from what we have done wrong.” Sign up for the Animals farmed monthly update to get a roundup of the biggest farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

          "headline": "The fears of five-year-olds: how young children cope with Covid anxiety",
          "bodyText": "Let me introduce you to a little girl called Miriam. She’s five years old and attends a primary school in north-east London. The adults who know her describe her as a confident, outgoing child. “She has a hugely adventurous spirit; she wants to try everything,” said one. But the pandemic that continues to spread fear and uncertainty across all our lives has made her scared of the world around her. Getting to sleep is difficult for Miriam because she has nightmares. Especially on Sundays. Coming into school is hard, because she doesn’t want to leave her mother. Sometimes she gets angry and clings to her mum. “Am I safe enough to do this on my own?” she’s thinking, and sometimes the answer she gives herself is no. “Her wings have been clipped by Covid,” says the school-based counsellor who works with her. She is not alone. Concerns about the devastating impact of the pandemic on mental health have been well aired since Covid-19 first swept the globe, forcing schools to close and countries into lockdown, but the focus has been for the most part on older children and teenagers who have seen their lives turned upside down, their exams cancelled, their futures thrown into doubt. But what of our youngest pupils, who have missed school without knowing what they’re missing and shouldn’t have a care in the world? On the upside, psychologists and educationalists agree many will have benefited from the extra time and attention they received from parents, whose own lives were paused as the world locked down – even if they have missed significant milestones and rites of passage: the birthday parties, play dates and sleepovers with grandparents, the swimming lessons, dance classes and (the current government obsession) Christmas nativities. Many, however, , have also been cooped up in cramped accommodation, cared for by anxious, overstretched parents who are struggling with their own demons. How are they all coping now? What will it mean for them in the future? And how are they feeling as the new Omicron variant takes hold across the globe, threatening to derail our journey back to a more normal life? A Guardian callout prompted dozens of responses from parents of five-year-olds. Some said their children had thrived. “Brilliant and resilient throughout,” said one. “Largely unfazed”, said another. But many more who responded were anxious about their children – such as Bella, a business analyst in the south-west of England. Her son appeared to cope well with lockdown at the start of this year. “He was home and, although he watched far too much TV, he was OK. He did miss some of his friends, but, as he had always suffered with separation anxiety, I think he felt more comfortable being home with me.” But as the lockdown wore on and Bella could not always give him her full attention because of her work, he struggled, shouting and playing his musical instruments as loudly as possible. Whenever they had to go out, he would obsessively wash his hands and apply alcohol gel until his skin was red and raw. Because he has asthma, infections have gone to his chest and he has had to undergo repeated PCR tests, which have left him traumatised. “The first one was OK,” said Bella. “But since then every one has been progressively worse. We honestly don’t think we will be able to get him to do another as it makes him so distraught.” He has also started to worry about spreading any infection he might pick up to others. “This week he told me he had a ‘big tummy ache’ and I knew it was anxiety-based. He has lost family to Covid, and we do have several vulnerable family members, so he does know the impact of spreading it, but it is so sad that a five-year-old should feel so anxious about something he should never have to worry about.” Freya’s mum is also concerned. Freya is an only child and loves company. “We used to go to all sorts of groups and clubs together, which she thrived on.” But when England went into lockdown in January, “she was so lonely and isolated that she stopped eating”. “Now she is back at school, she is much, much happier. But there are still significant scars. She is very anxious about germs and infection, and washes her hands obsessively. When one of her friends vomited in front of her recently, she was so anxious about catching the infection that she didn’t sleep all night. “Although she loves school, she is struggling to engage with the academic side of it. She also doesn’t really look forward to planned events any more because she always suspects that they may be cancelled because of the virus.” Freya barely remembers a time before Covid. “This Covid world is the world she knows and remembers. It causes her anxiety, stress and disappointment, and I worry that these will be things which she carries with her for life.” Anna’s son is also struggling. “My little boy was very anxious about leaving the house during the first lockdown. Despite it being warm and sunny, he wanted to just be inside. When Boris announced it was time to go back to school, he came out in a rash that the doctor eventually diagnosed as hives – they had never seen such a stress reaction in a child so young. “We regularly have tears about going to school and him telling us that he’s scared. He can’t watch any Disney film that has death in it as he’s so scared of his parents and grandparents dying – something he shouldn’t be thinking about so young.” Other parents who got in touch with the Guardian described a variety of concerning behaviours. One mother said her child was wetting herself at school despite being dry for months before, another has developed facial and vocal tics, while another child is grinding their teeth. There is a lot of obsessive hand-washing and widespread anxiety about germs. Meanwhile, the pandemic has been incorporated into play – children make vaccines with Duplo and when they play shops, anyone not wearing a mask is ordered to leave. Teachers have reported a lot of separation anxiety, with more clinginess than normal, children not wanting to let go of their parents, less capacity to focus. The five-year-olds “are not like five-year-olds”, said one Norfolk primary school teacher. “At best, they are emotionally and socially three or four. All instructions have to be short, direct and repeated. All tasks have to be simply and fully supported. They are tired, sad and generally overwhelmed.” Simon Kidwell, the principal of Hartford Manor primary school in Cheshire, says that when children came back to school after lockdown, some of his youngest struggled to communicate with each other and had little idea of how to take turns or play together. “Some children have had a great time during lockdown because they’ve had more adult attention, but we’ve also seen children who have been isolated during lockdown and they found it difficult. Our youngest children were not speaking to each other; they were playing in isolation. They were quiet and withdrawn.” Things have improved since the start of the autumn term, but, he says: “The youngest out of all the children are the most impacted. Some parents are still very anxious about sending them to school. Our attendance for this week is 92%, which is very low. We would normally be at 97%.” Place2Be is a children’s mental health charity working with more than 300 primary and all-through schools, offering one-to-one and group counselling. “We are seeing an increase in separation anxieties, mood swings, attention difficulties, worries and sadness,” said one counsellor. “At the beginning of this year there was a kind of fizzing energy about them. There were squabbles and unkindnesses. They were not ready to learn. It’s much calmer now. But they’ve had very, very early experiences of disruption, inconsistency and uncertainty, and of the world not being a safe place. All of those things will have an impact.” The effect of the pandemic on younger children has not been researched to the same degree as older children. One key study, however, has been the Co-Space study, a UK-based longitudinal survey of parents and carers that has been running since the fifth day of the UK’s first national lockdown in March 2020. According to Dr Polly Waite from the University of Oxford, who led the study alongside Prof Cathy Cresswell, there was a “really striking” difference in how the pandemic affected the mental health of children aged four to 10, compared with 11- to 16-year-olds. “The 11- to 16-year-olds with their own phones were able to interact with their peer group,” Waite says. “The younger ones who would normally be running around in the playground with their friends were isolated from their peer group, with parents who were feeling understandably really stressed during that period.” More than 60% of parents in the Co-Space study reported they did not feel able to meet the needs of both their children and their work. Parental stress was particularly high in single-adult households, among low-income families and where children had special educational needs or neuro-developmental disorders. “Most parents,” Waite says, “were not their best parenting selves during the pandemic.” How worried should parents of young children be? Prof Vivian Hill, the programme director for educational psychology training at UCL Institute of Education, says that many children who had anxiety and separation difficulties as a result of Covid have already adjusted and settled well at school. She adds: “A few will continue to be vulnerable to stress and anxiety triggers when facing adverse events. This pattern of behaviour can continue for some time, but within a supportive environment and with adults teaching the child the right strategies, over time they will develop coping strategies and learn to manage triggering events. While life events impact on us all, we can recover, given the right support.” To some extent, Miriam – that adventurous but terrified little soul we met at the beginning – bears this out. Her teachers are working hard to help her and she is being supported by Place2Be. She still struggles to separate from her mum, and Sunday nights are still the worst for getting to sleep. She still complains about tummy aches and headaches and she sometimes wants to stay at home. But she is learning to cope. She has a keyring with her mum’s picture in it, which hangs on her belt until home time. At school, she can look at it whenever she wants, and she can put it away when she doesn’t need to. It’s helping her to deal with the fear and uncertainty that engulfed her five-year-old life.

          "bodyText": "On a fine weekend evening, locals gather at the harbour in Watchet, west Somerset. Town crier David Milton, dressed in a gilt-trimmed green jacket and tricorn hat, leads the singing: lusty accounts of drunken and lovelorn sailors and maritime glories past. Kids bob on parents’ shoulders and seagulls cast figures-of-eight against the blue-grey horizons of the Bristol Channel, and soft outlines of Wales’s Barry island beyond. Rather than a nod to the pandemic’s TikTok fad, Watchet’s monthly shanty singalongs are an expression of a proud maritime identity for a town that’s often overlooked by the craft cider quaffers and luxury country cottage-bookers on the West Country holiday circuit. A few steps east along the harbourfront, a new symbol of Watchet’s pride rises against the coastal blues: a cubist jungle of brightly coloured boxes overlooking the dry dock. Designed by Invisible Studio architect Piers Taylor and realised by a determined collective of local women, East Quay is a £6.3m cultural venue with a gallery, restaurant, studios and rooms, all funded, in part, by the Coastal Communities fund and Arts Council England. It proposes a model for how tourism can be put to work for good in our struggling coastal communities. The writer of a 1927 Somerset guidebook, Mrs Osborn Hann, said of Watchet that it was “more like a foreign quay than any place I know of … a quaint and higgledy-piggledy town [where] houses seem to have dropped willy-nilly from the skies”. “It hasn’t much changed,” smiles Georgie Grant, one of the co-directors of project founders the Onion Collective (or “Onions” as the five-woman team call themselves). “Watchet has a character all its own,” she says, as she takes me on a tour of the town’s High Street, with its 16th-century inns and sloping, ice-cream-coloured facades. Despite this civic spirit, Watchet was in a rough place in the mid 2010s, when its largest employer, a paper mill dating back to the mid-17th century and known locally as “the family”, shut its doors for good. In 2013, when plans fell through for a controversial development of luxury flats on the marina quayside, Georgie and her fellow Onions – Jess Prendergrast, Rachel Kelly, Sally Lowndes and Naomi Griffith – decided to pool their skills in local politics, charity and arts management and ask fellow Watchet residents what they wanted for their town. Many Watcheters, Georgie recalls, were keen to restore the town’s Boat Museum, dedicated to the traditional boats – known as “flatties” – that used to sail the shallow mudflats at low tide; others wanted to perk up the visitor centre to attract more outsiders to a town that lures 70,000 tourists a year (compared with the million that decant in nearby Minehead). Most of these arrive as daytrippers on the heritage West Somerset railway which puffs the eight-mile route to Watchet from Minehead four times a day in summer (and for festive fish-and-chip and steam-and-cream themed itineraries in colder months). “We just listened to the locals,” says Georgie. “And eight years down the line, with some sweat and tears, Watchet has its Boat Museum, its visitors’ centre and this” – she gestures around the East Quay site from the courtyard that will also serve as a theatre performance space. Opened in October and commanding a third of Watchet’s harbour front, East Quay features a double-storey immersive art gallery run by arts charity Contains Art; 14 studio/workshops for local artists; a geology and ecology workshop; an alternative education space designed by local schoolchildren; a bistro and five self-catering accommodation pods, with interiors designed by Hereforshire maker-architects Pearce+Fægen (available to book from early 2022). Crucially, in an area with England’s lowest social mobility and an average household income of £16,000 a year, East Quay delivers 37 decent new jobs, including five apprenticeships, and it will support 109 jobs indirectly from visitors’ spending on local businesses. The five pods (which sleep between two and four) are multi-level metal boxes inspired by Watchet’s industrial and maritime history with, as Jess puts it, “a bit of graffiti and steampunk thrown in”. Each pod is individually themed – Playful Architecture, for example, has adaptive furniture (chairs that transform into tables and chaise longues) and a cargo net to kip in, and Industrial Heritage features a ship’s ladder and a bespoke iron bathtub with a view. The pods are tucked between artists’ studios, to encourage visitors to pop in for a cuppa and check out the artists’ collaborative productions. With brilliant light glancing off the Bristol Channel and the harbour fringed by moored boats, Pod One, Object Exchange, feels a bit like being a guest on a luxury yacht. As in the other pods, there’s a ground-floor bathroom and a kitchen with hob, microwave and grill, kettle, fridge and toaster. On a mezzanine level, a two-seat sea viewing platform has floor-to-ceiling glass offering 180-degree waterfront views. A “lost and found” feature arranged across its floor-to-ceiling shelves, lets visitors leave behind something that reminds them of their trip as they pick up a souvenir: maybe a piece of handmade paper or a fossil mudlarked from the coastline, where Jurassic and Triassic sediments meet in riot of striated limestone and ochre. In keeping with East Quay’s stance on supporting local labour markets, the pods’ bedding is made by a Devonshire company that stitches mattresses by hand, and packs of seasonal local produce greet arrivals, while freshly baked bread is on offer each morning from the on-site bistro, East Quay Kitchen, delivered to your door on request. At the heart of the ground-floor level of East Quay there’s another nod to Watchet’s heritage: a working paper mill. Local papermaker Jim Patterson was an apprentice at Wansbrough Paper Mill in the early 1970s, before setting up his own specialist watercolour paper factory, Two Rivers Paper in 1976. The 74-year-old was planning to retire, but has been lured back into artisan papermaking to train a new generation at East Quay. “Watching Jim at work will be a highlight for visitors,” Georgie says. From late 2022, East Quay will also be home to a factory that produces living construction materials from the mycelium fungus, a cutting-edge post-carbon technology. East Quay follows a wave of social enterprises that channel tourist revenue into local community renewal. They include Foxes Hotel in Minehead, which offers apprenticeships to young people with disabilities, and London’s Good Hotel, which trains long-term unemployed Londoners. In an era in which many locals in popular coastal spots rail against overtourism, there’s also a win-win, Jess believes, in spreading footfall to under-visited destinations. “We want to widen the holiday season here to reduce job seasonality,” she says, “and we’re providing new accommodation pods, rather than seeing local property converted to holiday lets, or sold as second homes.” As the afternoon sun gilds the sea, I climb with Jess and Georgie to one of two viewing platforms above the site, where locals and visitors will be able to come for views over old and new Watchet, and the hubbub of East Quay below. The development has already encouraged new marina owners the Marine Group to dredge Watchet’s silted-up dry dock; the Onions hope that leisure boat moorings will increase and that one day the pleasure ferries that used to ply the route from Watchet to the Welsh coast in the 1950s and 60s will return. We walk up the harbourside from East Quay as a steam train wheezes into the station. As we climb the bridge over the rail tracks, a teenager in a logo sweatshirt stops and stares at Jess. “Are you one of them Onion women who’s doing East Quay?” he enquires. Jess nods, uncertainly. The teenager pumps his fist in the air. “Big up the Onion Collective!” he cries. East Quay’s pods cost from £100 a night, eastquaywatchet.co.uk • This article was amended on 23 December 2021 to date Mrs Osborn Hann’s Somerset guidebook to 1927 rather than the Edwardian period, and to give the rail distance between Minehead and Watchet as eight miles, not 20. Tourism social enterprises across the UK Jubilee Pool, Penzance One of Europe’s last remaining seawater lidos, Jubilee was threatened with closure following storm damage, but in 2017 was taken over by a community benefit society. The group has restored the pool to its art deco glory and runs the pool – now a major tourist attraction – for the community. South Tynedale Railway, Cumbria Volunteers at South Tynedale Railway Preservation Society have created a tourist attraction straddling two of the UK’s most deprived rural areas: a narrow-gauge railway winding from Alston through the picturesque South Tyne Valley. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. Art B&amp;B, Blackpool This classic Victorian seafront hotel, renovated by 30 contemporary artists, reinvests its profits in local arts and community projects and stages events, talks and workshops for locals. Good Hotel, London Set on a boat in London’s Docklands, the Good Hotel provides jobs and career training for long-term unemployed Londoners. Profits from the project go to educate children through the hotel’s global foundation, including in Guatemala, where the original Good Hotel was founded in 2007. Bristol Ferry Boats Bristol harbour’s iconic yellow-and-blue boat fleet has been run for community benefit since 2013, with the group who run the boats staging interactive tours, wildlife spotting and storytelling trips for Bristolians.

          "headline": "China housing market slumps again as another developer runs into trouble ",
          "bodyText": "China’s giant housing market has continued to decline in the past month and another major developer showed signs of financial distress as state-owned enterprises began carving up the carcass of the failing property giant Evergrande. House prices, sales, investment and construction data released on Wednesday all showed renewed signs of the crisis in the market, which accounts up to 30% of the country’s output and which appears certain to drag on the world’s second biggest economy. It comes a day after shares in one of China’s largest developers, Shimao Group, fell 20% on concerns that it was offloading assets to manage its spiralling debts. New home prices fell 0.3% month-on-month in November, the biggest decline since February 2015, according to Reuters calculations. The figure was worse than the 0.2% drop in October and only nine of 70 cities tracked by the Chinese statistics bureau saw monthly price gains in November, the fewest since February 2015. The actual value of home sales plunged by 16.31% in what was a fifth straight month of decline, official data showed. New construction starts as measured by floor area fell 21.03% on year in November, down for the eighth month, while property investment by developers fell 4.3%. “Cities of all classes are under pressure,” said Yan Yuejin, director of Shanghai-based E-house China Research and Development Institution. “The current scale of market supply is large and demand is weak. The key is to accelerate inventory de-stocking to stabilise home prices.” However, more data released on Wednesday showed that weak demand for houses was in line with other metrics across the whole Chinese economy. Real retail sales increased by just 0.5% on an annual basis – down from 1.9% in October – to give the weakest outcome since August 2020, and far below pre-Covid levels as consumers remained cautious and Covid outbreaks continued to cause snap lockdowns. Passenger traffic data suggested that people were not travelling and spending as much, and sales during the annual November 1-11 shopping festival – China’s answer to the US “Black Friday” consumer spree – slowed compared with the previous year. Industrial output picked up last month after power shortages eased from the previous months but economists said the overall picture was becoming more bleak. Gerard Burg of Westpac in Australia said there was little sign of improvement in underlying economic conditions in November and was cutting the bank’s forecast for China’s economy. “Overall, growth in industrial production was only marginally stronger, investment trends remained extremely weak and retail sales data point to minimal consumption growth,” he said. China unveiled a package of measures earlier this month in order to bolster the struggling economy, including freeing up banks to lend more money to targeted businesses. Many economists expect the central bank to reduce the main interest rate from its current 3.85% – very high compared with every major western economy – and more fiscal measures to boost economic activity are also seen as likely in the new year. However, the crisis engulfing the property market looms over the economy in the wake of the default last week of China Evergrande, once the country’s second-biggest property developer. It finally succumbed to its $300bn debt mountain when it failed to come up with $82m owed to offshore creditors, and analysts have said a huge restructuring effort is now underway. Reports on Wednesday said that a working party sent by the government to Guangdong, Evergrande’s home province, had arrived at the company’s headquarters in order to start work on carving up the once-all conquering empire built by former steel executive Xu Jiayin. The working party comprises of representatives of state-owned monoliths such as Guangdong Holdings and the government-owned investment bank, China Cinda Asset Management. But while the state seems set to absorb Evergrande’s debts and to carry out the huge task of delivering around 1.6m as-yet unfinished homes to buyers who have already paid upfront for the properties, the developers that were previously thought secure are running into financial trouble. Shares in Shimao Group, which was one of China’s top-10 developers last year and investment grade-rated until a month ago, fell a record 20% on Tuesday after it sold assets between different parts of the company and cancelled apartment sales. Its bonds also fell in price and yields rocketed in a reflection of the risk to investors of lending money to the company. A Bloomberg index of property developer stocks in China fell to its lowest since early 2017, and Evergrande’s shares dropped almost 10% to a record low. A report by S&amp;P warned in November that up to one-third of Chinese developers could experience financial distress in the next 12 months because of the weak deamnd for housing and the crackdown by Xi Jinping’s government on what it regards as the industry’s reckless “borrow and build” model."

          "bodyText": "Top story: Starmer denounces ‘worst possible leader’ Hello this Wednesday – I’m Warren Murray, welcome to your briefing. Boris Johnson has suffered a humiliating rebellion over measures to slow the spread of the Omicron variant, with 99 Conservative MPs rejecting plans for vaccine certificates. It underlines the PM’s increasingly shaky grip over his party after the damaging Owen Paterson affair and revelations about lockdown-busting parties in Downing Street. The measure passed by 369 votes to 126 but only with the backing of Labour, whose leader, Keir Starmer, called Johnson the “worst possible leader at the worst possible time”. Given the rebellion, Starmer said, “the prime minister needs to ask himself the question whether he has the authority to lead this country through this pandemic”. Votes on all four plan B measures for England passed on Tuesday night. MPs also voted to make vaccinations compulsory for NHS workers, with 61 Conservative MPs voting against, joined by 22 Labour MPs. A plan to replace self-isolation with daily testing for contacts of people testing positive for the Omicron variant passed without a division. Britain’s wave of Omicron infections could reach 1m a day by the end of December, the government’s most senior public health adviser, Dr Susan Hopkins, has warned amid growing calls to limit Christmas gatherings. In Scotland, families have already been warned not to socialise in groups of more than three households in the run-up to Christmas. Ministers are being warned that soaring Covid cases could cause major shortages across industry, hospitality and healthcare, as rail companies cancelled services and Royal Mail said it was experiencing high staff absences. From healthcare to hospitality, these are the areas of work and life that could face a pingdemic-style problem, writes Jessica Elgot. * * * Bailey caught on camera – Shaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate for London mayor, has stood down from an official role in the London assembly after a photograph emerged of him joining a throng of people for a “raucous” party amid the Covid lockdown in December last year. Bailey’s team had sought to present blame for the party as being with Conservative campaign headquarters (CCHQ) staff, saying that he had only attended briefly. Bailey has not commented since the reports emerged. The Mirror on Tuesday also reported that prior to a Downing Street quiz party hosted by Johnson last December, an email was sent to staff that told them to leave the building via a back entrance once it was over. No 10 has argued the quiz was virtual, with staff who were in the office attending from their desks. * * * Midweek catch-up &gt; The Grammy-winning singer Billie Eilish has told how starting to watch pornography at age 11 “really destroyed my brain … I think porn is a disgrace”. Eilish said she suffered nightmares because of the sometimes violent and abusive content. Eilish said she is now angry at herself for thinking it was OK. “The first few times I, you know, had sex, I was not saying no to things that were not good. It was because I thought that’s what I was supposed to be attracted to.” &gt; The biggest taxi firm in Paris said it was suspending the use of Model 3 Teslas after a crash that killed one person and injured 20 others including three people who were left in intensive care. &gt; A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump’s latest effort to hide his tax returns from Congress, ruling that its legislative interest outweighs any deference Trump should receive as a former president. &gt; Amazon’s plastic packaging waste soared by almost a third to 270,000 tonnes during 2020, according the marine conservation group Oceana. Amazon says that calculation is flawed and it is making “rapid progress” cutting back on single-use plastics. &gt; The Parker space probe has officially “touched” the sun, plunging through the unexplored solar atmosphere known as the corona, Nasa has announced. It happened in April but confirming all the data has taken since then. * * * Reach deeper, rich told – Britain’s highest earners have been donating less to charity despite their soaring incomes, while donations from everyone else have risen, according to a probe of tax records. Charities have missed out on more than £2bn as a result of the widening “generosity gap”. Last year 1.6 million fewer people donated as thousands of fundraising events from fun runs to gala dinners were cancelled. Gus O’Donnell, the former cabinet secretary who led the research by the Law Family Commission on Civil Society, urged the wealthy to “think about what you could be spending your money on this Christmas … those with the deepest pockets can afford to reach a little further”. If the rich increased their donations to 1% of income, charities could be getting an extra £1.4bn in annual donations, the commission found. * * * The little-lauded cheeses – Medieval monks’ cheese like rollright and pre-second world war wensleydales should take the place of brie and gorgonzola on our Christmas dining tables this year, according to English Heritage. The supply chain meltdown and impact of Brexit on festive demands points to cheeses originating outside the UK being in short supply. Dr Michael Carter, an English Heritage historian and turophile, said a historical English cheeseboard would inspire people to continue ancient traditions and keep history alive. Today in Focus podcast: To mandate or not? In Australia, where employment-related mandates on the coronavirus vaccine were introduced months ago, the stories of two women demonstrate how such measures can work – and how they can backfire. Nicola Davis reports on the considerations governments must make when introducing vaccine mandates. Lunchtime read: The crown prince’s gambit Beaming in satisfaction, Mohammed bin Salman looked like a man in charge as Arab rulers arrived in Riyadh on Tuesday for a regional summit, Martin Chulov writes. With King Salman barely seen for 20 months, the crown prince is holding the reins of power in Saudi Arabia. The king is known to suffer from a slow onset form of vascular dementia, and whether his quasi-exile in the new age city of Neom is of his own volition is speculated upon inside the kingdom and around the Gulf. Meanwhile the prince has consolidated his power, ramped up reforms and sought to restore the kingdom’s standing after the grisly Saudi assassination of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. “He has cleared his path to the coronation,” said a former US intelligence official of the crown prince. “Covid or not, no one can deny that the king is not just missing in action, but likely out of business.” Sport Joe Root has told his England players that their harrowing experience in Brisbane is as tough as it gets, leaving “no excuses” as they head into their must-win second Test against Australia in Adelaide. Kevin De Bruyne called the shots in Manchester City’s 7-0 rout of Leeds that stretched their lead at the top of the Premier League to four points, while Marcelo Bielsa offered no excuses for the joint heaviest defeat in his club’s 102-year history. At Carrow Road, Jacob Ramsey’s superb individual goal and a late Ollie Watkins tap-in clinched a 2-0 win for Aston Villa over struggling Norwich. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has been stripped of Arsenal’s captaincy and dropped from the squad after failing to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club, according to Mikel Arteta. The Premier League’s clubs have agreed to introduce daily Covid testing for players and training‑ground staff as they fight to prevent the postponement of further games and, in the worst-case scenario, a break in the competition. Valtteri Bottas believes Lewis Hamilton deserved to be crowned Formula One world champion and was “gutted” his Mercedes teammate was pipped to the title by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen. After restrictions at Alexandra Palace in 2020, defending champion Gerwyn Price could face Fallon Sherrock in a tough PDC darts draw. Bryony Frost has revealed she considered relocating to France in her first interview since an independent panel of the British Horseracing Authority ruled she had been bullied and harassed by fellow rider Robbie Dunne. And Magnus Carlsen says he is ready to shock the chess world by giving up his world championship title – because defending it no longer motivates him. Business The deputy governor of the Bank of England has said that bitcoin could be “worthless” and people investing in the digital currency should be prepared to lose everything. Although bitcoin has risen in value to almost $50,000, it suffers from large swings and Sir Jon Cunliffe said: “Their price can vary quite considerably and [bitcoins] could theoretically or practically drop to zero.” The money in your non-digital wallet is flat at $1.324 and €1.175 today, however, and the FTSE100 also looks like opening level today. The papers Most front pages take a decidedly critical tone and raise questions about the future of Boris Johnson’s leadership after nearly a third of MPs voted against mandatory Covid passes as the UK battles a surge in Covid cases. The Times splashes with “Huge Covid rebellion stuns PM” while the Guardian suggests the scale of the Tory revolt “raises questions” over whether Johnson will in fact implement tougher restrictions in the coming days. The Telegraph rates it a “hammer blow to Johnson’s authority”. The Daily Mirror has a photo of 24 Tory aides at a Christmas party last December. The headline reads: “Boris bashed by 99 rebels as Tory quits over THIS party pic”. The Daily Express notes the revolt “bruises Boris” but asks whether he will be “proved right” over the need to introduce the latest Covid restrictions. The Financial Times has “Johnson suffers biggest setback of premiership in ‘plan B’ rebellion”. The Daily Mail points to an inside spread with the strapline: “98 Tory rebels: no more curbs, Boris”. The Sun carries a mention of it all – “Politicians lose heads over Covid” – but focuses on the Queen hosting Christmas dinner this year.

          "headline": "Amazon’s plastic waste soars by a third during pandemic, Oceana report finds",
          "bodyText": "Amazon’s plastic packaging waste soared by almost a third, to 270,000 tonnes, during the pandemic last year, according to a report from marine conservation group Oceana. Oceana estimates up to 10,700 tonnes of this plastic, including air pillows, bubble wrap and plastic-lined paper envelopes, equivalent to a delivery van’s worth every 67 minutes, is likely to end up in the sea. Amazon, the western world’s largest retailer, rejected Oceana’s figures and said it had overestimated the plastic waste by 300%. It also questioned the model used to estimate the percentage likely to enter the sea. It did not provide alternative figures. The retailer saw a boom in sales of 38%, to $386bn (£290bn) in 2020, when much of the world was in lockdown and online sales increased. Oceana’s report challenges the company’s recycling pledges, using interviews with local municipal waste officials, stores linked to by Amazon’s Second Chance recycling website and surveys of Amazon Prime customers. It concluded that the company’s recycling efforts “will not significantly reduce its enormous (and growing) plastic footprint”. Matt Littlejohn, Oceana’s senior vice-president, said: “We are using the best data available to us. If Amazon was transparent, we would gladly use their data. Yes, they are using more non-plastic packaging, but they are also selling a ton more product. “We understand people need Amazon. And so we’re hoping Amazon can fix this problem and become a leader in reducing plastic, which is really important for the oceans.” Plastic film used by Amazon in its packaging has little or no value to the recycling market and is not generally accepted by municipal recycling schemes in the US, UK and Canada, the report said. Oceana found that nearly 75% of Amazon Prime customers surveyed in 25 cities in the UK and US sent the plastic, knowingly or not, to landfill. Almost 40% put it in recycling bins, where the presence of plastic film would result in it going to the dump, and 35% disposed of the plastic in the bin. A little under 20% of 1,400 customers said they reused the plastic, while 5% said they placed the packaging in drop-off bins in stores on Amazon’s customer-driven recycling programme on the company’s Second Chance website. Further, representatives at more than 40% of the stores that Amazon suggests as alternative recycling drop-offs for plastic film told secret shoppers that Amazon’s plastic film was not accepted. Only 9% of all plastic waste has ever been recycled. Almost all goes to landfill, is burned, or enters and pollutes the environment, including waterways and oceans. Rachel Johnson Greer, a former programme manager at Amazon, who worked for the company for eight years, said the company would only take action on plastics if governments or a majority of customers demanded it. In May, more than a third of Amazon shareholders voted for a resolution calling on it to quantify its single-use plastic and provide recommendations on how to reduce its plastic footprint by the end of the year. Oceana has highlighted the action taken by the retailer in India, where it has eliminated single-use plastic packaging by using paper alternatives, after India’s prime minister, Narendra Modi, and its central government pledged to ban single-use plastics by 2022. The ban was delayed, but a tribunal ruled that packaging was the responsibility of producers, importers and brand owners. Amazon also announced it would move away from single-use plastic packaging in Germany. “If the company can do this in India and Germany, they can move away from single-use plastic packaging on a worldwide basis,” Littlejohn said. An Amazon spokesperson said: “Amazon shares Oceana’s ambition to protect the world’s oceans and respects their work but, for a second year, their calculations are seriously flawed. They have overestimated our plastics usage by more than 300%, and use outdated assumptions about the sources of plastic waste entering our oceans.” “Amazon is making rapid progress in reducing or removing single-use plastics from packaging materials in the UK and around the world.” Among its initiatives to reduce plastic waste, Amazon is looking to double fully recyclable cushioned plastic in North America, replace single-use pillows in Australia with fully recyclable paper ones, and expand its packaging-free initiative to 100 cities across India, it said."

          "headline": "Expect mass staff absences and major shortages, UK ministers told",
          "bodyText": "Soaring Covid cases could cause major shortages across industry, hospitality and healthcare, ministers have been told, as rail companies cancelled services and Royal Mail said it was experiencing high staff absences. According to cabinet sources, Boris Johnson and England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said at a briefing that rising cases would be likely to affect businesses with mass worker absences. Whitty also told ministers to expect a “significant increase” in hospital admissions. West End shows have been cancelled because of the surge in suspected Omicron cases, while waste collections, deliveries and schools are all under threat from shortages. No 10 emphasised there had not been “any discussion or any warning about hospitals or clinical settings having to close as a result of this variant”. Johnson’s spokesperson said public services should be able to continue to operate without disruption. “We have strong measures in place and robust, and now tested, procedures to ensure they can continue.” Asked if modelling had been done on the impact on staffing essential services, he said: “I think given the lack of hard data on things like severity, transmissibility and its impact on different vaccines and boosters etc, I think that would be hard to model.” The leader of Britain’s A&amp;E doctors said on Tuesday that Omicron could lead to high numbers of hospital staff having to take time off ill just as the NHS was grappling with winter pressures. “The biggest challenge to staff at the moment is going to be the numbers going off sick,” said Dr Katherine Henderson, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. “I was on a shift yesterday and during my day shift four doctors went off Covid-positive,” she told an all-party parliamentary group coronavirus evidence session. Elaine Thorpe, a matron in the intensive care unit at University College London hospitals NHS trust, said: “We’ve got a lot of staff really going down with Covid and that’s really impacting the number of nurses, doctors, admin staff – everyone behind the scenes. It’s not just the staff who work in the coalface in A&amp;E and critical care. It’s throughout the NHS that’s really going to be impacted on this and we’re really worried.” The Guardian understands about 100 Tube drivers are on Covid-related absences. ScotRail and West Midlands said there had been an increase in Covid cases among its train crews, while ScotRail axed services because of an outbreak among staff. Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the TSSA union, representing transport workers, said furlough should be urgently reintroduced and that essential transport services were under threat. “We know that Omicron has a higher attack rate than any previous variant of Covid-19. It will soon be the dominant form across Britain, putting essential services at risk, and straining our NHS,” he said. “In Scotland, hundreds of ScotRail trains have been cancelled due to illness. We need to take action now to break the chains of transmission.” Essential services could also come under pressure similar to the summer’s “pingdemic”, which forced millions of people to self-isolate. Greenwich council in south London has told residents that staff shortages will cause disruption to waste collection this week. The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, urged more support for businesses as it emerged there was a 25% increase in Christmas booking cancellations, in part by sick or wary customers. The trade body UK Hospitality has forecast that takings will be down by as much as 40% for December, usually the most lucrative month for venues. Increasing numbers of teachers are absent because of Covid, according to the latest Department for Education data, with 2.4% off across all state schools in England, compared with 2% two weeks before. Most of those were from primary schools, with one in 30 primary pupils in England absent from the classroom last week for Covid-related reasons."

General practitioners and pharmacies are reporting a sudden increase in demand for vaccines, after federal health advice changed to allow boosters five months after the second primary dose. Representatives of the aged care sector said the rollout for residents and staff was improved from earlier this year, with more than 1,000 booster clinics conducted in aged care facilities already. But rollout problems are emerging in other areas. Some GPs caught off guard by the weekend’s announcement said they were left without enough supply to meet demand. Demand on pharmacies also increased suddenly and significantly. The Australian Medical Association said it was “extremely concerned” at the lack of support for both GPs and pharmacists, and warned the booster rollout was already falling behind. AMA president Dr Omar Khorshid also warned against scaling back state and territory vaccination hubs. “Whilst we recognise that the state and territory vaccination hubs have taken nurses out of hospitals, aged care, and other health settings, it is critical that state and territory governments continue to run these clinics to ensure adequate access to vaccines for Australians needing their booster shot,” he said. Figures from the Pharmacy Guild of Australia show in the week leading up to the announcement, just under 20,000 vaccinations a day were delivered. On Tuesday, that figure rose to 40,000. At the same time, the guild has warned that vastly fewer pharmacies will be participating in the rollout of boosters, down from 3,400 pharmacies in the initial rollout to 1,900, due to the government’s low level of remuneration. Victorian branch president, Anthony Tassone, said the rate of $16 per booster dose was seen as “not sufficient to cover the true costs of delivery of the program”. Access issues are particularly pronounced in rural areas. Megan Belot, the president of Rural Doctors Association of Australia, said the access to booster shots for rural patients has been disappointing. “We are hearing stories that some state vaccination hubs in regional and rural areas are not getting access to the booster shot in a timely manner,” Belot said. She said the issue was especially concerning for rural and remote frontline healthcare professionals, because booster shots are vital to avoid hospitalisation and putting increased strain on an already burdened system. Belot said there was strain on rural and remote hospitals at the best of times even before the Covid-19 pandemic and that many rural and regional hospitals did not have intensive care units to treat severe Covid-19 cases. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Rebecca McGowan, a rural GP in Albury, says organising booster shots for her patients has been a “shambles.” She said for GPs to only find out on a Sunday evening, at the same time as the public, that booster shots would be pushed forward meant that by Monday morning she was inundated with calls from patients asking to be booked in. McGowan has had difficulty securing booster shot appointments for her patients, because she has had to prove that she has appointments booked for a full clinic two weeks in advance of being able to secure the supply. “We keep being told GPs are partners, but we’re not being treated as equal partners, but more like an afterthought,” McGowan said. She said there was added pressure for rural GPs because of the difficulty of staffing the clinics, especially as the booster shot program will now be running alongside vaccinating children. GPs like McGowan in the Albury-Wodonga area also face the challenge of having patients who straddle two states. Belot said another problem was programs that attempt to vaccinate remote populations in a two-day period often don’t accommodate those who are occupied with farming activities and can’t fit into the allocated window. In Melbourne, Prof Mark Stoove from the Burnet Institute warned of a slower take-up in lower socioeconomic areas if the booster program was again run through pharmacies and GPs. Until October, when there was a targeted campaign from state and local governments, Melbourne’s vaccine rollout ran along socioeconomic lines, with age, disadvantage and access to GPs mixing to create a perfect Covid cocktail. In August, Delta was rapidly spreading through Melbourne’s northern suburbs as some of the state’s lowest socioeconomic LGAs lagged on vaccination rates. “There will still be issues concerning the availability, according to the distribution of GPs and pharmacies,” Stoove said. “Certain areas have a lower density of GPs and pharmacies, so if the booster rollout primarily occurs through those avenues we will come across those problems.” In August the LGA of Hume had one of the lowest vaccination rates and highest daily case numbers. One of the key reasons was the low number of GP clinics per population. As vaccination rates caught up, the state has peeled back its hubs in the area, but councillor Joseph Haweil, who was mayor during the outbreak, says the community can’t rely on a GP-driven model. “Just how little supply and support there was through the GP system, I’m worried that is replicated again,” Haweil said. “I don’t think we can afford to have that happen again.” Cohealth is a not-for-profit on the frontline of the vaccine rollout in Victoria. It targets communities that have access issues and in the last six months, they’ve set up vaccination pop-up clinics in more than 50 separate locations. Cohealth’s community engagement manager Emit Taylor said it was too early to tell what barriers would have to be addressed with the booster rollout. “We’re still not quite in booster town,” Taylor, who uses they/them pronouns said. “We’re not quite sure what the hesitations will be.” Cohealth is tailoring its approach to each community, making sure language and access barriers are broken down. Taylor said there was a lot of work done to make strong community connections before the service will set up a pop-up – which will be essential when the need for boosters becomes more prominent."

          "headline": "‘A terrible tragedy’: US passes 800,000 Covid deaths – highest in the world",
          "bodyText": "The US death toll from Covid-19 has passed 800,000, a once-unimaginable figure seen as doubly tragic given that more than 200,000 of those lives were lost after vaccines became available last spring. The figure represents the highest reported toll of any country in the world, and is likely even higher. The US accounts for approximately 4% of the world’s population but about 15% of the 5.3 million known deaths from the coronavirus since the outbreak began in China two years ago. The grim milestone comes as the world braces for rise in cases of the new Omicron variant, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning it was spreading at an unprecedented rate. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters on Tuesday the variant had been detected in 77 countries and was probably present in most countries worldwide. Omicron, first detected by South Africa and reported to the WHO on 24 November, has a large number of mutations, which has concerned scientists. The new variant is posing a fresh threat as it gains a foothold in the US, though experts are not yet sure how dangerous it is. The number of Covid deaths in the US, compiled and released by Johns Hopkins University on Tuesday, is about equal to the population of Atlanta and St Louis combined, or Minneapolis and Cleveland put together. It is roughly equivalent to how many Americans die each year from heart disease or stroke. A closely watched forecasting model from the University of Washington projects a total of over 880,000 reported deaths in the US by 1 March. The deadly milestone comes as cases and hospitalisations are on the rise again in the US, a spike driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, which arrived in the first half of 2021 and now accounts for nearly all infections. Health experts lament that many of the deaths in the US were especially heartbreaking because the widely available and effective vaccines made them preventable. About 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, or just over 60% of the population. That is well short of what scientists say is needed to keep the virus in check. “Almost all the people dying are now dying preventable deaths,” said Dr Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And that’s because they’re not immunized.” When the vaccine was first rolled out, the country’s death toll stood at about 300,000. It hit 600,000 in mid-June and 700,000 on 1 October. Beyrer recalled that in March or April 2020, one of the worst-case scenarios projected upwards of 240,000 American deaths. “And I saw that number, and I thought that is incredible – 240,000 American deaths?” he said. “And we’re now past three times that number.” He added: “And I think it’s fair to say that we’re still not out of the woods.”"

          "bodyText": "The House is considering a measure to refer Mark Meadows to the justice department for potential contempt charges. The vote comes one week after Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, ended his cooperation with the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. The records that Meadows turned over to the committee before ending his cooperation include text messages from Fox News hosts and Donald Trump Jr on 6 January. In the messages, the Trump allies urge Meadows and the president to take action to end the insurrection. In one message, Trump’s eldest son told the chief of staff, “We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.” The attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, has announced that his office is suing the far right groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers “for conspiring to terrorize the District” in relation to the Capitol insurrection. The lawsuit refers to the Capitol attack as a “coordinated act of domestic terrorism”. Jim McGovern, the Democratic chair of the House rules committee, warned of potential future coups if investigators are not able to uncover all the details of 6 January. “Coups very rarely succeed the first go-around, but they oftentimes do the second time around,” McGovern said during a hearing on the contempt resolution. “If there’s ever a moment to be above politics, it’s now.” The Senate voted to raise the debt ceiling by $2.5tn. The vote occurred via a bipartisan deal that allowed Democrats to approve the measure and Republicans to oppose it in a divided legislature. With the House expected to pass the measure as well, lawmakers will have put off a potential default until after the next election. A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump’s latest effort to hide his tax returns from the House Ways and Means committee.“This ruling is no surprise, the law is clearly on the committee’s side. I am pleased that we’re now one step closer to being able to conduct more thorough oversight of the IRS’s mandatory presidential audit program,” said Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, in a statement. The Covid-19 death toll in the US has surpassed 800,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. It is the highest reported toll of any country. The actual death toll is likely even higher both in the US and around the world. The AP reports: A closely watched forecasting model from the University of Washington projects a total of over 880,000 reported deaths in the U.S. by March 1. Health experts lament that many of the deaths in the United States were especially heartbreaking because they were preventable by way of the vaccine, which became available in mid-December a year ago and was thrown open to all adults by mid-April of this year. About 200 million Americans are fully vaccinated, or just over 60% of the population. That is well short of what scientists say is needed to keep the virus in check. “Almost all the people dying are now dying preventable deaths,” said Dr. Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “And that’s because they’re not immunized. And you know that, God, it’s a terrible tragedy.” When the vaccine was first rolled out, the country’s death toll stood at about 300,000. It hit 600,000 in mid-June and 700,000 on Oct. 1.

I am pleased that we’re now one step closer to being able to conduct more thorough oversight of the IRS’s mandatory presidential audit program,” said Richard Neal, House Ways and Means committee chair, in a statement. Trevor McFadden, a federal district court judge, dismissed the case saying that Trump, who has claimed executive privilege shields him from requests from House Democrats to review his returns, does not have a case. “Even the special solicitude accorded former presidents does not alter the outcome,” McFadden wrote. Trump can still appeal the case. Guardian staff and agencies: Former New York governor Andrew Cuomo has been ordered to give up about $5.1m in earnings from a book deal about his response to the coronavirus pandemic, after he was found to have contravened ethics laws by using state resources to write the book. Cuomo was directed to turn over proceeds earned from American Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic within 30 days under a resolution approved 12-1 by the Joint Commission on Public Ethics (JCOPE), according to multiple media reports. An attorney for Cuomo immediately called the action unconstitutional and promised a fight. The order came a month after the commission voted to rescind the ethics approval it had given Cuomo before he entered into the $5.1m book deal. American Crisis was published in October 2020, months before Cuomo resigned amid findings he sexually harassed 11 women. The staff of the commission granted approval of the deal in July 2020, when his counsel told the commission that Cuomo agreed to not use any state personnel or resources to produce his book and that he would write it “entirely on his own time”. But complaints later surfaced that state property, resources and personnel were used to prepare, write, edit and publish the book.

With the House expected to pass the measure as well, lawmakers will have put off a potential default until after the next election. The country was at the edge of a catastrophic default several times this year, with lawmakers repeatedly clashing over efforts to suspend the borrowing cap. Republicans demanded that Democrats slash spending on social programs in exchange for support in suspending or increasing the debt ceiling. The current resolutions come after the leaders of both parties reached a deal to adjust Senate rules so that just this once, Democrats could address the debt ceiling issue with a simple majority vote, and Republicans could all cast their votes against it. Peter Stone in Washington: A powerful network of conservative election lawyers and groups with links to Donald Trump have spent millions of dollars promoting new and onerous voting laws that many battleground states such as Georgia and Texas have enacted. The moves have prompted election and voting rights watchdogs in the US to warn about the suppression of non-white voters aimed at providing Republicans an edge in coming elections. The lawyers and groups spearheading self-professed election integrity measures include some figures who pushed Trump’s baseless claims of fraud after the 2020 election. Key advocates include Cleta Mitchell with the Conservative Partnership institute; J Christian Adams of the Public Interest Legal Foundation; Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation; Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project; and J Kenneth Blackwell with the America First Policy Institute. These conservative outfits tout their goal as curbing significant voter fraud, despite the fact that numerous courts, the vast majority of voting experts and even former top Trump officials, such as ex-attorney general Bill Barr, concluded the 2020 elections were without serious problems. Watchdogs say that tightening state voting laws endanger the rights of Black voters and other communities of color who historically back Democrats by creating new rules limiting absentee voting and same day registration, while imposing other voting curbs. Among the election lawyers and groups advocating tougher voting laws, Mitchell, a veteran conservative lawyer , boasts the highest profile and has sparked the most scrutiny. She took part in the 2 January call where Trump prodded Georgia’s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to “find” about 11,780 votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory there. After details emerged about Mitchell’s role on the call, Foley &amp; Lardner, where she had worked for nearly 20 years, mounted an internal review, and she resigned.

Here’s where the day stands so far: The House is now debating the measure to refer Mark Meadows to the justice department for potential contempt charges. The vote comes one week after Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, ended his cooperation with the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. The records that Meadows turned over to the committee before ending his cooperation include text messages from Fox News hosts and Donald Trump Jr on 6 January.

Jim McGovern, the Democratic chair of the House rules committee, warned of potential future coups if investigators are not able to uncover all the details of 6 January. “Coups very rarely succeed the first go-around, but they oftentimes do the second time around,” McGovern said during a hearing on the contempt resolution. “If there’s ever a moment to be above politics, it’s now.” Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, argued that Mark Meadows’ refusal to cooperate with the panel forced investigators to advance this contempt resolution. Meadows’ refusal to testify about the records he has already turned over to the committee amounts to not just obstruction but also an “attack on the rule of law,” Thompson said at the start of the floor debate over the measure. “It’s regrettable that we are back to the floor considering another criminal contempt referral, but our former colleague, Mr Meadows, has left us no choice,” the Democratic congressman said. “The select committee is investigating an attack on our democracy, and it’s essential that witnesses cooperate with our investigation to get answers.” The House is now beginning one hour of debate on the measure to refer Mark Meadows to the justice department for potential contempt charges. The House will then debate two other proposals before moving on to the full-chamber vote on the Meadows contempt resolution. The vote on the contempt resolution is still expected to start in about an hour and a half, so stay tuned. A pill manufactured by the prominent Covid-19 vaccine provider Pfizer is highly effective in protecting against severe disease from coronavirus, the company said on Tuesday. The experimental antiviral pill Paxlovid is also effective against the Omicron variant that is spreading rapidly across the world, the company announced, citing laboratory testing. In clinical trials, Paxlovid showed almost 90% efficacy in preventing hospitalization and death in high-risk patients, Pfizer stated, replicating the results of a smaller-scale trial announced last month. Those results prompted the company to seek authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the pill to become the first widely available oral medicine to combat coronavirus. Regulators in the UK last month approved the twice-daily pill Molnupiravir, manufactured by Merck/Ridgeback, for use in elderly and at-risk patients, but its approval has stalled in the US amid safety concerns. Pfizer hopes that Tuesday’s announcement will bolster its case with the FDA, allowing for an early US approval and infected Americans having access to the pill by early next year. Programming note: the House is expected to vote later today on the motion to refer Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, to the justice department for potential contempt charges. According to the latest update from House majority leader Steny Hoyer’s office, the chamber will likely start voting at about 6 pm ET, roughly two hours from now. If the House passes the contempt resolution, the justice department will need to determine whether to prosecute Meadows over the matter. A federal grand jury has already indicted another Trump ally, Steve Bannon, for defying a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. Rev. William Barber II, the prominent North Carolina civil rights leader, accused Senator Joe Manchin of committing “political policy violence” on Tuesday over his blockade of voting rights and infrastructure legislation in the US senate. Barber made the comments as he led a demonstration outside of Manchin’s Washington, DC office with several activists, including some who traveled from West Virginia, demanding a meeting with the senator. The group was denied entry into the office building and wound up leaving signs and 10,000 petitions at the building’s entrance. In fiery remarks, Barber accused Manchin of lying to John Lewis, the civil rights icon who died last year. Manchin, Barber said, had told Lewis he supported two sweeping pieces of voting rights legislation. But Manchin’s support for the filibuster, the senate rule that requires 60 votes to advance legislation, has blocked Democrats from passing either bill. “His delay on voting rights is allowing a political coup d’etat to sweep through our state legislatures,” Barber said. He added Manchin’s actions were directly harming the nation’s poor and most vulnerable communities. The meeting came on the same day Manchin was reportedly meeting with a small group of Democratic senators to try and see if there was a path forward on the filibuster. Barber has been among several activists who have been arrested in Washington recently as they push for voting rights legislation. Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell was asked about the texts that Mark Meadows received from Republican lawmakers as the Capitol insurrection unfolded on January 6. The Republican leader told reporters on Capitol Hill that he was not in contact with Donald Trump’s chief of staff on the day of the insurrection. McConnell also expressed interest in the findings of the House select committee investigating the insurrection, saying, “We’re all watching, as you are, what is unfolding on the House side, and it will be interesting to reveal all the participants who were involved.” It is worth noting that Senate Republicans blocked the bill to create a 9/11-style commission to investigate the insurrection earlier this year. One reporter asked Jen Psaki how Joe Biden plans to mark the one-year anniversary of the Capitol insurrection, which will occur in three weeks on January 6. Psaki said she did not have any specific plans to share about the president honoring the day of the Capitol insurrection, which she described as “one of the darkest days in our democracy”. But the White House press secretary added, “I think there’s no question you’ll see us commemorate that day.” Jen Psaki was asked about the revelation that Republican lawmakers and multiple Fox News hosts sent texts to Mark Meadows on January 6, urging Donald Trump’s chief of staff to take action to end the Capitol insurrection. “It’s disappointing, and unfortunately not surprising, that some of the very same individuals who were willing to warn, condemn and express horror over what happened on January 6 in private were totally silent in public or, even worse, were spreading lies and conspiracy theories and continue to since that time,” the White House press secretary said. Psaki added, “Unfortunately we’ve seen a trend from some of the same individuals.” The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection held a hearing yesterday to vote on a recommendation that Meadows be held in criminal contempt for defying the panel’s subpoena. At the hearing, Liz Cheney, the Republican vice-chair of the committee, read some of the texts that Meadows received on January 6 as the insurrection unfolded. The texts were included in the documents that Meadows turned over to the committee before ending his cooperation with investigators. In one text, Fox News host Laura Ingraham said, “Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.” In another, Donald Trump Jr told the chief of staff, “We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.” This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over the blog from Joanna Walters. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, is now holding her daily briefing, and she was asked about Joe Biden’s meeting with centrist Senator Joe Manchin yesterday to discuss the Build Back Better Act. The press secretary said the negotiations overs the $1.75tn spending package continue, but Democrats are “not quite there yet” to get the bill passed. Democratic leaders have been pushing to pass the final bill before the end of the year to ensure families can receive checks from the expanded child tax credit program next month, but it’s unclear whether they will be able to meet that deadline. It’s been a busy morning in political news in Washington and there’s more to come. Reverend William Barber of the Poor People’s Campaign led a press conference a little earlier and we’ll bring you the highlights of that shortly. Please stay tuned. Meanwhile, here’s where things stand so far: The lawsuit filed in federal court in Washington, by the office of the attorney general of the District of Columbia, calls the Capitol attack by Trump fanatics trying to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s election victory a “coordinated act of domestic terrorism”. The attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, has announced that his office is suing the far right groups the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers “for conspiring to terrorize the District” in relation to the insurrection by extremist Donald Trump supporters at the US Capitol on January 6 this year. Jim McGovern, the Democratic chair of the House rules committee, warned of potential future coups if the right wing are allowed to continue to downplay and hide the truth of the attempt to stop the peaceful transition of power from Trump to Biden. The House rules committee met to take up the special House panel’s resolution calling for Trump’s White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to be held in criminal contempt for defying a subpoena from those investigating the Capitol insurrection. The lawsuit from the DC attorney general’s office against the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers hard right groups came as the House rules committee had been discussing this morning the “frantic” texts sent by Republican lawmakers and Fox News star punditry hosts while the Capitol insurrection was underway on January 6. These came up in the closed-door meeting of the special House panel last night over whether to recommend that then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows should be criminally charged with contempt of Congress for halting his cooperation with the panel’s investigation into the Capitol attack. Congressman Jamie Raskin read some of them out at the rules committee public hearing this morning, recounting how certain Republican lawmakers, Fox hosts and even Donald Trump’s eldest son, Don Trump Jr, contacted Meadows begging him to get the-then president to take decisive action to call on the insurrectionists to cease their riot and invasion. It’s not clear why Don didn’t call his dad directly, nor did Sean Hannity, who has talked to Trump on the phone probably hundreds of times at this point. Raskin cites the texts referring to: “GOP lawmakers and others sending frantic messages, saying ‘we are under siege...Mark, protesters are literally storming the Capitol, breaking windows...our doors, is Trump going to do something?” Raskin says: “Donald Trump Jr - ‘he’s got to condemn this...’ excrement [Jr wrote shit, not excrement, but Raskin is being polite on Capitol Hill] ‘asap. The Capitol Police tweet is not enough.’ Jr saying ‘we need an Oval Office address’.” To go back a little way, prior to today’s lawsuit by the attorney general of the District of Columbia, the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack just last month issued subpoenas to the leaders of the far-right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups, with its investigation directly focusing for the first time on the instigators of the violence at the 6 January insurrection. The chair of the select committee, Bennie Thompson, the Democratic representative from Mississippi, said in a statement those subpoenas reflected the panel’s interest in uncovering possible connections between the paramilitary groups, efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election and the Capitol attack, Hugo Lowell reported at the time. And going a bit further back, in looking at how these groups are powerfully driven by white supremacist beliefs, the Guardian’s Lois Beckett drew a line from January 6 to the groups at the far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017 that tried to stop the removal of the statue of Confederate General Robert E Lee (which stayed up until July this year), chanted racist slogans and violently attacked anti-racism protesters and liberal activists. As she wrote on January 8: The playbook for the Maga [the Make America Great Again Trump campaign slogan] invasion of the nation’s Capitol building has been developing for years in plain sight, at far-right rallies in cities like Charlottesville, Berkeley and Portland, and then, in the past year, at state capitols across the country, where heavily armed white protesters have forced their way into legislative chambers to accuse politicians of tyranny and treason. “No one should be surprised,” said Sarah Anthony to the Guardian back in January, a Black state lawmaker who was on the legislative floor in Michigan’s Capitol on 30 April 2020, when hundreds of anti-lockdown protesters, including white militia members with guns, tried to force their way inside. “This has been escalating in every corner of our country for months.” Read the report here on: From Charlottesville to the Capitol: how rightwing impunity fueled the pro-Trump mob. The DC lawsuit adds: “In the weeks leading up to the 2020 Presidential Election, the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, their leadership, and certain members and affiliates of both groups openly advertised their willingness to use violence to support their political agenda, including their efforts to reelect then-President Trump. It also reminds us of Donald Trump’s instruction from the debate podium in the fall of 2020, during the peak final months of the election campaign, that the Proud Boys should “stand by” and notes that: “During and following the debate, the Proud Boys leadership immediately took to the social media application Parler to show support for a violent response following President Trump’s statement.” The Oath Keepers group, the lawsuit notes sought to preserve Trump’s power after he lost the White House by saying: “All he has to do is call us up. We WILL answer the call” and the DC attorney general’s office pointing out that: “Based on past behavior, Oath Keepers members were willing to uphold that pledge using violence” and part of a plan of action should Joe Biden win the 2020 election would be “looking down the sights of a rifle at our fellow Americans.” “Oath Keepers publicly trumpeted the idea that members were standing ready to engage in a civil war, tweeting from the group’s account: ‘We ARE on the verge of a HOT civil war. Like in 1859. That’s where we are’,” the lawsuit states. The lawsuit filed against the far right Proud Boys and Oath Keepers groups says that as a result of those groups’ actions: The January 6th Attack on the Capitol, was not a protest or a rally. It was a coordinated act of domestic terrorism. Would-be insurgents from across the country came to the District, marched through its streets, and ultimately gathered at the United States Capitol, ready and eager to carry out a violent attack on the lawful operation of government. Then, as the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, their leadership, and certain of their members and affiliates had planned, Defendants and others rioted, broke through police barricades, and physically forced their way into the Capitol. In doing so, they threatened, assaulted, and injured those who tried to stop them, including officers of the District’s Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), and incited terror among those inside and around the building, including members of Congress who were discharging the official duties of their offices. In the wake of this assault, the Capitol was left in shambles, with the District left to deal with the aftermath of the violent disruption to what should have been the peaceful transition of presidential power. The lawsuit says Proud Boys International “is a US-based group that promotes and engages in political violence, including in service of its hate-motivated agenda”. And it describes the Oath Keepers as “a militia movement group united by baseless conspiracy theories arising from the idea that the federal government has been coopted by a nefarious group that is trying to strip United States citizens of their rights.” It further notes that: “Violence is an inextricable part of both organizations and a common link between them.” Karl Racine, the attorney general of the District of Columbia, in filing federal suit against the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, states that: “The District seeks compensatory, statutory and punitive relief and, by filing this action, intends to make clear that it will not countenance the use of violence against the District, including its police officers. The lawsuit filed in federal court moments ago lists as defendants not only the far right, white nationalist groups the Proud Boys (of Aubrey, Texas, per the suit) and Oathkeepers (of Las Vegas, Nevada), but also lists 32 individuals deemed to have associations to those groups, as well as noting there are 50 other unnamed defendants collectively referred to as “John and Jane Does 1 - 50”. Individuals include Henry “Enrique” Tarrio, a Proud Boys leader who is currently in jail in Washington, DC, for stealing a Black Lives Matter flag from a historic Black church in the city, after violently protesting against racial justice demonstrations. he was arrested on January 4 on his way to DC. The list also includes some individuals, such as Ryan Ashlock and William Chrestman, both of Kansas, who were indicted by a grand jury in February over the Capitol attack and cited by the Department of Justice as being members of the self-declared “western chauvinist” Proud Boys organization that has been declared a dangerous hate group by the federal authorities. Today’s lawsuit from DC accuses all of the defendants of conspiracy to terrorize “by planning, promoting and participating in the violent January 6, 2021 attack on the United States Capitol...with the express purpose of preventing members of Congress and then Vice President Michael Pence from discharging their official constitutional duties and declaring Joseph Biden the winner of the 2020 Presidential Election.” The attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, has announced that his office is suing the far right groups the Proud Boys and the Oathkeepers “for conspiring to terrorize the District” in relation to the insurrection by extremist Donald Trump supporters at the US Capitol on January 6 this year. The lawsuit has been filed in federal court in Washington, DC, adapts a law used after the US Civil War and known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, chiefly to protect government officials and people’s rights. Jim McGovern, the Democratic chair of the House rules committee, lamented that Fox News hosts privately pushed for an end to the Capitol insurrection on January 6 while publicly downplaying the violence of that day. McGovern noted that Fox News has not mentioned the texts that some of the network’s hosts sent to Mark Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, since they were revealed last night. “This would be a good time for these hosts to use their platforms to tell the American people the truth, just like they were privately texting Mark Meadows the truth on that terrible day,” McGovern said. “But I have to say that their silence is deafening.” The Massachusetts congressman expressed concern that Donald Trump and his allies are trying to “run out the clock” to keep the facts of January 6 from coming to light. “The lack of curiosity, the lack of outrage, the rationalizations why we shouldn’t be compelling people to testify -- it’s just stunning to me,” McGovern said. “We’re at a crossroads. Our democracy is being threatened, and this is serious.” McGovern also warned that America may see future attempts to overturn election results if lawmakers do not uncover all the details of January 6. “Coups very rarely succeed the first go-around, but they oftentimes do the second time around,” McGovern said. “If there’s ever a moment to be above politics, it’s now.” During the hearing aimed at taking up the contempt resolution against Mark Meadows, a Republican on the House rules committee, Michael Burgess, attempted to compare the January 6 insurrection to past protests held on Capitol Hill. “We’ve had bad protests here at the Capitol before. I was here when the Affordable Care Act went through the legislative process,” Burgess said. “You don’t think we had some really upset people outside the Capitol during those days? Of course we did. ... It’s what we do here.” Bennie Thompson, the chair of the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, vehemently rejected Burgess’ comparison. “I don’t know how you can draw a comparison between the Affordable Care demonstration and what occurred on January 6,” Thompson said. “People broke into this institution. They harmed people. They did all kinds of things. ... This is not the America that we live in.” Jim McGovern, the Democratic chair of the House rules committee, said the texts that Mark Meadows received from Fox News hosts and Donald Trump Jr on January 6 were “nothing short of a bombshell”. “The top personalities on Fox News, who are today trying to cover up the gravity of what happened on January 6, knew who to go to to stop the insurrection that day,” McGovern said at the start of the rules committee hearing to take up the contempt resolution against Meadows. McGovern added, “The president’s son knew who to go to. When Don Jr texted that ‘it has gone too far and gotten out of hand,’ what was ‘it’ that he was referring to? “The ‘it’ was the attempt to overthrow the election. The ‘it’ was the attempted coup in the United States of America. Yet the president did nothing in those critical moments.” It’s also worth noting that the texts messages were among the records that Meadows voluntarily turned over to the select committee before ending his cooperation with investigators, so there are likely even more bombshells in the records he has withheld. The House rules committee is now meeting to take up the resolution calling for Mark Meadows to be held in criminal contempt for defying a subpoena from the select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. The meeting comes one day after the select committee voted to recommend criminal contempt charges against Meadows, who said last week he would no longer cooperate with investigators. The rules committee meeting will set up a full House vote on the contempt resolution, and the Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to vote to refer the matter to the justice department. The justice department will then determine whether to prosecute Meadows over the matter. A federal grand jury has already indicted former Trump aide Steve Bannon on two counts of contempt of Congress for defying his subpoena. Over the course of a near-hour-long business meeting, the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection outlined in detail the materials Mark Meadows had turned over to the panel – and how Meadows then promptly refused to testify about those very records. Meadows turned over about 9,000 documents as part of a cooperation deal, the House select committee said, in his effort to engage with the inquiry to a degree in order to avoid an immediate criminal referral that befell other Trump administration aides who defied subpoenas. Among the materials Meadows turned over to the select committee was a PowerPoint presentation titled “Election Fraud, Foreign Interference and Options for 6 JAN”, which recommended Donald Trump declare a national security emergency to unilaterally return himself to office. But his cooperation with the select committee ended with the document production and Meadows informed the panel last week that he would not answer questions because he had learned that House investigators had subpoenaed call detail records for his personal phone. The select committee said Meadows’ refusal to testify constituted noncompliance with his subpoena, which was first issued in September, and initiated proceedings to recommend that the House hold him in contempt of Congress. During the hearing yesterday, Liz Cheney, the Republican vice-chair of the House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection, read text messages that Mark Meadows received on January 6. The texts, which Meadows turned over to the committee before ending his cooperation with investigators, include pleas from Fox News hosts and Donald Trump Jr urging the chief of staff to take action. “Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy,” Fox News host Laura Ingraham wrote in one message to Meadows. “We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now,” Trump’s eldest son told Meadows. “It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.” Multiple people inside the Capitol also pleaded with Meadows to convince Trump to deliver a message to his supporters, saying they were “helpless” as the insurrectionists stormed the building. “These text messages leave no doubt,” Cheney said. “The White House knew exactly what was happening here at the Capitol.” Bennie Thompson, the chair of the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack, said in an opening statement before the panel recommended Mark Meadows’ referral to the justice department that Donald Trump’s former White House chief of staff displayed willful noncompliance in his defiance of his subpoena. “It comes down to this,” Thompson said. “Mr Meadows started by doing the right thing: cooperating. He handed over records that he didn’t try to shield behind some excuse. But in an investigation like ours, that’s just a first step. “When the records raise questions – as these most certainly do – you have to come in and answer those questions. And when it was time for him to follow the law, come in, and testify on those questions, he changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn’t even show up.” The select committee said in the contempt report they were seeking charges against Meadows after he attempted to obstruct the investigation in myriad ways, from refusing to testify to frustrating their efforts to locate and discover documents relevant to the Capitol attack. The select committee also said Meadows should be prosecuted since he refused to testify even about information he voluntarily provided to the panel through his own document production and conceded were not covered by claims of executive privilege advanced by Trump. Greetings from Washington, live blog readers. The House select committee investigating the Capitol insurrection voted last night to recommend holding Mark Meadows in criminal contempt for defying the panel’s subpoena. The vote came one week after Meadows, the former chief of staff to Donald Trump, said he would no longer cooperate with investigators, despite already having turned over some of his personal records to the committee. The recommendation sets up a full House vote on the matter, and the Democratic-controlled chamber is expected to refer the matter to the justice department. The justice department will then have to determine whether to prosecute Meadows over the matter. A federal grand jury has already indicted another former Trump aide, Steve Bannon, on two counts of contempt of Congress. The Meadows vote raises the stakes for other Trump allies who may be considering defying their subpoenas, and it carries significant implications for how much investigators will ultimately be able to learn about what unfolded on January 6. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned."

          "headline": "Farmers warn of threat to UK food security due to seasonal worker visa cap",
          "bodyText": "Farmers have accused the government of failing to listen to their warnings over the future of domestic food production, after concerns ministers would not increase the number of seasonal worker visas next year. The criticism came at a summit convened by the National Farmers’ Union (NFU) and attended by the environment minister, George Eustice, where food producers, processors and retailers urged government to fix supply chains to ensure food security. Farmers have faced a string of labour shortage challenges over the last year, resulting in a mass slaughter of healthy pigs on farms because of staffing shortages at abattoirs, the destruction of fruit and vegetables which could not be picked on time, and disruption caused by lorry driver shortages. Immigration minister Kevin Foster told MPs on Tuesday that the number of seasonal worker permits issued in 2022 would remain at the 30,000 allowed in 2021, resisting calls to significantly increase the quota. Speaking at a hearing of the environment, food and rural affairs committee, Foster said the Home Office would announce full details of the scheme soon. “We will be moving to a three-year system, announcement is imminent,” he said. “There will be a scheme at 30,000 [permits] next year and then we always have the ability as we have shown with similar routes we have created to add on.” Foster added that the government intended to allow 30,000 workers into the country in 2022 and 2023, but this was expected to be cut to 28,000 people in 2024. Some growers expressed concern that changes to the programme would see more farmers competing for a limited pool of labour. Whereas the programme was reserved for fruit and vegetable pickers this year, it will be extended to cover ornamental crops such as daffodils next year, without an increase in the overall number of permits issued. “The seasonal worker scheme at 30,000 really isn’t adequate,” said Julian Marks, managing director of West Sussex-based grower Barfoots. “Soft fruit alone takes 30,000, and an idea that you can then spread that 30,000 over the ornamental industry as well as the edible industry is crazy, and is going to create some real tensions next year.” Barfoots was forced to throw away more than 700 tonnes of courgettes during the summer because of a shortage of workers available at the right time, Marks told the conference, while some green beans and sweetcorn cobs also had to be destroyed. “In terms of labour, it is very frustrating and we didn’t actually get any acknowledgment of that today from the secretary of state,” said Bob Carnell, chief executive of beef processor ABP Food Group. “We have a business model that was set with 60% of colleagues as non-UK nationals, we went into a global pandemic which has stretched everybody, and we really need time to adjust. That is all we are asking for: to redefine the business model to allow us to move forward and that question is not being listened to and it is frustrating.” Carnell said it would be possible to recruit some UK workers to fill vacancies, although the process takes time. “We want to keep feeding the nation,” said Minette Batters, the NFU president, adding that she had found it challenging to remain in discussions with ministers over the past year while also getting them to understand the problems faced by the industry. “We walk a tightrope of remaining at the table, and being locked out of the room,” she said. “It is for government to take it seriously, but there is a disconnect, but what do we do?” The pig industry said it was still suffering from a lack of abattoir workers. About 30,000 healthy pigs, including at least 10,000 piglets, have so far been killed on farms since the cull began in October, said Zoe Davies, chief executive of the National Pig Association. Davies warned that UK pork production, which currently accounts for about one-third of domestic consumption, was likely to fall in coming years as farmers reduce their breeding stock and farm fewer animals following the backlog at processing plants."

          "headline": "British Airways to restart short-haul London Gatwick flights from March",
          "bodyText": "British Airways will return to short-haul flying from London Gatwick next year, the airline has said as it confirmed the go-ahead of its planned subsidiary, BA Euroflyer. BA, which stopped flying from the West Sussex airport soon after the Covid pandemic started, will relaunch its short-haul leisure network in late March 2022, ending a break of almost two years. Flights will initially be operated by BA itself, but the airline intends to hive off the business to the subsidiary later next year once it has received regulatory approval. Its parent group, IAG, has said that a new standalone business was needed to make the resumption financially viable, citing years of losses for BA at Gatwick even before Covid hit. Tickets for flights to 35 short-haul destinations went on sale on Tuesday. Three Airbus short-haul planes will start operations in March, with the active fleet growing to 18 by the end of May. BA Euroflyer will – like the BA CityFlyer operation at London City – remain BA-branded. Its launch came after unions initially rejected the plans, which are understood to demand much more flexibility from pilots and crew in seasonal work than permitted under normal BA rostering. Thousands of staff were laid off during the pandemic, and many now could be rehired under inferior terms and conditions. The pilots’ union Balpa said the final agreement would “create up to 160 much needed pilot jobs in 2022” and had been tailored to fit the point-to-point flying model used by other major airlines. BA said fares would start from £39 each way, to be competitive with Gatwick’s no-frills carriers, led by easyJet, but would come with the airline’s usual luggage allowances and basic snacks onboard. The BA chief executive, Sean Doyle, said it was a “landmark moment” for the airline, adding: “The creation of a new British Airways short-haul organisation means Gatwick customers will benefit from access to a premium service from the UK’s flag carrier at competitive prices.” Stewart Wingate, Gatwick’s chief executive, said: “Despite the ongoing public health situation, today’s announcement is a positive signal that consumer confidence is returning as people start thinking about making travel plans for next summer.” While Gatwick and BA were upbeat about the launch, the air and travel industry was left dismayed again after the government chose not to lift the testing regime in a travel announcement on Tuesday. The health secretary, Sajid Javid, confirmed the removal of the last 11 countries from the red list but did not follow through on suggestions that the recently reimposed requirement for expensive PCR testing would be scrapped. Tim Alderslade, the chief executive of Airlines UK, said: “If the red list isn’t necessary given that [the Covid variant] Omicron is established here at home, then neither are the costly emergency testing and isolation measures imposed on even fully vaccinated travellers, which again put us completely at odds with the rest of Europe.” The travel association Abta – which has reported autumn bookings being at less than 30% of normal levels – said the government needed to explain why tests would be retained through the Christmas period, adding that it should give financial support to the sector. Abta’s chief executive, Mark Tanzer, said: “With the industry quickly approaching peak booking season for summer 2022, travel businesses are facing a very serious situation. Consumer confidence in travel has suffered a significant setback, which will outlast these restrictions.” The tourism body UKinbound said tests for vaccinated international arrivals were “stifling businesses across the inbound tourism industry”. Eurostar said it had seen the rate of bookings halve since PCR tests were brought back, with more cancellations or rearranged trips than new bookings for the Christmas period. Its chief executive, Jacques Damas, said the restrictions came “at a heavy price for the industry”."

          "headline": "Colbert on Chris Wallace’s move to CNN: ‘There goes Fox News’s last shred of credibility’",
          "bodyText": "Stephen Colbert “It has been a crazy and bewildering year,” said Stephen Colbert to kick off his final week of Late Shows for 2021, a year of political chaos, an attempted coup, extreme weather events and the continual bottoming-out of rightwing media. Things have gone so off the rails at Fox, the Late Show host explained, that even Chris Wallace, one of Fox News’s veteran broadcast journalists, announced this weekend that he would leave the network for CNN+ after 18 years. “It’s the end of an era, but luckily Fox has already filled the time slot with the flaming Christmas tree,” Colbert quipped. Wallace, the network’s most decorated down-the-middle journalists, was one of the few anchors at the network willing to ask difficult questions. “There goes Fox News’s last shred of credibility,” said Colbert. “Now they have to change their slogan from ‘Fair and Balanced’ to ‘Horse paste and gun! Argle Bargle! Argle Bargle!’” Wallace hosted his last episode of Fox News Sunday this weekend, with his final guest being Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. “Wow, what a way to go out,” Colbert deadpanned. “That’s like being able to request anything as your last meal on death row and ordering an interview with Lindsey Graham.” Seth Meyers On Late Night, Seth Meyers delved into a PowerPoint explicating methods for a political coup that circled through Trumpworld in early 2021. “They did everything they could, left no stone unturned, looked for every crack and crevice in our democracy they could possibly find,” Meyers explained of Donald Trump’s efforts to prevent the transition of power. “Trump tried so many different avenues”, he added. “He was like the guy in the grocery store during Christmas rush who keeps switching checkout aisles. “It’s so disorienting for things to be both this dangerous and this dumb at the same time,” he continued, pointing to the “truly insane” PowerPoint. The 38-page presentation included options such as declaring a national emergency; a retired army colonel, Philip Waldron, briefed the then White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, several times about the PowerPoint. Trump famously never writes things down, but “I guess he forgot to tell his underlings before they started emailing a PowerPoint around detailing their crimes,” said Meyers. “Even the mafia knows to use code words. If the mafia ever made a powerpoint presentation, it would say something vague, like ‘Plan For The Guys At The Place To Do The Thing’.” Trevor Noah On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah explained how California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, plans to use Texas’s restrictive abortion law as a model for gun control in the state. Under Newsom’s plan, California citizens will be able to sue anyone who makes, distributes or sells the assault weapons, citing supreme court rulings that have allowed the Texas anti-abortion law to stay in effect. “The idea is that because the supreme court is allowing this for banning abortion, they’re going to have to allow it for banning guns, too,” Noah said. “But here’s the thing: the problem with this idea is that the supreme court can make up whatever rules they like. If they want to strike down these gun laws, they’ll find a way, you know? “The supreme court is like that annoying kid that your mom made you have play dates with,” he added, mimicking a thwarted game of tag – “‘Tag, I got you!’ ‘Nuh uh, I have a vest that makes me invisible.’ “America has gotten so divided right now”, he continued, “that at this point I think maybe some states should just like … secede? And try to do their own thing. Have they tried that before? What’s the worst that could happen?” Jimmy Kimmel And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel mocked an event held by Trump and former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in Orlando that drew disappointing crowd sizes. The event, the first in their planned “history tour”, played to an arena with many empty seats, reported the Sun-Sentinel. “If the place was any emptier, it would be Don Jr’s head,” Kimmel quipped. “It was disappointing, to say the least,” he joked. Though tickets originally sold for upwards of $100, the tour eventually gave away some for free. “This happens a lot with things Trump puts his name on,” Kimmel explained. “First they’re considered to be valuable, and then everyone realizes they are garbage. We’ve seen this with his ties, his steaks, his university, his children.”"

          "headline": "UK cinemas brace for ‘biggest Wednesday’ as Spider-Man: No Way Home hits screens",
          "bodyText": "Cinemas are gearing up for their biggest weekend since reopening, and their biggest Wednesday results in history, as Spider-Man: No Way Home hits screens. The Marvel movie, which smashed records for ticket pre-sales and crashed cinema websites in both the UK and US, is expected to bring back audiences that have been avoiding the big screen or replaced it altogether with streaming services. According to Odeon, the UK’s largest cinema chain, more than 400,000 advance tickets have now been sold, with half of those in the first week – surpassing the previous record set by Avengers: Endgame in 2019, and more than three times the advanced sales achieved by Daniel Craig’s final outing as James Bond in No Time to Die. Carol Welch from Odeon Cinemas UK and Ireland said pre-sales for the film, starring Tom Holland as Peter Parker, showed “guests are loving being back at cinemas and are excited about the magic that our big screen experience brings to movies”. At Vue, the film sold more than 150,000 tickets in the first 24 hours of going on sale, five times the first-day sales of No Time to Die – which was viewed as a watershed moment for the industry’s path to recovery after global lockdowns. Vue Cinemas on Tuesday said the film “is expected to deliver our highest Wednesday results for any film in history in terms of admissions”. After a day, it also took the throne as Cineworld’s highest ever pre-sales release. No Way Home, directed by Jon Watts, is Holland’s sixth outing as Spider-Man and his third standalone film. Alongside Zendaya as MJ and Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, the film also sees the return of villains from previous franchises which starred Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man, including Alfred Molina’s Doctor Octopus, Willem Dafoe’s Green Goblin, and Jamie Foxx’s Electro. The Guardian awarded the film three stars, calling it “a propulsive, slickly choreographed adventure that will appease a broad fanbase this Christmas”. But it has been clouded in such secrecy that fans still don’t know whether their hopes of cameos from Maguire and Garfield will materialise. After tickets began to sell out, they began appearing on eBay for as much as $25,000 (£18,880). Despite rolling headlines warning of a rise in Covid infections, and speculation that government-enforced restrictions may be just round the corner, on Tuesday morning on the Vue Leicester Square website at least three opening-day showings were sold out, with only a handful of individual tickets available for other times. Phil Clapp, the chief executive of the UK Cinema Association, said cinema operators had been delighted with the excitement and anticipation shown by audiences for the film. “That confirms not just interest in this particular title, but also high levels of confidence in the safety of the cinema experience, particularly amongst those audience segments – teens and young families – which in many ways led the return to the big screen and so have seen for themselves the efforts that all cinemas have made to ensure that the experience is an enjoyable and reassuring one. “Our most recent independent industry survey for example showed that an exceptional 98% of returning cinema-goers rated their experience as ‘good’ or ‘very good’.” Clapp added that cinemas would “remain mindful” of concerns about the new variant and implement any additional measures deemed necessary by government, “for example the reintroduction last week of face coverings in cinemas in England”. David Hancock, a media and entertainment analyst at Omdia, said the film was “keenly anticipated” and predicted that it would continue to “do good business”. “The buzz seems to be mainly generated by the appearance of previous Spider-Man villains as well as a cinematic universe element in Doctor Strange appearing,” he said. “Bond kickstarted cinema back in October and Spider-Man is benefiting from that (the Bond titles got many older and more cautious people back in the cinema).” No Time to Die is currently the third highest-grossing film in the world (after two domestic Chinese titles) with about $780m in box office takings – making it Hollywood’s biggest release since the pandemic. Meanwhile Holland, who has been busy promoting the film, told the BBC on Tuesday that playing Spider-Man felt like “more than just having a job”. “There are kids out there that look up to Spider-Man and they come home from school and the person they want to sit down with is Spider-Man, and I am that person right now,” the British actor said. “So I have a responsibility to be a role model and to give these kids some drive and something to look up to.” The 25-year-old recently said he was considering quitting acting to return to his roots in dancing, having played Billy Elliot in the West End as a child."

          "bodyText": "When I meet Om Dhungel in a cafe near his home, he tells me about Merryn Howell. “She is my godmother,” he says, his eyes shining. “Every day I remember her.” Howell (then Jones) was a skilled migrant placement officer. Dhungel was a refugee of Nepalese ancestry from the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, where he had been an engineer and a senior public servant at the Department of Telecommunications. In 2001, after three years in Australia, Dhungel completed an MBA. But over the next six months, he applied for 52 jobs in engineering and business administration, and received 52 rejections. Om Dhungel in his home in Blacktown, Western Sydney People, offering sympathy, told him the problem was racism, or the fact that he was a refugee. Dhungel began to despair: the job he had packing shelves at Coles would be his for ever. But Howell refused to believe any of that. Keep going, she insisted. You will get there. After the 52nd rejection, she had an idea. She would conduct a mock job interview with Dhungel, and film it. “I came in the next day and she was jumping up and down,” Dhungel says. “She said, ‘Om, I’ve got it! You are looking down at my feet. Look at my face!’” Dhungel had simply been observing Bhutanese custom, which sees looking directly at a person of higher rank as a mark of great disrespect. Confident now that his problem wasn’t racism or being a refugee, Dhungel returned to the search. In no time he had two good job offers, the second an engineering-related role at Telstra. He stayed at the company for 10 years. He says he will use the lesson Howell gave him for the rest of his life. ‘I’m a Blacktown boy’ Blacktown has traditionally been a working-class community. In the early decades after the second world war, many waves of migrants from other parts of Sydney and the world came to an area that was rich in jobs in small factories, warehouses, building sites, and service centres such as Blacktown hospital. As a growing city deeply divided by socio-economic status, Blacktown depends on its people to hold it together But Blacktown is changing more than any other time since that postwar period. Although its south and west – especially the 11 suburbs of Mount Druitt – hold some of Australia’s poorest urban areas, its northern suburbs and the greenfield developments of the North West Growth Area are at the centre of a housing boom that is creating some of Sydney’s most affluent new areas. Unemployment is rising, especially among young people, yet in the past 50 years there has been huge growth in the proportion of Blacktown residents holding tertiary degrees – from well under 1% in 1971 to nearly 17% today. As a growing city deeply divided by socio-economic status, Blacktown depends on its people to hold it together. People like Dhungel. A small, finely built man, nearly 60, Dhungel runs his own consulting and mentoring practice. He sits on multicultural advisory committees with Blacktown city council and NSW police, and on the board of the Asylum Seeker Centre. He was chair of SydWest Multicultural Services in Blacktown, and lives in an elegant but not exclusive estate near the Blacktown CBD. “I’m a Blacktown boy,” he says with a laugh, and with pride. He was once a boy from Bhutan, from an ethnic Nepalese background. His family lived in a village in the south of the Himalayan kingdom. His parents, Durga and Damanta, ran a grocery at the market, but their son was educated well, and rose into the high ranks of the public service. He had conversations with the king, making sure to keep his eyes down when he did. People of Nepalese ethnicity had lived in Bhutan in large numbers for more than 100 years. But many ethnic Bhutanese thought their numbers were growing too fast, and feared being overtaken. A movement grew: One Nation, One People. The ethnic Nepalese were prohibited from teaching their own language. From the late 1980s, the regime began a campaign to expel them. Durga was accused of supporting insurgents, arrested and tortured till he passed out. When the family left, they lost everything. Family photos of Om Dhungel and his wife, Saroja By 1996, there were 100,000 Nepalese-Bhutanese refugees in camps in Nepal. Dhungel, his wife, Saroja, and young daughter, Smriti, lived in the capital, Kathmandu, so that he could advocate to the Nepalese and international governments on behalf of the refugees. While Saroja taught science in a local school, Dhungel worked as a full-time but unpaid human rights activist, and co-edited a newspaper, The Bhutan Review, that sought to draw the world’s attention to the plight of his people. He and colleagues delivered it by walking to every embassy in Kathmandu; Dhungel often carrying Smriti on his back as he travelled. Those six years in exile, in which he learned to live with virtually nothing, were the most important and formative of his life. The camps that housed the Bhutanese were poor but, unlike those in Kenya and Ethiopia that housed many South Sudanese, they were in the main not violent. There were divisions and some of these were bitter: some people wanted to take up arms to try to regain their land in Bhutan; others said they had to renounce that dream. Most agreed on two things: they would continue to press for their return to Bhutan, and they would do everything to educate their children. They opened schools under palm trees, and they waited. Hemanta Acharya was one of those children, and remembers her hunger to learn. In the camp where she spent the first 15 years of her life, her parents would tell her: “It is time to go to sleep, you don’t have to study so hard.” There was malaria in the camps and Hemanta’s friend died of typhoid. Her father had been a respected educator and community leader in Bhutan, for which he had been imprisoned for 15 months. But Hemanta wanted to be a doctor or a nurse, to prevent the kinds of needless deaths she saw sometimes in the camp. And she would watch aeroplanes making their way lazily across the sky and think. “One day, if I’m lucky, I will be on that plane.” ‘I feel a sense of gratitude to where I came from. It keeps me humble,’ Hemanta Acharya says She already felt lucky, though. The camp’s houses were made of mud, the roofs of bamboo and thatch. Rain would get into the houses and pool on the floor. “We didn’t care,” Hemanta says. “Cousins, neighbours – we all grew up together. We were so happy with what we had. We had dance competitions, quizzes, debates. We didn’t know iPhones, laptops, the developed version of life.” In the late 2000s the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees embarked on a concerted effort to clear the camps with the help of eight western nations. Australia agreed to take 5,500 of the 100,000 refugees. In 2008, Dhungel had been in Sydney for 10 years. The Australian Bhutanese community he belonged to numbered precisely 17 people. To prepare for the newcomers, Dhungel and others formed the Association of Bhutanese in Australia (ABA). Celebrating successes – big and small When Hemanta finally learned that she and her family were going to Australia, she counted every day till departure. As she boarded the flight, she said to herself: “Let this be the last day I am a refugee. As I land on Australian soil, let my refugee tale stay inside the plane.” When the family and others landed in Sydney, Om Dhungel, his wife, Saroja, and other members of the tiny Bhutanese community were waiting at the airport. Most people were taken to townhouses in Blacktown. Om and Saroja showed them how to work the lights and the flush toilets, how not to get burned by the hot tap or trigger the smoke alarm. Learning how to use a stove would take longer, so Om and Saroja gave about 50 families rice cookers. They also left food, especially vegetables such as chokos and rayo saag, a spinach that grows in Bhutan, in the fridge. In that first week, as the family of nine children, parents and grandparents shared three bedrooms, Hemanta would lie awake, wanting to start school but wondering, given her broken English, how she would go. Entering Year 9 at Mitchell high school, she struggled to pronounce “shower” and “sour” differently, but she made friends quickly, even if Jenny, an Anglo name, sounded like Zenny, a Filipino name. Om Dhungel and his wife, Saroja, looking at old photos of their time in Nepal, where Om worked full-time as an unpaid human rights activist Following her older brother, she took up soccer. On Saturday mornings, Om Dhungel would pick up a group of girls in his car and drive them to training. In the camp, kids had played with a ball made of socks and plastic, but girls were not welcomed. Now Hemanta found she had a gift for the game. Her progress was swift, and in June 2010, she represented Australia in the Fifa Football for Hope festival for refugee youth, held during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. She had been living in her new country for about 18 months. Hemanta’s journey was part of what many government officials regard as the most successful refugee integration program Australia has ever undertaken. Critically, it was not run by external service providers alone but with the close involvement of the Bhutanese community. As people continued to arrive, the ABA developed a plan to identify their skills and put them to use. Many had never been to formal school, and could not read Nepali. In partnership with an employment services provider, MTC Australia, the ABA created a spoken English school in Blacktown, run by community volunteers. Young Bhutanese were engaged to cut hair, do basic repair of computers and phones, or fix a tap. Others ran workshops on résumé writing and interview skills. A group was organised to take part in Blacktown’s Clean Up Australia Day, to “showcase our sincerity and commitment to the nation”. For many people, especially women, gaining a driving licence was the key to independence. Three women, including Hemanta’s mother, set up childcare centres, an opportunity that would not have come their way in Bhutan. Every Friday, the community held a seniors’ get-together with a yoga class at SydWest Multicultural Services in Blacktown. Members of Blacktown’s Bhutanese community gather together after being separated by the pandemic for months All these efforts came together in a monthly event held in a hall in Blacktown. The council provided the hall rent-free for 18 months, until the ABA offered to pay its own way. Jill Gillespie remembers people being brought up on stage to share an achievement. One would hold up a Year 11 certificate, another an L plate, to great applause. Gillespie says “these successes, however little they might seem in the broader sense of life, were all celebrated”. Gillespie says “the amount of time Om gave to the community in those early days was beyond my comprehension. He had a full-time job at Telstra!” She thinks the Bhutanese leaders “were smart cookies. They could see the value of early intervention to minimise problems down the track.” There were episodes of domestic violence and depression. Some people struggled to learn English or find jobs; others regretted a lack of contact with the wider Australian community. Nevertheless, a survey from 2019 showed that very few people who were eligible to work or learn were not doing so. More than 60% of families owned their homes. Those who couldn’t afford to buy left Sydney for more affordable places such as Adelaide, the largest Bhutanese centre, and Albury-Wodonga. In 2015, then home affairs minister Peter Dutton singled out the Bhutanese for “supporting each other to quickly gain employment and independent living”. ‘They don’t need charity, they need inspiration’ Over time, Dhungel has come to feel that Australian policy towards refugees is discouraging that opportunity for independence. He says that settlement services, by being run as a form of social welfare, are not nurturing the strengths of individuals or of their community. Under the current model, large providers compete for lucrative government contracts to deliver services to refugees. The more contracts a provider wins, the more it grows. To deliver the contract, it hires lots of specialist staff. Dhungel says these employees, often young and well-meaning, are required to undertake a “needs analysis” of the community, then to develop programs based on those perceived needs. Providers are not even required to engage with communities, simply to deliver the service. Main Street, Blacktown. The community is ‘definitely coming together’, Om Dhungel says Dhungel says providers are not acting in bad faith; they have to meet government funding requirements and other performance indicators. Yet he says their focus on refugees’ perceived weaknesses and needs, rather than their strengths, is breeding a culture of dependency. And by not engaging with communities, they are spending resources on tasks that communities could do themselves, learning valuable skills along the way. This is one man’s view, yet it is not a lone one. Hazara, Khmer and South Sudanese organisations all testified to the Senate’s Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee that the move from a community-based funding model to one dominated by large service providers had been damaging. The NSW Service for the Treatment and Rehabilitation of Torture and Trauma Survivors, which works with many communities, told the inquiry that some activities “are much better run by refugee organisations themselves”. Even the constant use of the term “refugee” to denote need frustrates Dhungel. “The sector champions its work with the most vulnerable but refugees are not vulnerable. They have often lived for long times without food, or divided one mango between two families. The service sector could strengthen communities by helping to build an array of champions within them, then step back to let communities do things by themselves. They don’t need charity, they need inspiration.” Dhungel believes the possibility of inspiration is abundant in Australia. Flick a switch, and the light comes on. If a road gets a pothole it is paved. People died in the Snowy Mountains so others could have power. His father, Durga, whose experience of torture made him fear people in uniforms, went on a tour of Blacktown police station. The commander, Mark Wright, invited him to sit in his chair. Sometimes Dhungel cannot believe the blessings of this country. ‘It’s a good problem to have’ I ask him whether he thinks Blacktown is coming together or apart as a community. “Based on my experience, I think it’s definitely coming together,” he says. His evidence? This year, Blacktown mosque invited about 30 non-Muslim leaders to the iftar to celebrate Eid, the end of Ramadan. Community festivals increasingly involve people from other groups. And earlier this year, a group of 10 Bhutanese of different ages got together to discuss how their community was going. A few lamented that the common bond they felt when they arrived in Australia had gone. People were working, studying and staying in their own friendship groups; fewer came to community events, that first rapture had been lost. One person asked: “How do we get back to 2008?” But other people replied: the reason our Bhutanese gatherings are smaller is that people are socialising in the wider community. They play sport with other Australians. Many Bhutanese – more males than females – are nurses, and they are having drinks, joining Facebook groups with workmates, and buying homes. One person said: “This is such a good problem to have.” I say to Dhungel that maintaining such cohesion relies on forces that are bigger than the Bhutanese: above all, the strength of the economy, the guarantee of getting a job. He is reluctant to entirely allow the point. “There is always something you can do,” he says. “What can we as a community do? We can’t always rely on the government to help us.” He has put that idea into practice. During the pandemic, SydWest Multicultural Services in Blacktown brought together a group of leaders from Bhutanese, South Sudanese, Sri Lankan, Indian, Sierra Leone and Afghan backgrounds to discuss what they could do together to combat isolation and loneliness in their communities. That group turned into a community leaders Covid-19 taskforce, hosted by SydWest, that met every month on zoom. When 12 local government areas in Sydney’s western and south-western suburbs were subjected to especially severe restrictions during this year’s lockdown, the taskforce began to meet on zoom every fortnight, and to discuss how communities could work together to get their people vaccinated. Forum members came up with the idea of virtual doorknocks: a volunteer would contact 10 people and ask each to contact another 10, to encourage community members to take the vaccine. These volunteers would also try to clear up misunderstandings – for example, the presence of soldiers, helicopters and more police in the area did not spell political trouble but that the government was trying to ensure people’s health and safety. Government figures from the start of November show that Blacktown’s double-dose vaccination rate of 94.8% was the highest among the 12 “LGAs of concern” and was beaten by only five other LGAs across the state. Such success is unlikely to have occurred without the “community champions” that Dhungel and others created, and without his insistence that “there is always something you can do”. Hemanta Acharya with her grandmother, Menuka Devi Acharya, and her aunt, Devi Maya Acharya Hemanta Acharya has worked as a registered nurse for the past five years and recently completed a Master of Nursing. She looks forward to the opportunities her degree is likely to bring. She also does media interviews for the community, writes for a Bhutanese literature blog and runs an occasional dance academy. She was the youth coordinator of the ABA in Sydney and is one of the community’s most active members. In a cafe overlooking a golf course in the Blacktown suburb of Colebee, she reflects on what she has lost and found in coming to Australia. She admits she feels nostalgia for aspects of the life she had in the camp. “I don’t miss the leaking roof, I miss the human connection. Now we are complaining about this flood [we spoke during a serious flood in Sydney]. It hasn’t even gotten into our houses and we complain. We are on our phones even when we are eating at home. My brother will be watching a football match, I will be watching a dance show, Dad will be watching something in Nepalese. In the camp we were together. My mum would leave us with our neighbours or relatives, we had that trust. They would feed us. That human connection is hard to see when you have everything.” On the other hand, Hemanta knows that if she were still in Nepal she would be a housewife. Even if she were allowed to study, she would have to rely on her husband. Here she has a car, and can go wherever she wants, pursue whatever path she wants. “I feel a sense of gratitude to where I came from. It keeps me humble.” She says that from an early age, watching planes in the sky from that house with water on the floor, she wrote down her dreams and goals. “There is nothing wrong with dreaming, the biggest you want to achieve. Even if you think you can’t achieve it, always dare to dream. The rules change, the opportunities come along – if you keep that dream alive, one day you will get to a point where you say, ‘Ah, it is already fulfilled.’” This article is based on a narrative paper on Blacktown written for the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute."

          "headline": "Train in vain: how NSW’s new public transport body led to a budget standoff",
          "bodyText": "A standoff over the New South Wales government’s asset shuffling to bolster its budget bottomline has the potential to threaten political careers and put the state’s credit rating at risk if it is not resolved. Margaret Crawford, NSW’s auditor general, this week announced she was refusing to sign off on the state’s 2020-21 financial report “due to significant accounting issues”. At the centre of the dispute is the treatment of the innocuously named Transport Asset Holding Entity, or TAHE. It was known as Rail Corporation until its conversion to a state-owned corporation last year. The Audit Office typically signs off on the government’s financial reporting by the end of each September or early October, so the process is months overdue. Awkwardly for the NSW treasurer, Matt Kean, this week’s public declaration of the dispute comes just days before he releases the state’s mid-year review. What is TAHE? Pronounced “tah-hee”, the entity is a statutory state-owned corporation (SOC) that holds rail property assets, rolling stock and infrastructure in the Sydney metro area and limited country locations worth about $40bn. TAHE makes these assets available to Sydney Trains and NSW Trains for their operations, as it has done for decades. It also provides rail infrastructure to other operators under access agreements. In its submissions to a NSW upper house inquiry, the state government – now led by Dominic Perrottet – justified the creation of TAHE as part of a “critical reform” of the state’s transport cluster to “best optimise the use of state funds”. “Appropriate commercial and economic drivers” would deliver a better return for taxpayers than the previous RailCorp, the submission argued. What did it mean for the budget? The auditor general was been wary of the implications for the state finances of such a change for years, not least because assets such as railroads typically need significant injections of government funding and aren’t typically profit making. How these necessary payments are treated, though, has big implications for the budget bottom line being presented to the public. Previously the government paid recurrent grants to RailCorp to deliver its capital program, and these showed up as expenses. As former auditor general Tony Harris noted in his submission, from July 2015 onwards, new funding for capital projects could be treated as equity injections and not expenses once TAHE was born. This shift followed Australian accounting standards for corporations that are set up to generate commercial returns. Big bickies The status change to TAHE was very helpful for the budget. “The reduction in budget expenses (and thus the improvement in the budget result) for the five years from 2015-16 to 2019-20 by classifying RailCorp as a commercial non-financial public corporation was $14,349m comprised of $5,829.4m in operating losses and $8,545.5m of equity injections for capital purposes,” Harris said in his submission. “In none of those years did RailCorp make a profit, notwithstanding its ‘commercial’ characterisations,” he said. Or as he told Guardian Australia: “It’s all a charade.” “It’s a relatively complex issue because it’s so artificial,” Harris said. Why the standoff? The Audit Office had warned in its 2020 report on the state’s finances that “the accounting for further cash injections and the fair value of TAHE’s assets will be a key area of audit focus in 2020–21”. Despite that alert, treasury officials dug in their heels, challenging Crawford to submit a qualified report on the states finances for the year to last 30 June. Kean can sign off on such a report but to do so would raise “some ethical or behaviour issues”, former auditor general Harris says. Kean could call for a review – something the Labor opposition says won’t wash with the public. Or he could reject the treatment of TAHE as a commercial entity, and adjust the budget. That would mean, among other things, that current predictions of a return to an operating surplus by 2024 would probably be pushed back, potentially years. That last path would embarrass Kean’s boss, Dominic Perrottet, who was steering the TAHE transition until his elevation from treasurer to premier following the October exit of Gladys Berejiklian before the Independent Commission Against Corruption hearings. On Tuesday, the Australian reported treasury department chief Michael Pratt was planning to retire. Political fallout The Greens and the Shooters, Fishers and Farmers Party head the upper house public accountability inquiry looking into TAHE, and another hearing is due on Thursday. With the accounts yet to be signed off, the auditor general will skip this week’s event, indicating the committee will last into next year, with lingering fallout. Labor, too, is leading the charge with shadow treasurer Daniel Mookhey aware the wider media is now cottoning on. “It’s hard to make an accounting scandal a front page story,” he said on Tuesday just after the issue led that day’s Sydney Morning Herald print edition. “Why should the public care?” he said. “Well, this government has nominated itself as Australia’s best economic manager and the best manager of the books … but the emperor has no clothes. That’s the moral tale.” Mookhey also tabled in parliament a critical report by accounting giant KPMG that disputed the treatment of TAHE’s accounts to make it appear a commercial entity. The upper house inquiry later revealed how the supposedly independent advisory firm subsequently tried to quash its own negative report to favour the government’s approach. After rail, hospitals and schools could be up for similar asset treatment, Labor warns, while Harris says roads could be added to the list. Is there a safety issue? Labor has warned that the public’s safety is at risk because the attempt to make TAHE a profitable entity would give incentives to managers to, say, develop land over rail stations rather than invest in loss-making and expensive maintenance. The government rejects this. “[O]ver the three decades since the state-owned corporations act was introduced, SOCs have consistently and transparently demonstrated that they can consistently and safely manage public monopolies and partial monopolies such as water and energy”, it said in a submission. The Audit Office, though, plans to find out whether there is an issue. Along with its review of finances, it has launched a performance audit to “examine whether TAHE’s operating model is fit-for-purpose to effectively and efficiently achieve the outcomes intended by government, particularly in relation to rail safety”. Do markets care? Harris argues one motivation for improving the appearance of budgetary health was to increase the chances of NSW retaining its AAA credit rating with agencies such as Moody’s Investors Service and S&amp;P Global. Indeed, such a goal is the sole objective of the state’s Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 because it implies a lower borrowing cost. That is handy as the Covid pandemic’s impacts include a blowout towards $100bn in net debt for the state. So far, those agencies are not perturbed by the tantrums over TAHE. Still, “we are trying to monitor developments quite closely”, Martin Foo, an associate director at S&amp;P Global said. Similarly, John Manning, a vice-president and senior credit officer at Moody’s, said “the focus is on the whole government” and the treatment of TAHE doesn’t affect the overall debt load. However, Foo noted NSW’s and Australia’s ratings were underpinned by auditing that was “independent, timely and public”, a standard that was now in the spotlight. • This article was amended on 15 December to clarify comments made by Matt Kean’s office. It also incorrectly named Michael Pratt as the transport secretary. He is the treasury secretary."

          "headline": "‘Extremely rare’ photograph of the Rossettis taken by Lewis Carroll up for auction",
          "bodyText": "In October 1863, Charles Dodgson, better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, visited the Rossetti family at home in Chelsea, London, photographing the poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti playing chess, and his sister Christina, the poet, looking on benignly. The “extremely rare” photograph, which was arranged and printed by Dodgson himself, is now to be auctioned by Bonhams later this week. The image was taken in the garden of Dante Gabriel’s house on Cheyne Walk on 7 October 1863. Dodgson had been staying with the sculptor Alexander Munro in early October 1863, and Munro took him to meet the Rossetti family. The date was two years before the publication of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland would make Dodgson famous as Lewis Carroll, and a year after Dante Gabriel’s wife, the poet and artist’s model Elizabeth Siddall, had died after an overdose of laudanum. Dante Gabriel buried his poems with Siddall – but exhumed them in 1869. Dodgson wrote in his diary that he “afterwards looked through a huge volume of drawings, some of which l am to photograph – a great treat, as I had never seen such exquisite drawing before”. Later, Dodgson said he “dined with Mr Rossetti, and spent some of the evening there”, describing his visit as “a memorable day”. He would come back the next day to photograph the whole family, as well as Dante Gabriel’s drawings – he helped found the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood - and one of his models. The image shows Christina Rossetti – who had published her collection Goblin Market and Other Poems, illustrated by Dante Gabriel and including her famous poem Remember, the previous year – at the left. She is watching her mother Frances Lavinia Rossetti and Dante Gabriel play chess, with their sister Maria Francesca – with a less interested look on her face - to her right. “It’s such an intimate photograph, to see the two of them playing chess together, and the sisters looking on,” said Ian Ehling, director of fine books and manuscripts at Bonhams New York. “Carroll was an intimate reader of Rossetti’s books, so that’s probably how the friendship came about, and then he himself was of course a very gifted amateur photographer throughout his life.” Dodgson would stay in touch with Christina over the years, giving her a copy of Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and The Nursery Alice, while she gave him a copy of her Pageant and Other Poems. “It’s fascinating that Carroll is said to have been reading Goblin Market” – Christina’s poem about a girl seduced by the cry of the goblins, whose sister sets out to save her - “when he wrote Alice’s Adventures Underground,” said Ehling. Bonhams, which will auction the albumen print for an estimate of US$50,000-70,000 (£37,500-52,000) on Wednesday, said it was extremely rare. “Of the three known complete images of this photograph, only this and one other are in private hands,” said the auction house. “No similar quality original Lewis Carroll photograph of the Rossetti family has sold on the open market in recent years.” It previously belonged to Christina and Dante Gabriel’s other brother William Michael Rossetti, who passed it to his daughter, Helen Rossetti Angeli. It is now being sold by an American collector. “William Michael Rossetti was the historian or the archivist of the family,” said Ehling. “He held the family history close.” • This article was amended to correct the spelling of Frances Lavinia Rossetti’s middle name."

          "headline": "Facebook put profit before Rohingya lives. Now it must pay its dues",
          "bodyText": "In 1977, the Myanmar military launched a national drive to register citizens and drive out people they deemed to be “foreigners”. Since then, more than 2.5 million Rohingya people have fled the country, with 740,000 fleeing to Bangladesh in the displacement crisis of 2017 alone. It is nearly a decade since the Myanmar regime and its supporters were first denounced by the international community for carrying out a “campaign of ethnic cleansing” against the Rohingya people. Legal initiatives on behalf of Rohingya survivors issued this week allege that the campaign of clearances and genocide perpetrated on the Rohingya people was facilitated by a Goliath, Facebook. “Facebook turned away while a genocide was being perpetrated,” claims Tun Khin, the president of the Burmese Rohingya Organisation UK. “Putting profit before the human rights of the Rohingya people, permitting the spread of hateful anti-Rohingya propaganda which directly led to unspeakable violence.” We believe Facebook is guilty of many things. Facebook was greedy: it sought to monopolise the Myanmar market by providing access to its platform without incurring data charges. This meant that, for many in Myanmar, Facebook was the internet. The design of Facebook’s algorithm promoted hateful and divisive content: it handed the Myanmar military and its extremist supporters the perfect tool for distributing and amplifying hate speech and for inciting violence against the Rohingya people. We believe Facebook was negligent: it failed in its policy and in its practice to invest sufficiently in content moderators who spoke Burmese or Rohingya, or local factcheckers with an understanding of the political situation in Myanmar. Moreover, it allowed vast numbers of posts inciting violence or containing hate speech to be published, and permitted many accounts that posted such material to stay online. Finally, Facebook was callous: even after it was warned – as early as 2013 – about the extensive anti-Rohingya content on its platform, it did not do anywhere near enough to intervene. Facebook executives admitted in 2018 that they knew the company needed to “do more”. That was three years ago, but it was only this week, after being notified about our legal actions, that Facebook announced it was closing further military regime accounts. It is the same old story: corporate giants from the global north roaming with impunity in the global south for profit, to the detriment of those who are the most vulnerable in the world. The Rohingya people have no access to the courts in their native land while the Myanmar constitution forbids them having any rights. Even if they did, what form of fair hearing would they have in the courts of a regime that is committing genocide against them? Today, the majority of Rohingya survivors are dispersed across the globe and those that remain continue to face crimes against humanity. The Rohingya people have been displaced to Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, India, the US, Australia, Thailand and Europe. Stateless, without legal rights, they are some of the most vulnerable people in the world: following on from the primary act of genocide, they also face exposure to secondary vulnerabilities such as human trafficking, child labour and gender-based violence. To add insult to injury, the refugee camps endured a disastrous fire and Covid-19 complications. While cultural, ethnic and religious tensions are at the heart of their persecution, the Rohingya people also had environmental injustices thrown at them. The mass “clearance operations” (as the military described them) conveniently cleared swathes of land for oil and gas development. Major international oil giants have planned production-sharing initiatives with the Myanmar regime within the Rakhine basin. The Rohingya people’s plight was sealed by the Shwe gas project, which was designed to supply gas from Rakhine state (the Rohingya homeland) to China’s Yunnan province and factories owned by the Myanmar government and military, and their associates. The project has destroyed local fishing and farming – the backbone of Rohingya society. Land was confiscated to provide clear areas for the pipeline and associated infrastructure. The pipeline has torn through the Arakan Yoma forest ecosystems, created soil erosion and destroyed vast amounts of coral reefs – destroying the cultural infrastructure of the Rohingya people. Nothing short of genocide and ecocide has been carried out against the Rohingya and their homeland. It is now incumbent on the courts of the global north to provide access to justice for the vulnerable people of the global south. After all, it is within the jurisdictions of such established and hallowed courts that these errant Goliaths hide and are based. Such corporates repeatedly attempt to avoid accountability; indeed Facebook has so far only responded to letters alerting them to this litigation by claiming that the company cannot be held liable in the UK but only in Dublin, where it is provided greater legal protections. Corporate empires and tech businesses such as Facebook are purposely contrived to tap dance around corporate liability, but justice must eventually win out. A business model that is inherently global is inherently liable globally. It will be fitting for David to bring down Goliath after the mighty and powerful in government have failed so far to do so.

          "headline": "The network of election lawyers who are making it harder for Americans to vote",
          "bodyText": "A powerful network of conservative election lawyers and groups with links to Donald Trump have spent millions of dollars promoting new and onerous voting laws that many battleground states such as Georgia and Texas have enacted. The moves have prompted election and voting rights watchdogs in the US to warn about the suppression of non-white voters aimed at providing Republicans an edge in coming elections. The lawyers and groups spearheading self-professed election integrity measures include some figures who pushed Trump’s baseless claims of fraud after the 2020 election. Key advocates include Cleta Mitchell with the Conservative Partnership institute; J Christian Adams of the Public Interest Legal Foundation; Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation; Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project; and J Kenneth Blackwell with the America First Policy Institute. These conservative outfits tout their goal as curbing significant voter fraud, despite the fact that numerous courts, the vast majority of voting experts and even former top Trump officials, such as ex-attorney general Bill Barr, concluded the 2020 elections were without serious problems. Watchdogs say that tightening state voting laws endanger the rights of Black voters and other communities of color who historically back Democrats by creating new rules limiting absentee voting and same day registration, while imposing other voting curbs. Among the election lawyers and groups advocating tougher voting laws, Mitchell, a veteran conservative lawyer , boasts the highest profile and has sparked the most scrutiny. She took part in the 2 January call where Trump prodded Georgia’s secretary of state Brad Raffensperger to “find” about 11,780 votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory there. After details emerged about Mitchell’s role on the call, Foley &amp; Lardner, where she had worked for nearly 20 years, mounted an internal review, and she resigned. Trump’s 2 January call also spawned a criminal investigation by Georgia’s Fulton county district attorney that could create problems for Mitchell, say ex-prosecutors, and may bring scrutiny of the lawyer by the House committee looking into the 6 January Capitol attack. Mitchell, who reportedly raised $1m to help fund a baseless investigation of Arizona’s largest county that Trump pushed aggressively, generated more controversy last month when she was named to an advisory board for the federal Election Assistance Commission with backing from her close legal ally Adams whose foundation Mitchell chairs. Using her perch at CPI and another post with the libertarian FreedomWorks that early this year announced a seven-state drive to revamp voting laws led by Mitchell, the lawyer has helped spearhead new state election measures and block two congressional bills – the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act – which Democrats have been trying to enact to counter the wave of new state laws. According to an October update from the Brennan Center for Justice, 19 states had enacted 33 new laws this year that “will make it harder for Americans to vote”. To press for new state voting laws, Mitchell has worked closely with some influential groups quietly backing new measures, such as the American Legislative Exchange Council, a powerful and shadowy group of state legislators that historically promotes model bills where she used to be outside counsel. At an Alec meeting on 1 December in California, Mitchell helped lead a secretive “process working group” session devoted to election and voting law changes and related matters that included several top legal allies such as Adams and Von Spakovsky, according to reports from the Center for Media and Democracy, and Documented. Adams’ foundation, which in 2020 received about $300,000 from the Bradley Foundation, whose board includes Mitchell, has brought lawsuits to defend some of the tough new voting laws in Texas and other states. Top funders of the right’s armada include a family foundation tied to billionaire Richard Uihlein, the Bradley Foundation, and two dark money giants, the Concord Fund and Donors Trust, according to public records. Legal watchdogs raise strong concerns about the new laws promoted by the right in numerous states such as Georgia and Texas, and note that the arguments for changing voting rules seem rife with contradictions. “During the 2021 legislative session, we saw anti-voter organizations push cookie-cutter legislation restricting the right to vote in legislatures across the country,” said Danielle Lang, senior director of voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center. “The same language appeared in state after state without regard for the state’s particular needs. For example, strict cutbacks on access to vote by mail were introduced in states that had wholly positive vote by mail experiences in 2020,” she added. Such complaints have not deterred the legislative blitz by Mitchell with allied lawyers and groups nationwide to change voting laws. Mitchell declined to answer questions from the Guardian about her voting law work or the Georgia investigation, though in an interview early this year with the AP she boasted “I love legislatures and working with legislators”, and revealed that she talks to Trump “fairly frequently”, but provided no details. Mitchell’s ties to Mark Meadows, Trump’s former chief of staff, are palpable, too, including post election as a frenzied and baseless drive was under way to overturn Trump’s loss. On 30 December, according to the Washington Post magazine, Mitchell wrote Meadows and “offered to send some 1,800 pages of documents purporting to support claims of election fraud”. Meadows, who also has a senior post at CPI, now faces contempt charges for reneging on testifying to the House panel about the 6 January Capitol attack and earlier efforts to block Biden from taking office. Mitchell’s effort to support Trump’s baseless case during the 2 January call with Raffensperger could pose new headaches for the lawyer as the Fulton county district attorney’s investigation proceeds. During the call, Mitchell claimed to have evidence of voter fraud, but a top lawyer for Raffensperger’s office replied she was mistaken and faulted her data. “You can’t make yourself much more of a participant to Trump’s efforts that day than actually making statements during the call,” said Michael J Moore, a former US attorney in Georgia. “That’s what Ms Mitchell did. That conduct alone will be enough bait to get the attention of the prosecutors. Whether it’s enough to snare her in the trap, only the DA and the grand jury can answer that.”"

          "bodyText": "With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: The Australian and Victorian governments have announced a deal with Moderna to establish an mRNA vaccine facility in Melbourne by as early as 2024. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the emergent Omicron variant will not “take us back” to more Covid-19 restrictions, and Australia is now prepared to open up and live with the virus. The New South Wales government will push ahead with easing Covid restrictions, including those for unvaccinated people, from Wednesday despite epidemiologists urging caution amid rising case numbers and the Omicron variant. Tasmania is set to reopen to all vaccinated Australians on Wednesday. While businesses will welcome the tourists, some are concerned the health system won’t cope. Gina Cass-Gottlieb, treasurer Josh Frydenberg’s nomination for chair of the competition watchdog, may have to recuse herself from any decisions relating to one of the regulator’s biggest cases if she is approved for the job. A report into the Covidsafe contact-tracing app found it was used just 13 times in the past six months during the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. Have a great evening. We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. One of Australia’s largest national disability insurance scheme providers has apologised to the residents of two troubled group homes after allegations of violence, abuse and neglect were aired at an inquiry. The commission also heard on Tuesday that Life Without Barriers charged residents at a Victoria home a substantial proportion of their disability pension for “rent” despite the property being leased on a peppercorn deal of $1 a month. During hearings in the past week, the disability royal commission has heard violence between residents at the Victoria group home run by the provider was so bad it had become “normal”, while there were also allegations of violence, sexual abuse, and neglect at another home in New South Wales. In one case aired at the commission last week, a resident in the NSW home was hospitalised with a bowel condition and “nearly died” after staff allegedly did not follow care protocol. The provider did not report the incident to the NDIS watchdog. In another incident, the commission heard a Life Without Barriers investigation found there was not enough evidence to substantiate claims a support worker pushed a client at the NSW home to the ground, even though the employee admitted doing so. Read more: An Indigenous prisoner in NSW has been taken to hospital after concerns were raised that the prison was not adequately managing his care for an infection in his hip. The 37-year-old’s lawyer, Lisa De Luca, said the man had been sent to hospital after pressure from her and other advocates for authorities to treat his illness as serious. De Luca said the man, an inmate at Junee correctional centre, 450km west of Sydney, was in a lot of pain, could not walk and had only been offered paracetamol for the infection, she said. “He’s in a bad way, he rang me yesterday,” De Luca said. “(The prison) are saying he saw a doctor. The GP said ‘yes you have an infection it’s in your hip replacement’. The client was in distress.” The lawyer contacted the prison multiple times, which she alleges played down the seriousness of the infection. Read more: The Morrison government has announced an $85m financial package to bolster Fiji’s economic recovery. The support follows a similar commitment last year of $83.5m, and will help the Fijian government finance essential services and support economic growth. The recovery package will have “a focus on fiscal management, private sector recovery, gender equality and social inclusion”, according to a joint statement. Fiji’s attorney-general and minister for economy, Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum, said: As a result of severe travel restrictions, the Covid-19 pandemic’s economic ramifications have been steep across the Pacific. We appreciate Australia’s confidence in Fiji’s financial management through this direct budgetary support that will help alleviate the socioeconomic burden on Fijian society. With more than 90% adults in Fiji now fully vaccinated –– owed in significant part to Australian-donated vaccines –– we look forward to a normalisation of trade and tourism that reconnects our region and allows our recovery to begin in earnest.” Foreign minister Marise Payne said: No country – big or small – has been immune to the Covid-19 pandemic. Australia is pleased to be supporting our close friend and neighbour, Fiji, as the country continues its economic recovery.” Forensic teams searching for evidence in relation to the disappearance of William Tyrrell will finish their operation in coming days. In mid-November, police began a renewed effort to search for evidence at multiple sites in Kendall, the town on the New South Wales mid-north coast where William went missing from the home of his foster grandmother in September 2014. When announcing the renewed search, police were upfront that they were searching for remains. Search sites have included the home where William was last seen, a nearby creek and bushland, with subterranean imaging equipment used to detect inconsistencies in soil. While forensic teams were seen bagging various pieces of cloth throughout the several weeks of searching that was hampered by rain, they are yet to make any announcements in relation the significance of any discoveries made during the dig. In a statement released on Tuesday afternoon, NSW Police said: The NSW Police Force advise current inquiries and search operations being undertaken in the Kendall area are expected to be completed in coming days. The forensic search, which is being conducted under a Coronial Order as part of ongoing investigations into the disappearance of William Tyrrell, has been ongoing since Monday 15 November 2021. Once the search operation is complete, a team will facilitate a repatriation of the site. Further, forensic examinations of seized items and a significant quantity of soil remain ongoing. Deputy State Coroner Harriet Grahame has been appraised, and Strike Force Rosann detectives continue to prepare a brief for the information of Her Honour. Investigators would like to thank the NSW Rural Fire Service, Salvation Army, and the local community for their hospitality and assistance. The NSW Police Force remains committed to finding William Tyrrell and investigations by the Homicide Squad’s Strike Force Rosann are ongoing.” Western Australia’s health minister Roger Cook is speaking about potential Covid exposure in his state. Two truck drivers from South Australia who were in WA between 9-11 December have tested positive to Covid. Cook said close contacts will be notified and exposure sites listed later today. “At this stage we haven’t allocated any contacts as close contacts, they are simply contacts,” Cook said. Cook said authorities’ main concerns lie with the movements of one of the drivers. A baby girl is in a critical condition in hospital in Adelaide after contracting invasive meningococcal disease. The seven-month-old has the W strain of the disease, with seven of her close contacts receiving precautionary antibiotics, reports AAP. South Australia has reported 11 cases of meningococcal so far this year compared to five at the same time last year. The Northern Territory has detected four new Covid-19 cases in the community as an outbreak spreads towards the Western Australian border. One of the infections is linked to a cluster in the town of Katherine, 320km south of Darwin, reports AAP. The other three cases are unconfirmed, but Health Minister, Natasha Fyles, said they are very likely to be genuine infections due to the close contacts. Two of those are in remote Timber Creek near the WA border, 225km east of Kununurra, and the other one is in Kalkarindji, 550km south of Darwin. “Today’s case numbers are nowhere near as high as yesterday but we do expect more cases in the coming days,” Fyles said on Tuesday. It brings the current outbreak to 88 cases but that is expected to rise to 91 later in the day once the three infections are confirmed. It started when an infected woman illegally entered the NT in late October. People in Timber Creek have been ordered to wear a face mask in most public places until 2pm on Friday as a rapid response team prepares to travel to the town. A lockout in the Aboriginal community of Beswick, 425km southeast of Darwin, will end at 2pm Tuesday but masks will need to be worn until the same time on Friday. The mask order is also in place in nearby Barunga Aboriginal community, Katherine and the town of Tennant Creek, 990km south of Darwin. Earlier this afternoon, my colleague Josh Taylor wrote about how a report into the Covidsafe contact-tracing app found it was used just 13 times in the past six months during the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. Nationals senator Matt Canavan, appearing on ABC TV this afternoon, acknowledged the app spearheaded by his government didn’t work, and pointed out he has said this before. He said: That app didn’t work. You have to try different things when you have a global pandemic in front of you...It didn’t work but it was worth trying.” Half of all young people held in detention facilities in Australia are Indigenous and almost two-thirds have yet to be sentenced for a crime, new data shows. It comes after a commitment by Australian governments to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 10 to 12, a move advocates and lawyers say does not go far enough to protect the most vulnerable children from the trauma of being incarcerated. A report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), released on Tuesday, found that 72% of the more than 800 children and young people held in detention on an average night in the June quarter this year were unsentenced – meaning they were either remanded in custody while awaiting the outcome of a court case or held in custody by police. It also found 50% of those in youth detention were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, despite Indigenous children making up just 6% of the 10-17 age cohort in the broader population. Indigenous children were jailed at 20 times the rate of non-Indigenous children as of June 2021 and were also more likely to be jailed without being sentenced and more likely to be under the age of 18 when incarcerated, the report showed. Read more: On a picturesque stretch of Tasmania’s east coast, Kate Bradley’s berry farm and cafe has struggled since Covid drastically cut the number of hungry tourists pulling up for her “desserts with a view”. But as Tasmanians prepare for the border with the rest of the nation to open fully on Wednesday, Bradley shares mixed feelings of anxiety and relief with many in the island state. “I’m a little bit apprehensive about opening up. One part of me says bring it on as quickly as possible, the other says, how are we going to go?” Bradley says. “But we need the business and I’m optimistic. “All my staff are vaccinated and most of our family are too. I’ve got all the cleaning and sanitation gear here and I’m also going to buy for all my staff these rapid antigen tests. I’m as prepared as I can be.” Tasmanians have enjoyed a relatively restriction-free lifestyle throughout 2021, with no community cases of Covid. Apart from a three-day lockdown when a traveller fled hotel quarantine, there have been no orders to wear masks except in hospitals, airports and at large events. Read more of Sally Glaetzer’s piece about Tasmania’s preparations ahead of relaxing its border rules from Wednesday: Health authorities in South Australia have announced 12 new Covid-19 cases have been detected in the most recent 24-hour reporting period. Two of the new cases are reported as being aged care health workers. It comes as a Covid case attended a school assembly in Adelaide, which has prompted hundreds of people in the city’s south report for testing. It will come as no surprise but the Covidsafe contact-tracing app has been used just 13 times in the past six months during the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria. The second report on the operation of the app, released this month, reveals between May and November this year, contact tracers downloaded data from the app just 13 times, with only two potential close contacts identified through the app. The 13 users who uploaded their data showed 331 exchanges between phones using the app, with nine encounters (where the phones were within 1.5m of each other for a period of time). With just two potential close contacts identified. It shows a massive decline in not only people using the app, but contact tracers relying on it in the peak of the Delta wave in Australia. Since the launch 2020, there have been 792 people with Covid uploading data from the app, with 2,829 potential close contacts identified. As previously reported, there are less than two dozen close contacts identified who weren’t found through manual contact tracing. The report says by identifying a previously-unknown exposure date at Mounties in Sydney, two people who were at that venue were found to have tested positive for Covid-19. The report also reveals the measurement was changed to account for Delta in October. Instead of needing people to be in contact for 15 minutes or more, public health officers can now view encounters of between one minute and 15 minutes, meaning fleeting contacts where Delta could have been transmitted could have been captured by the app, provided people were using it. The government still refuses to say how many users continue to use the app. The department said in the report that the Sydney outbreak in June led to a doubling of registrations nationally, and numbers increased again after the fourth and fifth lockdowns in Melbourne. I’ve been watching the ongoing case against sitting judge Salvatore Vasta, who is being personally sued for his handling of a routine property settlement case in 2018, during which he jailed a man for contempt. Such proceedings are remarkably rare. Judges like Vasta, who sits on the federal circuit court bench, are generally protected by judicial immunity, shielding them from being sued as a result of errors. In this case, Vasta has conceded he mistakenly assumed that another judge had previously found the man, known by the pseudonym Mr Stradford, to have breached a court order, making him guilty of contempt. Vasta then sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment, to serve six. Stradford says he endured a torrid time in prison. His lawyers are arguing Vasta, as an inferior court judge, exceeded his jurisdiction in jailing Stradford and has therefore lost the protection of judicial immunity. Jeremy Kirk, SC, acting for Vasta, said in his closing submissions on Tuesday that he accepted Vasta could have found out there had been no hearing on Stradford’s alleged previous contempt prior to jailing him. Kirk said: We accept he could have found it out with reasonable inquiries. It was as I said a significant human mistake, but a human mistake nonetheless. It did have serious consequences, we don’t avoid that conclusion or characterisation either. That being said, many exercises of judicial power can have serious consequences. But Kirk maintained that Vasta is protected by judicial immunity and should not even be before the court. The hearing continues before justice Michael Wigney in the federal court. Commuters in Sydney are being urged to wear masks and socially distance on trains as best they can on Tuesday, as rail employees taking industrial action see the city’s network operate at 25% of its weekday capacity. Dale Merrick, chief operating officer of New South Wales TrainLink, warned that travellers on some lines would have limited personal space in carriages. “Customers travelling to the Hunter Valley, into the Blue Mountains and the South Coast, [are] today effectively experiencing a weekend timetable and as I said, [this is] utterly disappointing that we have had to do so today,” Merrick said. All lines on the Sydney network are affected, with workers refusing to staff foreign-made trains as part of failed enterprise agreement negotiations between the the Rail, Tram and Bus Union and NSW Trains. Industrial action was also taken last week, and Merrick said he was “greatly disappointed that again today our employees and the union have taken this action”. Merrick said negotiations with the union are ongoing. Two dogs have been rescued from mine shafts by specialist Victorian firefighters in separate incidents in the same week. The Country Fire Authority’s Bendigo-based Oscar1 Brigade rescued Bruno the bull-Arab on 5 December after he fell down a mine shaft at Castlemaine Diggins National Park, reports AAP. Less than six days later, the brigade was called to rescue Terry the kelpie-cross from a mine shaft at Woodend. “The owner said they were camping and the dog just went for a run, but as it was night and you can’t see these mine shafts at the best of times, he just fell down the hole,” Captain Daniel McMahon said. “It was a 15-metre shaft but we thought it may have been a false floor, meaning there could have been another 10 or 20 metres below if the floor had collapsed. “Terry was in surprisingly good nick though with no injuries, so we hooked him up to the ropes and Woodend brigade helped pull him up.” McMahon said he was pleased both incidents ended with a good result. “Rescuing a dog in a mineshaft is a serious job, but for us, it also doubles as real-world experience in case we are called to a community member in the same unfortunate situation,” he said. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, says the emergent Omicron variant will not “take us back” to more Covid-19 restrictions, and Australia is now prepared to open up and live with the virus. Announcing a deal with Moderna and the Victorian government that will see a new manufacturing facility built in Melbourne by as early as 2024, Morrison said the country’s high vaccination rate meant Australia could “continue to move forward”. “We’re not letting Omicron take us back,” Morrison said. “We’ve decided as a country to live with this virus and Australians have worked so hard for that. “Australia can now open up. This Christmas we’re about to have is a gift Australians have given to themselves by the way they’ve worked together with the settings that we’ve put in place.” Morrison also conceded the Coalition had made mistakes during the pandemic, including in the early phases of the vaccination rollout, but said these had been overcome. Read more: The New South Wales auditor general has reportedly refused to sign off on the state’s finances, prompting fears public assets could be sold to cover up a $10bn government “accounting sham”, reports AAP. Margaret Crawford has told Treasury she will not approve the budget, Nine Newspapers report, unless a solution is found to what she described as “significant accounting issues” with the government’s Transport Asset Holding Entity. The state-owned corporation was set up in 2015 to own NSW’s transport assets but accountants and public servants have since warned it is being used to inflate the NSW budget. NSW Treasury had miscalculated the benefit of TAHE to the state budget to the tune of $10 billion over the next 10 years, a parliamentary inquiry has heard. Former transport department secretary Rod Staples has also warned the setup blurs the lines of responsibility for maintenance of the assets and public safety. The government is scrambling to find a solution, two days before it is due to hand down its half-yearly budget update. Opposition leader Chris Minns fears Sydney Trains, NSW trains or the entire Transport department could be sold to plug the massive hole in the budget. If you’re still unclear on what TAHE is, here’s an explainer we prepared earlier. Australia’s drugs regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), has tested a number of imported products labelled as ivermectin and found that they are counterfeit. The products Iversun-12, Covimectin-12, and Ivilife-12 failed laboratory tests. In a statement the TGA said the findings should “serve as a warning against buying ivermectin products from unverified online sellers”. “Counterfeit products may contain undeclared and hazardous ingredients that could cause a serious adverse reaction. They may also be contaminated because of a lack of manufacturing and testing standards.” The TGA is working with the Australian Border Force to target counterfeit and unlawful ivermectin entering Australia. Border force will refer suspected counterfeit products to the TGA for further direction. The TGA has also warned against self-medicating with unproven Covid-19 drugs like ivermectin. “It is very dangerous to take large doses of ivermectin and there is insufficient evidence to validate its safe and effective use for Covid-19,” the TGA said. As Covid cases in New South Wales continue to rise, the state government has committed to its plan to lift restrictions for unvaccinated residents from tomorrow. On Tuesday, as NSW recorded 804 new cases, the government insisted it had considered all the options but was committed to easing restrictions on Wednesday in order to return the state “back to a full life of normality”, AAP reports. From Wednesday, unvaccinated people will be allowed back in pubs, cafes, gyms and shops and mask mandates will be eased. The NSW health minister Brad Hazzard made the comments as health authorities are battling to contain an outbreak of the Omicron variant, with a total of 85 cases now confirmed in the state. “We’re not about to start backflipping on issues we promised,” Hazzard said. Hazzard also warned “once the unvaccinated are mixing with the vaccinated, the numbers will increase even further”. “That’s worrying because that puts pressure on our doctors and nurses and our frontline health system,” he said. He was scathing about people who refused to get vaccinated, saying they were “very vulnerable to what is a rapidly increasing number of Covid cases”. A decade of reforms to save the Murray-Darling basin could be undermined by New South Wales’ plans to license too much flood water harvesting, with insiders warning that NSW’s processes will result in irrigators being licensed to take billions of litres of flows without proper environmental assessment. Two members of the four-person Healthy Floodplains Review committee, which hears appeals from irrigators about their proposed flood plain water entitlements, say the system is “sloppy”, “flawed” and should be reviewed immediately. They say over the last 12 months the committee has been swamped with more than 400 appeals, involving 1,300 separate flood plain harvesting structures; the committee is overwhelmed and applications are often accompanied by poor evidence. Irrigators, they say, are now “consultant shopping” to achieve outcomes many times larger than the initial assessment by the Natural Resources Access Regulator, which conducted an on-the-ground survey of dams and other structures used in flood plain harvesting.

Retail giant Woolworths has endured one of its most challenging trading periods following the emergence of the highly contagious Delta variant of Covid-19, AAP reports. The supermarket operator said its stock flows and operating rhythm were rocked by the scare in the first six months of fiscal 2022. Chief executive Brad Banducci said today in a market update: The first half of F22 has been one of the most challenging halves we have experienced in recent memory due to the far-reaching impact of the Covid Delta strain. He said the costs of trading in a Covid environment would affect first-half earnings. Woolworths, which will release its first-half results in late February, expects to see a direct cost hit of $150 million in its Australian Food division in addition to direct costs of between $60 million to $70 million. Australian Food earnings before interest and tax are forecast to be between $1.19 billion and $1.22 billion, compared with about $1.33 billion in the same period in fiscal 2021. Banducci said during a call with analysts also saw challenges in Christmas trade, namely sourcing goods due to the supply chain difficulties of the pandemic. It’s not going to be an easy ride into Christmas. We’ll have a white knuckle ride – not in demand, but in having the stock there for them to buy. Consumer electronics and some toys were proving difficult to source for Big W stores. The retail giant will also book a bonus payment for staff of between $35m and $40m as a way of saying thank you for their efforts during the pandemic. Shares in Woolworths Group on the ASX were down 8.5% to $37.08 at 11.44 AEDT. I just want to make sure no one has forgotten that THIS was just said at a press conference. Here is the full statement from the PM’s office about the new agreement with Moderna to produce mRNA vaccines in Australia by 2024. Jam Land, the company part-owned by the energy minister Angus Taylor and his brother Richard, illegally poisoned critically endangered grasslands and should restore native habitat, a ministerial review of the original investigation has concluded. The decision, published late Friday, follows an 18-month review of the original determination which ordered Jam Land to restore 103 hectares of grasslands on a property in the New South Wales Monaro region. It comes more than five years after the company poisoned the grasslands, known as the natural temperate grassland of the south-eastern highlands, on a property in Corrowong. You can read the full report below: New Zealanders stuck overseas and Kiwi business groups have reacted with despair to Jacinda Ardern’s border rethink, AAP reports. The change-up was the biggest talking point in New Zealand’s Parliament House on Tuesday, where politicians have returned for the last sitting week of the year. On Monday, Ardern announced the planned reopening to Australia-based New Zealanders, set for 17 January, would be subject to a last-minute review in early January. We haven’t changed any decisions at this stage around reconnection ... but I think people understand we need to review the latest details and evidence around Omicron. The review is in contrast to previous statements from Ardern’s ministers they were “very committed” to the date, and Kiwis should make travel plans for then, knowing they could bypass hotel quarantine for self-isolation. Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins insisted on Tuesday: It’s looking very likely that we’ll proceed. But we can’t discount the possibility that Omicron could prove to be a spanner in the works. The border rethink comes amid surging vaccine rates in New Zealand. As of Tuesday, 89% of Kiwis aged 12 or over are fully vaccinated, and 94% have had one dose. New Zealand’s reticence to reopen contrasts with shifts from hold-out Australian states. After hitting vaccine targets, Queensland has opened up without self-isolation requirements for fully vaccinated travellers, Tasmania is following suit on Wednesday, and Western Australia will do so from February 5. Business NZ chief executive Kirk Hope said the NZ government was “overly cautious”. They’re using an approach that has suited them well. But it’s increasingly frustrating for business, who are going to be at a competitive disadvantage to Australia. The (border rethink) signal has created quite a lot of uncertainty for business, which had been looking forward to the door opening on the border even just a bit. The border review – slated for 7 or 8 January – has drawn scorn from opposition parties. Opposition leader Christopher Luxon – the big winner from polling released on Tuesday that indicated 20% of New Zealanders rated him their preferred prime minister – said the time had come to reopen. The rest of the world is moving on. They are finding a way to move forward ... it is about risk management. We have to find a way through to manage risk intelligently. Separated families are also aghast, given many had put off applying for quarantine places in recent weeks believing the border would be open to them from 17 January. Just on that ACCC news from before, here is the treasurer’s tweet on his top pick: A-League Men’s and Women’s clubs are expected to receive a cash windfall after an US private equity firm bought a minority share in the body which oversees both competitions. Technology investment specialist Silver Lake has struck the deal with the Australian Professional Leagues (APL), which is responsible for the operation and commercialisation of the country’s professional football competitions. It’s understood the deal is for a 30% stake in the body and is worth approximately $130m. The investment will be used to build a digital media platform. You can read more in the article below: Just out of the NSW press conference, chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant has confirmed that the cluster which started at a prom-themed event at Newcastle nightclub has ballooned, with 150 of the 650 attendees now testing positive to Covid-19. Yesterday there were 28 Covid cases in the Hunter New England region, today this jumped to 224. Just back to that question Scott Morrison was asked about Karen Andrews suggesting that Australia would have domestic mRNA manufacturing capacity by October this year: Queensland chief health officer John Gerrard says Queensland won’t be following NSW in removing restrictions for unvaccinated people anytime soon: We are not even looking at removing the mandate, it’s not even something that’s on the agenda, so that that is not a good plan at all. Luckily it seems that this Queensland community case was not infectious while out and about. Queensland’s Covid-19 graphics are extremely confusing nowadays, as they don’t seem to count infected people from other states who test positive while out and about in Queensland as local cases. But the long and short of it is that one new case has been detected in the community. South Australia will find out by the end of the week what restrictions will be eased once the state reaches 90% double vaccination. Vaccination vans which have travelled to Aboriginal communities around Victoria have helped push the vaccine rate of First Nations people in the state up to 83.5%, the Victorian Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation has said. As of this week, the Australian Immunisation Register states that 87.8% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 15 and over in Victoria have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 83.5% have received their second dose. The high vaccine rate reflects a steady climb up from low figures in September, when it was revealed that a record-keeping error meant the actual Indigenous vaccination rate in Victoria was less than half what had previously been reported. It follows nine weeks of targeted vaccination campaigns in the form of vaccination vans which have travelled to Mildura, Shepparton, Warrnambool, Seymore, Wodonga, Benalla, Morwell, Drouin and Warragul. VACCHO chief executive Jill Gallagher: I’m so proud of our community in welcoming the vans with open arms – it has been incredible. We have seen some great outcomes achieved by the ACCO vaccine van. This reflects what trust looks like in the community ... I have also been particularly pleased to see so many elders coming to visit the vans to have a yarn and get vaccinated. Aboriginal communities across Australia have been targeted by misinformation campaigns, which have slowed the vaccine rollout. Scott Morrison has been pressed on what he meant when he said no government had got everything right during the pandemic. I mean – and I said this last night at the Sydney Institute – no government has got everything right, but no government can in a pandemic. To think that that was 100% strike rate on every decision, I think Australians understand and I think the honesty of governments in being able to say that clearly – I know the Victorian government feel the same way . But what I can tell us is we did make the big calls and we did get the balance right and the proof of that is the fact that we have saved 40,000 lives based on looking at the average amongst the OECD. Think about that – 40,000 lives saved because of how Australia has responded to this pandemic. One of the strongest advanced economies to come through the pandemic in the world and one of the highest vaccination rates. That is the proof of the combination of decisions and responses that our government and, work being other governments around the country, have made. No country gets it all right but I can tell you we got it right a lot more often than so many other places around the world and Australians are safer today and better prepared today for what’s coming next than almost any other country in the world. For once the prime minister and the Victorian government seem to be on the same page when it comes to Covid-19. Here is what Victorian deputy premier James Merlino has to say in response to that same question: In terms of what the settings will be in this week, the minister for health will make an announcement later in the week. It’s based on the latest health advice but what we have done is in line with the national plan and we can do it because Victorians have been so fantastic in getting vaccinated. But the answer to your question, whether it’s Omicron or Delta or the next variant, it’s vaccines that protects the citizen, protects families and means that we can enjoy the freedoms that we do right now. Reporter: Is lifting the masks going backwards or keeping masks on, say, for a few weeks, in your mind is that going backwards? Or if they said we need to do it that would be OK? Scott Morrison: Well, we had a pause on the opening that starts tomorrow and we did that because we were waiting for the picture to emerge a bit more clearly before taking that next step and now we feel confident to take that next step and states and territories are doing exactly the same thing. You know, over the course of this pandemic, sometimes there has been that need for patience. And I know that can be frustrating. I welcome, on the issue of patience, Western Australia giving a clear timetable about when it’s opening. Tomorrow, Tasmania opens. Tremendous, just in time for the Tassie Test next month, which I’m thrilled to see happening. But all of that, I think, goes to the national plan that [Jodie] McVernon from Doherty helped us construct with the premiers. We’re in phase C now and we look forward to getting to phase D, and that’s all about living with the virus. Scott Morrison says Covid-19 health decisions can no longer be based just on case numbers: We’re now in a different phase. Cases are not the issue and I know over a period of time we may have become conditioned to case numbers being the trigger. That’s not the case ... Now, here in Victoria, as you rightly say, you’ve been having cases of over 1,000 a day for some time and the Victorian public hospital system and health system is coping strongly. They did the work, they did the planning, New South Wales is the same. So that is the way forward. Questions have turned to the NSW situation now, where the state plans to lift a large number of restrictions on unvaccinated people tomorrow despite today being its most infectious day in more than 10 weeks. Scott Morrison is asked what he thinks of this but the prime minister says we can’t start walking backwards: We’re taking Omicron incredibly seriously. We had a very long discussion about this in the meeting with premiers and chief ministers last week. We’re not letting Omicron take us back, though. We’ve decided as a country to live with this virus and Australians have worked so hard for that. When we have vaccination rates about to hit 90%, one of the highest in the world, that means we have choices today that we didn’t have 18 months ago and that means that we can continue to move forward. Tomorrow, we will begin welcoming students to Australia again, skilled migrants, working holiday-makers, under those visa programs. From tomorrow, Korea, as I announced yesterday with the president, and Japan, also join with Singapore and New Zealand. But we have watched this very closely and made careful decisions and taken the best medical advice on this. Reporter: Last year Karen Andrews promised mRNA manufacturing by October of this year. Is that a failed promise? Scott Morrison: No, that’s not what she said. I know that’s been misrepresented, particularly by our opponents in the Labor party who seem to think you can do this by time travel. I’ll ask Angus to comment on that. Angus Taylor: That’s not what Karen said. The point she made was the timeline depends on getting access to the intellectual property. We have that now. Getting access to a site. We’re close to having that ... and we’re committed to getting this done as fast as possible. It’s important to point out there’s been no development of a new mRNA manufacturing facility anywhere else in the world since the pandemic struck and this will be one of the first in the world. We’re in a good situation to get onto this as quickly as possible, and make it as effective as possible, not just for health outcomes but also for jobs, development of a medical technology hub and development of capabilities I talked about. NOOOOOOOOOOOO Scott Morrison just added to this accidentally horrific metaphor with “meet and beat”: Angus and I and Greg like to talk about meeting and beating of targets. It’s like shake and bake. Meet and beat. And that’s what we want to see happen here. We want this on the ground as quickly as possible. Am I going crazy? Is this satire? Does anyone want to tell this Moderna representative what “pitching a tent” actually means? I want to thank you, prime minister, acting Premier, and other ministers and most importantly the Doherty. I’m thrilled and proud to be here today, to announce that Moderna will be pitching tent in Australia, upon the finalisation of our agreement. We have played a critical role during the pandemic, and as we have all learned, pandemics can come at the time we least expect them. Anyone else weirdly shocked that official army regalia comes in a short sleeve option? The Moderna man at the press conference (apologies to you, but you didn’t say your name at the start) says a definite location has not yet been locked in for the new mRNA manufacturing hub. Since all the politicians are speaking from the Doherty Institue, named after Australia Nobel laureate Prof Peter Doherty, I think it’s only fair that I once again share his most iconic tweet. A tweet that I genuinely believe changed Australian culture forever. Josh Frydenberg has put forward lawyer Gina Cass-Gottlieb as a poacher-turned-gamekeeper candidate to chair the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. If approved by the states and territories, Cass-Gottlieb will replace Rod Sims, who has been in the job for a decade, when his term expires in March. It’s a big change for Cass-Gottlieb, a partner at law firm Gilbert &amp; Tobin, who has spent much of her career bashing Sims’ ACCC over mergers and acquisitions on behalf of big companies, as well as representing clients under investigation by it and other regulators. On approval by the states and territories, who haven’t withheld the thumbs-up in living memory, she will become the first woman to chair the ACCC, one of Australia’s most powerful regulators. Frydenberg thanked Sims for his service: Mr Sims has made an outstanding contribution to competition, consumer and infrastructure policy in his time at the ACCC, helping to advance world-leading reforms, including most recently with respect to the digital platforms ... I also acknowledge his wider contribution to public policy during his distinguished public service career which spans more than three decades. I wish him well for the future. James Merlino: This is a huge announcement because this is the first time in the southern hemisphere we’ll have mRNA manufacturing based in this nation. And 25m vaccines, the ability to ramp up to 100m, and it’s not just in regards to vaccine developments, whether it’s variants of coronavirus right now, pandemics of the future, but beyond, beyond that, treatment of cancer, treatment of rare diseases, this is a massive game-changer and to have that manufacturing capacity, the research capacity, right here in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, is a great thing. This will create jobs: 1,000 jobs, 500 in construction, 500 ongoing, but beyond that, it saves lives. Whether it’s dealing with a pandemic, treatment of cancer, treatment of rare diseases, this is a major, major announcement. Victoria’s deputy premier James Merlino is speaking now (the Moderna deal is a collaboration between the state and federal governments), and seems to have a new slogan: Boston, London, Melbourne. Merlino: When you think about medical research and biotechnology, think about Boston, think about London, and you think about Melbourne. This is the place to be. Boston, London and Melbourne, the three great leading cities when it comes to medical research and biotechnology. In Melbourne and Victoria, 30,000 jobs in medical research, biotechnology, across our industry, universities, and institutes such as the Doherty. Forty per cent of the nation’s medical tech and biotech companies are based in Melbourne, and 60% of the nation’s pharmaceutical exports come from Victoria. So this is a great announcement and it’s the logical place to do it. Scott Morrison: We are building our sovereign capability here. Which protects Australia’s national interests. Our sovereign capability to manufacture these vaccines here in Australia. Up to 100m-a-year* capacity to do this in this arrangement is extraordinary. But we’ve got it right. We’ve spent the time to get it right. This is not an arrangement that you just rush into and do a deal on a coffee shop somewhere. This is something you do the meticulous work on. We worked with a number of states and we came to the very, I think, sensible conclusion here in the Victoria, we have the strong foundation to continue to build, not just a great research and collaboration infrastructure, but a powerhouse of medical manufacturing, that plays exactly into our economic goals of securing the economic recovery, 1 million Australians are now employed in manufacturing. *But remember, the first year isn’t until 2024. So, obviously when chatting about doing a deal to set up domestic vaccine manufacturing, the elephant in the room is Scott Morrison’s decision last year to do a deal to produce AstraZeneca domestically, which ended up being, well ... not the best move. The prime minister is going with the “well, everyone got stuff wrong and I promise we are getting it right this time” tactic to explain this: It was in this country that already we have produced here in Victoria, 25m AstraZeneca vaccines. In August of 2020, we did the deal to ensure that could be done right here in Australia and that provided the workhorse, the backbone of the vaccine program that’s seen us get to where we are today. But we also know during this pandemic, as we have learned many lessons, no government has got everything right, I’m sure that James [Merlino] would agree with me, we all sought to work together to make the best calls we possibly can. But the mRNA vaccines have proven to be, I argue, the biggest scientific discovery over the course of this pandemic. OK, jumping down to Victoria now where the prime minister is speaking from the Doherty Institute in Melbourne. This morning he is announcing that Australia has made a deal with the pharmaceutical company Moderna to create an mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility in Australia. (It won’t be functional until 2024.) Scott Morrison seems to be feeling a little poetic and, dare I say, sentimental this morning. It was in February 2020, I was here with Greg Hunt, and I got to stare in the face of the virus because it was reproduced here for the first time anywhere in the world. Since that day, together, Australians have been staring this virus down. We have made some big calls. We got the balance right, I believe, working together as a country. Working together with states and territories, working together with our health and medical, science and research community, that is enabled us to achieve incredible things in this country. We have the lowest fatality rate of almost every country in the world, saved more than 30,000 lives. A number of flood warnings have just been published for NSW: Brad Hazzard: The numbers of people in the hospital at the moment are fairly low. There’s only 21 in ICU today. I think there’s one on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or Ecmo. The numbers are slight this morning. But once the unvaccinated are mixing with the vaccinated, the numbers will increase even further. That’s worrying because that puts pressure on our doctors and nurses and our frontline health system. I said this once before, I will say it again – to the unvaccinated, it’s not fair to health workers that you can be so selfish to think that being unvaccinated is OK. It’s not. It’s the doctors and nurses in our hospitals who then have to care for you when you come to our hospital. I have no doubt there will be people coming to hospitals because they have been unvaccinated. Brad Hazzard is asked if he is ruling out the possibility that the Newcastle area could go into lockdown after a spike of cases in the area: New South Wales is not planning on any snap lockdowns. What we’re planning on is making sure the community understand the need to have boosters and being vaccinated. Brad Hazzard: The circumstances of what is occurring right now in the Hunter district, where we are seeing substantial increases in numbers of Covid, is a very telling reminder to all of us, particularly as we open up to the unvaccinated. My message to the vaccinated, you might be out and about now but you are very vulnerable to what is a rapidly increasing number of Covid cases here in NSW. Go and get vaccinated. Give up on the current views you have and going get vaccinated.* *Wow! If only there were some legal incentives that would encourage people to go get vaccinated! NSW health minister Brad Hazzard is speaking now after the state recorded its most infectious day in 10 weeks. And yes, there is a brass band playing Feliz Navidad in the background. Though NSW Health is easing a huge number of restrictions for unvaccinated people tomorrow, Hazzard says he worried about the lack of Covid-19 booster shot take-up: I am concerned not enough people are actually understanding the benefit of getting the booster. A third shot of vaccine is going to make all the difference. What we do know, is it does not matter whether you have had AstraZeneca or Pfizer or Moderna, whatever you may have had, it does drop off in terms of the effect on your immunity. Particularly if over 60, immunity drops off after three to four months and we need to go and get a booster. The wild weather that’s been battering the east coast of Australia has led to widespread flooding in multiple states and a surge in insurance claims, reports Jack Gramenz from AAP. NRMA Insurance says the number of weather-related damage claims during the spring season, which included NSW’s wettest November on record, was 35% above average. All up, 10,000 homes claimed weather damage from the insurer in Queensland, NSW and the ACT. NRMA data shows nearly half the claims were for hail damage in the Coffs Harbour region on the NSW north coast in October, and wild weather was responsible for two-thirds of the claims. The insurer’s natural perils executive manager Mark Leplastrier says it’s been “an ominous start to storm season”. Spring featured some of the most unpredictable and extreme weather we have seen in many years, and with a La Niña system now declared, we could be in for more wet weather over summer ... There has been some relief from flooding in NSW at least, with river heights dropping in several areas around the state after persistent wet weather. The Hunter River has receded below minor flood levels, as have the Severn and Hawkesbury rivers. Minor to moderate flooding is still occurring along the Gwydir, Macquarie, Macintyre, Bogan, Murrumbidgee, Warrego, Paroo and Snowy rivers. There is still a risk of major flooding on the Namoi, Lachlan, Barwon, and Weir rivers. The Namoi could send Wee Waa back into isolation with a major flood peak predicted on Tuesday night. The river is expected to peak near 7.1 metres. Lepastrier said climate change impacts could make severe storms more frequent over a wider area, and seven out of 10 people in a survey said they worried natural disasters were increasing in frequency and severity. Disaster assistance is available in local government areas around NSW. The clean-up will come too late for many of the state’s farmers, who have had their hopes of a prosperous harvest crushed by weeks of heavy rain and flooding. A survey of rural confidence by Rabobank released on Tuesday showed confidence was high leading into the harvest season, with 88% of respondents predicting excellent conditions to continue, before flooding devastated crops. Rabobank central NSW regional manager Toby Mendl said: A few weeks ago, it was hard to imagine that cropping conditions in NSW could get any better but we now have a situation where some growers, who had been preparing to harvest record-yielding crops, will actually harvest nothing. Domestic border restrictions in Australia have eased as local cases of the Omicron variant rise. Overseas, the UK has raised its Covid alert level and reintroduced restrictions amid concerns that Omicron poses a “rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services”. Here’s what we know so far about Omicron and how worried Australia should be about the new variant of concern.

Alas, he was silenced. Find out what happened in the article below: Firefighters will be able to more accurately predict whims of deadly bushfires thanks to new modelling it is hoped will save lives and properties, reports AAP’s Tiffanie Turnbull. Australia’s national science agency CSIRO and the NSW Rural Fire Service have developed the country’s most advanced model for predicting the speed and behaviour of eucalypt forest fires. Eucalypt forests make up more than 70% of Australia’s forests, and have featured in some of its fiercest fires. The model is a mathematical description of how a fire responds to environmental conditions, and will be rolled out nationally this summer. CSIRO bushfire behaviour researcher and leader of the project Miguel Cruz said: This model was built using analysis of the most extensive set of data gathered from observations of large, high-intensity experimental fires and wildfires, collated from around the country over the past 40 years. Firefighters input forecast weather and wind information from the Bureau of Meteorology, data on the fuel load within the forest from vegetation databases, and patterns of existing behaviour of a fire from fireground reports. CSIRO bushfire behaviour researcher Andrew Sullivan said the new model would give firefighters an extra advantage in controlling complex and difficult blazes. Firefighters often have to battle steep terrain and challenging conditions just to reach the fire ... Critically, this model can accurately predict the speed that a fire front will advance across a landscape, which is essential to enable authorities to efficiently identify threats, issue bushfire warning messages, signal evacuations and plan fire suppression actions. A real estate agency in Queensland has come under fire after it emailed tenants offering them the chance to buy a Christmas gift for their landlords. Kanik &amp; Co, located near Brisbane, sent out an email to tenants offering to facilitate the purchasing of select gifts, along with any “handwritten notes”, that would be delivered to the owner of the property. Some of the offered gifts include a $50 “white wine grazing box”, a $55 “festive sweets basket”, a $70 “self care hamper”, a $99 “foodies hamper” and a $115 gift called “all things golden”. You can read the full report below: A reminder that this significant jump in Covid-19 cases in NSW comes before a huge range of vaccinated economy restrictions being lifted across the state tomorrow. From 15 December the following rules apply to everyone, regardless of vaccination status: Masks will only be required on public transport and planes, at airports and for indoors front-of-house hospitality staff who are not fully vaccinated QR check-in is only required for hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals or memorial services, personal services, pubs, small bars, registered clubs, nightclubs, strip clubs, sex on premises, and indoor music festivals with more than 1,000 people No person limit in gyms, indoor recreation and sporting facilities Non-critical retail reopens to all No person limit for personal services including hairdressers, spas, beauty and nail salons, tattoo and massage parlours Employers allow staff to work from home at their discretion International travellers who are not fully vaccinated still need to quarantine on arrival for 14 days No limit to number of visitors in your home No limit to number of people for outdoor public gatherings All visitors to residents in aged care facilities and disability homes permitted in line with their policies No person limit in hospitality venues Singing and dancing is permitted indoors and outdoors for all Travel between greater Sydney and regional NSW permitted for all Carpooling permitted for all Caravan parks and camping grounds open for all No person limit for major recreation facilities like stadiums, theme parks and racecourses No person limit for entertainment facilities including cinemas and theatres No person limit for information and education facilities including art galleries, museums and libraries No person limit for outdoor public gatherings and recreation Music festivals reopen with 20,000 person limit Amusement centres and play centres open to all Weddings and funerals permitted with no person limit, eating and drinking allowed while standing and dancing permitted for all Singing and dancing indoors permitted by all Places of worship open to all Rules via AAP. The deaths of two Queensland infant twins with special needs is being investigated by child protection police, reports AAP. Emergency services were called to an apartment block in Bungalow, an inner suburb of Cairns, on Monday morning. They were unable to revive the two infants, who both had special medical needs. On Tuesday morning police said the Cairns child protection investigation unit was investigating their deaths. Australia’s eight planned nuclear submarines will cost $70bn at an “absolute minimum” and it’s “highly likely” to be more than that, defence analysts say. With inflation, the cost could be as high as $171bn, according to a report from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. The thinktank’s report contains a series of estimates ranging from low to high and concedes that estimating the final cost of the project is necessarily an “extremely assumption-rich activity”. Under the low range, for a smaller submarine with a more efficient build, the “constant” cost (not including inflation) would be about $70bn. Including inflation (the “out-turned” cost), it would be $116bn. You can read the full report below: Here is the full statement from the Victorian government on the Moderna manufacturing facility that’s set to be operational by 2024. Scott Morrison has called on states and territories to ease their last remaining Covid-19 restrictions, as Western Australia announced plans to reopen its hard border to the rest of the nation, reports AAP’s Andrew Brown. Speaking at the Sydney Institute’s annual dinner on Monday night, Morrison urged jurisdictions to “facilitate, rather than dictate”: Australians kept their side of the deal, it is time for governments to now keep theirs; to step back and let Australians step forward ... To put Australians back in charge of their own lives, relying on the connecting points and relationships that exist between the state and the individual. It comes as West Australian premier Mark McGowan announced the state would relax its border restrictions from 5 February. The prime minister congratulated WA for making it to the 80% vaccination level and for announcing plans to scrap its hard border: Australia is going to be connected and together again ... This will be welcome news for thousands of Western Australians looking forward to reuniting with family and friends after so long apart. The prime minister also confirmed that a two-week pause on allowing visa holders to enter the country without an exemption would end as scheduled on Wednesday. This has not yet been independently confirmed by Guardian Australia but Nine News is reporting that NSW is set to record 804 new Covid-19 cases today, a significant bump up from previous days. We will have to wait till 9am to find out for sure. Fresh doubts have emerged over whether Australia can rely on boosting soil carbon to achieve its net zero emissions goals with a NSW government report predicting the land sector will become a significant source of emissions in a warmer climate. The concerns are raised in a report on soil health trends in NSW forests, published without fanfare by the state’s Natural Resources Commission. It examined soil organic carbon levels in eastern NSW forests and how they may be affected by projected rising temperatures and shifting rainfall patterns. They found major losses could be expected, particularly for southern forests, suggesting “forest managers will have to implement appropriate soil carbon-enhancing strategies even to just maintain current SOC levels”.

NSW Health is battling to contain several large transmission events and there are now 64 cases of the new Omicron strain on record. Anyone who was at Newcastle’s Finnegan’s Hotel in Darby Street on Friday between 6.30pm and 2.30am on Saturday, has been advised to get tested and self-isolate for seven days. NSW Health said on Monday night: All household contacts of close contacts must also be tested and self-isolate until a negative result is received by everyone in the household ... It is likely some of these cases have the Omicron variant of concern. NSW Health is appealing for anyone who didn’t check in using the QR code to also get tested and self-isolate. The latest alert comes after cases linked to an outbreak that started at Newcastle’s Argyle House nightclub on Wednesday spiked from 24 to 84 on Monday, with a number of the cases also likely to be the Omicron variant. Nearly 700 people checked into the venue and chief health officer Kerry Chant on Monday said it was “incredibly important” that anyone who was at the venue gets a test, “given the high transmission at this venue”. Here is a little blog treat to get you through the morning! Religious Australians will be given greater freedom of speech than non-religious expressions of conscience under the Coalition’s bill, a leading academic has warned. Prof George Williams raised the issue in a submission to the human rights committee inquiry into the religious discrimination package. The bill faces an uncertain future with two inquiries running over summer and some religious organisations threatening to withdraw their support over the Morrison government’s deal with four Liberal moderates to strengthen protections for gay students at religious schools at the same time. You can read the full report here: Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce says WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should not be extradited to the United States to face charges. Joyce has penned an opinion piece for the Sydney Morning Herald stating that he believes a trial should be held in the UK or Assange should return to Australia, as he wasn’t on American soil at the time the alleged espionage offences occurred: As an individual, whether you like him or despise him, it is beyond him, given his circumstances, to protect his rights by himself. So we must hope for the British courts to do so, and we will judge its society accordingly. I have never met him and, from observation, don’t respect him. I presume I would not like him. And I view these facts as a clarion call to be all the more vigilant that he is treated just as one of my most powerful colleagues or dearest friends would be. Joyce also noted that Assange “was not in breach of any Australian laws at the time of his actions”, urging the UK courts not to cave to pressure from the US to send him over. Good day everyone and welcome to this glorious Tuesday! It’s Matilda Boseley here and I hope your morning is going better than mine as my phone appears to have died. Why don’t we jump into the news to try and distract me from my woes! One of the big headlines today: Australia is getting its own mRNA vaccine manufacturing facility ... but not until 2024. The factory will be built in Victoria in partnership with vaccine manufacturer Moderna and is expected to produce as many as 100m vaccines each year. It’s unlikely this factory will make much of an impact on the Covid-19 pandemic, with at least a two-year lead time until jabs start coming of the production line. Prime minister Scott Morrison, who will make an official announcement later this morning, said it would help the country be prepared should there be another pandemic. In other news, the NSW rail network is once again being put to the test with the union taking industrial action today. The Rail, Tram and Bus Union said it would refuse to drive foreign-made trains as part of ongoing enterprise agreement negotiations with NSW Trains, a move that will impact about 75% of trains on the network. RTBU NSW secretary Alex Claassens said in a statement that he was hopeful the state government would come to the bargaining table. It’s disappointing that another week has passed, and there’s still no indication [of] the NSW government stepping in and doing the right thing ... The NSW government has been refusing to commit to providing workers and commuters with basic guarantees around hygiene, safety and privatisation for many months now ... We’re very aware of the impact this will have on commuters, but we also know that not taking action will leave workers and commuters at risk. As part of the EBA negotiations, the union wants an end to privatisation, safety standards maintained and a commitment to retaining current hygiene levels while not relying on contractors to provide it."

          "bodyText": "Immediate action must be taken to prevent trafficking and exploitation of children in orphanages, according to a report published on Monday. International children’s charity Lumos says that an estimated 5.4 million children worldwide live in institutions that cannot meet their needs and neglect their rights and where they are exposed to multiple forms of exploitation and harm. The report is the first to identify global patterns of institution-related trafficking, taking into account evidence from 84 organisations in 45 countries around the world. It highlights instances of sexual exploitation, as well as children being forced to work and coerced into performing for foreign donors to secure more funding. In some instances, children were left malnourished and held in cramped, unhygienic conditions to attract money from donors and volunteers. Lumos also found cases where the institution operated as a base from which children were made available to perpetrators for several hours or days before being returned. The charity says many vulnerable children enter institutions with forged identity documents, including false parental death certificates or paperwork attesting to abandonment, and are “coached to pose as orphans in the presence of volunteers and other visitors”. They are then trafficked out of the same institutions into other forms of exploitation, including sex work and forced begging. In Ghana, trafficked children were subjected to some of the worst forms of abuse, with children sold by institutions to work on cocoa farms and in goldmines. In Cambodia, some orphanage owners were found to have bought vulnerable children from disadvantaged families and marketed them to donors for profit. The report shows that trafficking is more prevalent in countries with a significant tourism industry. In Uganda, the number of children in homes has increased from about 1,000 in the late 1990s to 55,000 today, and in Cambodia, the number of residential care institutions has increased by 75% in the last decade, despite a sharp decline in the number of orphans in both countries. Most institutions are developed in tourist hotspots. In 2017, more than 100 children attempted to flee an orphanage in Guatemala after experiencing abuse, but were brought back by law enforcement officers and placed in confinement. Fifty-six of the girls, who had been placed together in a cramped room, started a fire to gain the attention of the officers outside. The officers did not respond to the situation, resulting in the death of 41 girls. In 2019, the United Nations General Assembly recognised the link between children’s institutions and human trafficking but the charity says there are few examples of it being tackled effectively. Lina Gyllensten, acting director of evidence, advocacy and campaigns at Lumos, said: “Lumos’ report shows that institutions are playing a significant role in many instances of child exploitation and abuse around the world. Vulnerable children are being trapped in a complex web of institution-related trafficking and are being repeatedly exposed to multiple forms of harm. It is time to break these cycles of exploitation.” Parosha Chandran, barrister at One Pump Court, said: “I suspect that many people will be shocked by this report. They may recognise themselves as a well-intentioned orphanage volunteer, or as a generous donor who has supported children left vulnerable after a humanitarian disaster. Reading what follows may be the first time that they realise that they’d unwittingly played a part in propping up a harmful ecosystem in which children, most of whom have at least one living parent, act as commodities in an industry of profit-making orphanages.” The report makes recommendations for breaking the cycles of exploitation, including the reinvestment of funding from institutions into family and community-based services, better data collection and a new model law, outlining the steps national governments need to take to combat the problem. Lumos is urging national governments to boost specialist support to children in care and ensure children get expert support and information to know their rights."

          "headline": "China’s troll king: how a tabloid editor became the voice of Chinese nationalism",
          "bodyText": "On 2 November, the Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai posted a long message on the social media site Weibo, accusing China’s former vice-premier, Zhang Gaoli, of sexual assault. As soon as the post went live, it became the highest-profile #MeToo case in China, and one of the ruling Chinese Communist party’s largest public relations crises in recent history. Within about 20 minutes, the post had been removed. All mentions of the post were then scrubbed from the Chinese internet. No references to the story appeared in the Chinese media. In the days that followed, Peng made no further statements and did not appear in public. Outside China, however, as other tennis stars publicly expressed concerns for her safety, Peng’s apparent disappearance became one of the biggest news stories in the world. It wasn’t long before Hu Xijin stepped into the story. Hu is the editor of the Global Times, a chest-thumpingly nationalistic tabloid sometimes described as “China’s Fox News”. In recent years, he has become the most influential Chinese propagandist in the west – a constant presence on Twitter and in the international media, always on hand to defend the Communist party line, no matter the topic. On 19 November, he tweeted to his 450,000 followers that he had confirmed through his own sources – he didn’t say who they were – that Peng was alive and well. Over the next two days, he posted videos of Peng at a restaurant and signing autographs in Beijing. To many observers, this seemingly stage-managed footage, disseminated by organs of the Chinese state, was not reassuring. On 21 November, the International Olympic Committee spoke with Peng on a video call and declared that she was “doing fine”. When this intervention still failed to convince many that Peng was safe, Hu took the opportunity to hammer home one of the central themes of his three-decade career in journalism: when it comes to China, the western media sees only what it wants to see. “They only believe the story about China that they imagine,” he tweeted. “I’m surprised that they didn’t say the lady who showed up these two days is a fake Peng Shuai, a double.” Those who continued to question Peng’s safety, Hu wrote, were trying to “demonize China’s system”. Hu’s eagerness to reframe a story about sexual assault and censorship as a story about clashing political ideologies and anti-China prejudice is part of a significant change in the way China presents itself to the world. From the late 1970s onwards, as China was opening up but had yet to assume a major role in international affairs, it struggled to handle criticism from abroad. The official response was usually some form of wounded denial, or a stilted demand that other countries stay out of its business. But over the past decade, as China’s global power has grown, President Xi Jinping has pushed the country into a more confident, aggressive posture, and Hu, more than any other Chinese journalist, has become the voice of this pugnacious nationalism. On China’s most popular social media platform, WeChat, the Global Times is reportedly the most read outlet. “My English is almost all self-taught,” Hu once said in a video on Weibo, “and in English, I’m most skilful at picking a fight.” He has hyped up the prospects of military confrontation between the US and China over Taiwan. He has warned that if Britain infringes Chinese sovereignty in the South China Sea then it will be treated like “a bitch” who is “asking for a beating”. He has compared India to a “bandit” that has “barbarically robbed” Chinese companies. He has referred to Australia as nothing more than “gum stuck to the bottom of China’s shoe”. He recently concluded an article with the question: “In the face of such an irrational Australia, shouldn’t China be prepared with an iron fist and to punch it hard when needed, teaching it a thorough lesson?” When he picks a fight with foreign officials on Twitter, Hu likes to take screenshots of the tweets and post them on Weibo, just to show his 24 million followers – most of whom are blocked from Twitter by the great firewall – that he’s out there, defending China’s honour. “The most important thing about Hu is that he has constructed a whole style of authoritarian, nationalistic rhetoric,” Xiao Qiang, an expert in Chinese media at Berkeley’s School of Information, told me. “His readers go around repeating the same things and spreading the same sentiments.” Hu’s combative approach has been taken up by a number of Chinese diplomats and spokespeople – often called “Wolf Warriors”, in reference to a jingoistic Chinese blockbuster movie – who promote a “China first” philosophy and use social media to trash anyone they see as opposing Chinese interests. But where the Wolf Warrior diplomats are a recent phenomenon, people like Hu “have been propagating this idea for 10 years,” says Xiang Lanxin, a professor of international politics at Geneva’s Graduate Institute. Hu’s endless stream of quotable insults and invective stands out amid a sea of bland official statements, calls to “occupy new platforms for party discourse”, and so on. Once you know his name, you see him quoted everywhere – the BBC, NPR, the Financial Times, the Washington Post, the Times, Reuters. In the past two years, the New York Times has mentioned him 46 times. “He’s willing to be quoted in the Xi Jinping era, when huge numbers of others – especially liberal commentators – have grown too nervous to go on-the-record with foreign journalists,” says Evan Osnos, who has written about China for the New Yorker since 2008. Hu has even become the subject of headlines in his own right. “Editor of Chinese state newspaper which routinely mocks Australia enjoyed LUNCH at our embassy”, reported Daily Mail Australia last year. One reason for Hu’s ubiquity is that he has unparalleled licence to speak bluntly about politics. Hu’s domestic critics have described him as “the only person with freedom of speech” in mainland China, though that freedom is partly a reflection of his adherence to the CCP line. Hu’s insistence on thrusting himself into every passing controversy has earned him the nickname diaopan, or “Frisbee catcher” – like a loyal pet, he tries to bring every argument home for the government he serves. Over the years, Hu has encouraged a kind of mystique around his connection with party leadership. “To be honest, I myself don’t know for sure to what degree I reflect the authority’s voice,” Hu told me when we spoke on the phone late last year. He likes to say that the Global Times’ success is a product of the market. But when I asked him if the paper is financially independent from the government, he eventually told me, after some back and forth, that the English edition receives government funding for providing overseas propaganda. Where Hu once spoke for a hardline fringe of the Communist party, his newspaper’s aggressive China-first ideology is now ascendant. As one American author who stopped writing for the Global Times in 2011 put it: “With all those Wolf Warrior diplomats, it’s like the government has been Global Times-ified.” * * * In 2016, President Xi visited the Beijing headquarters of the People’s Daily, the largest newspaper group in China, which is run by the Communist party and publishes Hu’s Global Times. On his tour of the offices, as he passed through the exhibition hall, Xi pointed approvingly to a display copy of the Global Times and declared himself a reader. Hu, it seemed, was successfully pursuing the propaganda strategy that Xi had laid out early in his presidency. Hu’s rise is hard to grasp without understanding the broader story of free speech in 21st century China. In the 00s, hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens came online and their voices became more audible. Starting in 2008, the People’s Daily set up a dedicated team to monitor public opinion online. Its first few annual reports presented new digital platforms in a positive light, as a way to bring the government and its people closer. Weibo and other online communities were “a good tool for citizens to participate in and discuss politics,” the 2010 report stated. During this period, journalists in China were afforded a little more freedom to do reporting that touched upon politically sensitive issues, though certain topics – such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, and the lives and conduct of top leadership – remained off-limits. Starting in the early 2010s, and particularly from 2012, with the rise of Xi, this more liberal approach to public discourse was gradually reversed. “When Xi Jinping became president [in 2013], he was not interested in the voices on the internet,” Xiao, the UC Berkeley professor, told me. “Instead, he perceived such voices as a threat to his power, and recognised that it was time for a complete crackdown.” Posts on social media, such as Weibo, became increasingly monitored and censored. It became more common for web users to receive an “invitation to tea”, a euphemism for a phone call instructing you to visit your local police station to answer questions about your online activities. From 2013, a growing number of citizens were suspended or banned from online platforms, detained or sentenced to prison. Drawing on media reports and court documents, an online database recorded more than 2,000 cases in which people had been punished or prosecuted for their online speech since 2013. The total number is almost certainly much higher. In 2013, at the same time the party was tightening its grip on public discourse, Xi called a conference with propaganda officials from across the country, urging them to “tell the China story well”. That meant covering China in a way that was positive, engaging and harnessed new digital platforms. It meant proudly celebrating China’s achievements, rather than focusing on its imperfections. Hu adapted fluidly to China’s new media environment, which was at once very online, obedient to the party line and international-facing. In his articles, social media interventions and interviews, he played the role of both dutiful defence attorney – there to deliver the party’s side of the story, no matter how implausible it might seem – and aggrieved relative of the accused, yelling out to the court that the prosecution and the judge were prejudiced or corrupt or stupid, or all of the above. It was a style that suited the tenor of Chinese social media, as well as the new self-image of the Communist party. Other party media outlets started to mimic Hu’s style, writing in a more colloquial manner. Even People’s Daily, famously stolid and voiceless throughout most of its history, encourages its commentators to be more “fun” and to grow personal brands. In 2019, Xi visited the People Daily’s office again. He asked the country’s media workers to embrace new technology to “maximise and optimise propaganda impact” and “to promote the voice of the party directly into various apps and occupy new platforms for party discourse”. As Xi cruised through the office, the People’s Daily editorial team lined up and applauded. Among them was Hu in a dark grey jacket, smiling ear to ear. * * * No event seems to distil Hu’s remarkable place in Chinese journalism like the Tiananmen Square massacre. Journalists are always proud to tell their readers that they were there when something significant happened. Hu does the same when it comes to Tiananmen, except that he inserts himself into this history in order to discredit it. References to the Tiananmen massacre are prohibited in China. Perhaps the only exception to this rule is the Global Times. When Hu writes about the subject, he paints it as a dangerous folly. “If the incident 32 years ago has any positive effect,” Hu wrote this June, “it has inoculated the Chinese people with a political vaccine, helping us acquire immunity from being seriously misled.” Hu was 29 when the pro-democracy protests began. He had been born into a poor, Christian, but otherwise traditional family. His father was an accountant at a factory that manufactured rockets, and his mother, who was illiterate, made embroidery with a sewing machine to bring in some extra income. At 18, Hu joined the People’s Liberation Army and enrolled in its foreign-language college in Nanjing, where he majored in Russian. In 1986, still a military officer, he started a masters programme in Russian at Beijing Foreign Studies University. In the spring of 1989, when protests erupted across the country, Hu was months away from graduation. “I went to Tiananmen Square every day, chanting slogans like everybody else,” Hu told a Chinese reporter in 2011. (Xiao, the UC Berkeley professor, who was a student at Notre Dame in 1989 and flew back to Beijing upon seeing the news on TV, laughed at the idea that Hu could have been there as a protester. He noted that the military college Hu attended is sometimes known as “China’s cradle of 007s”. “If he truly participated in the protest, god knows what his role was,” Xiao said.) Shortly after the violent suppression of the Tiananmen protests, Hu joined the People’s Daily newspaper, where he spent two years as a researcher and another two years as an editor on the night shift. At the time, China was more than a decade into Deng Xiaoping’s push to develop a market economy. Hu was part of a group of journalists at the People’s Daily who sought to create new revenue streams by launching a weekly newspaper called Global News Digest. On 3 January 1993, 20,000 copies of the first issue, which included a story on Diana, Princess of Wales’s split from Prince Charles, appeared on newsstands. The front page featured a grandiose message from the editors, which proclaimed that after 500 years of falling behind the west, and 14 years of economic reform, China was “saying goodbye to poverty and backwardness, like a giant dragon about to take off, standing tall in the east of the world, its head held high”. Despite this lofty rhetoric, Hu claims there wasn’t a clear vision at first. “We published whatever ordinary people liked to read,” he told me. The publication was filled with exotic stories about spies, royal romances, historical assassinations and children raised alongside wild animals. Most mainstream publications were so propaganda-heavy, so filled with party lingo and news of top leaders’ endless meetings, that the arrival of the plain-talking, eye-catching Global Times must have felt like an episode of Sex and the City beamed into the middle of a long sermon. Articles from the 90s included The Dark World of the Russian Mafia, From Female Slave to Fashion Model, and The Unexpected Madness of Monks: Korean Buddhists’ Rivalry Doused Monastery with Blood. A few months into his stint at Global News Digest, Hu’s career was transformed when he was dispatched abroad to cover the Bosnian war for the People’s Daily. In his memoir about the experience, published in 1997, he recalled thinking that the fact of a Chinese journalist reporting on a foreign war “was likely more newsworthy than whatever articles he has to file”. To Hu, the conflict in Bosnia became the backdrop for a private battlefield in his mind, as he began measuring himself against the western journalists around him, whom he both admired and resented. “To be a soldier in a modern news war, I couldn’t defeat the western reporters, but I congratulate myself for being able to even join them for a fight,” Hu wrote in his memoir. (Almost a quarter of a century later, his Twitter avatar is a photo of him in Sarajevo, sitting on the curb taking notes.) The book is sprinkled with a mixture of pride and vulnerability, as Hu struggles with his own inferiority complex: “Why can’t I be the one who creates a sensation? Why can’t a Chinese reporter be in the limelight?” he writes at one point. He admits that he spent his time obsessing over how to “look more like a real reporter”, rather than focusing on reporting. “I couldn’t stand being looked down upon, not only on a personal level, but also on the account of being Chinese – a fact that brings with it a kind of unbearable pressure for me.” He carried this chip on his shoulder everywhere he went. On one occasion, he turned up to a news briefing that was in Albanian. He didn’t understand a word, but that didn’t stop him from asking a question in English – not to seek an answer, just to assert his presence. Hu returned to Beijing in 1996 and soon became Global News Digest’s deputy editor. “I was a war and international affairs reporter, and my personal interest was fused into our coverage,” he told me. In 1997, the paper changed its name to the Global Times, and in the next two years, circulation tripled. “China was becoming integrated with the world,” Hu said. “In the past, international news were merely pieces of knowledge or information from remote corners of the world. Gradually, international news became more and more related to China, and the Chinese audience developed a keen interest in what’s happening outside the country.” One international incident from this period symbolised that new reality. On 7 May 1999, a Nato bomb hit the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, killing three Chinese journalists. Officials from the US claimed that it was an accident and that the real target had been a Yugoslavian defence agency a few hundred metres down the road. But many people in China believed it was a deliberate attack, and anti-American protests erupted across the country. Two days after the bombing, the Global Times published a special issue, featuring a report by a Global Times journalist who had been speaking with the ambassador in the building just minutes before the explosion. According to Han Rongbin, a professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia, events such as the embassy bombing strengthened a collective sense of aggrieved national identity. “That’s why some nationalists like to say that it was America who made them so nationalistic,” he said. As the Global Times grew, China’s most powerful politicians watched with admiration. In 2004, when the paper published a column that criticised Chinese journalists for unthinkingly accepting American media narratives about the “war on terror”, the foreign minister, Li Zhaoxing, said that he’d long been waiting to read such an article. “Journalism might be without borders, but journalists do have motherlands,” wrote Li – in the Global Times – shortly after. Later that year, the president of the People’s Daily publishing group, Wang Chen, spoke at a seminar to discuss the “Global Times phenomenon”. Wang said that the minister of foreign affairs and the head of the overseas propaganda office had repeatedly told him how much they loved the paper, and that the Global Times exemplified how to make propaganda readable. In presentations to advertisers during this period, the publication would tout its close ties with top leadership, claiming that its readers included “nearly 200 key leaders of the country at the party central, the state council, the central military commission and the National People’s Congress”. As soon as each issue was published, the presentation claimed, special messengers would deliver the paper to Zhongnanhai, the walled compound where much of the Communist party elite live and work. * * * Since 2005, when he took over the paper as editor-in-chief, Hu has expanded the Global Times to an operation of 800 staff, publishing six days a week in Chinese and in English. “We needed to expand our influence, and we couldn’t do that without using English,” Hu told me, explaining the decision to launch the English edition in 2009. Looking back, the first few years of the English-language Global Times can seem like a strange interlude in the paper’s history. Located in a rented office building outside the People’s Daily compound, the English operation was largely separated from the Chinese one. Rather than rigidly following the nationalistic line, it afforded journalists some space to report on more sensitive topics. Around the time of the English edition’s launch, the Global Times hired a dozen foreign editors. Their job was to ensure that stories in English read smoothly, but they had little say on editorial decisions. The English-language content was written mostly by Chinese journalists. James Palmer, who worked at the Global Times for seven years and is now a deputy editor of the American magazine Foreign Policy, told me that in the early days, the newspaper’s English content was about 60% “banal”, 20% “mad nationalistic stuff” and 20% “genuinely interesting”. Hu differentiated his paper from the other English-language party outlet, China Daily, by running stories on subjects such as dissidents and LGBTQ rights. “The Global Times was trying to make waves,” Jemimah Steinfeld, a British former editor, told me. Staffers from this period remembered that Hu liked to paint himself as a force for progress. All reforms begin with rule-breaking, Hu told a Chinese magazine in 2013. If your type of rule-breaking helps the country, eventually the government will give it approval. This, he said, is how progress in China works. According to Wen Tao, a Chinese reporter who worked for the English edition, Hu told staff to avoid self-censorship and to pursue whatever they considered newsworthy. Wen’s pieces captured the everyday struggles of life in Beijing a decade ago: a poet criticising his local government’s plan to cut down 20,000 trees in order to extend a road; a father trying to advocate for food safety, after his children got ill from adulterated milk formula, only to be put on trial himself. In February 2010, he broke a story about the dissident artist Ai Weiwei and other local artists protesting in downtown Beijing against the demolition of a residential complex. Afterwards, Ai visited the newsroom of the English edition, and was warmly welcomed. The divergence between the English Global Times and the Chinese Global Times was striking. “Their reports depicted two different Chinas,” wrote Wen on his personal blog in 2016. Where the Chinese edition demonised international voices, the English edition reported “some realities” in an attempt to show the outside world that the Chinese, too, enjoyed a free press. “If you didn’t look at the byline or the name of the paper, it could have very well been a story from the Wall Street Journal,” Wen told me. It did not last. Not long after his Ai Weiwei story, Wen was asked to submit his resignation. “The paper was looking to push boundaries, but I probably overdid it a little bit,” Wen told me. Around that time, he ran into Hu in the elevator. Wen recalled the older journalist expressing frustration: sometimes you write your stories, hoping to make room for more reporting like this – only to find yourself being told to take a big step back. (Palmer told me that the Global Times “had a culture of two ‘serious mistakes’ every six months” and that Hu was “very regularly” told off by the propaganda authorities and other ministries.) It is hard to tell to what extent, if any, Hu’s English-language Global Times reflected his own journalistic ideals, or whether, as Wen suggested, the licence given to its reporters was itself a kind of propaganda exercise, intended to give foreigners the impression that the Chinese press enjoyed greater freedom than it really did and that he, too, was a real reporter. At the very least, it seems that during this period, at the English edition, Hu was fairly committed to performing the role of a liberal-leaning editor. Palmer recalled that in their first meeting, Hu told him, unprompted, that he wanted democracy and freedom of speech in China, but that reform had to be gradual. In Wen’s view, Hu is a deeply conflicted figure. “On the one hand, he wanted to do journalism professionally, but on the other hand, he couldn’t change his position as a party man,” he said. By 2011, as the government line on freedom of speech hardened, so did the editorial line of the Global Times. That year, the authorities detained Ai Weiwei for 81 days, and the Global Times denounced him in a series of Chinese and English op-eds, including one headlined “Ai Weiweis will be washed away by history”. “It was a very sudden pivot,” Palmer remembered. “And after that it just became worse and worse.” The American author who no longer contributes to the Global Times told me: “Their business model seems to have switched to being completely provocative and just to piss people off.” Sometimes, one former editor told me, when an article seemed particularly inflammatory or outrageous, “we sent up a red flag, and they would be like, ‘No, that’s exactly what we want to say.’” * * * There are many ways to be an editor in chief, Hu told me as his mobile phones rang in the background. “Some people might use their energy on managing, but I devote more of my energy to content.” On the phone, Hu was polite and warm, in contrast to his aggressive online persona. He took long pauses before answering most questions, as if to compose mini-essays in his mind. Every day, he told me, his team “monitors” the internet in search of popular subjects, and once they land on an idea, they prepare a summary of the issue and brief Hu on it. Then Hu gets to work, turning it into a column. For each piece, his staff typically interview two or three experts, mostly government thinktankers and professors from top universities. According to Hu, this means that his columns “don’t only reflect my own opinion, but absorb the opinions of many people in our society. We represent a somewhat mainstream take in China.” As the space permitted to alternative views has shrunk, it has become increasingly difficult to judge what proportion of China’s 1.4 billion people share the Global Times’ worldview. Scholars, journalists, writers, lawyers and activists have found their social media accounts suspended or erased because of their unspecified violation of the platform’s rules. These cases are so common and seemingly minor that they attract little international attention, but their collective effect is suffocating. In mainland China today, censorship and self-censorship are like the weather – you can complain about it, but you have to adapt to it. To rebel is to submit to the possibility of having your life ruined. Early last year, a 36-year-old woman, Zhang Zhan, decided to report from Wuhan as a citizen journalist. She was soon arrested and sentenced to four years in prison, and now, several months into a hunger strike, she is on her deathbed. Most people in China don’t know about Zhang Zhan, and those who do tend not to think about what she represents – to do so would only lead to trouble. That doesn’t mean that party-approved figures such as Hu are beyond criticism in mainland China. Hu’s critics include former contributors to the Global Times, who feel that since 2010, he has grown into an increasingly absurd, even dangerous, caricature of himself. “You might have noticed that I rarely write for them any more,” Shen Dingli, a professor of international relations at Fudan University, who is on the Global Times’s go-to list of experts, told me in an email. “The reason is their inclination towards extreme nationalism.” Xiang Lanxin, who is based outside China, told me something similar, having been put off by Hu’s increasingly crude politics. He used to be a frequent contributor to the Global Times, but he stopped in the early 2010s when he sensed that Hu was “no longer interested in meaningful debates”. Hu’s critics are particularly alarmed by enthusiasm for military solutions to problems. After a recent border scuffle in the Himalayas with India, Hu argued that the Chinese army should “ready themselves to launch into battle at any moment”. In another column, Hu suggested that China should build up an arsenal of 1,000 nuclear warheads. In September, the Global Times published an op-ed headlined “People’s Liberation Army jets will eventually patrol over Taiwan”. When I asked Hu about critics who accuse him of warmongering, he became agitated and denied suggesting that China should start a war. “What I said is that if Taiwan started to assault us, then we must fight back with overwhelming force,” he told me. (One wonders what kind of action would constitute an “assault” in his view.) To Xiang, Hu’s influence is far more important than that of the headline-grabbing Wolf Warrior diplomats. Where diplomats can be silenced with one word from the top, the feelings of Chinese superiority that the Global Times stokes every day are far harder to control. “This newspaper has been leading popular mood in a nationalist direction for a long time, and the consequences of this are not to be taken lightly,” Xiang told an interviewer last year. Occasionally, it can seem as if Hu is becoming a stranger in a sphere he helped build. In May, the Weibo account of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission posted an image titled China Ignition vs India Ignition, contrasting a recent Chinese rocket launch with Indian cremation – a reference to the country’s surging Covid death toll. When Hu criticised the post and expressed sympathy for India’s plight, he was attacked by nationalists for being too soft on one of China’s principal rivals. A decade ago, on social media, Hu had seemed to be the No 1 flag bearer for Chinese nationalism. Now his status is not so certain. On Weibo, while Hu was being criticised for insufficient national pride, one Global Times journalist asked: “Has Hu Xijin changed? Or, have the times changed?” The answer seemed clear. Hu is 61, and rumours about his imminent retirement surface periodically. Yet he remains as zealous and full of fight as he was three decades ago. “He really is the soul of the paper,” Wen told me. “It’s very hard to imagine a de-Huxijinised Global Times.” The audience he once dreamed of as a young reporter in Bosnia – readers who don’t unquestioningly admire western journalism and instead cheer on their Chinese counterparts – has materialised. Each of his Weibo posts are followed by thousands of comments and tens of thousands of likes. Hu likes to call himself a shubianzhe, an antiquated term for a guard stationed on the nation’s frontiers, keeping it safe. In just the past week, fulfilling this duty has involved insulting Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, comparing Hong Kong activist Nathan Law to a 6 January Capitol rioter, taunting the Australian prime minister, bickering with a Florida senator and posting numerous cartoons highlighting American hypocrisy. It is a ceaseless task. For now, Hu fights on. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, listen to our podcasts here and sign up to the long read weekly email here."

          "bodyText": "“Have you ever suffered from depression?” “Well, there was this time when I was younger, and …” “Yes or no?” Welcome to prison induction: a warning of things to come; a process where niceties about mental health are observed not for the purposes of care but for the sake of resource allocation. For former teacher Mark Cobden (Sean Bean), it’s the first time. And it’s rough. Initially we see this terrifying world through Cobden’s out-of-his-depth, middle-class eyes. The barely restrained violence. The barely contained mental illness. The barely tolerable boredom and ennui. Time’s creator Jimmy McGovern spares us nothing. Everyone is turned inward by the misery of their situation, and Time is horribly convincing in its depiction of both visceral fear and the sense of existential wheelspin as life passes without anything happening. On Bean’s face in repose, we see the torment of guilt and regret, the restless nights in an uncomfortable single bed. Bean’s performance is supremely understated and all the more emotionally resonant for it. Its brilliance often lies in his body language; his demeanour when he does nothing other than shuffle around, keeping his head down. Either through guilt or terror, he struggles to meet anyone’s gaze. He tries to turn himself into a ghost – to dissolve into his sentence in the hope of making it to the other side. But when you’re in such close proximity to so many other damaged, angry, frightened people, that isn’t possible. Even if you aren’t looking at them, they’re looking at you, with predatory or contemptuous or eagerly opportunistic eyes. Cobden’s first cellmate, Bernard (Aneurin Barnard), is a suicidal self-harmer. His second, Daniel (Jack McMullan), is a sneak and a liar. Cobden is routinely humiliated by the pitiless bully Johnno (the excellent James Nelson-Joyce). There are bleak truths he must learn the hard way – not least that in prison, aggression is the most meaningful currency and he’s dangerously short of it. Still, there’s nothing Johnno can do to Cobden that is worse than the pain he inflicts on himself. Unwatchably bleak then? Thankfully, it’s not that simple. Cobden’s supervising officer Eric McNally is a good man, albeit under impossible duress himself due to an errant son who is struggling elsewhere in the overstretched and compromised prison system. McNally is played by Stephen Graham – a model of intense restraint, expressing an infinity of inner turmoil with a puff of his cheeks. McNally is as kind as he can afford to be in the circumstances. As jeopardy surrounds his son, he too is pushed to his limits. McGovern is known for polemics but the brilliance of Time is that it manages to show, not tell. There is very little grandstanding here – we are simply presented with the grim realities of our dysfunctional penal system and asked, implicitly, how we would cope. This is television that hands an audacious amount of agency to the viewer: Time is either as brutal or as compassionate as we are willing to make it. Will we ponder both the crime and the punishment? The claustrophobia and horror render the moments of kindness – Cobden teaching fellow inmate Kavanagh (Terence Maynard) to read and write, the emotional succour offered by prison chaplain Marie-Louise (Siobhan Finneran) – almost unbearably poignant. These are tiny pinpricks of light at the end of the tunnel: people doing their best with what they’ve got. The real redemption is to be found in forgiveness. We’re encouraged to put ourselves in Cobden’s shoes but he is a convicted drink-driver, responsible for a man’s death. His pain is palpable, but so is that of his victim’s family. “You’re in here as punishment, son” says Cobden’s mother June (Sue Johnston) while visiting. “Not for it.” Does Cobden believe that himself? In some ways, this is the heart of McGovern’s polemic. Cobden is already punishing himself. His life sentence will be endured long after his release. His own family is shattered, his initial attempts to reach out to his victim’s family are rebuffed. Do we want offenders to suffer indignities beyond the loss of their liberty? Are we willing to consider broken people as mendable, or do we just want to throw them away? If it’s the latter, the current system is doing a pretty good job. But might there be another way? Redemption is a long, hard road. Time suggests it’s one worth walking all the same."

          "bodyText": "The vultures are circling again, just two years after the Conservative party tore apart its last leader. Here is yet another “worst week” for the beleaguered prime minister, after his planned week announcing new crime policies switched to probes into possible Downing Street law-breaking. When getting “rat-arsed” at Tory parties becomes this year’s topical panto joke, things have turned serious. He faces a major rebellion on Tuesday, his Covid regulations likely to be saved only by Labour’s public health seriousness. The following day he faces another pasting at prime minister’s questions and on Thursday a byelection. With Labour nine points ahead nationally, North Shropshire may be held and yet still signal such a Tory collapse that statistically it endangers Boris Johnson’s own seat. Voters knowingly elected a liar, but they rarely forgive chaotic incompetence. Johnson’s fate rests with those who elevated him, the nexus of parties-within-a-party that hold the real Tory power. This week Steve Baker MP relaunches Conservative Way Forward, founded to guard Margaret Thatcher’s flame. These idolaters ask themselves “What would Maggie do?” with as little historical sense as those who claim to know the answer to “What would Jesus do?” A prime saboteur, Baker is an agent in all the rightwing caucuses that riddle the Tory party. He chairs the Covid Recovery Group, which is stirring the plan B rebellion; he is a core member of the European Research Group (ERG); a member of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, a group of deniers blocking climate-saving action; and founder of the Cobden Centre, promoting hardline free-market economics. As a sky-diving, born-again Christian who was baptised in the sea, Baker also belongs to the Cornerstone group for family, faith and flag, and voted against same-sex marriage. All revolutionary insurgents need new causes. Baker’s airy manifesto for the Way Forward in the Sunday Telegraph declares “the Conservative party is in the wrong place”, accusing it of “carrying on with centre-left policies”. In a litany of objections to Covid regulations, he protests: “Conservatives don’t create societies where people must live and work in fear a minister might, without notice, impose restrictions on them.” As Omicron arrives in over-filled hospitals, he says Johnson’s plan B is “creating a miserable dystopia”. Yet for all his low-tax yearning, Baker has just enough political sense never to say what public spending he would axe. Prof Tim Bale, a political party analyst, points to the reason: two-fifths of Tory members are over 65, cleaving to state-financed social care and the NHS. Johnson’s enemies, the remainer greybeards he threw out, such as Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine and Dominic Grieve, may smile at the irony of seeing him now threatened by turbulent disrupters. This new cadre model themselves on the Trumpian Republicans of the Christian right. “I believe God means us to live in liberty,” Baker told the Financial Times. Does that stuff fly in North Shropshire? Johnson would be in less trouble if his government was charging full-speed ahead in any direction. Instead, he dithers between levelling-up and small state austerity, zigzagging between slogans without policies, while laced into an eye-watering budgetary corset. Without fast-forward propulsion, governments topple. With gracious condescension, Baker says he’s not seeking Johnson’s head on a plate, yet: “I want Boris Johnson to rescue his position,” he says. “Things are not good.” If they tire of Johnson, Liz Truss is the obvious candidate to be his successor. Her brazen zealotry frightens many: Dominic Cummings calls her a “human hand grenade”. A founder of the Free Enterprise Group and co-author of the notorious new Tory right manual Britannia Unchained, her photo-ops mimic Thatcher imagery – in a tank, hugging a calf – yet she lacks her idol’s political filters. Who else would try solving the childcare crisis by deregulating childminders to let them each take in six two-year-olds? Conservative Way Forward is founded in a belief that the party is no longer recognisably conservative: if so, they are the entryists who subverted it over decades. Where Neil Kinnock rooted out the Militant tendency tearing at Labour’s grassroots, the Tory party has always appeased its rebels. When Baker was chair of the ERG, Theresa May made him a minister. When Suella Braverman took over as ERG chair, she was similarly rewarded. Even her ERG successor, the outlandish Jacob Rees-Mogg, was swept up into government. The deputy ERG chair, Andrea Jenkyns, has been elevated to the whips’ office, a bizarre appointment given the ERG’s own hostile whipping operation. Through failing to stand up for the conservatism of Harold Macmillan and Edward Heath, the Tory party has plunged further right than most of its voters. Just 200,000 largely rightist party members have for several decades selected none but Brexiters, libertarians and obsessive state-shrinkers. The result, according to Bale, is that the MPs they picked are now even further right than those party members. About 100 Tory MPs may vote against plan B, well beyond the usual suspects, including relative moderates such as Tom Tugendhat and Tobias Ellwood. Some MPs feel pressure from local parties, while others are simply venting fury at Johnson’s catalogue of failings. But remember this: those who vote against measures to tackle Omicron are irrationalists defying the best scientific opinion. Sir Graham Brady, the head of the 1922 Committee, calls these modest restrictions “Soviet-style”: reaching for Stalin really is the end of rational debate. Here is a party falling apart, eaten from within by failure to extirpate extremists. This is not primarily about Johnson’s unfitness for office. It’s about the bizarre and dangerous nature of the extreme party that put him in power and will replace him, as the whim takes it. This is about a party that has become unfit to govern.

          "bodyText": "Thanks for joining us. We will now be closing this Covid blog. However, you can catch up with all the latest developments on our new blog here. Here is a snapshot of all the key Covid developments: Omicron has killed at least one person in Britain, prime minister Boris Johnson revealed. Boris Johnson issued an appeal to members of the public to step forward to assist the Covid booster jab programme. Norway tightens Covid measures and bans serving of alcohol in bid to halt Omicron outbreak. Protests in Latvia turned violent after a police officer was injured and four demonstrators arrested as several thousand people in the capital Riga protested anti-Covid restrictions. Peru says it is battling a “resurgence” of the pandemic, with infections and deaths rising. The country has the world’s highest coronavirus death rate. China has recorded its first case of the Omicron variant, state media report authorities in the northeastern city of Tianjin as saying. In Denmark, health authorities say a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine will be offered sooner to everyone over 40 to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. The US Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots. California will impose a statewide mask mandate in all indoor public spaces. Covid-19 cases in Canada may rapidly rise in the coming days due to community spread of the Omicron variant. Nigeria will destroy around one million expired Covid-19 vaccines, Faisal Shuaib, head of the National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), said. At least 200,000 Covid-19 vaccines have expired in Senegal without being used in the past two months and another 200,000 are set to expire at the end of December because demand is too slow, the head of its immunisation programme said. Thailand will halve to three months the time between administering a second Covid-19 vaccine shot and a booster, health officials said. The Omicron variant likely accounts for 11% of new Covid-19 cases in Ireland, its Chief Medical Officer said on Monday, while predicting a very rapid increase in the proportion of Omicron infections in the coming days amid probable widespread community transmission. Ireland has so far confirmed 18 cases of the variant through whole-genome sequencing out of an average 4,000 Covid-19 cases it has been reporting each day. A trait distinguishing Omicron from the dominant Delta variant suggests a much higher total, said the National Public Health Emergency Team. Ireland’s Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said in a statement: Using this methodology, we estimate that 11% of cases are now due to the Omicron variant, an increase from less than 1% only one week ago.” Just over 90% of Ireland’s eligible 3.9 million people over the age of 12 have been fully vaccinated - one of the highest rates of protection in Europe - and it has administered a further 1.2 million booster doses. Coronavirus passports could lead to increased uptake of vaccines, especially among young people, a study suggests. Research by the University of Oxford found Covid-19 certification led to increased jab uptake 20 days before and 40 days after introduction in countries with lower-than-average vaccination coverage. Increase in vaccine uptake was most pronounced in people under 30. The modelling analysis was published in The Lancet Public Health. Coronavirus passports require people to have proof of either complete vaccination, a negative test or a Covid-19 recovery certificate to access public venues and events, such as restaurants or concerts. As well as helping to prevent the spread of coronavirus in public venues, it has been suggested they may encourage more unvaccinated people to get vaccinated, particularly those who perceive their own risk of hospitalisation or death from Covid-19 as low. Read the full story from our reporter Andrew Gregory here. Hello it’s Samantha Lock back with you on the blog as my colleague Jedidajah Otte takes a well-deserved break. First up, some Covid numbers out of Australia. The country’s most populous state of NSW has recorded 804 new Covid-19 cases and one death, a significant jump from previous days. Victoria recorded 1,189 new cases a six deaths. Prime minister Scott Morrison called on states and territories to ease their last remaining Covid-19 restrictions, as Western Australia announced plans to reopen its hard border to the rest of the nation. The US Air Force has discharged 27 people for refusing to get the Covid-19 vaccine, making them what officials believe are the first service members to be removed for disobeying the mandate to get the shots. The Associated Press reports: The Air Force gave its forces until 2 November to get the vaccine, and thousands have either refused or sought an exemption. Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek said Monday that these are the first airmen to be administratively discharged for reasons involving the vaccine. She said all of them were in their first term of enlistment, so they were younger, lower-ranking personnel. And while the Air Force does not disclose what type of discharge a service member gets, legislation working its way through Congress limits the military to giving troops in vaccine refusal cases an honorable discharge or general discharge under honorable conditions. The Pentagon earlier this year required the vaccine for all members of the military, including active duty, National Guard and the Reserves. Each of the services set its own deadlines and procedures for the mandate, and the Air Force set the earliest deadline. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has said the vaccine is critical to maintaining the health of the force and its ability to respond to an national security crisis. None of the 27 airmen sought any type of exemption, medical, administrative or religious, Stefanek said. Several officials from the other services said they believe that so far only the Air Force has gotten this far along in the process and discharged people over the vaccine refusal. As a result, they were formally removed from service for failure to obey an order. Stefanek said it is also possible that some had other infractions on their records, but all had the vaccine refusal as one of the elements of their discharge. It is not unusual for members of the military to be thrown out of the service for disobeying an order — discipline is a key tenet of the armed services. As a comparison, Stefanek said that in the first three quarters of 2021, about 1,800 airmen were discharged for failure to follow orders. According to the latest Air Force data, more than 1,000 airmen have refused the shot and more than 4,700 are seeking a religious exemption. As of last week, a bit more than 97% of the active duty Air Force had gotten at least one shot. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has issued an appeal to members of the public to step forward to assist the Covid booster jab programme in a race to counter the new Omicron variant. Johnson, who announced the new mass booster programme on Sunday, said “tens of thousands” of volunteers were needed in order to ramp up delivery of booster jabs to an unprecedented pace. Roles needing to be filled by volunteers range from stewards to organise and manage the queues to trained vaccinators to administer the jabs. On Sunday, Johnson announced that every eligible adult in England is to be offered a booster shot by the end of December, a month earlier than previously planned, while resources are being made available to the devolved nations to speed up delivery. Johnson has acknowledged that it will require an “extraordinary effort” by the NHS, with hundreds more vaccination sites, mobile units and pop-ups due to open over the coming week. In a direct appeal to the public, Johnson said: As part of our Get Boosted Now vaccination drive we need to increase our jabbing capacity to unprecedented levels. But to achieve something on this scale, we need your help. So today I’m issuing a call for volunteers to join our national mission to get jabs in arms. We need tens of thousands of people to help out, everyone from trained vaccinators to stewards. Many thousands have already given their time but we need you to come forward again, to work alongside our brilliant GPs, doctors, nurses and pharmacists, to deliver jabs and save lives. So please come forward if you can. There are currently almost 3,000 vaccine sites across the country, staffed by over 90,000 volunteers, PA reports. After the NHS last week announced a recruitment drive for 10,000 paid vaccinators, 4,500 people have registered their interest while 13,000 have come forward as volunteer stewards. Brazil logged 2,082 fresh infections and 48 new deaths from Covid-19 on Monday as infections are still decreasing in the country, with 7,133 new infections reported on average each day. That’s 9% of the peak, which was reached on 23 June, according to the Reuters Covid-19 Tracker. Overall, 22,188,179 infections and 616,744 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported in the country since the pandemic began. California will impose a statewide mask mandate in all indoor public spaces as Covid-19 case rates soar with the spread of the new Omicron variant, the state secretary of health and human services, Mark Ghaly, said on Monday. As of Saturday, 7.4 million of California’s population of around 40 million had received their booster jab, according to the office of governor Gavin Newsom. My colleague Dan Sabbagh has written up a piece on how the NHS will gear up for the “huge challenge” of delivering prime minister Boris Johnson’s new booster jab target: Doctors, nurses and NHS executives will have to find a way of trebling the rate of booster vaccinations to more than 1.2m a day if they are to offer all eligible adults in the UK a jab by the end of December. The target came as a surprise to the health service, which will now have to find staff to work through the holiday season, alongside the 750 military personnel drafted in to assist them. Full story here: Covid-19 cases in Canada may rapidly rise in the coming days due to community spread of the Omicron variant, mirroring the situation in the country’s most populous province of Ontario, Canada’s top health official said on Monday. Ontario, which accounts for almost 40% of Canada’s population of 39 million people, reported 1,536 cases of Covid-19 on Monday, a more-than 70% increase from a week ago, including 80 cases of the Omicron variant. The surge has prompted the provincial government to suspend easing of restrictions that were planned to be lifted ahead of the holiday season, Reuters reports. The World Health Organization has said that the Omicron coronavirus variant poses a “very high” global risk, having reached over 60 countries, while it remains unclear for the moment how much vaccines can protect against it. Ontario has directed government staff, who started gradually returning to their offices in November, to go back to working from home at least until early-February, CTV news reported Monday. The University of Victoria in the provimce of British Columbia announced on Sunday that it will be moving its in-person exams online from Monday after a rise in Covid-19 cases on Vancouver Island. Schools in England should not be closing early for Christmas unless they have been told it is “necessary” on public health grounds, the British government has said. The prime minister’s official spokesman indicated that schools would be kept open unless there is an “absolute public health emergency”, PA reports. Asked whether schools might close early for Christmas, the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said: Certainly we do not think anyone should be closing schools early unless they have received advice from the local director of public health that it’s necessary on public health grounds. We wouldn’t want to see that happening routinely, just as a precaution, because as I’ve said, education is vital. And we’ve seen, sadly, because of the public health crisis, children have to miss face-to-face education. And so it’s very important that we maintain schooling as much as possible. The NASUWT teaching union however is calling on education secretary Nadhim Zahawi to urgently announce additional measures for schools and colleges before the Christmas break to avoid a repeat of the “chaos” last year. The Government should advise schools to cancel or postpone non-essential activities and events immediately, as well as move to online staff and parental meetings, the union says. A staggered return of pupils in January should be considered and extra on-site testing facilities should be provided until the February half-term, the union says. Health secretary Sajid Javid said on Monday he could not guarantee schools would not close again due to the pandemic. Zahawi said on Sunday he could not guarantee that all schools would be open everywhere in January. Northern Ireland is set to be overwhelmed by the Covid-19 variant Omicron “very, very soon”, the deputy first minister warned on Monday. Michelle O’Neill said there were 10 confirmed cases of the new Covid-19 variant in Northern Ireland on Monday. PA reports: Earlier first minister Paul Givan urged take-up of the Covid vaccination booster, warning that a “storm coming our way”. However his party [the DUP] has opposed Covid certification for entering some hospitality venues. On Monday evening, MLAs debated the regulations in the Assembly chamber where health minister Robin Swann urged united support for the scheme. “A united front is what we need, with joined up policies and united messaging. That has been sadly lacking at critical stages to date,” he told MLAs. “It is my fervent hope that today marks a turning point, that, given the seriousness of our situation, that this House can debate this measure rationally and respectfully.” However, DUP MLA Pam Cameron said her party will not back the Covid certification scheme. There was a protest at Stormont earlier by those opposed to the scheme. Former DUP economy minister Paul Frew, a vocal critic of mandatory certification, was among a number of party members who met with the protesters outside Parliament Buildings. He suggested the scheme could be halted by way of legal challenge. “There are going to be legal challenges, there is no doubt about that and that’s where it might be stopped,” he told demonstrators. “I hear you 100%, and I’m with you, but this will only be tested legally.” Speaking inside the Assembly chamber, Ms O’Neill called for parties to unite. “If ever there was a time for a united front on the public health message, it’s today because we’re facing into a very, very difficult period in the weeks ahead where we see this new variant now coming on stream, we’re probably about two weeks behind what’s happening in England and Scotland and they are getting into very difficult territory,” she told MLAs during Executive Office questions. “We are going to be overwhelmed with this new variant very, very soon. “My priority is to keep businesses open and safe. I want to keep every door opened but to make sure it’s a safe space for people to enter.” Ms O’Neill also said she had spent the weekend speaking to the Treasury, making the case “very strongly” for financial support for businesses. “That’s where we would want to be if we could have the resource to be able to do that,” she added. The vaccine booster programme in Northern Ireland is being accelerated in response to the threat posed by Omicron and has opened up to all over-30s. [...] On Monday morning there were 309 Covid positive patients in hospital, of whom 32 were in intensive care. The US Supreme Court on Monday rejected a challenge to New York’s refusal to allow religious exemptions to its mandate that certain healthcare workers in the state be vaccinated against Covid-19. Acting in two cases, the justices denied emergency requests for an injunction requiring the state to allow religious exemptions while litigation over the mandate’s legality continues in lower courts. Conservative Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have granted the injunction, Reuters reports. Norway will ban the serving of alcohol in bars and restaurants, impose stricter rules in schools and speed up vaccination as part of new efforts to curb the outbreak of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, the government said on Monday. Remote working will be compulsory where possible, mask mandates will be extended and access to public swimming pools and gyms restricted. The measures will come into force overnight from Tuesday to Wednesday and are expected to last four weeks. “For many this will feel like a lockdown, if not of society then of their lives and of their livelihoods,” prime minister Jonas Gahr Stoere told a news conference. The move comes after the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI) warned on Monday that restrictions must be tightened to avoid up to 300,000 people contracting Covid every day. The institute added that there could be up to 200 hospital admissions daily unless stricter measures were put in place. On Monday, Norway logged 358 hospitalisations with Covid, a new daily record. Night clubs in England will have to ask revellers who prefer using their Covid pass to gain entry instead of doing a lateral flow test to show proof that they have had a booster jab as part of future plans, the British health secretary has said. Sajid Javid told parliament on Monday that it is the government’s intention to include proof of a booster jab, once all adults have had a chance to get theirs. He said: From Wednesday - subject to this House’s approval - you’ll need to show a negative lateral flow test to get into nightclubs and large events, with an exemption for the double vaccinated. Once all adults have had a reasonable chance to get their booster jab, we intend to change this exemption to require a booster dose. MPs are due to vote on Tuesday on the requirement for NHS Covid passes showing a person’s vaccine details or test results in England, which would come into effect from Wednesday. But Javid said it was “misleading” to say MPs are being asked to vote on “vaccine passports”. He said: The government has been absolutely clear about when it talks about access to nightclubs or to very large gatherings [...] that the requirement is to take a free lateral flow test and make sure it’s negative. And if you don’t want to do that then you can prove your vaccine status. It’s up to that individual. That’s not a vaccine passport and the sooner we get rid of this misleading description of what the government is proposing, the better. The NHS in England was put onto a crisis footing on Monday night as hospitals were told to discharge as many patients as possible ahead of a potential Omicron-driven surge in Covid cases. Anyone possible should be discharged to care homes, hospices, their own homes and hotels before Christmas in order to free up beds, amid warnings that January could see hospitals caring for even greater numbers of patients than they did at the worst point of the pandemic back in January. Hospitals and GPs have also been told to scale back the normal services they provide, and limit care to those needing urgent attention, so NHS staff can be freed up to deliver boosters, in a letter from NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard and medical director Prof Stephen Powis, who said the service is now facing a major threat classes as a Level 4 “national incident”. Hospitals will undertake fewer non-urgent operations but “highest clinical priority patients”, including people with cancer and those who have been waiting a long time, will be given priority. They have also been told to take ambulance-borne patients into A&amp;E quicker so that paramedics can get back on the road to answer more 999 calls, speed up efforts to bring in nurses from overseas to help tackle the NHS’s lack of staff and send as many patients as possible for surgery at private hospitals. It is understood that 386,000 people in England booked booster jabs – almost 50,000 an hour – during the course of Monday, the first day after Boris Johnson’s appeal to the public to get fully vaccinated as a matter of urgency. However, sources concede that health service bosses do not know when they will be able to hit the 1m jabs a day the prime minister has said are needed. Travel restrictions imposed on people coming to the UK should be removed given how widespread the Omicron variant is in the country, the British health secretary suggested on Monday. PA reports: Sajid Javid told MPs the justification for having the rules is “minimised” by the new coronavirus variant “spreading rapidly” throughout the country. He added he has raised the matter with transport ministers and he hopes the government “can act quickly”. His remarks came after Labour former minister Ben Bradshaw repeated his call for the “very draconian, costly and complex” travel rules introduced only recently to try and stop Omicron arriving in the UK to be dropped. The UK’s largest airlines and travel companies have also expressed their concerns about the “haphazard and disproportionate” restrictions imposed by the government. Tougher rules introduced due to Omicron mean everyone entering the UK must have evidence of a negative pre-departure test, and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from a post-arrival test. People arriving in the UK from the 11 African countries currently on the red list must spend 11 nights in a quarantine hotel at a cost of 2,285 for solo travellers. Mr Javid told the House of Commons: “I think [Mr Bradshaw] makes a very good point, given that we already know that the Omicron variant is fast becoming the dominant variant in our capital city, spreading rapidly throughout the country, the justification for having those rules is minimised. “It’s something that I’ve already raised with my colleagues in the Department for Transport and I do hope that we can act quickly.” [...] It comes as ministers are set to consider whether to replace hotel quarantine with self-isolation at home for fully vaccinated travellers. Sir Keir Starmer, the leader of the UK Labour party, has backed the government’s moves to ramp up the Covid booster jab programme as he warned the NHS is in danger of being “overwhelmed” by the emergence of the new Omicron variant. Starmer said that it was essential to put the national interest first as he urged people to “stick to the rules” and get their top-up injections. Prime minister Boris Johnson announced on Sunday that every eligible adult in England was to be offered a third dose of the vaccine by the end of December. In a televised address in response, Starmer said ministers should have acted sooner in the face of the threat from the fast-spreading Omicron strain. He said: We may not be certain how dangerous it is but we do know that lives are at risk and again our NHS is at risk of being overwhelmed. If that happens more people will die. So we must do everything that we can to protect the NHS. Sir Keir said delivering the accelerated booster jab programme would be a “big challenge” but that he was confident the public would rise to meet it. Time and time again the British people have risen to the challenge so let’s pull together now and do the right thing once more,” he said. At times like this, we must all put the national interest first and play by the rules. Of course I understand that sticking to the rules can be inconvenient but stick to the rules we must. It would be easy to let the festivities we’ve all been looking forward to, divert us from our national duty. Getting jabbed, wearing masks and working from home if we can really will help prevent infections and help prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. Hello, I’m Jedidajah Otte and I’ll be taking over now. Feel free to get in touch if you would like to flag anything you think is relevant to our coverage, I’m on Twitter @JedySays or you can email me. Nigeria will destroy around 1 million expired Covid-19 vaccines, the head of its primary care agency has said. It’s been a quieter day today as Omicron continues its spread around the world, but the blog has still posted about lots of important developments. Cyprus introduced new measures to curb a Covid surge, including vaccinations for 11-15 year olds, isolation for cases and close contacts, and bringing forward boosters. China reported its first Omicron case in the northern city of Tianjin from an overseas returnee. The UK reported its first patient to have died from Omicron, as the government issued a warning to the public not to assume the variant is less dangerous than other strains. Citizens are rushing to get their booster jabs to protect themselves against the new variant, which is poised to replace Delta as the dominant strain in the UK, with queues round the block for vaccination centres and the NHS website crashing under the demand for appointments. Norway announced plans to introduce new restrictions, which will be unveiled at a press conference tonight. Rachel Hall here signing out for the rest of the day. Thanks for following and for sharing your tips and insights with me. The global Covid blog will continue this evening, in Jedidajah Otte’s capable hands. Italy reported 98 coronavirus-related deaths on Monday against 66 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections fell to 12,712 from 19,215. Reuters reports: Italy has registered 134,929 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 5.24 million cases to date. Patients in hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 6,951 on Monday, up from 6,697 a day earlier. There were 60 new admissions to intensive care units, up from 54 on Sunday. The total number of intensive care patients increased to 856 from a previous 829. Some 313,536 tests for COVID-19 were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 501,815, the health ministry said. Reuters have published a handy summary of key developments today in the spread of Omicron. Europe Britain reported at least one death from the Omicron variant, the first publicly confirmed death globally, and urged people to get booster shots. Britain’s health secretary said the Omicron variant will become the dominant variant in the capital in the next 48 hours, while Denmark expects it to become dominant this week. Norway will further tighten restrictions in a bid to limit an expected surge of Omicron, its prime minister said. Middle east and Africa The president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has the world’s lowest vaccination rate at roughly 0.1%, urged people to get inoculated after the Omicron variant was detected there and as cases increase exponentially. Around 400,000 Covid-19 vaccines are set to expire in Senegal by end-December, the head of its immunisation programme said, as the country faces logistical problems, short shelf life and vaccine hesitancy. Ghana’s main international airport operator said it will fine airlines $3,500 for every passenger they bring in that is not vaccinated or that tests positive on arrival. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who tested positive on Sunday, is still showing mild symptoms, his office said. Emma Raducanu, the 19-year-old British champion of the U.S. Open, tested positive and will miss this week’s exhibition event in Abu Dhabi. Asia-Pacific Major Chinese manufacturing province Zhejiang is fighting its first cluster this year, with hundreds of thousands of citizens in quarantine and virus-hit areas suspending business operations, cutting flights and cancelling events. Health authorities in Tianjin have detected mainland China’s first Omicron case, state media reported. Eight Hong Kong pro-democracy activists were sentenced to up to 14 months in prison for a Tiananmen vigil last year, which the police had banned citing coronavirus restrictions. New Caledonia’s pro-independence movement rejected Sunday’s “no” vote, in which over half of voters abstained after France declined to delay the ballot to allow for a mourning period following a surge in infections. Americas The United States crossed 50 million cases on Sunday, according to Reuters tally. Catholic pilgrims estimated at over 1.5 million people gathered in Mexico City on Sunday for the annual Virgin of Guadalupe gathering after festivities were cancelled last year. A Brazilian Supreme Court justice ruled on Saturday the country must demand proof of vaccination for visitors seeking entry, a day after hackers hit the health ministry website targeting vaccination data. Australia may manufacture mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 and other diseases by 2024 under an in-principle agreement struck with pharmaceutical giant Moderna, Sarah Martin reports. The Omicron variant of the coronavirus is spreading rapidly and will become the dominant variant in the British capital in the next 48 hours. The UK’s Health Secretary Sajid Javid told parliament: “No variant of COVID-19 has spread this fast.” “While Omicron represents over 20 percent of cases in England, we’ve already seen it rise to over 44% in London and we expect it to become the dominant Covid-19 variant in the capital in the next 48 hours.” Denmark has said that Omicron is expected to become the dominant coronavirus variant this week, with new daily cases reaching around 10,000. The country’s Serum Institute has detected 3,437 Omicron cases since it was first detected in Denmark on 22 November. In the UK, 54,661 people tested positive for coronavirus on Monday, while there were 38 deaths within 28 days of a positive death, and 926 people were admitted to hospital, official figures show. The weekly case tally was 9.2% higher than the preceding week, at 363,682. Cyprus will start vaccinating children between the ages of 5 to 11 as part of a package of new measures to curb a Covid surge following the first confirmed cases of the omicron variant on the island. Health Minister Michalis Hadjipantela unveiled the additional measures, which included cutting the mandatory six-week waiting period for booster shots by two weeks, and tighter restrictions for infected individuals and close contacts. Associated Press reports: Hadjipantela said anyone diagnosed with the omicron variant or any other new mutation will have to undergo compulsory isolation at their usual residence. Close contacts will be required to undergo a rapid antigen test within 72 hours and a PCR test a week later. Booster shot recipients are exempted. Meanwhile, the country’s SafePass — or proof of vaccination — will be revoked as of Wednesday for anyone not receiving a booster shot within seven months of completing their inoculation. Also as of this week, unvaccinated people will be barred from attending christenings, weddings and hotel receptions on top of an earlier decision to exclude them from stadiums, cinemas, theaters and nightclubs. There are calls in Germany for its vaccine advisory panel to overhaul the way it evaluates Covid-19 shots in a bid to tame soaring infections. Reuters reports: The panel of 18 appointees known as STIKO last week recommended vaccinations for limited numbers of children, including those at risk of developing severe Covid-19, but stopped short of a blanket recommendation for 5-11 year olds. That limited approval, combined with STIKO taking weeks to fall into line with Germany’s regional health ministers widening the eligibility for booster shots from September, has stoked a debate on whether the expert panel needs to be reorganised to speed up decisions to keep up with the of pace of the coronavirus. In recent weeks, Germany has been among the worst-hit countries in western Europe, with infection rates among school-age children twice as high as the all-age rate. At least 200,000 Covid-19 vaccines have expired in Senegal without being used in the past two months and another 200,000 will expire at the end of December due to slow demand. Reuters reports: African governments have been calling for more Covid-19 vaccines to help catch up with richer regions, where vaccine rollouts have been humming along for more than a year. Yet, as the pace of supply has picked up in recent weeks some countries have struggled to keep pace. Logistical problems, the short shelf life of vaccines that arrive from donors, and vaccine hesitancy have all kept doses from reaching arms. Up to 1 million Cpvid-19 vaccines expired in Nigeria last month, Reuters revealed. “The main problem is vaccine hesitation,” said Ousseynou Badiane, who is in charge of Senegal’s vaccine rollout. “The number of cases is decreasing. They ask: ‘why is it important to get vaccinated if the illness is not there now’?” Senegal is currently vaccinating between 1,000 and 2,000 people per day, Badiane told Reuters, down from 15,000 during the summer. At this pace, it cannot use all the vaccines it has. Part of the problem is the short shelf life of vaccines that arrive from donors that include the United States and China. Our science correspondent Linda Geddes has written about whether lateral flow Covid tests can be trusted in the face of the Omicron variant. She writes that the emergence of Omicron has thrown a spanner in the works: According to the latest data, just one month after your second Pfizer or AstraZeneca jab, the ability of antibodies to neutralise Omicron is 30 times lower than if you were infected with the Delta variant – reinforcing the message that double-vaccination is no guarantee against infection. So, if you’re relying on a LFT to guide whether or not it is safe for you to leave the house, the odds of it being wrong just got higher. You can read her full analysis here: An update from the Guardian’s China correspondent, Vincent Ni, on the situation in the country. Mainland China has reported its first Omicron case in the northern city of Tianjin, as the country’s eastern province of Zhejiang has been battling a rise in new infections of Delta variant in recent weeks. The Chinese authorities reported that the Omicron case was detected from an overseas returnee, who showed no symptoms upon arrival on 9 December. The patient is now being quarantined and treated in a designated hospital. The first Omicron case in Tianjin came as its nearby Beijing is gearing up for the Winter Olympics, which is to be held in February. The Guardian understands the patient is not related to the Games. The arrival of Omicron – thought to be a more transmissible variant than Delta - comes as the eastern Zhejiang province – a province with 65 million population – is battling against its first domestic cluster outbreak this year. Among the 80 new locally transmitted cases with symptoms in mainland China on 12 December, 74 were identified in Zhejiang. In October, the province reported just one local case. The outbreak in Zhejiang – home to the e-commerce giant Alibaba - has led more than a dozen publicly listed companies to halt production on Monday. Their shares fell sharply as a result. The companies said that they would comply with the anti-virus control measures imposed by the local government, which will decide when production can be resumed. Among the worst-affected cities in Zhejiang province is Shaoxing. Since 5 December, 123 of the 192 cases detected in the province were from the city of 5 million. A mass testing programme is under way. Early this month, the Chinese region of Hong Kong – which runs a separate health system from the Mainland - reported it first cases of Omicron. On Monday, the territory reported two additional cases of the variant, bringing the total to seven. Hong Kong’s health authorities said that both cases were imported from the UK, where Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs on Monday that Omicron now represents 20% of Covid cases in England. Reuters has published some facts and figures on the Covax programme, which is backed by the World Health Organization and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (Gavi), and aims to deliver vaccines to poorer countries. The programme has delivered more than 610m Covid-19 vaccine doses to 144 countries, Gavi data shows. But in September, the 2021 delivery target was cut by nearly 30% to 1.425bn doses. China has detected its first Omicron case, in a traveller arriving from overseas in the northern port city of Tianjin, state-run Tianjin Daily reports. The traveller arrived in the city on 9 December and is being treated in isolation in hospital. Hungary has detected its first two cases of Omicron, according to state television. Denmark is pushing forward its vaccine programme to enable everyone over 40 to receive a third booster dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. This would mean that everyone aged 40 and above can get the vaccine four and a half months after the second jab, the country’s health authority said. Reuters reports: A third dose is “safe and effective” as soon as three months after the initial vaccine course, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said last week. Denmark is second worldwide only to the UK in confirmed cases of Omicron, with both countries having extensive sequencing of samples to detect variants quickly. Russia’s parliament is abandoning a draft bill that would have required people travelling by plane or train to present QR codes showing proof of immunity to Covid-19. Reuters reported that the U-turn came in response to strong public opposition to the proposal, which would effectively have forced people to get vaccinated - or show that they had caught the disease and recovered - in order to travel around the country. Russia has the third highest death toll from Covid-19 after the United States and Brazil, and the Kremlin has expressed frequent frustration at the slow public uptake of the Russian-made Sputnik V vaccine. British prime minister Boris Johnson said on Monday the first patient had died after contracting the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, Sky News reports. The Guardian’s full report is here: Norway will further tighten its coronavirus restrictions this week in order to limit the spread of the virus, Reuters reports. Prime minister Jonas Gahr Støre told Norwegian news agency NTB on Monday. “The situation is serious. The spread of infection is too high and we have to take action to limit this development.” Norway is setting record highs both in terms of new Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations, partly due to the spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. A news conference will be held at 8pm CET tonight to outline the measures. UK vaccination centres have been overwhelmed with demand for the booster vaccination, which is a key tool in the country’s bid to stem a “tidal wave” of Omicron. The NHS website has crashed under the scale of demand, while long queues have been reported outside vaccinations centres around the country. On Sunday night, the prime minister Boris Johnson unveiled plans to vaccinate 1 million people per day – higher than any time so far in the campaign – to limit the variant’s rapid spread and avoid reintroducing restrictions that would have onerous implications for society and the economy.

You can reach me at rachel.hall@theguardian.com. The focus on this blog is the biggest global coronavirus stories, but there’s more UK-specific news on our UK Covid blog. Thailand will halve to three months the time between administering a second Covid-19 vaccine shot and a booster, health officials have said, to try to strengthen immunity in anticipation of a local spread of the Omicron variant. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa, 69, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, though is showing only mild symptoms, the presidency said. Indonesia will start administering Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six to 11 on Tuesday. Australia’s most isolated state – Western Australia – will fully reopen its borders on 5 February after almost two years sealed off from Covid and the world. The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced on Monday plans to allow interstate and international travellers to enter the state without quarantine from midnight on 5 February, when the state was expected to hit its 90% fully vaccinated target. Russia says it has detected Omicron in 16 people who returned from South Africa. The Interfax news agency cited deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova giving the figures. Pakistan has also detected its first confirmed Omicron case. New work from home guidance takes effect in England today, following recently tightened coronavirus guidance. British prime minister Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. New Zealand health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, believed to be skirting tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. That is it from me, Martin Belam, today. You can look forward to the company of Rachel Hall to take you through the rest of the day’s global Covid news. Andrew Sparrow has our combined UK Covid and politics live blog. I will see you tomorrow. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic the president of one of the largest Native American–run non-profits has warned that health and economic disparities are still seriously affecting Indigenous communities, despite some progress achieved by the Biden administration. Josh Arce, president of the Partnerships with Native Americans (PWNA), told the Guardian in an interview that challenges affecting Indigenous groups ranged from health inequities such as high rates of diabetes, heart disease and other illnesses to inadequate infrastructure such as running water and reliable electricity. Nearly all of these problems were worsened by the pandemic. “The issues are, by and large, some of the same issues that we’ve been confronted with but they’ve been really highlighted and exacerbated by Covid-19 throughout the past two and a half years,” said Arce, who added that such challenges “really permeate all aspects of Native life and communities”. For centuries, Indigenous communities in the US have faced challenges in public health, education, infrastructure and other areas, an aftershock of violent colonization and widespread racism. While the Biden administration has marked some progress, such as the appointment of Native American Deb Haaland as secretary of the interior, an achievement that Arce noted was critical and brought hope to Native communities, Arce warned that more action is needed to ensure more progress for Indigenous communities in the US. Read more of Gloria Oladipo’s report here: Native American communities lashed by Covid, worsening chronic inequities India has reported its lowest tally of active Covid-19 cases in 18 months, but a sharp drop in the use of protective face masks is causing concern after a rise in the number of infections with the Omicron variant. Many people have been standing or sitting close to each other without masks, or covering only their chins, at big rallies held by political parties in several states before elections. Something similar happened before the Delta variant ravaged India from April. Cases have come down sharply since then, with an active Covid-19 total of 91,456 as of early Monday, the lowest in 561 days, according to the health ministry. Krishna N Das and Chandini Monnappa report for Reuters that cases of the Omicron variant though have risen to at least 36 in India, and accounted for 3% of the virus sequences analysed in the country in the past two weeks, with Delta accounting for the rest. Health authorities have been urging people to cover their mouths in public. “The falling graph of mask use could cost us,” top Indian health official Vinod Kumar Paul told a recent news briefing. “Mask is a universal vaccine, works on every variant.” France will be hit by a sixth Covid-19 wave next month due to the emergence of the new, more contagious, Omicron variant of the disease while the country is still in the midst of the current, Delta-fuelled, fifth wave of the pandemic, according to a leading French hospital executive. “We haven’t said a word on the sixth wave, which is Omicron, which will come later, in January,” Martin Hirsch, head of Paris’s AP-HP hospitals group, Europe’s largest hospital system, told RTL radio according to Reuters. Pakistan has confirmed its first case of the Omicron variant, in the country’s most populous city of Karachi, the country’s National Institute of Health (NIH) said on Monday. “The NIH has been able to confirm … that a recently suspected sample from Karachi is indeed the ‘Omicron variant’,” the NIH said in a Tweet. “This is the first confirmed case but continued surveillance of suspected samples is in place to identify the trends.” Authorities in the south Asian nation had begun investigating a first suspected case of the Omicron variant of coronavirus last week, a health ministry official told Reuters on Thursday. After a provincial official in southern Sindh province initially said the variant had been identified in a private hospital patient, the NIH had then said they were still carrying out sequencing to confirm the case was that of Omicron. Pakistan this month placed travel restrictions on several countries in southern Africa in the wake of the discovery of the variant. Andrew Sparrow has launched our UK Covid and politics live blog here, so he will be picking up further UK developments there. I’ll be continuing here with the latest coronavirus news from around the globe. Stephen Reicher, professor of psychology at the University of St Andrews, urged people to “think carefully” about their social contacts in the run-up to Christmas. PA Media quotes the member of government advisory body the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours (Spi-B) told ITV’s Good Morning Britain saying: At the moment, we’re in a situation where the new variant in effect is coming at us like an express train. We’ve got to do something or else we’re in real danger of overwhelming our society and overwhelming the NHS. And there’s so many things you can do. The first thing, and the most obvious thing, is that if you reduce the number of social contacts you have you limit the spread of the infection. Now, nobody wants to give up their Christmas parties, and nobody wants to miss out on meeting up with people. It’s a little bit like Christmas dinner – if you have too big a Christmas breakfast, then you spoil your appetite for your Christmas dinner, which is what really counts. And I think, in the same way, we need to think really seriously about our contacts. How important are they? Do we really need them and is it more important to act carefully now so that the contacts we really want and we really need are still happening? We won’t get any official figures on the impact of England’s new “work from home if possible” directive on transport for a few hours yet, but ITV’s London political correspondent Simon Harris has just posted a picture of his very empty commute this morning. Some follow-up on the latest Omicron concerns in Wales, where Cathy Owen reports for WalesOnline that health minister Eluned Morgan has warned new restrictions might be needed. Owen writes: Speaking on BBC Politics Wales, Ms Morgan said she expected the numbers in Wales to “change very quickly in a very short space of time”. Asked whether that advice might change, Ms Morgan said: “I think there will come a point where that may be likely to happen. The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind of restrictions that we saw last Christmas unless we absolutely have to. We know that last Christmas was really disappointing for so many people. That’s not where we want to be. But we will always act in the best interests of the people of Wales.” Wales’ coronavirus rules are now being reviewed weekly instead of every three weeks in response to the new variant. In response to Boris Johnson’s televised statement yesterday, first minister of Wales Mark Drakeford said: This is a fast-moving form of coronavirus, which has the potential to cause a large wave of infections in Wales. This could lead to large numbers of people needing hospital treatment at a time when our NHS is under significant pressure. Our best defence continues to be vaccination. Emerging evidence shows the booster dose is vital. We are doing everything we can to accelerate our vaccination programme to increase the number of people who will receive their booster in the coming days and weeks. Older people and those at greatest risk are being prioritised at the moment. Scotland’s health secretary Humza Yousaf has been on the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland radio programme today, and said that it was “inevitable” that first minister Nicola Sturgeon would announce further anti-Covid measures when she addresses the Scottish parliament tomorrow. Sturgeon has said that following yesterday’s television address by the UK’s prime minister, Scotland would also be expanding its booster programme. The BBC quote her saying: I can confirm that urgent work is under way to further accelerate roll out of the booster vaccination programme in Scotland. Scotland already has the highest proportion of the over-12 population protected with booster or third doses of all the UK nations. Now, however, urgent efforts are being made to step up the pace even further with the aim of offering a booster jag appointment to all eligible adults by the end of this year if possible. Thailand will halve to three months the time between administering a second Covid-19 vaccine shot and a booster, a health official said on Monday, to try to strengthen immunity in anticipation of a local spread of the Omicron variant. Reuters report that Thailand has so far detected eight imported cases of the Omicron variant but has yet to see community transmission, according to its health ministry. Omicron has been reported in dozens of countries. “Because Omicron is now widespread, the booster third shot would help lessen the severity of symptoms and reduce the death rate,” said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, spokesperson for the government’s Covid taskforce. Taweesin said recipients of a second shot in August or September could get boosters right away at any vaccine centre nationwide. More than 43 million people – or 60% of people in Thailand – have received two doses of a vaccine so far. The UK’s health secretary Sajid Javid has been across the airwaves this morning. Another couple of key points to emerge over his appearances. Firstly he has not been willing to rule out any further measures to attempt to curb the predicted spread of the Omicron variant, including closing schools. He also suggested that non-clinically trained civil servants could be drafted in to helping with the administration at vaccination centres as the government attempts to roll-out booster jabs at an unprecedented rate. Javid has also defended the planned introduction of vaccine passports, which will be voted on in parliament this week and is due to come into force in England from Wednesday, describing them as a “perfectly reasonable ask”: The Spectator, meanwhile, is suggesting the the current count of Conservative MPs set to vote against further Covid restrictions is up to 71. Here’s a reminder of the latest numbers in the UK: The chief executive of an acute hospital NHS trust in England talks anonymously to us today about the pressures the service is facing: The strain on hospitals is very visible and quite visceral – you can see ambulances queueing outside and people sleeping on chairs because you can’t get them into cubicles to be seen because too many sick people are waiting for beds. But what we can’t necessarily see is what’s happening to all the people who are at home getting sicker. That’s a very large, invisible problem. Many of the people in our hospital are very old and very frail. They don’t necessarily need to be in an acute hospital but they need to be in a bed somewhere, with someone looking after them round the clock. Social care is a massive, massive concern; not being able to get these people who are medically fit to be discharged out and home is what blocks up the “front door”, our A&amp;E. We’re going great guns at treating people on the waiting list. And this winter we’re doing more than ever to protect that, as well as dealing with all the other pressures we have. We are holding beds for people on the waiting list who are having surgery. But that raises really difficult ethical dilemmas. Do you hold an intensive care bed for someone with an aneurysm that could kill them at any minute, or bring in someone who’s just arrived through A&amp;E and needs surgery? Is there a bed for someone who comes in and needs a thrombectomy, a potentially life-saving operation after a stroke? You can imagine how some of our staff feel about unvaccinated people with Covid eating into our supply of ICU beds when you’re making these decisions, about whether someone with stage 4 cancer or an aneurysm can have an operation.

The Western Australian premier, Mark McGowan, announced on Monday plans to allow interstate and international travellers to enter the state without quarantine from midnight on 5 February, when the state was expected to hit its 90% fully vaccinated target. But the premier warned that once the state’s hard border was eased, unvaccinated or “high-risk” arrivals will still be required to quarantine for 14 days – unless they are under 12 or exempt on medical grounds. “I’m confident that this is the right time and the right way to take this important step,” McGowan said. “West Australians have lived a normal life inside our Covid-free bubble and nearly 2 million people have done the right thing and gotten vaccinated. The announcement comes on the same day Scott Morrison said that visa-holding skilled workers and students will be allowed into Australia from Wednesday. Read more of Narelle Towie’s report here: Western Australia to reopen border on 5 February after almost two years sealed off from the world The boss of the organisation which represents NHS trusts said pressure on health services is “not sustainable”. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News a combination of record highs in 999 calls, the second-highest ever number of emergency department admissions, elective procedure backlogs, the extension of the booster campaign, and social care pressure mean the NHS is “busier than its ever been before.” He said: “That’s obviously a worry because it’s before the traditional winter peak in January and it’s before any cases really coming into hospitals and we are now starting to do in terms of Omicron cases, so we’re already at beyond full stretch, in our view, before either of those things occur so it’s a worrying time, but as you’d expect everybody on the NHS frontline is doing absolutely the best they can to provide the best possible care.” He added yesterday’s request from the prime minister for “extraordinary effort” comes as staff are “very, very tired”. PA Media quote Hopson saying: “I think staff are worried, to be frank, that this level of pressure is going to become normalised and it’s not sustainable.” He also told Sky News a social care staff shortage and the removal of some beds to control coronavirus infections meant hospitals were trying to operate with 30-35% fewer beds. He said 11% of beds were occupied by patients who were fit to leave hospital but could not be discharged due to a lack of social care staff, meanwhile hospitals were operating at between 94% and 96% capacity. He explained how the social care sector could not deliver 1.5m hours of at-home care for patients because workers had left to take jobs in retail, logistics, and hospitality because of better pay and sign-on bonuses, revealing a lack of a “sustainable workforce model” in the NHS and social care. One line of questioning for UK health secretary Sajid Javid this morning has been the effectveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine. PA Media quote him saying it would be “completely unfair” to suggest the AstraZeneca vaccine was not as good as once thought. Javid was asked on Sky News: “Is it because AstraZeneca wasn’t as good as we initially thought and actually the booster, either Pfizer or Moderna, is what’s helping?” He replied: “No, I think that would be completely unfair. AstraZeneca has played a phenomenal role in protecting our country.” He added: “The difference now is... this variant, and different types of vaccines will react in different ways. But whether it’s AstraZeneca you had for your first two doses or its Pfizer or Moderna, you still need a booster shot to be protected against this new variant.” There’s been some advice from Ami Jones, an intensive care doctor from Wales on BBC television this morning in the UK to avoid sitting in unventilated rooms with people you don’t know. Associated Press writer Justin Spike has an interesting piece this morning looking at the difficulty of reporting on Covid in Hungary, and how some people argue that a paucity of official information is playing into low vaccination rates. Although Hungary has secured vaccine doses from China and Russia in addition to those provided by the European Union, nearly a third of its adults still have not received a single shot. That hesitancy is something immunologist Andras Falus said can be partly attributed to official communications about the pandemic being “extremely poor, inconsistent and totally incapable of maintaining trust.” “A significant proportion of the population no longer believes when they receive real data, or resign themselves to not paying attention to the data because they feel almost viscerally that it is inconsistent and unreliable,” said Falus, professor emeritus at Semmelweis University in Budapest. Illes Szurovecz of the Hungarian news website 444.hu says the information released by the conservative government of Viktor Orbán does not provide a clear picture of how the outbreak is developing and that it is opaque and difficult to follow. “There’s a lot we don’t know,” Szurovecz said. “If there was more detailed data, people would be better able to judge how severe the pandemic is and how dangerous the virus is. ... Doctors from different parts of the country would be better able to compare their results and care could be improved.” In lieu of more comprehensive data from official channels, Szurovecz and his colleagues track what few numbers the government releases and create detailed data visualizations on trends in the pandemic. Without that, he said, “it would be virtually impossible to look back in Hungary today and see how the pandemic has gone.” Lacking official information on how hospitals are faring, many journalists have tried to report from inside Covid wards to get a clearer picture. But Hungary’s government has barred journalists from entering medical facilities to report on the pandemic, and prohibited medical staff from giving interviews, something journalists say has made it impossible to report on worsening conditions, creating a false picture of the situation’s severity. Russia says it has detected Omicron in 16 people who returned from South Africa. The Interfax news agency cited deputy prime minister Tatiana Golikova giving the figures this morning. We know that Russia reported its first two Omicron cases on 6 December. Reuters say that it was not immediately clear if the 16 cases announced this morning included the two reported earlier this month. The UK government health minister Sajid Javid has defended the government’s work from home if possible advice in England, which comes into effect from today. He said on Sky News: At the end of the day, as ministers you have to take all this into account, and understand the trade-off. Because when you do take action like here – we’ve asked people to work from home from today – you know, this has a big impact on people’s lives. It’s not just a distraction, it can be really difficult for people to be away from the office, not to have that social interaction, it can impact their life chances, so we wouldn’t take this action lightly at all. So, based on the advice that we’re getting, but now also on the observed data, we do have two weeks of data where we are seeing this phenomenal growth in infections. It’s already, we estimate, around 40% of infections in London. And so because of this growth rate, and what we now know on the vaccines, that’s why we’ve announced this national mission on the booster programme. UK health secretary Sajid Javid has said “we’ve got to act early” over the Omicron variant because of the threat of exponential growth, despite a low-level of hospitalisations and no reported deaths in the UK yet involving the new variant. On Sky News, interviewer Kay Burley put several Covid-sceptic points to him, suggesting that reports so far show that people infected with the Omicron variant only suffer from a mild illness. Javid said: Omicron has only taken hold in the UK in the last three weeks. It’s already growing at a rate of doubling two to three times two every two to three days. It’s doubling and at that rate you will have a million infections by the end of the month. If I can explain it this way. With Delta, let’s assume that of all the infections around 2% of those people end up in hospital. Omicron, let’s assume it’s half the severity. That’s just half it. If it’s 1% of a much larger number, you still end up in a lot of hospitalisations. To put those figures into a bit more context, what Javid is saying is that if you have 1m infections with Omicron, and that leads to 1% of people being hospitalised, you would have 10,000 hospital admissions. Then the number of infections would double again within three days, and you would have another 20,000 people requiring hospitalisation. The peak level of daily hospitalisations in the UK at the previous height of the pandemic in January 2021 was around 4,500. Javid went on to say: If the government just sort of stuck its head in the sand and said, ‘Let’s just wait and see what happens. Let’s wait for the deaths to happen’, by then it would be too late. The infection growth rate for the next couple of weeks would have been baked in. The next three or four doubling times would have been baked in, and then you’d have me here rightly saying ‘Why didn’t you act earlier? Have you not learned any of the lessons about this virus? Have you not learned about how to try to protect people from it and take action in advance?’ And you would rightly have been able to ask me this question. The first salvo of UK health secretary Sajid Javid’s interview on Sky News has been a restating of the government’s case to expand the booster programme as set out by the prime minister on TV last night. Javid said: What we now know about Omicron, first of all, is that it is spreading at a phenomenal rate, something that we’ve never seen before. It’s doubling every two to three days in infections. And that means we’re facing a tidal wave. We are once again in a race between the vaccine and the virus. The second thing that we now know for sure is that the vaccines two doses are not enough, but three doses still provide excellent protection against symptomatic infection. And that’s why the booster programme has become more important than ever. He also made a direct appeal to viewers We are throwing everything at it, and can I just please say this to your viewers, please play your part. This could not be more important. We need to win this race against this virus. We’ve never seen this kind of growth before. So please do come forward. Protect yourselves, your loved ones, and your community. Here is a reminder of the latest situation in the UK. Over the last seven days there have been 360,480 new coronavirus cases recorded in the UK. Cases have increased by 11.9% week-on-week. There have been 834 deaths recorded with 28 days of a positive Covid test in the last week. Deaths have increased by 0.5% week-on-week. Hospital admissions have increased by 3.7% week-on-week. At the latest count on the UK government’s own dashboard, there were 7,413 people in hospital in total with coronavirus, of whom 900 are in ventilation beds. Hello, it’s Martin Belam here in London taking over from Samantha Lock in Sydney. The UK media round is being done by the health secretary, Sajid Javid, this morning. He is up on Sky News first, so I’ll have the key lines from that shortly. New work from home guidance takes effect in England today, following recently tightened coronavirus guidance. British prime minister Boris Johnson made the announcement at a Downing Street press conference last week, saying people must work from home where possible from Monday. Although the government instruction that people in England should work from home where possible from Monday is advice and not legally mandatory, organisations across the country are switching to home working where possible. However, some companies have told workers they can continue to come to the office if required for their mental health. Ukraine has just released its daily Covid count. Another 4,073 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were recorded for Sunday, 12 December. The country also reported 188 deaths. If you’ve just joined us, here is a quick run-down of all the latest Covid developments. British prime minister Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. Announcing the booster offensive, Johnson said two doses of vaccine were not enough, but scientists were confident that three would make a huge difference. The US is approaching the grim milestone of 50m coronavirus cases with a total of 49,921,405 reported since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. The number of deaths stand at 797,346. Although infections appeared to be in decline, daily increases have been reported for the past two weeks, with the number of hospitalised Covid patients also rising and up 20%. States in colder parts of the country are seeing the biggest surge in new infections on a per capita basis, including Vermont, New Hampshire and Michigan. Britain faces a “tidal wave” of the Omicron variant and two vaccine doses will not be enough to contain it, prime minister Boris Johnson warned, as he accelerated the nation’s booster rollout programme. Russia has recorded a cumulative total number of Covid cases that now exceeds 10 million. The European Central Bank’s vice-president Luis de Guindos has tested positive for Covid-19 and is self-isolating, the ECB said. The US is set to reach 800,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Three doses of a Covid-19 vaccine is the “optimal care” but two doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccines or one of the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine remains the US government’s official definition of fully vaccinated, infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci said. Australia will shorten the wait time for people to receive a Covid-19 booster following a rise in Omicron cases. More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies have suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of China’s eastern Zhejiang province. Australians are preparing for quarantine-free travel across most of the country during the Christmas period as the state of Queensland opened its domestic borders to all vaccinated people for the first time in nearly five months. South Korea will test artificial intelligence-powered facial recognition to track Covid-19 cases. South Africa’s president Cyril Ramaphosa, 69, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, though is showing only mild symptoms, the presidency said. Indonesia will start administering Covid-19 vaccinations for children aged six to 11 on Tuesday, a health ministry official said. New Zealand health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, believed to be skirting tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. More than a dozen Chinese-listed companies said they had suspended production in coronavirus-hit parts of China’s eastern Zhejiang province in response to local government’s tightened Covid-19 curbs, Reuters reports. Share prices have also reportedly plunged. Zhejiang reported a total of 173 locally transmitted cases with confirmed symptoms during the 6-12 December period, official numbers showed on Monday, marking the province’s first domestic cluster outbreak this year. In October, the province reported just one local case. A slew of companies, including Ningbo Homelink Eco-Itech Co Ltd (301193.SZ), Zhejiang Zhongxin Fluoride Materials Co Ltd (002915.SZ), Zhejiang Jingsheng Mechanical &amp; Electrical Co Ltd (300316.SZ) and Zhejiang Fenglong Electric Co Ltd (002931.SZ), announced the production suspension through exchange filings over the weekend. Their shares fell sharply in early trading on Monday with some falling more than 7%. India has just released its daily Covid report. The country reported 7,350 new cases in the last 24 hours with an active caseload of 91,456; the lowest in 561 days. Another 202 deaths were also reported. Super-spreader events in NSW and reinfections in Victoria have health authorities worried as Covid-19 infections continue to grow. Victoria reported 1,290 new cases and two deaths, while New South Wales recorded 536 new cases, amid increasing numbers of the Omicron variant. Health authorities in NSW are battling to contain several large transmission events, including cases of the rapidly spreading Omicron variant – with 64 cases of the new strain now recorded in the state. Of the 536 new cases announced in the state on Monday, nine were confirmed to have the Omicron variant, with NSW Health saying “more are expected as results of genomic testing are confirmed”. Read the full story here. Germany is reporting an additional 21,743 new daily Covid cases and 116 deaths, according to recently published figures from the Robert Koch Institute. The numbers are a significant drop from previous days, with 39,585 cases reported on 10 December 45,460 cases on 9 December. Covid infections have been steadily decreasing in the European nation since new lockdowns were introduced. South Africa has reported an additional 37,875 new coronavirus cases, which includes 19,840 retrospective cases and 18,035 new cases, according to the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD). In the past 24 hours a total of 18,035 positive Covid-19 cases and 21 Covid-related deaths were reported. The total number of fatalities in the country currently stands at 90,137. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, is currently in self-isolation in Cape Town and has delegated all responsibilities to deputy president David Mabuza for the next week. Experts have warned that the next variant of Covid-19 to sweep the world could emerge on Australia’s doorstep, due to incredibly low rates of vaccination rates in Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is Australia’s closest neighbour, and at its nearest point is just 4km from Australian territory in the Torres Strait. At various points in the pandemic there have been fears that travellers from PNG could bring the virus to Australia. Adrian Prouse, head of international humanitarian programs at the Australian Red Cross, said: I’m worried that PNG is the next place where a new variant emerges.” “In PNG less than 5% [of the adult population is vaccinated], in Indonesia, just under one-third. Two countries right on our doorstep with significant challenges in getting vaccines into arms.” Stefanie Vaccher, an epidemiologist with the Burnet Institute who has been based in PNG since last year, echoed this concern. “In populations that have low rates of vaccination coverage, there are more opportunities for the virus to spread and mutate. In PNG, where less than 4% of the population are vaccinated, there are a lot of opportunities for the virus to mutate and spread.” Read the full story here. Canada will start recognising molecular Covid-19 tests conducted at an accredited lab in South Africa for residents returning home, dropping travel restrictions previously introduced to prevent the spread of the Omicron variant. Ottawa faced pressure from doctors, stranded passengers and the World Health Organization to reverse requirements that travellers from 10 southern African countries get molecular PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests in a third country before returning to Canada. Canada has now dropped the need to obtain a pre-departure negative Covid-19 PCR test from a third country, according to a travel advisory issued on Saturday. The exemption will be in place until 7 January 2022 and will apply to all indirect flights departing from South Africa to Canada, the advisory added. There is no change to Canada’s ban on all foreign travellers from 10 African countries. Here’s a quick snapshot of the latest Omicron report from the World Health Organization (WHO). Based on current limited evidence Omicron appears to have a growth advantage over Delta. It is spreading faster than Delta in South Africa where Delta circulation was low, but also appears to spread more quickly than Delta in other countries where the incidence of Delta is high. Given the current available data, it is likely that Omicron will outpace the Delta variant where community transmission occurs. While preliminary findings from South Africa suggest it may be less severe than Delta and all cases reported in the EU/EEA to date have been mild or asymptomatic, it remains unclear to what extent Omicron may be inherently less virulent. More data are needed. There are limited available data, and no peer-reviewed evidence, on vaccine efficacy or effectiveness to date for Omicron. Preliminary evidence suggests a reduction in vaccine efficacy against infection and transmission associated with Omicron.” Here’s an interesting story out of New Zealand today. Health authorities are investigating claims that a man received up to 10 Covid-19 vaccination doses in one day on behalf of other people, believed to be skirting tough restrictions on the unvaccinated. The Ministry of Health said it was taking the matter seriously. “We are very concerned about this situation and are working with the appropriate agencies,” its Covid-19 vaccination and immunisation spokesperson, Astrid Koornneef, said. Local news outlets report the man is believed to have visited several immunisation centres and was paid to get the doses. In New Zealand vaccines can either be booked through a website, via a doctor, or people can turn up to walk-in centres. To be administered a vaccine, a person must provide the health care worker with their name, date of birth and physical address, but no further identification is required. Read the full story from our reporter, Eva Corlett, on the ground in New Zealand. The United States surpassed 50 million coronavirus cases on Sunday, according to a Reuters tally. After about two months of declining infections, the United States has reported daily increases for the past two weeks, driven by the more easily transmitted Delta variant. States in colder parts of the country are seeing the biggest surge in new infections on a per capita basis, including Vermont, New Hampshire and Michigan. The number of hospitalised Covid patients is rising as well, up 20% since the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November. Over the past month, deaths have increased by 4.6%, with the country’s death toll surpassed 800,000. Nearly half of US states have detected cases of the Omicron variant, but the Delta variant still accounts for 99% of current Covid cases, CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky said. Speaking of South Korea, the south Asian country has just released their daily Covid numbers. A further 5,817 coronavirus cases were recorded over the past 24 hours, with 40 confirmed deaths. A total of 83.7 % of the eligible population has at least one Covid vaccine and 81.2 % are fully vaccinated, according to ministry of health data. South Korea will soon roll out a pilot project to use artificial intelligence, facial recognition and thousands of CCTV cameras to track the movement of people infected with the coronavirus, Reuters reports. The nationally funded project in Bucheon, one of the country’s most densely populated cities on the outskirts of Seoul, is due to become operational in January, a city official told the news agency. The system uses an AI algorithms and facial recognition technology to analyse footage gathered by more than 10,820 CCTV cameras and track an infected person’s movements, anyone they had close contact with, and whether they were wearing a mask, according to a 110-page business plan from the city submitted to the Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communications Technology), and provided to Reuters by a parliamentary lawmaker critical of the project. The Bucheon official said the system should reduce the strain on overworked tracing teams in a city with a population of more than 800,000 people, and help use the teams more efficiently and accurately. The system can reportedly track up to ten people in five to ten minutes, cutting the time spent on manual work that takes around half an hour to one hour to trace one person. South Korea already has a high-tech contact tracing system that harvests credit card records, cellphone location data and CCTV footage, among other personal information. Bucheon mayor Jang Deog-cheon argued that the system would make tracing faster. “It sometimes takes hours to analyse a single CCTV footage. Using visual recognition technology will enable that analysis in an instant,” he said on Twitter. The Ministry of Science and ICT said it has no current plans to expand the project to the national level. It said the purpose of the system was to digitise some of the manual labour that contact tracers currently have to carry out. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday, but was showing mild symptoms, the presidency said. “The President started feeling unwell after leaving the State Memorial Service in honour of former Deputy President FW de Klerk in Cape Town earlier today,” the statement said. “The President, who is fully vaccinated, is in self-isolation in Cape Town and has delegated all responsibilities to Deputy President David Mabuza for the next week,” it added. Hello it’s Samantha Lock with you as we go through all the latest coronavirus developments. The Omicron variant has now spread to 63 countries with faster transmission noted in South Africa and the UK, the World Health Organization has said. Britain faces a “tidal wave” of the Omicron variant of coronavirus and two vaccine doses will not be enough to contain it, prime minister Boris Johnson has warned, as he accelerated the booster rollout programme, bringing forward a target to give over-18s a booster jab by one month to the end of December. “No one should be in any doubt: there is a tidal wave of Omicron coming,” he said in a televised address, after the country’s medical advisers raised the Covid Alert Level due to a “rapid increase” in infection from the variant. “I’m afraid it is now clear that two doses of vaccine are simply not enough to give the level of protection we all need,” Johnson added. South African president Cyril Ramaphosa tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday and is receiving treatment for mild symptoms, the presidency said. “The President started feeling unwell after leaving the State Memorial Service in honour of former Deputy President FW de Klerk in Cape Town earlier today,” the statement said. “The President, who is fully vaccinated, is in self-isolation in Cape Town and has delegated all responsibilities to Deputy President David Mabuza for the next week,” it added. Here is a snapshot of the latest Covid developments: The WHO says the Omicron variant is more transmissible than the Delta strain and reduces vaccine efficacy but causes less severe symptoms according to early data. British prime minister Boris Johnson launched an “Omicron emergency booster national mission” to protect the NHS and patients, ramping up vaccinations and rolling out 1m booster jabs a day. The UK recorded 48,854 new Covid cases and 52 additional deaths, raising the Covid alert level from 3 to 4. The UK also confirmed an additional 1,239 Omicron cases, marking the biggest daily rise to date with the total number of confirmed cases 3,137. America’s top infectious disease expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, said that Omicron “clearly has a transmission advantage” over previous Covid strains and stepped up calls for Americans to get booster shots as the new variant spread to at least 25 states. Austria has ended lockdown restrictions for vaccinated people across most of the country, three weeks after it was imposed. However, more than 25,000 demonstrators turned out in several cities to protest against the country’s compulsory vaccination plan, forcing citizens to be jabbed or face fines from February. Vaccinated people who are identified as a contact of somebody who has tested positive for Covid-19 should take an NHS rapid lateral flow test every day for a week, the UK government announced. Russia’s registered Covid cases passed the 10 million mark today, after nearly 30,000 cases were reported in the last 24 hours. Scotland aims to offer booster jabs to all eligible adults by the end of the year."

          "bodyText": "Name: Zoombies. Age: They are products of our times. Appearance: Pale blue talking heads, dead behind the eyes. I remember them – they lived on an island and needed rescuing. You’re thinking of Zoombinis, the children’s video game. Yeah, maybe. My brain is fried. We’re talking about Zoombies – the exhausted, zombie-like survivors of back-to-back Zoom meetings. This sounds like a pandemic thing. It is – part of a new tide of office jargon coined for a workforce that hasn’t visited an office in almost two years. I love working from home. I’ve only got dressed from the waist up for almost two years. Nevertheless, remote working has consequences. Zooming recreates all the stress of the office without the mitigating compensation of actual human contact. It’s dispiriting and exhausting. I had a Zoom meeting this morning, and everyone was bright-eyed and totally focused on work. If you can’t spot the Zoombie in the Zoom meeting, then the Zoombie is probably you. Everyone did keep asking if I was OK. I’m just tired, I guess. Have you been polyworking, by any chance? No, I’m married. “Polyworking” is another new term: it means seizing the opportunity of home working to perform two or more jobs. You mean people are working harder at home than they would in the office? What is wrong with this country? You know what they say: if a thing is worth doing badly, it’s worth doing two things badly for twice the money. I confess I’d not heard that one. What other jargon is arising from employment in the time of Covid? “Blursday” is a word coined to evoke the idea that the days of the week have lost their significance in the new paradigm. That’s very 2020. And 2021 too, come to think of it. Give me another. Workers now talk about “synchronous communication”, when they just mean speaking to each other in real time. Not in my Zoom meetings they don’t. What else? Are you familiar with the acronym RTO? It rings a bell. It stands for “return to office”, and relates to timings and strategies for the gradual reintegration of a remote workforce into fully synchronous, in-person employment. I’m starting to think we might not need that one. You may be right. Email me asynchronously about it. Do say: “The account manager Zoom-bombed our hybrid team meeting today, which was unprecedented.” Don’t say: “Sorry, I need to take this – it’s my other boss.”"

          "bodyText": "When Tony Hunter first shakes your hand, he holds your gaze a long time, calmly sizing you up, perhaps looking for a common bond. His outback New South Wales drawl is slow, but his mind feels fully engaged. Tell him he looks a lot younger than his 69 years and he looks sceptical: “I lost 10 years to alcohol in there.” Twenty-seven years ago Hunter and his partner, Melinda Bonham, were sitting on the porch of their house in Shalvey, a suburb of Blacktown, when Hunter fell silent, lost in thought. It was 1994, and the local Aboriginal community had endured a long cycle of drug and alcohol addiction, trauma and premature death. After a while, Hunter spoke: “I’ve gotta do something to help my people.” The headquarters of Marrin Weejali in Sydney’s west Marrin Weejali Aboriginal Corporation was born out of that thought. As Hunter strolls around Marrin Weejali’s crowded two-storey building in Blackett, near Mount Druitt, he introduces Rob and Brian, drug and alcohol counsellors. Another man, Drew, simply walks up, shakes hands, and identifies himself as a recovering alcoholic: “I can’t say enough for what Marrin has done for me,” he says. An outsider cannot easily tell counsellors from clients, which is not surprising, since six of the centre’s 10 counsellors, along with Hunter, were once addicts themselves. In the back courtyard, Hunter introduces another worker, Steve. “I found him on the side of the road chasing a lizard,” Hunter says. The reference is mysterious to all but Steve, who laughs, and lingers to chat. No one is in a hurry; everyone seems to have time, and to have come through a great trial. Established by Hunter and Bonham in 1996, Marrin Weejali is Sydney’s only Aboriginal-run drug and alcohol service. In Wiradjuri, the most widely spoken Aboriginal language in NSW, marrin means body and spirit, weejali means essence. The goal is to unite these two in the one person. Marrin’s core philosophy grows out of the therapeutic community model and programs such as Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous, which are built on the belief that people sharing their common experience can solve their common problem. Michael, Chris and Brian chatting with counsellor Brian Hunter at Marrin Weejali Groups meet to discuss not only addiction but mental health, family planning, anger management, and domestic violence. While some are for Kooris only, others are open to all; Marrin Weejali takes anyone who walks through the door. While 80% to 90% of clients are Indigenous, others have white, Islander and South Sudanese backgrounds. “We can’t say no to these non-Aboriginal people, because they grew up with Aboriginal people,” Hunter says. “If you went to school with an Aboriginal fella and he comes in here, where are you going to go? You become part of the Aboriginal community.” ‘From riverbanks to Sydney’ In 1823, governor Macquarie established a native institution in the area in order to effect what he called “the civilisation of the Aborigines of NSW”. It was one of the first public policies “aimed at eliminating Aboriginal cultural traditions and enforcing assimilation with a European way of life,” according to the Blacktown Native Institution Project. In time, people called the place Blacktown. The local government area of Blacktown city contains nearly 400,000 people – 40% of them born overseas. Residents come from 188 countries and speak 182 languages, according to the Blacktown city council website. What makes Blacktown exceptionally diverse is that it also holds Australia’s largest urban Indigenous population: more than 10,000 people, and nearly 5% of the population in Mount Druitt, which is part of Blacktown local government area. For Aboriginal people, Blacktown marks a place of sorrow, of being severed from their ancient life. In these times of statue-toppling and cancel culture, of renaming places and recasting the past in light of present values, the name of Blacktown might have been considered a candidate for the chop. Far from it. Blacktown is one of the most culturally diverse places in Australia In 2015, Liberal Party members of Blacktown council campaigned to change the name of the municipality to western Sydney. Councillor Jess Diaz told Guardian Australia that Blacktown should be “a modern metropolis which people will embrace, aspirational people. The branding of Blacktown is a negative for many developers. I think we should try and give the city a positive name.” Leaders of the Darug people, on whose land Blacktown stands, fiercely objected. They liked the name and the link with their history, however tragic, and it turned out that the people of Blacktown agreed. In a council survey of more than 3,000 residents, 80% voted against changing the name. Blacktown’s Indigenous residents comprise the Darug and a larger group – made up of Wiradjuri people and others who moved from country NSW – and their descendants. It is one of Australia’s great migration stories, rarely told. In the 1960s, many Aboriginal people saw an opportunity to leave behind the oppression of the missions and small towns of outback NSW, and to start a new life in the city. Aboriginal leader Chicka Dixon called it a mass migration “from the riverbanks to Sydney”. These journeys were no less difficult, in many ways more so, than those made by newcomers from overseas, writes Western Sydney University sociologist George Morgan. Many of these migrants arrived in Mount Druitt just as the state government opened the area to public housing. A Housing for Aborigines program was established in 1969. The modernist planning principles of the time sought to clear what were seen as the cramped and unhygienic slums of the inner cities. In new outer suburbs, more spacious houses, quiet streets and big backyards with trees would lead to better lives. But as early as 1969, a local state MP warned that population was running way ahead of planning. “There are thousands of children in the area, no playing fields, no meeting places, nothing for teenagers to do, and inadequate transport facilities to take them anywhere.” These problems dog the area even today. Marrin Weejali client Michael has been attending the centre for more than three months Many families did see their material conditions improve. But there was a catch, writes Morgan. “Prospective housing commission tenants from all social backgrounds – Anglo working class, migrant, Indigenous – had to demonstrate they were capable of living in a manner deemed respectable by those petty officials who assessed their applications.” These pressures fell especially heavily on Indigenous people, Morgan writes. Having been told for generations that their culture and ways of life were worthless, most “naturally felt exposed and inadequate when they moved into suburban housing”. Neighbours watched them closely; the commission discouraged visits by relatives; a woman was twice threatened with eviction because her lawn was not cut. Morgan writes of women, whose male partners were often absent, who succeeded beyond expectations. “They struggled assiduously to keep their houses cleaner than those around them. They dressed their children neatly and respectfully. They were strong and held families together.” One of the Aboriginal women who moved to Sydney and into Mount Druitt public housing was Connie Hunter, along with her son Tony, then 20, and his seven siblings. On a warm Wednesday in April, Hunter sits down to tell his story. He speaks very slowly, laughing sometimes, pausing often, occasionally closing his eyes and remembering. ‘There’s no ticking boxes here, mate’ Hunter and his brothers and sisters grew up in a tin humpy on the banks of the Barwon River, in Brewarrina, or Bree, in far western NSW. In the 1930s, when Connie was just a girl, welfare officers removed her from her family on Angledool Station in the far north of NSW, and brought her to the Brewarrina mission. People think, ‘if Tony can beat his addiction, I can too,’ Tony Hunter says Two of Connie’s sisters had lost all their children to the welfare officers. Whenever the welfare cars came into view, the Hunter children would jump into the river and swim to the other side. Hunter took to Sydney life. He worked as a welfare office for an Aboriginal organisation, then as a foreman for a meat company in Chullora. But in the 1970s, marijuana and amphetamine use were adding to alcohol problems in Mount Druitt, Hunter says. “They caused a lot of division among the Aboriginal people, a lot of thieving. A lot of people were burying their children. The grieving was horrific. And there weren’t any programs for Aboriginal people to help them, counsel them.” Calmly, he lists the casualties in his family. “My old [step] dad, he went first, he died in 77. Then my sister in 84; she was hit by a truck while on the drink. He didn’t stop, and they never found him. Then a young brother died in his sleep with an enlarged heart, alcohol related. Then another brother, then another, all from the alcohol and the speed. These three brothers didn’t see 35 years of age.” In 1989, at the age of 54, Connie had a stroke. She died two years later – in part, Hunter believes, of grief. “By this time, after burying them all, I’m hittin’ the drink pretty heavy by now,” he says. “I was trying to sedate pain, but it was everywhere. I didn’t want to live, and I didn’t want to die.” Hunter can name the date when everything changed: 7 January, 1992. He had been caught drink driving. “My probation officer knew a bloke named Les Beckett. One of those tall Queensland Aboriginal fellas. Now Les Beckett, he had lived an hour and a half from Bree over the border. I’d known him since I was 11 or 12. He’d gotten sober about three years before. The probation officer said, ‘Take this paper over to Les, he’s going to take you to AA meetings, and you tick them off on this form’.” Hunter says he had already been drinking that morning when he took a cab to Beckett’s place in St Mary’s, just west of Blacktown. “Les came out of his house and put his arms around me. He cuddled me. And he said, ‘Tony. I knew God would bring you back to me.’ And I said to myself, ‘Oh no, don’t tell me. He must have done Bible studies. He must have turned a Christian.’” Inside his house, Beckett read the form Hunter had brought from the probation officer, then threw it in the bin. “He said, ‘Tony, there’s no ticking boxes here, mate. There’s a meeting on at St Mary’s at half past 12. Come with me. You might be able to get sober.’” They went to the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. People stood up and told their stories of fighting the grog. Hunter hated and scorned every minute of it. But at the end of the meeting, “they’re all coming up shaking my hand, all these whitefellas, saying: ‘Hello Tony, how are you mate?’” The men went back to Les’s place. “We sat around a big table, and they were just constantly talking to me. It was a windy, cloudy sort of day, and I was looking up at the sky thinking about all the people I’ve lost. I was grieving so much, looking at the clouds, and the tears were rolling out of my eyes. These guys didn’t pull any punches with me. They said, ‘Tony, there’s a way out, mate. You don’t have to drink to have a good life.’ I felt the spiritual part of it through these guys. They were living it. And they were interested in my future, my life. I’d never felt this before.” Hunter went to more meetings. He began to see a counsellor who had also been an alcoholic. “It was like I got this new awakening. I just rocketed out of the dead zone, the evil spirit, where I was pinned down by alcohol.” Melinda Bonham in Plumpton Park, Plumpton ‘Marrin is a sacred protected site’ Hunter and Bonham were a good fit for creating Marrin Weejali: his storytelling power, her gifts in organisation. They consulted addiction specialists, other rehabilitation centres; both did diplomas in drug and alcohol counselling. The organisation began with meetings in a church, then a cottage provided by the housing commission, before federal funding enabled Hunter and Bonham to open a much larger centre in Blackett. But it took eight years to build. The locals fought hard against having an Aboriginal drug and alcohol centre in their midst. Protestors tried to challenge the move in the state land and environment court. After the centre was opened, an old man would walk past and throw dog faeces over the fence. A woman who lived out the back would fire her hose over the fence and drench a group of men sitting in the backyard doing a 12-step program. Slowly, however, Marrin Weejali put down roots. Bonham says attitudes changed when the federal government asked them to be a drop-in centre for filling out the 2011 census. The goal was to address an undercount of Indigenous people in 2006, but any local was able to fill out the form at the centre. “White people would come in, hesitate – ‘What am I going to walk into?’. Our staff would say, ‘Hello, how are you, would you like a cup of tea?’. That really broke down a lot of barriers. Some of those people still drop in today.” Marrin Weejali’s open door policy has taken it beyond its original mission. Locals use its optometrist, and the centre distributes government vouchers to help low-income people pay their energy bills. Young people can volunteer at Marrin Weejali to pay off fines for misdemeanours such as travelling on a train without a ticket. A counsellor, Lesley Strickland, says Aboriginal people see the centre’s phone service as “like the Black Yellow Pages: have you got number for this doctor? Where can I get my cat desexed?” “Marrin Weejali has never been broken into,” Hunter says. “It tells me that the community has taken ownership of this centre.” He laughs: “Marrin is a sacred protected site.” The original Marrin Weejali centre, a cottage provided by the housing commission Bonham says she still sees racism towards young Aboriginal people by some local police. “Strip searching, out in the open, pull them over for no reason, harassment. It’s disgusting.” On the other hand, police use Marrin Weejali’s rooms for meetings, as do corrections officers and other public servants. The centre employs a Vietnamese psychologist and works with a Chinese doctor. “I think there’s still racism in this community but there is quite a bit of learning and blending,” Bonham says. Most important is the long connection Hunter and Bonham have to the Mount Druitt community. People think, “If Tony can beat his addiction, I can too,” Hunter says. The six Aboriginal counsellors at Marrin Weejali are all from Mount Druitt and “all defeated the drug ice”. Bonham says Aboriginal people make good counsellors. “With the sorrow and trauma you understand other people’s journey better. Non-Aboriginal people feel that walking in the door.” One of these counsellors is Brett Moran. In 2009 he was 26 and facing a long jail term. He had been getting high on marijuana and amphetamines – and in and out of custody – since he was 12 years old. When he was charged again, an Aboriginal Legal Service court support officer in Penrith got him referred to Marrin Weejali. “The moment I walked through those gates I felt welcome, I felt comfortable, I didn’t feel judged,” he says. Kicking his addiction was not immediate; it required time in a rehab residential centre, and many hours of sitting in a group with other men, talking about the struggles that had brought them to Marrin Weejali. But on 10 May 2010 – Moran knows the date by heart – he stopped using drugs and has been clean ever since. He now runs the same groups at Marrin Weejali he once joined as a client. “At the end of every day I lie on my pillow and feel grateful for the day I’ve just had,” Moran says. For that he thanks his wife, Kristy, his three young daughters, and Marrin Weejali. “Marrin is a sacred place for me. Thanks to Uncle Tony, Mel, everyone here, I have my family, my freedom, my life.” The steady federal funding Marrin Weejali receives – $2.4m a year at present – is both a measure of its effectiveness, and of the need. “The demand for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander substance misuse … services is appalling,” states a Marrin Weejali annual report. That demand has only grown over the past 10 years with the ravages of the state’s methamphetamines epidemic. Bonham and Hunter are seeking funding to open residential services for men and women who need a home while they try to recover from addiction. Hunter also wants to develop programs that take Aboriginal people back to the bush, “and have people meet them, and walk with them, and say, ‘This is where your family comes from – this is why they left’. To create that opportunity for reflection, to lift their spirit. Some of the stories are sadder than mine. They bring tears to my eyes.” There are heartening stories, too. Hunter tells of a girl from far north Queensland who was using ice. She tapped “Aboriginal” and “drug and alcohol” into Google, and found Marrin Weejali. Staff found her sitting in the foyer with a suitcase and a three-year old child. “She’s living in a nice unit now, she’s working, four or five years sober. She still comes to the NA meetings here on a Friday.” ‘People of understanding’ Brian Hunter has worked at Marrin Weejali for two-and-a-half years The Aboriginal journey from the bush brought gains as well as losses. It led to the development of urban Indigenous organisations, what Morgan calls a “pan-Aboriginal culture and politics”. The work of the late Maria Lane, an Indigenous academic from South Australia, has shown how the postwar migration from the missions has been critical to the surge of Indigenous university students to 20,000 today, twice as many as 10 years before. Some of these students come from Blacktown. But the journey was not kind to Connie Hunter. “I think she regretted leaving her homeland,” her son says. “Down here, there were nice big hotels where she and her friends went to have lunch. I think she joined the Rooty Hill RSL Club, the hospitality she really enjoyed. But it was a different world.” It has become her son’s world. “I’ve been here for 50 years and survived,” Hunter says. Although he and Bonham have moved to “a lovely home” in Windsor, on Saturday mornings, he skips the local shops and drives for half an hour to have coffee at a Greek café in Mount Druitt. “Once you learn to sleep with one eye open, Mount Druitt is a great place. There’s a lot of people that have come here from the fringes of town, from the world of decency. Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. The Tongan community – I talk to some of their elders. You look in their eyes when you talk to them – they’re beautiful people. People of understanding. Want to work together, live together.” Hunter sees us out through the Marrin Weejali courtyard, where two men are making coffee. “This is where people have a cigarette together, where a lot of yarns happen. “Healing can begin with a handshake,” he says. “It knocks down the barrier, reflects straight back into here.” He points at his chest: “The spirit is right here, between our rib cage. Let’s shine a little bit of light and hope in here.” This article is based on a narrative paper on Blacktown written for the Scanlon Foundation Research Institute."

          "bodyText": "Grieving pupils at a primary school in east London are “struggling to cope” after one of their brightest and best-loved classmates was killed over the weekend in an incident being linked to pest control chemicals found in the flats where she lived. Rena Begum, the headteacher of Buttercup primary in Shadwell, said the school was in “great shock” after the death of 11-year-old Fatiha Sabrin in Saturday’s incident. The Metropolitan police were treating her death as unexplained before further tests and a postmortem could be carried out. In a statement it said: “A sweep of the building was carried out by the London fire brigade and a quantity of chemicals – believed to be used for pest control – were discovered. They will be safely removed and an investigation will be carried out to determine how they came to be in the building.” Begum said Fatiha was a school “role model”, who planned to become a doctor and whose written work had just been selected for a national award. After announcing Fatiha’s death to her classmates on Monday, Begum said: “The children are struggling to cope. It is a real shock to them at their young age that suddenly someone is not there. It took them half an hour to take it in, and then everybody started crying and there were tissues everywhere.” Fatiha’s mother, Kanji Fatema, was recovering in hospital after also inhaling toxic fumes at the flat at Nida House in Shadwell. Her seven-year-old brother was back at school after being discharged from hospital. Begum said: “A family friend went to the flat and found two bodies unresponsive. I got a call on the school emergency mobile, was told they were taken to hospital and that Fatiha had been pronounced dead and that the block had been evacuated.” The children’s father was reported to be flying back from Bangladesh, while emergency accommodation was being found for the family. Begum said: “We are doing our best to support the family” and described Fatiha as an “amazing student”. She said: “Every week when someone gets a gold award or star of the week, we write their name down. Her name is still there on the wall. “She was a brilliant writer, and we hope a book will be published soon including her short stories. She just got selected for a national literacy award for young writers.” Begum added: “She had strong dreams of wanting to help the community and becoming a medical professional. Her friends are devastated by her empty seat in class. There was a lot of confusion and tears, it was important for them to just let it out. We are giving them bereavement counselling. “She was a very popular member of the class and always willing to help others when they didn’t understand something. She was one of those students who never had to come to the headteacher’s office. She was a happy and bubbly person.” Fatiha’s class had been due to visit the Imperial War Museum on Monday as part of a project about the first world war. Begum said Fatiha’s family encouraged her to excel. She said: “They are a very supportive family and very ambitious for her. She just did an 11-plus exam to enter a grammar school and not many do that. She knew what she wanted to do in life and her family wanted the best for both of their children.”"

          "headline": "Tedesco goes against the grain to get RB Leipzig up and running",
          "bodyText": "“We need the ball and we need to control the game,” said Domenico Tedesco, summing up his plans at RB Leipzig after a first game, and a first win. If the phrase was fairly anodyne in terms of a new coach setting out his ambitions for a club that wants to continue climbing, it pricked up the ears. This was not from what many thought was the Tedesco playbook. There was a circularity, if not an inevitability, about the 36-year-old pitching up here. Not just because of his fitting the youthful outlook of the club, and not just because he was a coursemate and friend of Julian Nagelsmann in DFB coaching class going back seven years. Tedesco had made his top-flight coaching debut against Leipzig in August 2017, freshly installed in the top job at Schalke in the days when it felt like they might just be a forward-thinking club who could lose their culture of waste without bottoming out, like they did in last season’s relegation. It was a significant game not just for the tyro Tedesco but, it felt, for the Bundesliga as a whole. Leipzig had adapted so smoothly to the top flight for the first time. Against the backdrop of an administrative model that deeply offended swathes of the Bundesliga’s fan community – and they were made to know by just how much on a regular basis – they made clear that they weren’t going anywhere in a hurry. The sporting side of the model not only made light of the leap between divisions, but they offered the promise of sustainability. Ralph Hasenhüttl’s team had the Bundesliga worked out in an instant. Tedesco’s Schalke had an answer to that. In the opening game of the season in Gelsenkirchen, the home side had a plan. Leipzig like to attack, so let them have the ball and see how they deal with it. It was the ultimate second album syndrome for Leipzig – they were in their plush residential studio with writer’s block, drinking endless cups of tea, playing pool and trying to recycle offcuts from their debut. Schalke had 36% possession that day and they picked the visitors off expertly, winning 2-0 in a style that was very un-Schalke, where front-foot football is traditionally encouraged and appreciated. Relatively soon after Roberto Di Matteo’s cautious approach had finished him at the club, Tedesco dared to go circumspect – and it was clear a largely experienced squad were singing off the same hymn sheet straight away. Saturday’s debut in charge at Leipzig yielded similarly instant gratification as Tedesco’s new charges swatted aside an ailing Borussia Mönchengladbach and it demonstrated not just the new man’s ability to muster some unity but his way of absorbing what a set of players need, as he had done well at Spartak Moscow post-Schalke. “I heard the team was longing for possession,” he said after the game, underlining that keying in with players who hadn’t really clicked with his predecessor Jesse Marsch had been paramount. “Pressing was [only] the second priority today.” So Leipzig started like a train against prone opponents, showing no mercy. With a return to three at the back Angeliño was off the leash, creating first-half goals for Josko Gvardiol and the waking André Silva, scorer in four of his last five games. Gladbach benefitted from an incredible reprieve when Silva hit the bar with Yann Sommer miles out of his goal after the goalkeeper lost the ball to Christopher Nkunku, but Ramy Bensabaini’s smart finish late on for Gladbach, which should have set up a final push for the visitors, merely provoked Leipzig into finishing off the game as they should have done before, via Nkunku and Benny Henrichs. Leipzig now have the opportunity to garland their revival and push towards the top four, with Augsburg then Arminia Bielefeld next up. “We have one of the best squads in the Bundesliga. The aim is to qualify at least for the Champions League,” emphasised the CEO, Oliver Mintzlaff. Tedesco has no excuses but he appears canny enough to adapt to his surroundings, even if going against the grain. Talking points • On the other side of the coin in Saxony was Gladbach having collected a third straight defeat, with the matches accumulating two goals for and 14 against in total. “The question is how we can get out of this together,” said coach Adi Hütter, though it was not a huge leap of faith to suspect that the expensively recruited coach is standing on rapidly thinning ice. Sporting director Max Eberl isn’t hiding from the criticism and fulfilled his appearance on Das Aktuelle Sportstudio in which he outlined his concerns. “We have to show balls now,” he demanded, though interestingly didn’t repeat his unconditional backing of Hütter from the aftermath of last week’s thrashing by Freiburg. “Of course the coach is responsible,” Eberl said, “but I’m responsible too.” Next up on Wednesday is Eintracht Frankfurt, Hütter’s old club. • In a weekend when Joshua Kimmich gave a television interview with ZDF in which he spoke about his regret for not getting vaccinated sooner – and saving Bayern a few weeks of consternation – his team clawed their way to a satisfying win over a good Mainz team without him, having been a goal down at half-time. Jamal Musiala, who was also quarantined twice in the last month, delighted Julian Nagelsmann with his winner and his increasing all-round application, though the coach stressed that “Jamal doesn’t have to become Gennaro Gattuso”. • Should we be more surprised that Borussia Dortmund failed to keep pace by dropping points at Bochum, or that the home side couldn’t close what would have been a fourth successive home win? Substitute Julian Brandt’s late equaliser saved BVB from the full nightmare on Castroper Straße, but the ‘mini-derby’ always looked destined to cause them problems, especially given the fortitude of Thomas Reis’s team in recent weeks. “Dortmund were superior in terms of play, and in terms of stats, but I don’t care about that today,” said Reis. • Nobody, it appears, is in the form to press Bayern. After their recent surge Leverkusen took an early 2-0 lead at Eintracht Frankfurt via a Patrik Schick double – only to subsequently be buried under an avalanche of five unanswered goals from the home side, capped by another Djibril Sow rocket from range. “The way we performed [after going two down] was unbelievable,” said coach Oliver Glasner of his improving side. • It was a weekend of stabilising for Stuttgart, winners of their first away game, 2-0 at Wolfsburg. Despite CEO Thomas Hitzlsperger’s imminent departure, sporting director Sven Mislintat has reiterated his commitment. “I’m here because this club is fantastic,” he enthused. The home side were rather less chipper after a fifth loss in a row, which has also incorporated an exit from Europe, though sporting director Jörg Schmadtke pointed out new-ish coach Florian Kohfeldt is “paying for things he isn’t responsible for”. • Joy at last for Greuther Fürth, managing their first win of the season and – perhaps even more unbelievably – their maiden top-flight victory at home by beating Union Berlin 1-0 on Sunday thanks to Havard Nielsen’s winner."

          "headline": "Folk singer Michael Hurley at 80: ‘The way music comes to you, it’s like dreaming’",
          "bodyText": "‘Calling me an outsider artist … yes, I think it’s apt. It’s taken me a long time to join the gang.” On Thanksgiving Friday, Michael Hurley – freak-folk singer-songwriter and artist of nearly 60 years’ standing – is considering where he fits in. He’s calling from his little house in rural Oregon, among the doug firs and tall pines, where he’s just brewed 11 gallons of cider from his homegrown apples. “It’s really quiet here. Few cars go by. It suits me. It’s remote. It gets a little lonely sometimes.” To celebrate his 80th birthday, Hurley is releasing his first album of new material in 12 years, The Time of the Foxgloves, named after his favourite flower and his favourite time of year. His band on it includes the left-field bluesy singer-songwriter Josephine Foster, one of many contemporary fans. Other admirers include Cat Power (who has covered his songs Werewolf and Sweedeedee), Devendra Banhart (who released two Hurley albums on his Gnomonsong label), Lucinda Williams, Yo La Tengo, Violent Femmes and Will Oldham. “He’s a real hero,” Oldham said in 2017. “Seeing him singing and smiling makes me think I can get through this life doing what I do.” You hear some of their influences in Hurley’s eccentric, pared-back, bluegrass and blues-inspired back catalogue. At times his songs are sparse and tender (Be Kind To Me; Valley of Tears) at others spikily surreal (and with titles to match, like What Made My Hamburger Disappear?). The music’s playfulness is underscored by his records’ cartoonish cover art, featuring werewolves inspired by his childhood pet collies Boone and Count, psychedelic sunrises and women in bars drinking beer – “my favourite thing to draw”, Hurley says. Born in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, in 1941, Hurley spent childhood summers on the road with his siblings and operetta-directing father, travelling between their home and theatres in Florida. In the car, they would soak up artists including Fats Waller and Jelly Roll Morton, and make up “simple songs”; he also got on stage for the first time back then. “At the beginning of the shows, we’d be there, us kids, pretending we were fishing into the orchestra pit. Then the actors would come on and chase us off, make it part of the show!” His voice flutters with sleepy delight. “I always wanted to be a creative writer. I never dreamed that I would record.” He became a teenage school drop-out who passed his time making fanzines with names such as The Outcry and The Morning Tea – then he started playing music and hitchhiking with his sister’s blond Stella guitar (“I loved the way it looked and the way its strings would resonate”). One day, he was picked up by the folklorist Fred Ramsey, who lived up the local river road; he’d recorded traditional music across the south in the 50s and invited Hurley to his house to play his songs. He liked what he heard. Hurley’s debut album, First Songs, produced by Ramsay, came out in 1965 on the renowned Folkways label, home to Woody Guthrie and Harry Smith’s Anthology of American Folk Music. On its cover, Hurley already looked different, slightly edgy, peering from under a roguish swoosh of dark hair, a devil-may-care 22.  He was also playing the Greenwich Village coffee house scene at the time, where Bob Dylan and Paul Simon had made early career moves. He had meeting with major producers but nothing transpired: one assumes Hurley never wanted to be a bigger musician. “I did,” he replies, “but I didn’t have a progressive drive about it. I didn’t enjoy the process of applying for gigs, that determination to penetrate things, all this trouble you had to go through. I preferred playing parties. Little gatherings. Drinking with friends, hopping across the river.” He says he didn’t seem to fit people’s ideas “of what the blues or bluegrass or folk should be”. He thinks it’s funny that he first played the Newport folk festival in 2013. “By which time there was practically no folk at all, just indie-rock, so I played a real old folk song, Barbara Allen. Now I’m acceptable!” Seven years passed between his debut album and its follow-up, Armchair Boogie, in 1971. In the meantime, he’d got married, had kids, separated from his wife, had another kid with his girlfriend, and worked as a hospital janitor, artist’s model, shoe pattern-maker and pretzel vendor on the streets of Boston. But he kept making music. His 1975 album, Have Moicy! with the Holy Modal Rounders and Jeffrey Frederick &amp; the Clamtones became a cult favourite: its raggedy, joyful folk-rock holds premonitions of early-80s REM. Over the next three decades, Hurley managed to make a modest living selling his art, touring and making drowsy new albums every few years (the critic Robert Christgau said 1984’s Blue Navigator “sounds as if Hurley padded over to the studio before he was done with his nap”). This has meant his social life has for decades been on an international cycle. “I’ve been spoilt over the years in a way, catching up every year with old friends.” The pandemic has been hard. “I’ve been adjusting to staying in my locality. Doing two to three gigs a month. Going to drive-in automobile places … and I’m scared to fly yet. Hopefully I’ll be lucky in spring when the conditions will be better.” In recent years, he has enjoyed the new interest in his work from younger artists. He adores lots of their covers, highlighting the Hackles’ softer, subtler version of 2002’s O My Stars and Cat Power’s 2000 version of Werewolf, an eerie classic he wrote in the 60s, inspired by the horror films of Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff. “Cat’s version puts it in a whole different place. I don’t want people to sound like me. I want them to sound like them.” His new compositions on The Time of the Foxgloves warmed his heart in the summer: he says he loved playing with a full band in a studio – violin, pump organ, upright bass, banjo and percussion. Tracks include Knocko the Monk, an instrumental where a pump organ wheezes beautifully behind his spiky, nimble finger-picking, and Jacob’s Ladder, on which Josephine Foster’s ghostly alto acts as an antique, woozy foil for Hurley’s reedier tones. “The way music comes to you … it’s like dreaming,” he says. “Something’s going on. Melodies just drop into my thinking.” He has a theory about the type of person who is drawn to his songs. “They respond to the irregularity of it, how it’s not ordinary. A mother of a young son wrote to me recently and said, ‘My son gets so stressed but when I play your music, it calms him way down.’ Oftentimes, musicians have trouble with irregularities, but not everyone’s the same.” He takes a moment in silence. “That’s how it is. Some people feel its beauty.” The Time of the Foxgloves is out now on No Quarter Records."

          "bodyText": "With that, we’ll end our live coverage for today. Here’s a recap of today’s major news developments: Western Australia will ease its border rules from 5 February. Both international and domestic travellers will be able to enter the state without quarantining from that date, by which point it is expected to have vaccinated 90% of its population over 12 with two doses. All travellers will need to be vaccinated, with a very small weekly cap of hotel quarantine spots for unvaccinated international arrivals. Thousands of Queenslanders will be finally enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened just after midnight Queensland time. Scott Morrison welcomed the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to Canberra on Monday, with the leaders heralding closer defence ties as they witnessed the signing of a previously announced $1bn military equipment contract with a South Korean firm. Australia’s international border will open to more travellers on Wednesday, as the prime minister confirmed that his government would end the “pause” triggered by the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Covid-19 infections are continuing to grow, with Victoria reporting 1,290 new cases and two deaths, while NSW recorded 536 new cases, amid increasing numbers of the Omicron variant. Have a great evening. We’ll be back tomorrow to do it all over again. The auditor general has just published the annual report on major defence acquisitions. It’s basically a yearly stocktake on where major projects are tracking, based on information supplied by the Department of Defence. This is the report for the 2020-21 financial year, so it is looking backwards. Grant Hehir, the auditor general, found nothing that caused him to believe any problems with the accuracy of the information supplied by Defence as part of the process. But the voluminous report notes: “Defence’s assessment indicates that some elements of capability to be delivered by projects may be ‘under threat’, but the risk is assessed as ‘manageable’.” The report said the four project offices “experiencing challenges with expected capability delivery” are the Joint Strike Fighter, MRH90 helicopters, Overlander medium/heavy vehicles, and Battlespace communications systems (land) 2B. The second project listed there – MRH90 helicopters – is also known as the Taipan. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, announced last Friday a plan to acquire up to 40 Black Hawk helicopters in order to retire the MRH90 early. Rest assured, readers, we will be going through this report in greater detail in the coming days. Paul Mercurio, the actor and dancer known for his role in Strictly Ballroom, has been preselected as the Labor candidate for the Victorian state seat of Hastings. Premier Mark McGowan has said Western Australia will not reopen its borders earlier than 5 February even if it achieves 90% double-dose vaccination coverage before that date. He said this is because businesses need to prepare for a specific date and have certainty things won’t change. Western Australia’s quarantine cap for unvaccinated international arrivals could be limited to fewer than 100 people per week. Mark McGowan said an exact number had not yet been determined, but that “it may be down at 100 or perhaps less per week”. By contrast, New South Wales’ unvaccinated arrival cap is 210 per week, while Victoria’s is 250. As McGowan explained earlier, WA will only be allowing a small number of unvaccinated travellers arriving from overseas, and they will have to go through 14 days of hotel quarantine. Domestic arrivals will need to be double-dose vaccinated. Asked if he was considering extending the option of hotel quarantine for unvaccinated domestic travellers, McGowan said: “Not at this point in time, no.” McGowan explains that his strict stance on maintaining rules for unvaccinated people and poorly vaccinated regions after 5 February is because of vulnerable people in the state. Specifically, he mentions older and Indigenous residents. “We’re just trying to save their lives. It will find the unvaccinated. You might live in the desert but it can still find you.” Premier Mark McGowan was asked if further spread of the Omicron variant in other states could delay Western Australia’s border reopening date of 5 February. McGowan didn’t go as far as ruling it out, but said it was very unlikely. “Barring some unforeseen emergency or catastrophe which we can’t predict. But that’s the nature of Covid.” He said “it’s a very safe bet” that the border will reopen on 5 February. Western Australia’s health minister Roger Cook has urged residents in his state to use the time between now and 5 February – when the state will reopen its borders – to get vaccinated. Cook addressed the fact that an already stretched health system in the state was predicted to buckle if Covid spread when its vaccination rate was low. He said nearly 500 doctors and 350 graduate doctors have joined the system this year. Cook said: Make every day count, every day must be counted between now and 5 February. We have the precious gift of time to continue to get as many people vaccinated as possible. We need to make the most of this opportunity, Make no mistake about it, Covid is coming into our state. Western Australians are going to be in for a real shock from 5 February. We are going to be living with Covid-19. But there is no easy way of living with the worst virus in 100 years. McGowan is warning that there could still be travel restrictions for certain remote communities because of lower vaccination rates. McGowan said “some regions have dramatically lower vaccination rates”, flagging the Pilbara, Goldfields and the Kimberley specifically. “These are the only regions that currently have a first dose rate below 80%,” McGowan said. He said the Pilbara is of most concern, with a double -dose vaccination rate of just 46.1%. “If individual regions do not get their vaccination rates up, then further measures will be needed to protect the community.” Mark McGowan is now explaining how Western Australia’s new border rules will work when they come into effect from 5 February. International arrivals will still be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival in Perth, as well as six days after arriving. If the traveller is double vaccinated, there will be no quarantine requirement. For those who are not double vaccinated or have received a vaccine that is not recognised in Australia, they will have to go into a hotel or dedicated quarantine facility when it opens. McGowan said the cap of quarantine places for unvaccinated travellers will be smaller than WA’s current cap for all arrivals. Domestic arrivals must be double vaccinated unless they have a valid exemption. Domestic travellers will still be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure and undertake a PCR test within 48 hours of arrival in Perth If a traveller’s stay in WA is for five days or less, they will only be required to return a negative PCR test result within 72 hours of departure, and won’t need to get another test within 48 hours of landing. Premier Mark McGowan has announced that Western Australia’s hard border will ease on 5 February. It will take effect from 12:01am on that day, a Saturday. McGowan explained that he was making the announcement because WA had on Monday just reached 80% double dose vaccination coverage of residents 12 and over. By 5 February, McGowan said he expects the state to have reached 90% coverage. McGowan said: Even though Western Australians have lived a normal life inside our Covid free bubble, nearly 2 million people have done the right thing and gotten vaccinated. We followed a different model to the others. And it’s worked. I want to acknowledge each and every Western Australian for everything they’ve done over the past two years. Western Australia’s current zero Covid environment and high vaccination rate will help deliver the softest landing to minimise the impact of the virus. When it enters our state, McGowan’s announcement has defied earlier speculation on Monday that the state would ease its border rules from late January. Australia’s international border will open to more travellers on Wednesday, as the prime minister confirmed that his government would end the “pause” triggered by the emergence of the Omicron Covid variant. Scott Morrison, welcoming the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to Canberra on Monday, said Australia would open to travellers from South Korea and Japan and also international students and skilled workers more broadly. While pandemic recovery was on the agenda for the talks at Parliament House, the leaders also heralded closer defence ties as they witnessed the signing of a previously announced $1bn military equipment contract with a South Korean firm. Moon said he respected the Australian government’s “sovereign” decision to strike the Aukus deal with the US and the UK – an arrangement that China has claimed poses a threat to regional stability, amid worsening tensions between Beijing and Canberra. But the South Korean leader also voiced a desire to maintain a harmonious relationship with China, which he said was important to securing North Korea’s denuclearisation. He ruled out joining Australia, the US and other countries in a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics.

AccuWeather forecasts clear skies for Melbourne and Hobart on 25 December, while clouds are expected to linger across the rest of the country into the evening. Ahead of the release on Saturday of the Bureau of Meteorology’s official forecast for the week of Christmas, AccuWeather has predicted possible showers in Queensland and the Northern Territory on Christmas Day, with temperatures hitting the high 20s in most major cities. Here is the run down for every capital city: We’re expecting Mark McGowan to outline Western Australia’s border reopening date at 2pm WA time/5pm eastern daylight time. We’ll bring you that update here as it happens. Meanwhile in Victoria, the Australian Workers Union has raised concerns about the preselection process for the 2022 election amid ongoing factional turmoil in the state arising from the exit of party powerbroker Adem Somyurek. AWU branch secretary Ben Davis has written to state secretary Chris Ford calling for a halt to the preselection process that is being run by the national executive, alleging irregularities that are “potentially fraudulent”. Davis says that a number of party members have alleged that nomination forms have been filled out before a candidate has been selected, which he says is “potentially creating a false document pursuant to the Crimes Act. “As a member of the Interim Governance Committee (IGC) I hereby request that nomination forms for all contested ballots be provided to me, and if you see fit to the other members of the IGC also, before any ballots of national Executive are held,” the letter says. “Delaying the ballots in the contested seats should also occur until the party can conduct an appropriate investigation.” So far, seven sitting Labor MPs have been targeted as a result of the factional in-fighting, with one of these, upper house MP Cesar Melhem, describing the situation as “total bloodletting”. Millions of tourism dollars are expected to be injected into the Queensland economy after the state reopened its borders to fully vaccinated visitors, reports AAP. Tens of thousands of people began flooding into Queensland on Monday following the decision to drop entry and quarantine restrictions at 1am for fully jabbed travellers after hitting the 80% double vaccination target. The arrival of interstate travellers in time for the festive season is a much-needed boost for tourism, particularly in the state’s far north. Tourism Tropical North Queensland chief executive Mark Olsen said the region had been losing millions of dollars a day since early 2020. He told Nine: It’s been a really tough 21 months for the (far north) tourism industry. One third of our visitors are normally international ... and we haven’t seen them since February 2020 ... Both NSW and Victorian visitors put a million a day each into this economy so we have really been looking forward to having them back. Olsen said more than 9,000 tourism jobs in the far north had been lost since early 2020 but was confident it could bounce back after Monday’s reopening. You can read more about Queensland’s border rules easing from today in this article, filed by Jennifer King in Tweed Heads. There are 16 new cases of Covid-19 in the Northern Territory, with the government considering ramping up Covid rules for some communities. Of the new cases announced on Monday, 14 are from East Katherine, where authorities had been doing a testing “blitz”. A chief health officer directive will be issued from today requiring anyone in the NT who has been in Katherine recently to get tested. Nicole Manison, deputy chief minister of the NT, has also revealed there were only five Covid tests conducted in Tennant Creek – a town of about 5,000 – on Sunday despite positive wastewater detections of Covid. She said “frankly, that is not good enough”. Manison said it was “likely” the government would escalate Covid rules and introduce “lockouts” – where unvaccinated people are placed in lockdown – in some regional communities in the territory in coming days. South Australian premier Steven Marshall has said there are 13 new Covid-19 cases in his state for the reporting period announced on Monday. He said the majority of the cases are believed to be the Delta variant. There have so far been two confirmed cases of the Omicron variant in SA. There has been a bit more sun across New South Wales in recent days, prompting concern for people swimming in hazardous conditions at beaches in the state. Over the weekend, Surf Life Saving NSW volunteers performed more than 60 rescues, with two people requiring resuscitation. Sadly, a middle-aged man was unable to be revived at Coffs Harbour on Saturday. He was pulled from the water about 300m north of the patrol flags, semi-conscious and still breathing. NSW Ambulance inspector Charnan Kurth said “drownings can occur in seconds – we have to be constantly looking out for each other”. In the UK, Boris Johnson is gambling on an unprecedented ramping up of vaccinations, rolling out 1m booster jabs a day to stem an incoming “tidal wave of Omicron” and avoid imposing further restrictions. The army will be deployed across the country to help rapidly accelerate the vaccine program and GPs will be told to cancel appointments to dedicate resources to offering vaccines to every UK adult by the end of December. In a televised address to the nation on Sunday night, the prime minister said he was “afraid we are now facing an emergency in our battle with the new variant, Omicron, and we must urgently reinforce our wall of vaccine protection to keep our friends and loved ones safe”. Read more: The RSPCA has teamed up with two other leading animal welfare organisations to lobby both clothing brands and sheep farmers to move away from mulesing sheep. RSPCA Australia, Four Paws and Humane Society International say they will work with the wool industry to encourage the breeding of sheep that do not require mulesing. Mulesing is the process of removing folds of skin from the tail area of a sheep. It’s done to reduce flystrike and is mainly practised on sheep that have folds of skin, like merinos. It used to be the industry standard in Australia, where flystrike can be a deadly problem, but over the past two decades many wool producers have focused on breeding sheep that do not require mulesing. Some farming organisations are also changing their standards to discourage mulesing. The Victorian Farmers Federation lobbied for regulations requiring the mandatory use of pain relief when mulesing sheep, which came into effect last year. But the Australian Superfine Wool Growers Association remains in support of the practice. Four Paws’s wool expert, Rebecca Picallo Gil, said more than 3,000 Australian woolgrowers had already switched to no-mules flocks. Humane Society international’s Georgie Dolphin said: With the advanced genetics available today, it is unacceptable to continue to breed wrinkly sheep that are prone to flystrike. Our organisations want to see an end to mulesing within the next decade, a target that is easily achievable. One of the most tangible announcements from the joint presser was Scott Morrison confirming the international borders would reopen as planned this Wednesday. We reported last week this was likely, but a bunch of international students and other travellers have been anxiously messaging Guardian Australia over the weekend hoping for some certainty. This should come as a relief to them. First, a quick recap: the government announced in late November it was delaying the plan to reopen Australia to international skilled and student cohorts, as well as humanitarian, working, holidaymaker and provisional family visa holders, from 1 December until 15 December. That “pause” also included reopening to travellers from Japan and South Korea. It was to gather more information about the Omicron variant. As it stood, the Australian border was “already closed to travellers except fully vaccinated Australian citizens, permanent residents and immediate family, as well as fully vaccinated green lane travellers from New Zealand and Singapore and limited exemptions”, per the government release at the time. All arrivals to Australia also require a negative PCR test and to complete Australian traveller declaration forms detailing their vaccination status and confirming requirements to comply with state and territory public health requirements. While the government has been signalling it wanted to get on with reopening, these things are always subject to change, based on latest advice about Omicron – so many travellers were worried about whether their plans would be disrupted once again. But Morrison, standing next to South Korean president Moon Jae-in, told reporters: We also have tourism and education links that run deep – some 20,000 Korean students come and study in Australia – and we are looking forward to welcoming them back as we are the many tourists and business travellers and skilled migrants. And on Wednesday of this week, we will move again forward. The borders will be reopened both to Korea and to Japan and for skilled migration and for students as we conclude the pause that we announced several weeks ago. Morrison praised the high level of vaccination in both countries, adding: I know the more than 123,000 Australians of Korean ancestry will be looking forward to seeing their friends, their family and them being able to join together and that has been made possible because of the outstanding achievements in Korea in managing Covid and I congratulate the president on their achievements.

In other news, John Gerrard has now officially taken up his position as the new Queensland chief health officer after Jennette Young moves on and up to the governor role. A small word of caution on the defence announcement out of the Scott Morrison/Moon Jae-in joint presser. The Morrison government has confirmed that a $1bn defence contract for new Self-Propelled Howitzers for the Australian Army has been awarded to Hanwha Defense Australia. From Morrison’s release: “Based in Greater Geelong, the contract will procure Self-Propelled Howitzers and Armoured Ammunition Resupply Vehicles, under the LAND 8116 Phase 1 project. The government committed to this project in May 2019.” The then defence minister, Linda Reynolds, announced in September last year that Hanwha Defence Australia had been chosen to build 30 self-propelled howitzers for the ADF, to be built in the Geelong region, as you can see from this story at the time. The contract signing was witnessed by Morrison and Moon before their joint press conference in parliament house in Canberra this morning. In today’s release, the government says the initial contract “covers 30 Self-Propelled Howitzers, 15 Armoured Ammunition Resupply Vehicles, and weapon locating radars that help find enemy artillery, collectively referred to as the Huntsman family of vehicles”. The defence minister, Peter Dutton, said: “The prime ability of the new vehicles is to fire and move quickly, avoiding enemy counter-attack. This project will mean a significant increase in the level of firepower and security for Australian artillery capability.” A group of male koalas from Victoria’s Strzelecki Ranges will be brought to Adelaide as part of a new breeding program aimed at securing the survival of the species. The koalas are expected to arrive in coming weeks to join a group of disease-free male and female koalas at the Cleland Wildlife Park in the Adelaide Hills. The Cleland population, including some koalas rescued from the 2020 Kangaroo Island bushfires, is considered to be the only sanctuary-managed colony free from both chlamydia and koala retrovirus in Australia. Environment minister David Speirs says the transfer of the koalas is part of a bold conservation initiative that will help secure the survival of the species. Catastrophic events like last year’s bushfires across Australia significantly reduced koala numbers... That’s why this unique breeding program, which will include the addition of the Strzelecki koalas, will help to safeguard populations and provide opportunities for research as a priority for the species’ long-term survival. The Victorian koalas are being taken from a private forest plantation after assurances from wildlife authorities their removal was in the interests of conservation. Koala Life, an independent not-for-profit organisation set up for the conservation and research of koala diseases, said the relocation would increase the number of disease-free genetically diverse animals, which would ultimately help to protect the species from future challenges. Chief executive Chris Daniels: It’s also an important step in our scientific breeding program and significantly assists our research into the species... These koalas will form part of a breeding program that can support the long-term conservation of the species, particularly in response to natural disasters. Thousands of Queenslanders will be enjoying dinner in their own homes on Monday at last after spending months trapped across the border in New South Wales. The border between the two states reopened at 1am Queensland time. Queensland’s police commissioner, Katarina Carroll, estimated that 50,000 vehicles would be crossing in the early hours of Monday morning, with long delays expected. All vehicles were required to present a border pass that was only made available to those travelling from hotspots one hour before the border opened, leaving many already anxious travellers more worried about getting home. You can read the full report below: On the day borders reopen, Queensland has recorded one new locally acquired case, as well as two overseas-acquired cases and seven interstate-acquired cases, detected in hotel quarantine. Moon’s response, to paraphrase, was basically: “Dude, we have a rogue nation with a bunch of nukes right above us that we are technically still at war with - yeah we are going to try and be friends with as many people as possible, mate.” Moon: With regard to the question on the relationship with China, that was your question: Korea and Australia uphold the same values and our position in terms of the geopolitical situation, we are like-minded. First of all, in terms of our alliance with the US, it’s the basis of our diplomacy as well as security affairs and in terms of the economic relationship, of course, the relationship with China is important. However, Korea has another factor to take into account and that has to do with the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and also denuclearisation of DPRK. We need the constructive efforts of China to enable the denuclearisation of [the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea]. Therefore, Korea is focused on the steadfast alliance with the US and also with China; we want a harmonised relationship. And we want to maintain such a relationship and we will be putting in the efforts to make this happen. And, of course, with regard to the relationship with China, there may be certain conflicts and there may be some issues of competition. However, if you look at climate change and the supply chain issue, and also in terms of pandemic and infectious diseases, there are global challenges and these are domains where we do need cooperation and collaboration. Morrison: I have absolutely no doubt that our only ambition between Australia and Korea is to ensure a peaceful and safe and free and open Indo-Pacific. Where all nations in the region can trade openly and well and positively, free from any coercion and have their own choices about how they move forward. Reporter: President Moon, Australia, like South Korea, has faced billions of dollars in Chinese trade sanctions as punishment for domestic policy decisions. How should countries respond to Chinese economic coercion? And to Scott Morrison: how can Australia and Korea work together to counter Chinese economic coercion? Morrison jumped in to answer first (perhaps as the question was being translated?). I might start - the question has come from the Australian side. I would say this. Australia and Korea are like-minded liberal democracies and we work together to ensure there are economic choices in the region. There is a strengthening of our capabilities both from defence security point of view and not just in the traditional, but also in the new areas of cyber and new technologies that occurs in a security space, but also occurs in an economic space. The fact that we’re working together on critical minerals supply chains and rare earths, these are the critical minerals and rare earths that power and support a new energy economy. And so ensuring that there are trusted supply chains between like-minded countries is incredibly important for our region. It brings stability, it brings balance. Moon says that this trip has nothing to do with China and Morrison immediately added: When you are engaging with other countries in these types of contracts, it is an objective to be doing so with those countries who are like-minded in their outlook, and I think between Korea and Australia we share a very similar view and a similar aspiration for the Indo-Pacific. Moon Jae-in has been asked by reporters if visiting Australia just days after the government decided on a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics was likely to upset South Korea’s relationship with China (which is always fairly strained anyway, given the issue of North Korea). He was also asked if South Korea intend to issue a similar boycott. Moon: With regards to the Beijing Olympics on the diplomatic boycott, we have not received a request from any other country, including the United States, to participate in the diplomatic boycott. We are not considering a boycott measure. With regards to AUKUS, we respect the decision made by the sovereign state, Australia, and this is the decision made by Australia as a sovereign nation and we respect that. And Australia is making efforts for peace and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region and within the region. Australia does not desire dispute arising in the region and, for peace, we will continue to cooperate with Australia. And the state visit I make at this time has nothing to do with our position over China and we believe that between Korea and Australia it is very important that we cooperate over the core minerals and for the hydrogen economy and for the low-carbon emissions technology. Moon: Third, we agree to strengthen supply chain cooperation. Australia, the world’s richest country in mineral resources, and Korea, a major producer of batteries and electric vehicles, play an important role in the global supply chain. Our two countries share the view that establishing a stable mineral supply chain is important not only for the two countries but also for the global economy, and we have signed the MoU on cooperation in the critical mineral supply chain. We will systematically cooperate throughout the entire resource development cycle including mineral exploration, development, production and mining disaster management, further strengthening human exchange and technical cooperation. Today, the two countries have set a new milestone in cooperation based on the solid friendship and trust we have built over the past 60 years. We will, together, prepare for a new era. South Korea and Australia are also apparently great space buddies now! Moon: Second, we have agreed to nurture our key future industries together. The two countries declared to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and are focusing on a transition to a low-carbon economy. Today, the prime minister and I signed the plan for low- and zero-emissions technology partnership by broadening the ecofriendly technologies such as hydrogen economy, solar power and carbon capture mechanisms. We will turn it into an opportunity to create new jobs and industries. We have also decided to strengthen space cooperation. Australia established a space agency in 2018 and is spurring efforts to foster its space industry. Korea has also set a new turning point for space development, with the launch of the new rocket this year. I hope that the MoU regarding space cooperation will enhance exchange and foster cooperation in fields from space exploration in the launch vehicle industry to satellite navigation, and I hope the agreement becomes a stepping stone for the two countries. If you were wondering whether this is all a thinly veiled front to send a message to China about who really has power in the Indo-Pacific, here is Moon: The prime minister actively supported the Korean people and the peace process and two countries continue working to the towards the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, and also peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region. Moon is now delivering his speech in Korean. Luckily I’m fluent! (I’m not, I shall be using the ABC translation.) Your excellency, prime minister Morrison, thank you very much for the warm hospitality. You have invited me as Australia’s first [leader] since the Covid-19 outbreak and today our two countries have formed a close cooperative relationship. I think this will be a great gift for the people of two countries to celebrate the 60th anniversary of diplomatic ties ... Today the prime minister and I advanced our bilateral relations and elevated to a comprehensive Australian partnership. Together our two countries will leap forward as global leaders and look forward to moving towards a future of shared prosperity. First, we agree to strengthen ... strategic cooperation for fostering regional prosperity. Morrison: Australia and Korea have some of the highest vaccination rates double-dose of anywhere in the world, and so that is enabling our economies to open up and we see that today here in Australia as the borders come tumbling down there in - between Queensland and the rest of the country - and Australians are being reunited because of their effort to get vaccinated and to see families reunited, to see Australians coming together as we get to the end of this year. This is encouraging, but I know the more than 123,000 Australians of Korean ancestry will be looking forward to seeing their friends, their family and them being able to join together. This has been made possible because of the outstanding achievements in Korea in managing Covid and I congratulate the president on their achievements. We look to proceeding with the many agreements that we have announced today, whether in defence, defence materiel, the memorandum of understanding to establish an implementation plan for Australia and Korea’s low zero-emissions technology partnership that the president and I agreed we would proceed with when we met together in the UK at Carbis Bay at the G7. Here is Daniel Hurst with a bit more information on those deals that were signed by Morrison and Moon this morning. Morrison: Today, as always, our economies complement each other. We are important trading partners and we welcome the prospect of Korea joining the CPTPP [comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans-Pacific partnership] and we look forward - should they wish to take that decision and step - we look forward to being an encouraging partner. The CTPPP sets a high bar for countries that understand the importance of the rule of law in trade that deals with its partners fairly and consistently in a way that promotes free trade and Korea has already achieved those marks, not only in their relationship with Australia, but with the many trading partners with whom they have trusted relationships. This investment goes in both directions and we look forward to that continuing. We’re also important security partners as we have just witnessed with the howitzer contract, a billion-dollar armoured vehicle centre for excellence to be located in the Geelong region. Here is Morrison speaking, and yes, he did get the name of the Korean War wrong ... while speaking to the president of Korea. It’s a great honour to have you here in Australia in what is your first ever trip to Australia along with first lady Kim. As guest of our government on this important state visit, the first of these we have had since the outbreak of Covid ... As you know, the friendship between your nations is deep and historic. From Kapyong to here we are now in Canberra. Our ties were forged during the Vietnam - during the Korean - War. Australia was the second nation after the United States to come to Korea’s aid in those very dark days. More than 17,000 Australians fought to defend your freedom and, indeed, the freedom of all liberal democracy peace-loving countries in these conflicts. Australia and South Korea have struck a $1bn defence deal as leaders Scott Morrison and Moon Jae-in hold formal talks in Canberra, reports Paul Osborne from AAP. The South Korean president and first lady Kim Jung-sook were welcomed to Parliament House, where they signed the official visitors book, by the prime minister on Monday. Australia and South Korea will upgrade their ties to “comprehensive strategic partnership” status during the visit. The $1bn deal - under which Korean defence company Hanwha will provide 30 self-propelled howitzer artillery weapons, 15 ammunition supply vehicles and radars to detect enemy artillery - is the largest defence contract struck between Australia and an Asian nation. The new vehicles will be able to quickly fire and move to avoid enemy counterattacks. Defence minister Peter Dutton touted the deal as a boost for Australian firepower and security in the Indo-Pacific. [It] is one of several projects that will modernise the Australian Army, ensuring it continues to maintain a capability advantage now, and into the future... We are committed to keeping our region safe while protecting our interests in a rapidly changing global environment. The deal is expected to create at least 300 jobs in the Greater Geelong region, where the manufacturing facility will be based. Construction is due to start in 2022. Morrison said the relationship continued to grow, underpinned by trade, shared values, common regional strategic interests and a commitment to an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. Our comprehensive strategic partnership with the Republic of Korea is underpinned by our joint commitment to defence and security cooperation. This year mark 60 years of diplomatic relations between the two nations. Moon is the first international leader to visit Australia since borders reopened. So Moon and Morrison are signing some partnerships and deal first, and I assume will speak after that. We are standing by for Scott Morrison and the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, to give a joint address from Parliament House in Canberra. A flood warning and total fire ban in the same state on the same day has pretty big “post-apocalyptic” energy, doesn’t it? It’s time to have a chat about what’s going on at The Sydney Morning Herald. Overnight, the newspaper posted an article confirming that newly appointed editor, Bevan Shields, had called longtime opinion columnist Elizabeth Farrelly and ended her arrangement with the paper after she “failed to disclose that she had registered as a candidate for the Labor party in the Strathfield local government elections when she wrote a piece criticising Liberal and independent councillors in the electorate”. The writer has now issued a statement on the situation via a Facebook post, stating that it was “an oversight on my part” not to disclose her registration, but says she never actually intended to run for local government. Simply to keep my options open, I registered my interest online. I was not preselected for the Labor federal candidate, nor for the Labor council ticket, so I did not run in the recent council election. I was involved with the Labor campaign only insofar as I agreed to have a placard on the front lawn for a couple of weeks and to hand out on polling day for 2 hours. This was done in thanks for the warm welcome I received to the neighbourhood. The ABC is reporting this morning that the Victorian Greens have referred the government-owned logging agency VicForests to the state’s anti-corruption watchdog and the ombudsman. It follows the ABC’s reporting of allegations that VicForests had logged sites illegally and spied on a conservationist. The logging agency has denied it logged illegally and said it always complied with the law. The Greens’ Ellen Sandell has written to the Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission (IBAC) and the ombudsman, asking them to launch investigations. I respectfully request that IBAC conduct an investigation into whether these actions by VicForests — especially the allegations of spying on a private citizen — constitute corrupt conduct and warrant further investigation... Using taxpayer money to hire a private investigator to spy on a private citizen I would consider a gross misuse of taxpayer funds. Serious allegations of widespread illegal activity by a Victorian public sector agency I would consider something also worthy of investigation by IBAC. Trade minister Dan Tehan has urged businesses not to hoard a chemical key to keeping Australia’s freight and logistics sectors on the road, reports AAP’s Georgie Moore. Australia has about seven weeks’ worth of urea – used in the diesel exhaust fluid AdBlue – left amid a global shortage as China restricts exports. The federal government is speaking to countries including Indonesia about shoring up Australia’s supply. It is also approaching Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Japan. Korea last month flew 27,000 litres of urea to Australia. Tehan told ABC radio this morning that the Covid-19 pandemic had highlighted the fragility of some supply chains: There will always be some stock which they [businesses] keep in warehouses ... But what we don’t want to see is the excessive warehousing of AdBlue at this stage. He is confident Australia will be able to secure the urea it needs: There is obviously issues around containers, shipping disruptions which we’re also working through ... But from everything that we’re seeing, there is clear supply which we can bring to Australia. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has spoken to Radio National about the plight of Australian Julian Assange. Although attempts to extradite him from the UK to the US are ostensibly for their court system, Wilkie said “the reality is it’s always been intensely political” because he claims charges are politically motivated against Assange for “doing his job” as a journalist and reporting via WikiLeaks: This can be solved politically by Scott Morrison picking up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson and saying, ‘This has gone on long enough – it’s not acceptable that an Australian Walkley award-winning journalist is being kept in jail for really doing nothing more than publicising hard evidence of US war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan, let’s release him and let him come back home.’ Wilkie also called on Labor leader Anthony Albanese to commit to the same, if he is elected. Wilkie said jail “is killing” Assange. On who he will help form government in a minority parliament, Wilkie said he had been burned by Julia Gillard reneging on his pokies reform, and in future he will treat “every vote on its merits including confidence and supply” – meaning no deal to support one side. Still, he said climate change will be important to him and Morrison has done “terribly” on the anti-corruption commission issue. Scott Morrison is currently welcoming the South Korean president, Moon Jae-In to Australia. Gosh, we are so far away from everyone, it’s always exciting when a political leader makes their way down here! Federal health minister Greg Hunt is speaking now from Melbourne where he has just announced that Medicare-funded telehealth options will become permanent. He also reiterated that Australia is on track to open the border for skilled labourers and international students: The first is about the reopening of the borders for students and for skilled labour on 15 December. Yes, we are on track for that. That has been reconfirmed over the weekend. We said on the 29th of November that we were intending to reopen on 15 December. That has been through the national cabinet process ... Then in terms of telehealth, it’s a continuation of the existing measures across the work of GPs, allied health and specialists and I want to thank everybody for their involvement in that. All of the different parts of the medical community have played their role but the RACGP has been our principal partner on that front and well supported by the AMA and ACRM. Independent MP Andrew Wilkie has implored Scott Morrison to pick up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson to end the prosecution of Julian Assange, AAP reports. The former intelligence analyst told the ABC: The reality is this has always been an intensively political matter and it can be solved politically by Scott Morrison picking up the phone to Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. It comes after reports the 50-year-old WikiLeaks founder suffered a stroke in prison in October. Wilkie said: Jail is killing Julian Assange. There is no way he will survive continued incarceration in the UK. Assange has just suffered a legal blow after the UK high court ruled he could be extradited to face charges in the US. His lawyers say they intend to appeal the decision in the UK’s highest court. He faces an 175-year prison sentence on espionage charges in the US over an alleged conspiracy to obtain and disclose classified information which revealed alleged war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. Just very normal things happening on the NSW/Queensland border. After a Gold Coast man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing that he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. “Other than in exceptional or extreme cases you can’t rely on words, or conduct that consists substantially of words,” the state’s then attorney general, Cameron Dick, said in 2011. “We need a change to the law … just because you say something it doesn’t mean that you should be killed.” A decade later, another Queensland man, Arona Peniamina, also convinced a jury his spouse’s suspected infidelity had provoked him into ending her life in a jealous rage. The government’s reforms had not prevented him from successfully arguing he was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, because he had been provoked. You can read the full report below: Watch out, Queensland! Anthony Albanese is in your state now and is bringing the election campaign with him! Here’s what he had to say to the ABC before jumping on his flight to the sunshine state. We need to reconnect with Queenslanders, we didn’t do well enough in the last election. When I was locked out of Sydney because of restrictions, I spent a long time in Queensland, I did a couple of road trips up and down the coast. I visited every small place that there was in between Rockhampton and Brisbane down the coast, and I think that Queenslanders know that this is a tired government, the end of its third term, they don’t have an agenda for today, let alone a vision for tomorrow and I’ll be talking today about our plans including 465,000 free Tafe places, 20,000 additional university places, and how we build back stronger. We need to take of the sacrifice that Australians have made by actually trying to envisage how we become more resilient, how we make more things. On my trip to Queensland a few months ago, I went to Maryborough, they’re doing fantastic there. Making trains, building things, creating jobs in regional Queensland and that’s what I want to drive. A total fire ban has been declared for north-western Victoria, AAP reports. The Country Fire Authority says the Mallee and Wimmera regions will be subject to a total fire ban on Monday, It means no open-air fire can be lit or remain alight, and strict rules apply for the use of farm machinery, chainsaws and lawnmowers. “CFA advises people living in areas at risk of fire to activate their bushfire plan,” the authority said. Temperatures are expected to reach the mid to high 30s in the two regions, with strengthening north-westerly winds forecast early before a blustery southerly change crossing the state throughout the day. There is also a low risk of dry lightning in the area. A high fire danger rating applies for central, north-central, northern country and south-west regions, while the eastern parts of the state are of low to moderate risk. It is only the second total fire ban of the season, thanks in part to cooler and wetter-than-average weather in November. The outlook for this fire season indicates a lower threat of prolonged bushfires but grass and crop blazes remain a high risk across the state after average to above-average rainfall and strong fuel growth. CFA acting chief officer Garry Cook said: Overall, we’ve had milder conditions leading into this fire season, but we can’t afford to be complacent about these hot and windy days where the fire danger spikes. Grass and crop fires are prevalent this season and can move at speeds of up to 25km/h and jump highways. A person in New South Wales has been admitted to hospital infected with the Omicron variant of Covid-19, the first Omicron patient to be hospitalised since it arrived in Australia last month. It comes as thousands of protesters marched through capital cities yesterday to oppose vaccine mandates, and Western Australia and Queensland prepared to reopen their borders. After two years of border closures, the WA premier, Mark McGowan, is today due to announce when the state’s borders will reopen to domestic and international travellers, after reaching the 80% vaccination milestone at the weekend. And “tens of thousands” of people are expected to cross into Queensland after its borders reopen at 1am on Monday. It will be the first time in 229 days people will not need to quarantine on arrival, provided they are fully vaccinated. You can read the full report below: Of course with Queensland’s border opening, tourism minister Dan Tehan is out and about this morning taking a victory lap (even though the decision to open the border has nothing to do with the federal government). Here he is chatting to ABC radio: All the forecasts are, when it comes to domestic tourism, by the end of next financial year it will be back to pre-pandemic levels and international tourism will follow on the back of that, so there are positive signals for our tourism industry ... 660,000 jobs in our tourism sector, we want to make sure that reaches beyond post-pandemic levels and we need those overseas skills ... here in Australia helping us strongly rebuild the tourism sector. Things seem to be getting pretty loose over in the Barnaby Joyce isolation suite, with the deputy prime minister placing his phone inside a microwave to get the perfect camera angle for his Sunrise interview. I feel like there is a joke about radiation frying your brain in there somewhere, but I’ll just leave that up to you. China has responded “irrationally” to the Aukus pact between Australia, the US and Britain, defence minister Peter Dutton says. The conservative Australian minister continues to mount forthright criticism of the Chinese government, accusing it of “bullying” countries that stand up to it. Yesterday Dutton said the Australian government had formed the Aukus partnership with the US and the UK because it wanted to see “see increased stability and peace in our region”. “The response by China to that, I think, was irrational,” he told Sky News Australia. You can read the full report below: Time to chat about next year’s election, and the battle the treasurer is facing from an independent in his home seat. Michael Rowland: You are now facing, as we know, Monique Ryan in the seat of Kooyong. She’s a Royal Children’s hospital doctor. You’ve labelled people like she, an independent, as a front for Labor and the Greens. What evidence do you have for that? Josh Frydenberg: Well, at the last election, I had an independent who said they were gonna vote for Labor. That’s a pretty clear indication. We’ve also seen plenty of cases where they’ve just mirrored the policies of our political opponents. Rowland: But what evidence do we have at this time? Frydenberg: This is a rinse-and-repeat, Michael. What we’ve seen, we’ve seen obviously a lot of funding going into these independents around the rest of the country, and it’s a democracy, so people can put their hand up. ABC News Breakfast host Michael Rowland: Just on Omicron, you might have caught up with the news just in the last hour or so, Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, made an address to the nation there. He’s declared a tidal wave of Omicron case is about to hit the UK. He’s declared it a public health emergency, and has declared that all British adults over the age of 16 can get a booster shot by the end of the year. Taking that into account, are we being a bit too sanguine about Omicron here in Australia? Treasurer Josh Frydenberg: We saw the medical advice, and that saw a pause for two weeks of the reopening of the border to international students and to skilled workers. That was a precautionary measure. But we will continue to listen and follow the health advice, and it has served us well to date. But at the same time, we need to ensure that our economy keeps this momentum going. And we’ve seen a very strong rebound, Michael. We’ve seen 350,000 jobs come back since the start of September. We’ve seen business and consumer confidence lift. We’ve seen Australia maintain its AAA credit rating. We’ve seen a very strong pipeline of investment, both in the housing market and more generally across the economy. The Queensland premier taking a victory lap as the borders reopen this morning. Federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg is chatting to media this morning, discussing the Queensland border reopening. He was asked if he is “absolutely confident” that state border closures are now a thing of the past. I certainly hope so ... We do know that the Omicron variant is not the first or not the last variant that we will probably see with respect to Covid. We also know that it’s highly transmissible, but perhaps not as severe as previous variants. We also know that the vaccine has proven to be a very effective defence against the virus, with the number of hospitalisations and deaths coming down, and restrictions being eased accordingly. So, I’m very hopeful that the state premiers will stick to the plan, keep their borders open, and allow Australians to be reunited at Christmas and allow businesses to flourish. The NBN has announced plans to switch to 100% renewable electricity by the end of 2025 and use electric or hybrid cars where possibly by 2030, reports AAP. Australia’s NBN Co has announced a “towards-zero carbon ambition”, with the company outlining a plan to use electricity exclusively from renewable sources by the end of 2025. As well as purchasing 100% renewable electricity from December 2025, an initial three-year roadmap works toward switching to electric or hybrid cars were possible by 2030, and reducing annual energy use by 25 gigawatt hours by the end of 2025. Total electricity generation in Australia was estimated to be 265,232 GWh in 2020, according to government numbers. More than 8.3m premises are connected to the NBN network, and the company says it will seek a “more efficient use of energy as data demand and the number of connected premises continues to grow”. NBN Co chief executive Stephen Rue said: Beyond the direct impact of becoming an environmentally sustainable business, what’s equally exciting is the power of the network to help enable digitisation, and the huge benefits that unlocks for the nation in terms of emissions reductions, as well as socio-economic benefits. The company has already entered into a renewable power purchasing agreement intended to deliver almost 20% renewable energy to the network by the 2o23 financial year. It plans to reach the 100% target through further power purchase agreements and contracts for renewables. The announcement comes as NBN Co becomes the first Australian telco and government business enterprise to join RE100, a global initiative joining “the world’s most influential businesses committed to 100% renewable power”. RE100 Australian co-ordinator Jon Dee said: It joins 110 other major companies in Australia that have joined RE100 and made the commitment to switch to 100% renewable electricity. Between them, Australian members of RE100 use more than 5.5 terawatt hours of electricity a year, enough to power 800,000 Australian homes. The towards-zero carbon ambition is part of NBN Co’s second sustainability report released toay, which also looks at social and economic impacts. With 33% of management positions held by women, NBN Co outperforms the national average, it notes. Additionally, as at 30 June 2021, NBN Co had a gender pay gap of less than 1%. Good morning everyone and welcome to the new week! It’s Matilda Boseley here on the blog with you today and I have some good news to start us off. After nearly five months the Queensland border has finally opened! As of this morning, anyone from Victoria and NSW can enter the sunshine state as long as they are fully vaccinated and have proof of a negative PCR test before beginning their journey. With tens of thousands of people expected to travel today, Jen King is up on the NSW/Queensland border this morning to bring us all the updates. Let’s go west now because Western Australia’s premier is set to finally reveal when the state’s borders will open, ending months of speculation. Mark McGowan is expected to announce a firm date for the reopening, this morning, likely in late January or early February. The state’s borders are closed or heavily restricted to every other state or territory except Tasmania. It’s anticipated the vaccination rate will have climbed to 90% by the time the borders finally reopen. Once the borders come down, transitional restrictions will come into effect. This will likely include mask mandates in high-risk indoor settings, and proof-of-vaccination requirements for large events with crowds of more than 1,000 people, nightclubs and casinos. Entry to remote Indigenous communities will remain restricted and contact registers will still be used. OK! With all of that out of the way, why don’t we jump right into the day?"

          "headline": "Cabaret review – Eddie Redmayne is electric in this blinder of a show",
          "bodyText": "This revival of John Kander and Fred Ebb’s 1966 musical might as well come with its own distinctive Kit Kat Club drumroll: one of the hottest – and more expensive – tickets of the year, its high concept staging extends across the venue, turning the foyers and the facade into the Weimar-era Berlin cabaret club in which its drama is set. There is also the drum-roll hype of Eddie Redmayne’s casting as the club’s impish Emcee. Appearing on a London stage for the first time in a decade, he has a long way to fall in a part whose songs, interspersed through the show, are central to its shifting tone, from the permissiveness and bonhomie of the late 1920s to the rise of the Third Reich. But from the moment we are “Willkommened” by Redmayne, it is clear he is in control of his material and electric in his part. As the soiled soul of Berlin, Redmayne’s Emcee mirrors the movement from light to dark; he is a comically twisted Rumpelstiltskin at the start, uncoiling to a figure resembling a terrible evil fairy or angel of death by the end. There are several moments at which we catch our breath, one coming in “If You Could See Her” in which he pushes the comic absurdism of singing a soppy love song to a gorilla and then chills us with the last, antiSemitic line, spat out like snake venom rather than whispered like Joel Grey’s comic aside in the 1972 film. It does not matter that Redmayne’s voice is drowned out by the orchestra at times. He gives an immense, physicalised performance, both muscular and delicate, from his curled limbs to his tautly expressive fingertips. Rebecca Frecknall’s production on the whole lives up to its hype, magnetising us with flamboyant camp and then delivering menace that feels freshly charged. Jessie Buckley, as Sally Bowles, first emerges as a glassy-eyed, underage sex-bomb – an obscene Shirley Temple in a frou-frou dress. Buckley plays her as the opposite of Liza Minnelli’s fun-loving chanteuse. Here she is a plummy-voiced Sloane who is emphatically unsexy with an edge of severity. But she sings with astonishing command, and there is an especially breath-taking version of “Cabaret” which is full of zombie-like darkness that sucks all of Minnelli’s froth out of it. Omari Douglas brings a gentle sweetness to his part as the bisexual American novelist, Clifford Bradshaw, but seems hemmed in by the role, as muted as his beige suit, though there is one flaring moment of passion when he kisses another man. Together, they do not spark romantic chemistry as the central couple. Their scenes together feel static and are side-lined by the passion of the show’s older couple: the boarding house landlady, Fraulein Schneider (Liza Sadovy), and the Jewish grocer, Herr Schultz (Elliot Levey). They become this production’s heart, first surprised to have found love so late and then broken when Nazi fervour drives them apart. “What Would You Do?” sings the Fraulein, and we feel her caught between the immovable forces of fascism, survival, and love. Together, they are magnificently tender and tragic. Tom Scutt’s stage design is expressionistic and imaginative: a train journey is represented by a model train revolving around the outer part of the three-tiered, circular stage. “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” has miniature model men standing to attention on the revolve, replaced by real men in its reprise, which is infused with ominous, stomping movements and a martial drum beat, prefiguring the terror to come. The auditorium is re-arranged with tables and chairs which creates the intimacy of a cabaret club, accompanied by Isabella Byrd’s cleanly sensational spot-lighting. Some of the early scenes seem like discrete warm-up acts, filled with romp, burlesque and transgressive naughtiness. The minor characters are beautifully realised too: Cliff’s friend, Ernst (Stewart Clarke), never loses his affability even after he reveals himself a Nazi. The Kit Kat Club’s dancers are by turns vulgar, comical and sexy with a thrilling blend of genders, and the musical comedy tickles with cartoonish charm, especially as Fraulein Kost (Anna-Jane Casey) smuggles her night trade of sailors into the boarding house. “Two Ladies” looks like a hazy theatrical wet dream, staged amid an orgy of tangled bodies – one character masturbates to Mein Kampf and another makes luridly suggestive moves on a sink plunger. Occasionally, it verges on outre overload. In the far shorter and overly sinister second half, Julia Cheng’s sinewy and soaring choreography is key to the tip from hedonism to hate: high-kicks start to resemble goose-steps and street violence is conveyed in a dance of outstretched limbs and a jacket balled in the fists of the performers. Redmayne creeps around the fringes of the stage when he is not performing, watching scenes from afar. If this show is sold on his star turn, we get more than our money’s worth with his blinding performance – in this blinder of a show. Cabaret is at the Playhouse theatre, London, until 1 October 2022."

          "headline": "Asylum seekers, families allegedly threatened after Australian immigration data breach",
          "bodyText": "The personal details of nearly 10,000 people seeking asylum in Australia – unlawfully posted online by the Australian government – were accessed by people in foreign countries, including China, Russia, Egypt, and Pakistan, and from masked anonymous locations. New documents show the information was allegedly used to threaten asylum seekers, and to persecute their families. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection – now home affairs – was alerted to its massive accidental data breach by a Guardian investigation in February 2014. A compensation claim on the breach is being heard on Monday morning in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The total payout could run to tens of millions of dollars. The personal information of 9,528 people then held in immigration detention – including full names, citizenships, dates of birth, location and period in immigration detention – was publicly available online on the department’s website for eight days in early 2014. More than 2,500 of them were children. In January, the office of the Australian information commissioner ordered the Australian government to pay compensation to nearly 1,300 people from that group who mounted a class action against the government, arguing that the exposure of their information could leave them vulnerable to persecution if forced to return to their home countries. The payout model put forward by lawyers for those affected proposes at least $10,000 in compensation for each person for the impact on their privacy and human rights, with additional payments, possibly more than an additional $25,000, for people acutely affected by their private information being released. The OAIC has proposed a range from $500 to more than $20,000. Newly available tribunal documents reveal that, while most IP addresses accessing the information were Australian, there was access from at least 11 other countries, including China, Egypt, the Russian Federation, Pakistan, Malaysia, and India. It was also accessed from anonymous locations. The report, a Microsoft excel document, was directly accessed 123 times by 104 unique IP addresses. It was downloaded at least 26 times, the department says. The report was also available on the internet archive for 16 days: it is not known how many times, and from where, it was accessed there. According to submissions on behalf of the affected people, the data breach has been used against asylum seekers and, in some cases, led to their families in their home countries being threatened. In one case, a verdict in a foreign court explicitly referenced the data leaked on the Australian government website as evidence that a person linked to an asylum seeker then in Australia had helped the asylum seeker flee their home country. The person was jailed as a result. “Multiple class members [asylum seekers] have provided documentary evidence of repercussions against their families upon their protection applications becoming known, after the data breach,’’ documents before the tribunal state. “The risk of this information being accessed by authorities is now realised, and if they were to attempt to return home they would be at a high risk of being persecuted by authorities, or of having their families persecuted.” The department sent emails and letters to those people whose privacy had been breached. Not all were able to be reached. Some had left Australia, and at least 172 were not sent notices because they had died, according to the department’s records. Slater and Gordon, acting for the asylum seekers, said the loss of the personal information was especially damaging for people seeking asylum. “The immense fears flowing from the data breach are well founded,’’ the legal firm said. “The data breach is a particularly serious one, and the consequences of the breach may yet be particularly harmful.” Slater and Gordon has argued that the secretary of the department should reconsider applications for protection visas made by class members, but that were refused, in light of the data breach. “The loss of the confidential nature of the information cannot ever be rectified – on the secretary’s own evidence, it seems that there is no way to know where the information currently is or how far it has (or will) spread; there is no suggestion or sense that the sensitivity of the personal information or the potential risks posed by its disclosure will diminish materially over time (particularly in cases of class members who have left behind relatives or close friends or associates in their former countries),” the firm said. The department, in documents before the tribunal, said as soon as it was alerted to the data breach by the Guardian, it took steps to remove the document within 45 minutes. It wrote to those affected “to alert them that the inadvertent disclosure of their personal information had occurred and to express the department’s deep regret that it had inadvertently allowed potential unauthorised access to the individuals’ personal information”. In this correspondence, the department noted that it would assess any implications for the individuals as part of its normal processes, and that individuals could also raise concerns during those processes."

          "headline": "Catalonia row deepens over family’s push for Spanish in school",
          "bodyText": "The long-running and bitter row over language teaching in Catalonia has intensified after a family in the Spanish region was harassed and abused for seeking to ensure that a quarter of the lessons at the school their five-year-old son attends are taught in Spanish. The family’s actions have provoked an angry response from some Catalan nationalists who view their stance as an assault on the region’s language and culture. According to media reports, the family became the subject of a WhatsApp group that has suggested identifying the child and his parents. One person tweeted that their house should be stoned, while another called for the little boy to be shunned, adding: “The other children should leave their class when lessons are taught in Spanish. If we don’t react, they’ll kill our language.” At the end of last week, the Catalan high court ordered the regional education ministry and the head of the school in the town of Canet de Mar to take measures to protect the boy and his identity. During a visit to the school last Thursday, Josep Gonzàlez-Cambray, who serves as education minister in the pro-independence regional government – said he condemned “any kind of threats or violence”. But he criticised the Catalan high court’s decision to order that 25% of classes be taught on Spanish as “an intolerable attack”, adding: “The Catalan school model is a model of success, which guarantees us social cohesion, equity and equal opportunities.” Fernando Grande-Marlaska, the interior minister in Spain’s Socialist-led coalition government, has warned that “any threats to coexistence” will be investigated. Salvador Illa, a former central government minister who now leads the Catalan Socialist party, also criticised the attacks on the family and said schools need to obey the decisions made by courts. “This doesn’t go against Catalan; it’s about complying with rulings, and the [regional education system] still guarantees Catalan as the educational centre of gravity in Catalonia,” Illa said on Thursday. The Spanish right has seized on the episode as proof of anti-Spanish discrimination in Catalonia, where the separatist government attempted unilateral secession in 2017. Pablo Casado, the leader of the rightwing People’s party – which is leading the national polls but has just three MPs in the 135-seat Catalan parliament – said: “Today in Spain, we’re suffering a terrible case of linguistic segregation involving a five-year-old boy.” Casado said the Catalan government was practising “linguistic apartheid” and accused the Socialist-led minority government of “complicit silence” because it relies on the support of some Catalan nationalists in congress. The far-right Vox party, whose rise has been partly fuelled by the Catalan independence crisis, has called a demonstration outside the regional parliament on Tuesday evening. It said it would no longer allow “twisted separatism to continue assaulting the little boy and his family from Canet with total impunity”. Language issues have also featured in the central government’s efforts to get next year’s budget through parliament. Last month, the administration of Pedro Sánchez attempted to placate the Catalan Republican Left party – which heads the regional government – by proposing that at least 6% of streaming platforms’ content would have to be in Spain’s co-official languages: Catalan, Galician or Basque."

          "bodyText": "My husband, Peter Wilmers, who has died aged 72, was a pioneer of community greening whose work helped transform the Lancashire valley of Rossendale and inspired a national movement. A creative worker for the environment, he had a rare combination of strategic vision and an ability to get things done. In 1983, Peter moved as a planner from Norfolk to Lancashire to lead Rossendale Groundwork, a not-for-profit environmental charity based on local partnerships, supported by the Countryside Commission. Rossendale, a Pennine valley with high unemployment and a degraded landscape, was not home to the first Groundwork trust, but Peter, with energy and political skill, established the Rossendale organisation as a model of what Groundwork could achieve. Work focused on “New Landscapes” and “New Lives”. For 10 years, Groundwork was the third largest employer in the valley. Training schemes exceeded expectations; local footpaths and walls were restored; a derelict building became a visitor centre; and 22,000 trees a year were planted. Perceptions changed with community involvement. Peter played a major role in getting ministers to support a national rollout of Groundwork. The local MP, Sir David Trippier, emerged as a champion for the wider movement and the federation continues today as a national force for regeneration. Sporting his green suits and red shoe laces, Peter attracted the great and the good while pioneering many innovative programmes. He led Groundwork’s expansion into east Lancashire and Bury in the 1990s. In Blackburn, a derelict canal building became a flagship centre; a £5m grant transformed wastelands around a deprived estate. “Youth Works” programmes targeted youth crime. He set up the UK’s first business environmental audit programme, enabling small businesses to reduce their environmental impact and costs. This led to work in Hungary and Poland and conference presentations across Europe, in Beijing and New York. By 2003 Peter was managing four Groundwork organisations. At the North West Development Agency, to which he moved in 2005, he championed “green infrastructure”, proposing investment in functional green space to sit alongside other infrastructure programmes. He helped Natural England reveal and celebrate the economic benefits of nature. This approach, pioneered through Natural Economy Northwest, is now established. Peter retired in 2010. For 15 years he was a governor of Cribden House school, Rawtenstall. He actively participated on the board of Rossendale Leisure Trust and the Whitaker Museum until his death. Born in Clapham, south London, Peter was the son of June (nee Mecredy), who taught English as a foreign language, and John Wilmers, a QC. He attended and was influenced by Leighton Park, a Quaker school in Reading, from which he went on to study social science at Leicester University and postgraduate planning at Nottingham University. Talented and multifaceted, Peter sparkled. His legacy continues in the landscape and the people changed and inspired by his work. Peter was married first to Sue Biffen and then to Kath Long, with whom he had two sons, Tom and Harry. Both marriages ended in divorce, and Harry predeceased him. Peter and I met in 1987, and married four years later; he is also survived by Tom, his grandchildren, Hugo and Clara, and June."

          "headline": "John Midwinter obituary",
          "bodyText": "John Midwinter, who has died aged 83, did much to transform telecommunications from a simple phone-based service in the 1970s to the full broadband and internet network that we have today. Before such services came from the privatised British Telecom, the state provider was the Post Office: during John’s time at its research laboratory (1971-84), he shaped the understanding, design and development of the first optical fibre communications systems and their introduction into the UK network. In the process he helped Britain lead the world in establishing optical communications as a fast-moving and competitive research area. When, in 1966, Charles Kao of Standard Telecommunication Laboratories proposed the idea of optical fibres – strands of glass as thin as a hair carrying communications traffic – the challenges were huge, and struck many as insurmountable. A full system called for the design of optical transmitters and receivers, reliable lasers to generate pulses of light, techniques to modulate and demodulate data, and a better understanding of the physics of data-carrying optical pulses propagating in glass. However, John, as head of what became the Post Office’s optical communications division, set about developing a complete system carrying live traffic. In 1977 the world’s first optical fibre system was installed between Martlesham and Kesgrave, in Suffolk, with members of his research team splicing fibres in the snow, sleet and rain, to successfully demonstrate the transmission of data over approximately 8km of fibre. The next problem was to significantly extend the length of these systems. This involved the use of mono-mode fibres of a much smaller diameter core, supporting a single path for the light to follow. Data-carrying pulses of light could be prevented from spreading, so allowing much higher data rates over longer distances. This went against conventional wisdom, which held that it would be impossible to join such thin, fragile fibres. However, by the early 80s, John’s group achieved this feat, sending data at four times the rate over a distance of 60km. British Telecom, as it was from 1980, stopped all work on competing technologies and in 1984 became the first telecommunication operator to switch entirely to single-mode fibre systems. The rest of the world soon followed, with the help of John’s textbook, Optical Fibres for Transmission (1979). As a result of his work, today more than 95% of all data is transmitted over optical fibres and more than 500m kilometres of fibre are installed each year on land or under the sea. In 1984 Eric Ash, head of the department of electronic and electrical engineering at University College London, recruited John as BT professor of optoelectronics. At UCL John focused his research on exploring whether photons could be used to carry out processing functions in order to design, for example, an optical computer. But while photons were excellent for transmission, electrons proved better for switching and other digital functions. By the early 90s, John returned to research on optical communications, exploring the use of multiple wavelengths or colours for the routing of optical information. He was elected to the fellowship of Engineering (now RAEng) and appointed OBE (both 1984), and became fellow of the Royal Society (1985). He succeeded Ash as head of the department in 1988 and a year later became Pender professor of electrical engineering (the Victorian cable pioneer Sir John Pender endowed the chair in UCL in 1885). John also served as vice-provost of UCL (1994-99) and president of the Institution of Electrical Engineers (2000-01), and retired as emeritus professor in 2004. John was calm, logical, efficient in all ways, encouraging and respectful of well-reasoned opinions. The concept of procrastination was alien to him, and he was always supportive and generous with advice. Born in Newbury, Berkshire, he was the son of Vera (nee Rawlinson) and Harry (Henry) Midwinter. As Harry belonged to the fourth generation of Midwinters to run a corn merchant’s business, it was expected that John would follow this path. At St Bartholomew’s grammar school, John was a bookish child who hated team sports, and showed early aptitude for engineering, building model aircraft and cars in his spare time. Following school, John volunteered for national service with the RAF. There he became a radar instructor and broke with family tradition by going on to study physics at King’s College London, where he gained a first-class degree (1961). His first job was with the Royal Radar Establishment, Malvern, Worcestershire, carrying out research in nonlinear optics, which led him to work on the first ruby laser in the UK. He continued this research with the Perkin-Elmer corporation in the US, and in 1971 returned to the UK to take up his Post Office post. John met Maureen Holt through ballroom dancing as a teenager, and they married in 1961. Together they enjoyed travelling, hiking, planting their meadow, sharing a love of classical music and looking after several generations of Labrador dogs. In retirement, John became a passionate advocate for mitigating climate change, lecturing widely for the University of the Third Age (U3A). Maureen survives him, along with their four children, Timothy, Philippa, Kim and Piers, and five grandchildren. • John Edwin Midwinter, optical fibre communications engineer, born 8 March 1938; died 13 November 2021 • This article was amended on 20 January 2022. By the time John Midwinter began research work for the then state telecommunications provider, it was the Post Office rather than the General Post Office: the change came in 1969."

          "bodyText": "After a Gold Coast man who bludgeoned his teenage girlfriend to death escaped a murder charge by arguing he had been provoked by her tales of infidelity, the Queensland government decided to step in. “Other than in exceptional or extreme cases you can’t rely on words, or conduct that consists substantially of words,” the state’s then attorney general, Cameron Dick, said in 2011. “We need a change to the law … just because you say something it doesn’t mean that you should be killed.” A decade later, another Queensland man, Arona Peniamina, also convinced a jury his spouse’s suspected infidelity had provoked him into ending her life in a jealous rage. The government’s reforms had not prevented him from successfully arguing he was guilty of manslaughter, rather than murder, because he had been provoked. As had occurred more than a decade earlier, convincing a jury he had been provoked meant Peniamina would therefore be subjected to a lesser sentence. As the Queensland supreme court judge Peter Davis noted, Peniamina had spent the days leading up to his wife’s death investigating her contact with another man. Peniamina’s case led to more questions about how the Queensland justice system was failing women, and another review of the law as it relates to the use of provocation as a defence in murder cases. Peniamina successfully argued that the suspicion of infidelity provoked him to start assaulting his wife, Sandra Peniamina, and that he was further provoked when she picked up a knife to defend herself. “There are instances where this would help those who were provoked and were protecting themselves,” Sandra’s sister, Carnetra Potter, who is now looking after the couple’s four young sons, told the Courier Mail. “But it in this case did not work in our favour. I believe the [law] should be looked at as a whole.” The attorney general, Shannon Fentiman, agreed, saying the wide-ranging work being done by the state’s women’s safety and justice taskforce would include an examination of the defence of provocation in domestic, family and sexual violence cases. The taskforce did not respond to a request for comment about when the review could be completed. Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Queensland remains one of the few Australian jurisdictions which allows a partial defence of provocation, allowing the crime of murder to be reduced to manslaughter. As the New South Wales court of criminal appeal justice Anthony Johnson said in April, the partial defence “has attracted criticism”, leading to review and reform during the past two decades. It had been abolished in Victoria, Tasmania, Western Australia and most recently in South Australia, Johnson said. The ACT and Northern Territory have restricted the use of provocation as a defence but not abolished it entirely. Johnson’s comments were made as he denied the leave to appeal application of Warren Francis Rogers, who attempted to argue “extreme provocation” was a factor when he used a pillow to smother his wife of 40 years, Anne Rogers, to death. As he later explained to his son-in-law, Rogers killed her after a fight started because of he was upset by a non-sexual relationship she had with another man. “I’m not a bad person, I just snapped, you know?” Rogers said. “I just snapped … she pushed me too far.” While Rogers’ application was rejected, and NSW does not allow the partial defence of provocation, its unique model is considered problematic by some experts. The NSW laws, enacted in 2014, include a partial defence of “extreme provocation”. The laws were designed to significantly reduce the number of cases under which provocation could be argued, but leave it open as a defence for cases that met a four-staged test, to ensure that victims of prolonged family violence, for example, could use it as a defence should they kill their abusive spouse. Provocation can be considered in sentencing if a person is found guilty of murder. “The government is satisfied that the bill strikes a careful and appropriate balance between restricting the defence and leaving it available for victims of extreme provocation, including victims of long-term abuse who kill their abuser,” the then NSW attorney general, Brad Hazzard, said in introducing the bill. A select committee was established in parliament to examine the laws after the case of Chamanjot Singh, who stood trial for murder after cutting his wife’s throat. Singh claimed during his trial that his wife, Manpreet Kaur, provoked him by telling him she had never loved him and was in love with someone else, and threatening him with deportation. He said he lost self-control and should not be found guilty of murder but of manslaughter, and the jury agreed. Abolish the defence completely In her 2017 research, Dr Kate Fitz-Gibbon, an associate professor at Monash University, found that in the decade before the reforms were introduced, there were 20 convictions finalised in the NSW supreme court for manslaughter by reason of provocation. The majority of these cases involved intimate partner homicide motivated by relationship separation or infidelity, she found. Fitz-Gibbon found that the NSW reforms would eliminate many of these scenarios of what she called “jealous man provocation”. She told Guardian Australia that the Peniamina case was a clear reminder of why the partial defence should be scrapped, as, by its nature, it operated “to facilitate victim blaming narratives”. “We have seen time and time again throughout Australian criminal law history that the partial defence has been successfully utilised by men who have killed their female intimate partners to avoid full accountability for their lethal actions. “It would be naive to think that the abolition of the partial defence of provocation is the entire solution. “We must continue to challenge cultures within our legal system that allow for the proliferation of gendered narratives whereby women are ultimately blamed for their own deaths.” She said that some Australian jurisdictions were currently progressing reforms that would better ensure men who committed fatal intimate partner violence they are held to account. But that did not mean that such offences should be subject to mandatory sentences, as these measures meant men who often raise provocation to mitigate their sentences. “The partial defence of provocation must be abolished in every Australian state and territory, it has no place in our legal system.”"

          "headline": "Sailing away: superyacht industry booms during Covid pandemic",
          "bodyText": "In an era of environmental awareness and conspicuous displays of sustainability, you might not expect a rise in the number of people with the means and appetite for a £50m floating fortress of solitude. But, in part because of the coronavirus crisis, the superyacht industry is booming – and the number of vessels under construction or on order worldwide has hit a new record. According to figures revealed in the latest edition of Boat International’s Global Order Book, more than 1,200 superyachts are slated to be built – a rise of 25% on last year. “The market’s never been busier,” said Will Christie, a superyacht broker. “And I’ve been in the industry 20 years. A lot of people say they appreciate the safety of being on a yacht during the pandemic. But it’s also because whereas in previous eras the people with enough money were too busy in the office to justify the purchase, these days they can work from anywhere. “I had one client who sent his trading terminals by plane so he could use them onboard – he’d be kitesurfing in the afternoon and then go back to his desk.” Christie said shipyard order books were typically full until 2025 – meaning clients are prepared to pay a premium to take over someone else’s slot if it can be delivered years earlier. He argued that the ability to transport a holiday home to a different location at a moment’s notice was deeply appealing. “Everybody just wants freedom, and ultra-high-net-worth individuals can afford it,” he added. “The ability to escape anywhere is very attractive in the current climate. They think: I don’t need to be stuck in the office, and if you’re worth billions, why should you be?” Critics of the boom in superyachts point to the vastly disproportionate environmental damage produced by the super-rich. “Whether it’s this or private jets or trips to space, they’re just sticking two fingers up at the rest of society,” said Peter Newell, a professor of international relations at Sussex University. “It’s decadent. They’re not comfortable with the constraints that come with accepting collective responsibility for the fate of the planet.” Newell, the lead author of a Rapid Transition Alliance report which called for policymakers to target the “polluter elite” to limit their carbon consumption, said industry claims of moves to a more sustainable model were unconvincing. He called for government action. “You can’t just rely on people’s empathy – it has to be tax and regulation,” he said. “But it is very, very hard with a mobile elite that can move its money and its property around.” Of the 1,200 superyachts on order or under construction, 27 would be more than 100 metres long, the Global Order Book said. The REV Ocean, being built by the Norwegian billionaire Kjell Inge Røkke, will measure 183 metres, making it the biggest in the world. It features a “moon pool” through which a submarine will be deployed for ocean research. Some of the more eye-watering features of existing superyachts include helicopter landing pads, open-air cinemas, and – in the case of the UFC fighter Conor McGregor – a “jousting platform”. The economic anthropologist Richard Wilk, a distinguished professor at Indiana University in the US, said: “Of course, if you add every superyacht together, it’s just a blip on total greenhouse gas production. But it is symbolic – and the global impact of the 2,000-odd billionaires on the planet are very significant. So it’s part of a pattern of overconsumption by the upper crust.” In research with his colleague Beatriz Barros, he found that the average billionaire had a carbon footprint thousands of times that of the average person. The global average footprint of CO2 emitted per person is just under five tonnes, while they estimated that Roman Abramovich – the top polluter according to their list – was responsible for about 33,859 tonnes of carbon emitted in 2018. More than two-thirds of that was the product of his yacht, the 162.5-metre Eclipse. As well as fuel when the vessel is in use, Wilk said, “even when [the owners] are not onboard, they usually have a substantial permanent crew there, using all kinds of relatively inefficient systems. They might call the captain and ask him to take the yacht from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean to meet them. So you can greenwash it, but it doesn’t make much difference.” Sympathy for superyacht owners may not have been enhanced by a recent intervention from Australia’s richest woman, the mining magnate Gina Rinehart. In a video recorded from the deck of her own vessel in front of an emerald sea, she complained that there were not enough spaces to dock superyachts in Queensland. “For instance, we’ve just experienced days of very rough water from the southern Queensland border to the Capricorn Coast,” she said. “Then, when we arrived at the coast not feeling that great after two very rough sleepless nights and a rough day, many yachts were outside the marinas, given the lack of marinas.” Queensland might suffer because overseas superyacht owners would be less likely to visit, she added. “‘These superyachts need marinas too – sadly lacking for vessels over 50 metres. It’s time for more marinas large enough to cater not only for small and medium yachts but larger ones too.”"

          "bodyText": "After years of stability, the Office for National Statistics reported that alcohol-specific deaths in 2020 had increased by 19% from 2019, counting 8,974 deaths coded as caused by alcohol misuse, with three in four being from alcoholic liver disease. The national lockdown saw an increase in abstention, but also in heavy drinking. Harm can increase without greater total consumption: the distribution matters, not just the average. Drinking too much alcohol raises the risks of many diseases, so analysts try to estimate total numbers of deaths attributable to alcohol consumption – they modelled about 19,200 alcohol-related deaths in England in 2019, around four times the direct count of number of alcohol-specific registrations. The method requires many assumptions, such as 11% of breast cancer deaths in women over 75 being due to alcohol, and a major recent change in such attributable fractions cut estimated alcohol-related death figures by around 23%. People might like a single number to settle an issue but we cannot count everything directly and analysts may need to construct a range of statistics to improve our understanding. Many tens of thousands of deaths every year are attributed to air pollution, but until an inquest in 2020, it was never given as an official cause of an individual death. Influenza also demonstrates the limitations of counting. Between 2013 and 2020, only around 600 people in England and Wales died with influenza as the direct underlying cause each year. Yet England’s public health agency estimated in 2020 that there were around 15,000 “influenza-attributable deaths” in the 2016-17 season alone. That figure comes from the FluMomo model, which picks out periods with high mortality over a curved seasonal baseline, attributing those deaths to influenza or extreme temperatures. This approach has some weaknesses, including potential overestimation and insufficient corrections for registration delays. In essence, FluMomo tries to estimate how many fewer deaths would occur if flu were eliminated. That just about happened last winter, contributing to a deficit in non-Covid-19 deaths and our continued distancing behaviour means, once again, flu is running at a very low level. That’s currently about the one bit of good news for the NHS. • David Spiegelhalter is chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at Cambridge.

          "bodyText": "Landscapers (Sky Atlantic) The Great (Starzplay) You Don’t Know Me (BBC One) | iPlayer How to Make It on OnlyFans (Channel 4) | All 4 Landscapers, Sky Atlantic’s new four-part true crime drama, shouldn’t work. It stars Olivia Colman and David Thewlis as Susan and Christopher Edwards, the “Mansfield murderers”, who in 1998 shot her parents and buried them in the garden (also amassing £245,000), and were finally sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014, with a minimum of 25 years each. Written by Ed Sinclair, Colman’s husband, and directed by Will Sharpe (Giri/Haji; Flowers), Landscapers is pretentious, wayward, hyper-conceptual – eschewing realism, shredding timelines – breaks all the rules of true crime, including the good ones. It’s also extraordinary, disquieting, beautiful; television as art. From the off (all episodes are available to stream), we’re plunged into Susan’s reality-distorting Hollywood obsession: westerns, romances, the squandering of huge sums on memorabilia, faked letters from Gérard Depardieu. The couple are impoverished in France, having been on the run for 15 years – needlessly, as nobody noticed the victims were missing – and librarian Susan lives in idealised “scenes”, casting accountant Christopher as her screen hero. This self-protective cocoon – Susan was abused by her father – is compounded by Christopher harbouring the kind of saviour complex that’s so often a front for control; even early on, their Great Love looks more of a tarted-up co-dependency doomed to shatter under pressure. This comes when Christopher gives them up and they return to England to face the police, brilliantly played by Kate O’Flynn, Samuel Anderson and Daniel Rigby, while Dipo Ola is wonderful as Susan’s kindly solicitor. Christopher’s betrayal is the moment when Susan’s mask of meekness slips to reveal childish rage, a nastiness that reminds you that, however confused the Edwards’s story of the murders becomes, murders they still were. Landscapers itself evolves into a writhing screen-Hydra of themes, moods and techniques: from black-and-white court scenes, snowy police interviews and a full-blown western sequence, to such a comprehensive smashing of the fourth wall that players leave one set to join another. Just as you think the Edwards are being too endearingly portrayed as bunglers and innocents – “My husband and I got ourselves into a bit of a pickle” – real-life news reports cut through the whimsy like a sharp syrup. Dennis Potter’s influence is here, but also Charlie Kaufman’s 2020 Netflix film I’m Thinking of Ending Things (which also starred Thewlis). The result is mesmeric and audacious, though without the anchorage of the lead performances it could still have turned into so much experimental shrapnel. Colman won an Oscar for The Favourite, but she’s even better here. She and Thewlis provide the (irregular) heartbeat of Landscapers – together, they live and breathe every strange, tortured moment of it. Tony McNamara co-wrote The Favourite, and his Starzplay dramedy The Great, about the rise of Russia’s Catherine the Great (played with wicked elan by Elle Fanning), is, well, great. Now returning for a 10-part second series, with episodes released singly until issued as a box set on Boxing Day, to say that The Great bears the weight of history lightly is an understatement. From what I can make out, it plonks on lavish costumes, sits in sumptuous palaces and feels good to go, wilfully spraying around anachronisms and outright filth like it’s Sex Education with powdered hair and corsets. You half expect Catherine’s husband, Nicholas Hoult’s Peter III, to arrive atop a skateboard, shouting his signature “Huzzah!”. As we rejoin them, Peter remains hampered by sycophants who indulge his every hot-headed move and Catherine is intent on forcing Peter to abdicate, while also bewailing her pregnancy, “a coup on your body”. While the whole cast is great, Fanning and Hoult’s chemistry is the jewel in the Greats’ imperial crown, though in Catherine’s scathing view it doesn’t exist: “I look at you and go dry like sand.” There’s more than a whiff of Blackadder here, but you won’t catch me complaining about that. You Don’t Know Me is a four-part thriller, adapted by Tom Edge (Vigil) from the book by barrister Imran Mahmood. It stars Samuel Adewunmi as Hero, a car salesman who’s dragged into the criminal underbelly in his quest to find mysterious new girlfriend (Sophie Wilde), resulting in him facing charges for the murder of local drug dealer Jamil (Roger Jean Nsengiyumva). The drama has barely begun before Hero sacks his barrister and is in court defending himself, explaining how the damning evidence (forensics, CCTV et al) isn’t proof of his guilt. From there it’s a veritable kaleidoscope of flashbacks, with occasional courtroom links. At times it all gets a bit bargain-bin Top Boy, and Hero’s relentless courtroom explanations and denials recall Shaggy’s It Wasn’t Me. Then there’s Jamil’s inexplicable survival after being shot at point-blank range: somehow he rises from the dead like a puffa-jacketed Christ. Still, You Don’t Know Me is pacy and enjoyable, with twist piled upon twist and all-round great performances, including Bukky Bakray (Rocks) as Hero’s sensitive sister. Adewunmi was wasted in the recent disappointing Angela Black, and here he’s able to showcase his skills and charisma. As Hero, he’s engulfed in emotions – love, fear, despair – proving he’s a leading man all the way. The Channel 4 documentary How to Make It on OnlyFans followed former lads’ mag model turned OnlyFans star Alex Sim-Wise as she advised others to, as she put it, “make naughty content online” on the controversial site that makes 90% of its income from sexual content. Among them were Zoe, who wanted to make extra cash indulging foot fetishists, and Emily, who styled herself as Baddie Rabbit. During the making of the documentary, OnlyFans announced a ban on sexual content and then just as abruptly withdraw it. Obviously the libertine sex positive argument was strong here, while counter-arguments (including widespread concerns about underage content providers) were in short supply. Still, this was an illuminating, humanising peek at OnlyFans contributors: Baddie, for one, suffered from everything from low self-esteem to autoimmune hepatitis. While not agreeing with all the views aired, I didn’t stop liking the people. What else I’m watching… Other, Like Me (BBC Four) A documentary about COUM Transmissions, the 1970s art-music collective (Throbbing Gristle, Psychic TV) that became mired in satanic abuse allegations. They don’t make “outsiders” like this any more. Interviewees include the late Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti, who in later years accused P-Orridge of abuse. Vienna Blood (BBC Two) Second series of the period crime drama set in the opulent environs of Vienna during the 1900s. When a Hungarian countess is found drowned in her hotel bath, the case must be solved by detective Jürgen Maurer and psychiatrist Matthew Beard. Curb Your Enthusiasm (Sky Comedy) The 11th series of Curb is in fine, turbo-caustic form, with guest stars including Woody Harrelson and Seth Rogen. In the latest episode, our antihero is too idle to queue to vote and Tracey Ullman co-stars as a councillor so abhorrent she’s Larry’s match."

          "bodyText": "During the closing stages of Margaret Thatcher’s premiership, I said to the Conservative MP John Biffen: “I think Mrs Thatcher must be suffering.” This was surprising, coming from such a long-term critic of Thatcherism as myself, but so was the reply from Biffen, a former member of her cabinet and also, for years, her leader of the Commons. “Yes,” he replied, “but is she suffering enough?” Biffen was strongly opposed to the poll tax – a proposal for local authority taxation which would apply the same rate to rich and poor – general opposition to which eventually contributed to Thatcher’s fall from power in 1990. Biffen was also MP for the Oswestry constituency, which later became North Shropshire. North Shropshire is in the news. A solid Conservative seat where there is going to be a byelection on Thursday as a result of the “sleaze”-enforced, if reluctant, resignation of Owen Paterson, but one which, according to the latest odds, the Liberal Democrats might win, given the way the public finally seems to be catching up with what an appalling government Boris Johnson has landed them with – Johnson, of course, being in the lead when it comes to the debasement of modern British political standards. Now, I did not get where I am today by making political forecasts, let alone following the betting. Nevertheless, byelections can spring surprises. There was an interesting one way back in 1985, when my then colleague Adam Raphael was covering the Brecon and Radnor byelection, which Neil Kinnock, then leader of the Labour party, had obviously hoped his candidate would win. Neil and Adam had a £10 bet on the result. But Labour’s support was dented by an incendiary speech by the National Union of Mineworkers’ leader, Arthur Scargill, and the seat went by a narrow margin to the Liberals. Neil paid up with a £10 cheque, which Adam did not cash, but instead framed for posterity. Alas, it turns out that the writing on the cheque has completely faded away. Posterity will have to take their word for it. If the North Shropshire byelection does produce an upset, this might well be the final nail in the coffin of Johnson’s troubled premiership. But whether this might benefit Labour is an open question. Kinnock and his deputy Roy Hattersley had reasonable hopes they would defeat Thatcher in a general election, but by ruthlessly dispensing with her in favour of John Major, the Tories got themselves a new lease of life. The good news is that Labour’s present leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has also had a new lease of life with his forensic assault on this frightful government. But we must wait to see whether he and Labour can turn up the heat on the disaster of Brexit. I was disappointed to read an article by Lionel Barber, former editor of the Financial Times, in which he said that he and some distinguished colleagues on the new Independent Commission on UK-EU Relations were united in the view that “there can be no question of refighting the Brexit referendum or reopening the question of EU membership. The war is over, the Leavers won.” This is desperately defeatist. They acknowledge that “Brexit isn’t working” then say “the task of the commission is to help fix it”. But Brexit can’t be “fixed”. As Kinnock recently observed: “You cannot mend a burst tyre.” Day by day the news gets worse: our so-called Brexit negotiator Lord Frost has alarmed the Biden administration with what his “renegotiation” of the Northern Ireland protocol might portend for peace in Northern Ireland, and he unashamedly wants to abandon the European social model – to which the UK, by way of having previously championed the single market, has made a major contribution. Frost and his colleagues fantasise about a trade deal with the US which is simply not on the cards. Trump-era tariffs on US imports of steel and aluminium? Down for members of the EU, but not for the UK. Pig farmers? Sheep farmers? Thousands of small and medium-sized British businesses? All suffering from the absurdity of Brexit. It is more than five years since 37% of the electorate voted for Brexit, in response to a number of grossly misleading promises. As I wrote recently, I ask many people I encounter what they think of Brexit, and the response is decidedly negative. As for the younger generation – the many people who have become eligible to vote since 2016 – my strong impression is that they are overwhelmingly in favour of rejoining. Labour should go for it!"

          "bodyText": "There’s a communal prayer of penitence that is often used in Church of England services. In it, worshippers confess that they have sinned against their fellow humans “in thought, and word, and deed; through negligence, through weakness, through our own deliberate fault”. Concise yet powerful, it recognises the different ways we can harm each other. Sins of omission and of carelessness are no less damaging, or requiring of forgiveness, than those born of malice. We live in a period when our personal contributions to systemic injustice, many of them unintentional, are becoming increasingly obvious. Our new age of enlightenment has illuminated any number of dark corners that society has long failed (or refused) to notice. Cricket, the sport I love, has just endured a particularly punishing month of reckoning. First, Azeem Rafiq’s public testimony against his former county, Yorkshire, forced the English game to admit that its anti-racism stance wasn’t worth the T-shirts it was printed on. Then, right before the Ashes, Australia’s then-captain admitted sending sexually explicit messages to a colleague. In both cases, players, coaches and commentators found themselves suddenly jobless, while the sport’s administrators have scrambled, with little dignity, to contain the fallout. Rafiq said he had no interest in shaming individuals, but in exposing the culture of which their actions were a part. The fact that he was undermined with the revelation of antisemitic tweets from his past is symptomatic of our default position, to respond to calls for societal change with charges of hypocrisy. Each new sally in the culture wars requires its own forensic dig through social media. Each corresponding “Gotcha” moment detracts and distracts from the widespread need for justice, education and understanding that has inspired such powerful movements as Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movement. Attitudinal and behavioural changes in our society are as rapid as they are overdue. Generations Z and Alpha will grow up with a far greater understanding than their predecessors of how insidious and widespread is the human instinct to “other” one another and how enshrined it is in our political systems and social networks. For anyone older, this is a time of reassessment. How many of us can honestly say we haven’t laughed at comedy based on stereotypes we’d blench at now, whether it’s our parents laughing at funny foreigners in 70s sitcoms or Rachel sniggering at the word “homo” in Friends? Given the insults that liberally littered schooldays past – girls calling each other “retards” or boys calling each other “gay” – who hasn’t used language they’d cringe to repeat or stayed silent at something they would quickly denounce today? No wonder many feel defensive, threatened, overwhelmed: having good intentions, and being decent in our individual encounters, is no longer enough. We’re living in an era when we’re being asked to listen and learn in ways that many of us haven’t done before. If it were easy to admit and apologise for our complicity in social “norms” that hurt others, we might have solved some of these problems. But even saying sorry for the smallest things can feel beyond us, especially under the scrutiny of social media that is quick to point the finger. While our first thoughts in these situations must be with the victims of injustice, it’s possible to feel horror for the discrimination they’ve endured (and we’ve ignored) yet retain an instinctive sympathy for those caught in the crude spotlight of their own errors. Perhaps that’s not an unselfish feeling. It’s born of the utter surety that some of our own past thoughts, beliefs and utterances might not withstand such scrutiny, whether or not our timelines are devoid of casually racist memes. Occasionally, it feels as though we’re living in a world of mutually assured destruction. There are few enough of us with clean hands, yet still, in our moral panic, we sacrifice our scapegoats and revel in other people’s downfalls. The more loudly we exercise our judgment on “historical messages” or thoughtless speech or crass attempts at humour, the harder it becomes for everyone else to own their mistakes. We can’t escape, and we can’t progress, if we’re trapped in a circle holding guns to each other’s heads. We have to find a new model for taking responsibility that tempers justice with mercy. We need to adopt a readiness to forgive that stops us getting so self-righteous and stoking divides. We must make space for grace. We also have to admit – to ourselves, to others – that we’re all susceptible to human nature and human flaws. Understanding how or why someone said or did something wrong, whether through deep-rooted and unchallenged prejudice or wilful ignorance, or worse, isn’t the same as condoning it. Acknowledging our mistakes and changing our behaviour is the most vital thing we can do. We’re more likely and able to make amends if we’re not terrified of lifelong judgment and if we don’t feel singled out for blame. In our secular society, we’ve let go of many of the rituals that allow us to acknowledge communal wrongdoing and encourage us to seek corporate forgiveness. Many would, understandably, choke on the hypocrisy of the absolution that religious establishments offer, when so many of them have been implicated in oppressive systems of their own. But maybe we’ve struggled to replace them with anything else that can recognise and relieve the heavy tonnage of our collective guilt. Instead, we point out the mote in our brother’s eye. Or we outsource atonement to actual corporations and other organisations we can hold accountable for actions and behaviour that exist at a safe distance. There’s surely a reason why the mea culpas doled out by PR departments these days have started to sound less like careful legalese and more like liturgy. “Our sport did not welcome you, our game did not accept you as it should have done,” intoned the ECB’s press release. It could almost have come with an amen at the end. • Emma John is a freelance writer and author"

          "bodyText": "Australia has said it will shorten the wait time for people to receive Covid-19 booster vaccines. Health minister, Greg Hunt, said the time interval will be shortened to five months after the second dose. Another 633 Omicron cases have been found in the UK, the biggest daily increase since the Covid-19 variant was detected last month. The latest figure, a 50% day-on-day increase, brings the total number of confirmed Omicron cases to 1,898 across the country, the UK health security agency said. Brazil’s supreme court justice, Luis Roberto Barroso, has ruled the country must demand proof of vaccination for visitors seeking to enter the country. The Omicron variant could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England over the next five months if no additional measures are taken beyond Plan B, according to scientists advising the government. A booster dose means the risk of symptomatic infection with the Omicron variant is “significantly reduced”, according to health officials who have urged all those eligible to make sure they get their third jab. Tens of thousands gathered in Austria’s capital Vienna to protest mandatory Covid vaccines and home confinement orders for those who have not yet received the jabs. Taiwan’s government said on Saturday that it had detected the island’s first cases of the Omicron variant, found in three people who had arrived from abroad. Mexico’s health ministry reported 235 more deaths from Covid-19, bringing the country’s official toll since the pandemic began to 296,620. The health ministry has previously said the real number is likely significantly higher, Reuters reports. Boris Johnson is facing further questions over whether he breached Covid laws after pictures emerged of him hosting a Christmas quiz in Downing Street while London was under tier 2 restrictions. The prime minister was pictured on a screen reading out questions while staff were sat behind computers and conferred on the answers, the Mirror reported. London was then under restrictions banning any social mixing between households. Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Staff working for the Work and Pensions Secretary (DWP) in England drank alcohol and ate takeaways “late into the evening” on a number of occasions while coronavirus restrictions were in place, the department confirmed. It comes after the Sunday Mirror reported that political staff and officials frequently drank after work until the early hours of the morning, and ordered food to Therese Coffey’s office at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The newspaper said some of these evenings took place while hospitality and office parties were banned under Covid regulations. The DWP has confirmed there were times when alcohol was consumed in a work space outside the Cabinet minister’s Whitehall office but stressed it took place while work was continuing past normal employment hours. A source told the PA news agency the desks in the office are socially distanced and there was “no party atmosphere going on”. A DWP spokesman said: “Throughout the pandemic, DWP officials have followed Government guidance while continuing to deliver vital services for millions of people. “Staff worked from home where possible but a core team working directly to the Secretary of State regularly worked from the office, in accordance with the Covid-19 rules as they evolved. “The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol. No karaoke took place.” Asked about the Sunday Mirror’s suggestion that Coffey gave presents to staff while they stayed late one night over last year’s festive period, the spokesman replied: “On one occasion close to Christmas, the Secretary of State gave gifts to her core team, as she does every year.” The Treasury has confirmed “impromptu drinks” occurred when England was locked down. People in the UK should be able to get their Covid-19 jabs while doing their Christmas shopping, Labour said, as the opposition party calls for a “national effort” to increase the rate of booster shots. With recent research from UK scientists finding that booster shots are likely to be effective against the Omicron variant, Labour is urging ministers to open more vaccinations sites and to open up booking slots to all double-jabbed adults. Pop-up vaccination centres in supermarkets and shopping centres should be set up so people can get their third shot while on the high street doing their Christmas shopping, the party has suggested. The shadow health secretary, Wes Streeting, is pressing the government to “pull out all the stops” to meet the prime minister’s target of having offered a booster jab to all those aged over 18 by the end of January, PA reports. Brazil has registered 53 new Covid-19 deaths, the country’s health ministry said on Saturday, bringing fatalities in the country to a total of 616,744. The country had 3,355 new cases of coronavirus over the last 24 hours, reaching a total of 22.19 million, Reuters reports. Australia has said it will shorten the wait time for people to receive Covid-19 booster vaccines following a rise in cases of the Omicron variant. It had previously said it would offer a booster to everyone over-18 and who had their second dose of the vaccine six months prior, Reuters reports. But with rising cases of the Omicron variant, Australia’s health minister, Greg Hunt, said the time interval will be shortened to five months after the second dose. “A booster dose, five or more months after the second dose, will make sure that the protection from the primary course is even stronger and longer lasting and should help prevent spread of the virus,” Hunt said in a statement. Brazil’s supreme court justice, Luis Roberto Barroso, has ruled the country must demand proof of vaccination for visitors seeking to enter the country. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied requests of state health regulator Anvisa to demand vaccination proof from visitors, Reuters reports. But Barroso said in his decision that Brazil needs to avoid supporting what he called “anti-vaccine tourism.” The justice said the requirement for proof of vaccination can be waived only when the traveller comes from a country where no vaccines are available or the individual was prevented from vaccination due to health reasons. The government has delayed for a week a regulation that would require non-vaccinated visitors to quarantine for five days due to a cyberattack on the health ministry on Friday. You can follow the latest Covid developments in Australia in our dedicated blog: Israeli researchers said they found that a three-jab course of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine provided significant protection against the Omicron variant, Reuters reports. The findings were similar to those presented by BioNTech and Pfizer earlier in the week, which were an early signal that booster shots could be key to protect against infection from the newly identified variant. The study compared the blood of 20 people who had received two vaccine doses five to six months earlier with the same number of individuals who had received a booster a month before. “People who received the second dose five or six months ago do not have any neutralisation ability against the Omicron. While they do have some against the Delta (strain),” Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit at Sheba, told reporters. The first six cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus have been detected in Turkey, health minister Fahrettin Koca was reported as saying on Saturday by state broadcaster TRT Haber. Five of the cases were in the western city of Izmir and one in Istanbul, but none of those affected needed hospital treatment, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported. Three West Indies cricketers and a member of the team management have tested positive for Covid-19 after they arrived in Pakistan for the upcoming tour. There was confusion on Saturday about which age groups in England are now eligible to book a booster jab with the NHS, after an apparent glitch allowed younger people to book before they were expected to qualify. People aged 30 and over in England were expected to be able to book a Covid-19 booster from Monday as long as it has been three months since their second vaccine dose, but many 30-somethings reported on social media that they had been able to book their appointments already. The NHS website still said on Saturday evening that “the NHS is working on plans to offer a booster dose to everyone aged 18 to 39 years old”, and that people should note that this service is not yet available to book via their portal. “Please wait to be contacted by the NHS,” a disclaimer on the website added. Almost twice the number of coronavirus patients could be admitted to hospital in England compared with last year due to the Omicron variant, new modelling suggests. Experts from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) have calculated figures which propose that a large wave of infections could occur over the next few months if tougher Covid measures are not brought in, PA reports. The study projects a median peak of 7,190 daily hospital admissions in England in the worst case scenario – which could see the variant evading vaccines at a high rate as well as low effectiveness against the variant from boosters. The most optimistic scenario (low rate of the variant evading vaccines, high effectiveness of boosters) “is projected to lead to peak daily hospital admissions around 60% as high as the peak in January 2021 in England”. This would mean a median peak of 2,410 daily admissions compared with 3,800 daily admissions in January this year, the study said. France has also reported 120,383 coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic, Reuters reports. France has reported 53,720 new coronavirus cases. The country has had more than 8.1 million cases overall. Here is more on the protests in Vienna against mandatory vaccines and confinement orders for people who are unvaccinated. Sir Jeremy Farrar, a former UK government adviser, has tweeted the following: More than half of Angola’s doctors will indefinitely continue a national strike over pay and conditions as the coronavirus pandemic strains the African nation’s depleted public health services. Angola resorted to asking China and Cuba for help to fight the first Covid-19 wave last year with more than 250 Cuban doctors arriving, AFP reports. According to 2020 figures, Angola has 5,200 doctors. The country’s national doctors’ trade union on Friday said 3,000 of its members would “continue the national doctors’ strike in all public health units” after the industrial action began at the start of the week. Tens of thousands gathered in Austria’s capital Vienna to protest mandatory Covid vaccines and home confinement orders for those who have not yet received the jabs. Police said an estimated 44,000 people attended the demonstration, the latest in a string of huge weekend protests since Austria last month became the first EU country to say it would make Covid vaccinations mandatory. A partial confinement since last month ends on Sunday for the vaccinated, but those who have not received the required doses will have to remain at home, AFP reports. The UK recorded 54,073 cases in the latest 24-hour period, bringing the total to 10,771,444. There were also 132 deaths recorded, bringing the total to 146,387. More data from Italy. Patients in hospital with Covid – not including those in intensive care – stood at 6,539 on Saturday, up from 6,483 a day earlier. There were 76 new admissions to intensive care units, the same as the previous day, Reuters reports. The total number of intensive care patients edged up to 818 from 816 on Friday, which compares with 708 a week earlier. Some 565,077 tests were carried out in the past day, compared with a previous 716,287, the health ministry said. Dozens of US Navy medics have deployed to New Mexico to treat a Delta variant-fueled surge in Covid-19 patients as part of a military operation to treat virus hotspots across western and midwest states. New Mexico is suffering one of the highest levels of new coronavirus infections in the country, its hospitals reaching record capacity levels. Nearly 50 Navy medics are treating Covid patients at the San Juan Regional Medical Center in Farmington, northwest New Mexico, where critical care patient numbers have been over 200% of capacity for weeks, Reuters reports. The speed at which scientists worked to develop the first Covid jabs was unprecedented. Just nine months after the UK went into lockdown, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan officially became the first person in the world outside a trial to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. But the virus is mutating, and the emergence of the Omicron variant last month is already focusing attention on the next generation of jabs. Italy reported 96 coronavirus-related deaths on Saturday, the health ministry said. The daily tally of new infections rose by 21,042, Reuters reports. Italy has registered 134,765 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth highest in the world. The country has reported 5.2m cases to date. Another 633 Omicron cases have been found in the UK, the biggest daily increase since the Covid-19 variant was detected last month. The latest figure, a 50% day-on-day increase, brings the total number of confirmed Omicron cases to 1,898 across the country, the UK health security agency said. In England, another 618 confirmed cases of the variant were reported, with 1,757 in total. Scotland reported 11 more cases, with 121 now confirmed. In Wales, two additional cases were reported, bringing the total to 15. A further two were confirmed in Northern Ireland, bringing the total to five. New coronavirus restrictions could be introduced in Scotland next week, the deputy first minster, John Swinney, has said. PA reports that Swinney said ministers are spending the weekend “wrestling with the challenge of what are the right rules to have in place”. But he said he does not think that Scots will face a restricted Christmas. Asked on BBC Breakfast if new Covid measures would be put in place next week, Swinney said: I can’t say definitively that will be the case, but that’s certainly been looked at over this weekend. And we have to judge what’s the best set of measures that we can take to try to interrupt the circulation of the virus. We can’t have it moving at the pace its moving at just now because the danger is that will overwhelm our public and private services. Nicola Sturgeon is due to give a statement in the Scottish parliament on Tuesday. On Friday, she told a televised press conference that Scotland faced a “tsunami” of Omicron cases. Swinney’s comments come as the latest statistics show 11 more Omicron cases have been confirmed in Scotland, taking the total to 121. There were 4,087 coronavirus cases in total reported in the last 24 hours, with 12 deaths. Asked if Scotland faced a restricted Christmas due to new Covid measures, Swinney said: I don’t think so and I hope not. And we’re working very hard just now to make sure that does not become the case. Meanwhile, a hospital ward in Inverness has been closed to new admissions due to a Covid-19 outbreak. NHS Highland said that Ward 7a at Raigmore Hospital is closed to new admissions and visiting following the detection of a small number of cases of coronavirus. Tests are establishing whether any of the cases are of the Omicron variant and the results are expected next week. The projected number of deaths and hospital admissions caused by Omicron [see 12.12pm.] in England could be “substantially” overestimated if the new variant causes less severe disease than Delta, according to an expert. Prof Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said any model was “only as good as its assumptions”, adding that one key assumption in this model is that severity of disease outcomes for Omicron is the same as for Delta. He said: Although we will not know for certain for a few weeks indications from South Africa do suggest that Omicron does cause less severe disease than Delta. There is also early as yet not peer reviewed data suggesting that although Omicron mutations are enough to escape antibody, T-cell immunity would be less compromised. It is thought that T-cell immunity is more important for reducing risk from severe disease than it is for reducing the milder nose and throat infections. If Omicron is indeed associated with less severe disease as is, in my view, likely to be the case then these models would overestimate hospital admissions and deaths, possibly substantially. Prof Hunter said he suspects these models “overstate” risk of hospital admissions and deaths and the “worst case” scenarios are “unlikely to be seen”. He added: As better data becomes available in coming weeks we can expect these models to be refined. Authorities in France want to accelerate vaccinations against the coronavirus before Christmas as infections surge and more people with Covid seek medical attention, AP reports. “People can celebrate Christmas normally, but we must respect the rules ... and get vaccinated,” the French prime minister, Jean Castex, told public radio outlet France Blue during an interview on Friday. France has registered a daily average of more than 44,000 new cases over the past week, a 36% increase from the previous week, according to the latest government figures. Weekly hospitalisations of people with Covid went up 1,120, a 41% rise. The government on Monday closed nightclubs until 6 January and tightened social distancing measures in closed spaces and outdoors. Castex said the government is not considering another lockdown that would limit or prohibit public events and social gatherings. With over 48 million of France’s 67 million people fully vaccinated and tens of thousands signing up for either their first shots or booster doses, the country could make it through the holiday season without additional restrictions on public life, the prime minister said. Health workers in France were administering 700,000 vaccine doses a day, Castex said, adding that 90% of French residents had had at least one vaccine dose. “It’s an excellent figure,” he said. The government is discussing whether to have France join other countries that have authorised vaccines for all children aged 5-11. Children under the age of 12 who are considered at risk of complications from Covid will be eligible starting 15 December. Castex, 56, tested positive for the coronavirus on 22 November. His office said at the time that he had contracted the virus from his 11-year-old daughter. He was fully vaccinated, but his daughter was too young to get jabbed. Pointing to himself as an example, the prime minister said: “So yes, vaccinating children is necessary.” Care home residents in England will be allowed only three visitors and one essential care worker under updated UK government guidance announced as part of new measures to protect the sector from the spread of the Omicron variant. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the move was “in order to balance the current Covid-19 risk and the need to keep people safe in line with clinical advice”. It is understood the guidance will come into force from Wednesday. Fully vaccinated residents visiting family and friends outside the care home will be asked to take a lateral flow test on alternate days for two weeks after each outing, while those not vaccinated will have to isolate after an outside visit. Staff testing will be increased from two lateral flow tests a week to three, alongside a weekly PCR test. The chair of the National Care Association has said new rules on care homes have “almost” taken people back to the restrictions that were in place a year ago. Nadra Ahmed said she was hoping to get clarity on several details on the new guidance, including if people could change the nominated three people to visit someone in a care home. The full story is here: Care home residents in England to be allowed only three visitors at Christmas The Omicron variant could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England over the next five months if no additional measures are taken beyond Plan B, according to scientists advising the government. New modelling from the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, who also sit on the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M) or the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), used experimental data to look at how Omicron may transmit as the country heads into 2022. Even under the most optimistic scenario (low immune escape of Omicron from vaccines and high effectiveness of booster jabs), a wave of infection is projected which could lead to a peak of more than 2,000 daily hospital admissions, with 175,000 hospital admissions and 24,700 deaths between 1 December this year and 30 April 2022. This is if no additional control measures are implemented over and above the current Plan B introduced by the government in England. The team said mask-wearing, working from home and booster jabs may not be enough, and predict a peak of daily hospital admissions of 2,400 in January. In this scenario, bringing in control measures early in 2022 – such as restrictions on indoor hospitality, the closure of some entertainment venues and restrictions on how many people can gather in one place – would be sufficient to substantially control the wave, reducing hospital admissions by 53,000 and deaths by 7,600. The most pessimistic scenario looked at by the modellers (high immune escape from vaccines and lower effectiveness of boosters) projects a wave of infection that is likely to lead to a peak in hospital admissions about twice as high as the peak seen in January 2021, if no additional control measures are taken. This could cause 492,000 hospital admissions and 74,800 deaths, according to the study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed. In this scenario, the team estimates that stronger measures may be required to keep the peak number of hospital admissions below the January 2021 peak. The scientists assumed Omicron causes the same severity of illness as Delta but did not look at the impact of measures such as mass population testing to control its spread. The paper reads: These results suggest that Omicron has the potential to cause substantial surges in cases, hospital admissions and deaths in populations with high levels of immunity, including England. The reintroduction of additional non-pharmaceutical interventions may be required to prevent hospital admissions exceeding the levels seen in England during the previous peak in winter 2020-2021. Dr Rosanna Barnard, who co-led the research, said that while there remained a lot of uncertainty over Omicron, “these early projections help guide our understanding about potential futures in a rapidly evolving situation”. She said: In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of Omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home. However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough. Nobody wants to endure another lockdown but last-resort measures may be required to protect health services if Omicron has a significant level of immune escape or otherwise increased transmissibility compared to Delta. It is crucial for decision-makers to consider the wider societal impact of these measures, not just the epidemiology. Earlier, we reported that the Treasury has defended an “impromptu” drinks party after Rishi Sunak’s autumn spending review during lockdown. A spokesperson insisted it was a “small number” of staff who celebrated around their desks, despite reports put the number closer to two dozen civil servants at the event. A team of officials working on the chancellor’s spending review announcement stayed after hours for the party on 25 November 2020, the Times reported (paywall). Government sources said the drinks were not planned but the civil servants involved bought beer and wine from a nearby supermarket. A Treasury spokesperson told the Guardian: A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the spending review 2020. We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas. Here is my colleague Tom Ambrose’s story: Treasury defends ‘impromptu’ drinks party after Sunak’s autumn budget Labour has called on the UK government to give a “Christmas vaccine guarantee” to the hundreds of thousands of eligible children in England who have been unable to receive a Covid jab. With recent figures showing that just 44% of children in the 12-15 age group had been vaccinated on 8 December, Bridget Phillipson, the shadow education secretary, said the government needed to make a bigger push to vaccinate the remainder before they returned to school in the new year. “As Omicron cases in the UK are rising, it’s essential that ministers use the Christmas holidays to get the vaccine out to children, preventing continued chaos next term,” Phillipson said. “Labour has been calling on ministers to use pop-up and walk-in clinics, and bring back volunteers and retired clinicians to increase vaccine rollout, but 13 weeks after the jab was approved [by the chief medical officers] the Conservatives have failed to deliver. “With hundreds of thousands of children out of school each week this term, the government must urgently get a grip and stop neglecting children’s education.” The government had initially aimed to offer vaccinations to all 12- to 15-year-olds by the October half-term break. But the most recent figures suggest it will struggle to vaccinate half by the end of term next week. Read the full story here: Labour demands ‘Christmas vaccine guarantee’ for pupils in England Mauritius has recorded its first two infections of the Omicron variant, with a dozen more contact cases feared, AFP reports. The health minister, Kailesh Jagutpal, told a press conference on Friday the pair were asymptomatic and had tested negative the day before. “They have already gone home,” he said. He added that contact tracing for the two people had been carried out, revealing 12 positive cases with a missing S gene – a telltale sign of Omicron. Health authorities were currently analysing the samples to determine if they are in fact Omicron. One of the two Omicron cases was detected in a man who flew home to the island from South Africa on 27 November 27. The second case was recorded in a woman in the island’s south whose husband had returned from South Africa on 18 November. Mauritius fully opened its doors to international visitors at the start of October, hoping to rebuild its vital tourism industry after long months of isolation because of the pandemic. But it was forced to reimpose restrictions last month as Delta variant cases surged. According to latest figures reported to the World Health Organization, Mauritius has had 62,652 Covid cases and 680 deaths. More than 900,000 people have been fully vaccinated, representing 73.5% of the population, government figures show. What’s the truth about lockdown-busting parties at No 10? Don’t ask Shagatha Christie, writes Marina Hyde in her column this week. Here are some extracts: There was simply no other place a Johnson government would ever end up but mired in rampant lies, chaos, negligence, financial sponging and the live evisceration of public service. To the Conservatives and media outriders somehow only now discovering this about their guy, I think we have to say: you ordered this. Now eat it. Regrettably, though, space constraints must end our recap of the week here. But on it all goes, as Omicron closes in. We’ll play out with a reminder that in a pandemic that has so far killed 146,000 of the Britons who these people are supposed to be in politics to serve, the absolutely vital public health message has now TWICE been most fatally undermined by people who worked at the very heart of No 10 with Boris Johnson. That is absolutely a disgrace, and absolutely not a coincidence. Read the full column here: I have updated my entry for 8.23am to add details of where the arrivals who tested positive for Omicron in Taiwan had travelled from. You may have to refresh the page in order to see the updated post. A year ago humanity embarked on a project to vaccinate every person against Covid-19. But in recent months a shadow vaccination campaign has also been taking place. From giraffes to snow leopards, gorillas to sea lions, zoos around the world have been inoculating their animals with an experimental Covid vaccine as an insurance policy against what they fear could be a similarly fatal illness for certain mammals. Meanwhile, veterinary scientists have been scrambling to understand the scale of Covid-19 infection in our furry household companions, and what the consequences could be for their health – and our own. Last week two hippos at Antwerp zoo in Belgium became the latest in a coterie of creatures to contract Covid from humans. Fortunately, Imani and Hermien had no symptoms apart from runny noses, but other animals haven’t been so fortunate. In November three snow leopards died from Covid-related complications at a children’s zoo in Nebraska. Other zoos have reported infections in gorillas, lions, tigers and cougars. Although Sars-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in an animal, most likely a bat, until recently most of the scientific focus has, understandably, been on human cases of disease. Yet ever since the early days of the pandemic, scientists have worried about the possibility of other animal infections. “We’ve always recognised that coronaviruses have this tremendous capacity to jump species. So it was always predicted that there would be a variety of domestic animals, livestock and potentially wildlife that could be infected,” said Margaret Hosie, a professor of comparative virology at the University of Glasgow’s Centre for Virus Research. If other animals can become infected and transmit the virus, this could put pressure on it to adapt and acquire new mutations, raising the prospect of new variants that could be transmitted back to people. “You could be concentrating on eradicating the virus in humans, but meanwhile the virus could be mutating away quietly in an animal species, and getting hotter and hotter,” Hosie said. Read the full story here: From hippos to hamsters: how Covid is affecting creatures great and small Where did Omicron come from? By all accounts it is a weird variant. Though highly mutated, it descended not from one of the other variants of concern, such as Alpha, Beta or Delta, but from coronavirus that was circulating maybe 18 months ago. So where has it been all this time? And why is it only wreaking havoc now? Researchers are exploring a number of hunches. One is that Omicron arose in a remote region of southern Africa but failed to spread until now. Another is that it evolved in infected animals, such as rats, and then crossed back into humans. But a third explanation is gaining ground as more data come to light, that Omicron arose in a person with a weakened immune system: someone having cancer treatment perhaps, an organ transplant patient or someone with uncontrolled HIV. The latter possibility has sparked global concern. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to two-thirds of the global population living with HIV. For a whole series of reasons, ranging from lack of access to clinics to fear of stigmatisation and disrupted healthcare, 8 million people in the region are not on effective HIV therapy. Beyond the direct problems this causes with disease progression and vulnerability to Covid – people with advanced or uncontrolled HIV are far more likely to die from coronavirus – is the risk that uncontrolled HIV is driving the emergence of Covid variants. “For me there are two key things,” says Dr Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban, who was part of the team that first reported Omicron. “First there is the science that needs to go on to get a better understanding of this. But more importantly, on a public health level, we don’t need to wait for the science. It is a reminder that while addressing the immediate challenge of Covid-19, we also need to intensify efforts to end HIV as a public health problem.” Read the full analysis of why HIV prevention could be key to stopping coronavirus here: As Omicron cases are on the increase and a new wave threatens to overshadow Christmas in the UK, the scientists working on Covid are also making calculations about which of their own festivities to go ahead with and which to scale back. Hannah Devlin and Nicola Davis spoke to them about how they will navigate the festive season: Omicron is spreading so fast in the UK that people are “very likely” to meet someone infected with the variant unless they are “living the life of a hermit”, Eleanor Riley, a professor of immunology and infectious disease, said this morning. The University of Edinburgh academic also warned “a lot of people” could still end up in hospital even if the coronavirus mutation proves to provoke milder symptoms than the Delta variant. Prof Riley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Omicron is spreading so quickly that, I think, unless you are living the life of a hermit, you are very likely to come across it in the next few weeks. I don’t think anyone should be going around thinking they are not going to catch it, I think that situation has changed. She added: There is a huge ‘if’ about this, ‘is it milder?’. I think it is very dangerous to compare data from South Africa, say, to the UK. Even if it is milder and, therefore, a smaller proportion of infected people end up in hospital, given that so many people are going to come across this virus, even a small proportion of a lot of people is a lot of people in hospital. Some Treasury staff who worked on the autumn spending review last year had office drinks while England was in lockdown, The Times reports (paywall). It comes after more than a week of controversy over allegations of rule-breaking festivities in Downing Street in the run-up to last Christmas. The Times reports that about two dozen civil servants were present for the drinks on 25 November 2020. A Treasury spokesman said: A number of HMT staff came into the office to work on the spending review 2020. We have been made aware that a small number of staff had impromptu drinks around their desks after the event. The Treasury did not organise an in-person departmental party last Christmas. At the time non-essential shops, leisure and entertainment venues were closed as well as pubs, bars and restaurants, and people were urged to stay at home except for limited reasons including work if it could not be done from home. The Times said the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, was not at the event and that it is understood he was not aware of it at the time. On Friday, Downing Street said it has cancelled any plans to hold a Christmas party this year. It came as Boris Johnson’s ex-aide Dominic Cummings said there were “lots” of photos of parties in No 10 that would “inevitably get out”. Cummings dismissed defences from the prime minister’s allies that he would not have known about celebrations going on under his roof amid signs Johnson’s popularity is slumping. The government chief whip, Mark Spencer, insisted Downing Street staff “were not drinking alcohol” and partying during Covid restrictions after it emerged the prime minister’s press chief addressed staff at one event last Christmas. No 10 said Johnson retained full confidence in Jack Doyle to serve as communications director despite ITV reporting he addressed up to 50 people and made a speech at one party on 18 December. Read more: Boris Johnson pressed to say if there were parties in his flat during lockdowns Taiwan’s government said on Saturday that it had detected the island’s first cases of the Omicron variant, found in three people who had arrived from abroad. The Central Epidemic Command Centre said the infections were detected in travellers from the UK, Eswatini and the US. Like all entrants, they were tested on arrival and already subject to two weeks of quarantine. A booster dose means the risk of symptomatic infection with the Omicron variant is “significantly reduced”, according to health officials who have urged all those eligible to make sure they get their third jab. It comes as the experts warned Omicron could become the dominant variant in the UK by mid-December, with the communities secretary, Michael Gove, saying everything is being kept “under review” in terms of measures to tackle the spread. Analysis by the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found that the AstraZeneca and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines provided “much lower” levels of protection against symptomatic infection with Omicron compared to Delta. But the preliminary data, which looked at 581 people with confirmed Omicron, suggested effectiveness seemed to “increase considerably” in the early period after a booster dose, giving about 70-75% protection against symptomatic infection. The findings come as daily Covid cases reached their highest level in almost a year and the UKHSA predicted that, if current trends continue, the UK will exceed 1 million infections by the end of the month. Read more: Two jabs offer little protection against Omicron infection, UK data shows Gove warned of a “deeply concerning situation” after holding a Cobra meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the latest data and the co-ordinated response across the four nations. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at the UKHSA, said while their early data should be treated with caution, it indicated that “a few months after the second jab, there is a greater risk of catching the Omicron variant compared to Delta strain”. She added: The data suggest this risk is significantly reduced following a booster vaccine, so I urge everyone to take up their booster when eligible. Speaking to broadcasters, Gove said the Omicron variant is doubling every two to three days in England “and possibly even faster in Scotland”. He added that 30% of reported cases in London were the new variant, and warned that evidence suggested Omicron was “more likely” than past Covid variants to “potentially” lead to hospital admissions among the fully vaccinated. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, earlier warned of the possibility of a “tsunami of infections” from the new variant – and said she could not rule out more restrictions north of the border as a result. But No 10 maintained that there were “no plans” to go further with measures in England, amid reports that proposals are being drawn up for a “Plan C” featuring even tougher rules. Gove said the current approach being taken was “proportionate”, but acknowledged that “we absolutely do need to keep everything under review”. He said: Action is absolutely required and, as new data comes in, we will consider what action we do require to take in the face of that data. The Guardian reported that the health secretary, Sajid Javid, had been given a presentation from the UKHSA earlier this week warning that even if Omicron leads to less serious disease than Delta, it still risks overwhelming the NHS with 5,000 people admitted to hospital a day. It said the leaked advice said “stringent action” would be needed on or before December 18 if the variant’s doubling time stays at 2.5 days, although what such restrictions might entail were not set out other than to say measures that would bring the R number – representing the average number of people each Covid-positive person goes on to infect – below 1.

He said such a figure could be reached “sometime in January” but added that it was based on assumptions around the variant’s ability to get around existing protection, and the premise that it is similar to Delta in terms of the severity of disease it causes – something that is not yet known.

          "bodyText": "Pre-Covid, when international travel was still common, many Kiwi travellers received a similar question wherever they happened to be around the globe: Jacinda Ardern, is she the real deal? The New Zealand prime minister’s devotion to a new breed of politics, one rooted in “kindness”, “compassion” and “cooperation” often seemed too saccharine to be true, especially at a time when a series of notorious bullies were voted into positions of power around the globe. I usually answered this question brusquely, with a combination of facts and personal anecdotes from my interviews with the PM. I was interested, but not that interested, more enthralled by the dramatic twists and turns of foreign lands, where politics seemed Shakespearean compared with the warm, cosy bath of New Zealand’s Labour coalition government, now in its second term and astoundingly popular. A record number of babies in the house, cradled by the speaker as their mothers and fathers delivered important speeches? Cute, nice, a sweet Friday news story. Freezes on politicians’ pay during Covid? Feel-good, sure. An indication of a truly new breed of politician, and a truly new way of governing? I wasn’t convinced. Earlier this year, I shifted back to my native land of Australia, and settled in the Kimberley, still the country of cowboys and red rocks I remembered from my childhood. Immediately, the absolute dysfunction of the state-federal relationship struck me, as did the absurdity of mini prime ministers individually vying for votes and cash and sway. I asked around and read around, but could find no one who could explain to me why the state system worked or should continue as a mode of governance. Instead of the national unity so desperately needed in the midst of a global pandemic, personal fiefdoms ruled. Even a national speed limit couldn’t be agreed upon. As the year wore on, punctuated by a bungled vaccine rollout and a prime minister who was tone-deaf to the mounting cries of millions of fed-up Australian women, the drama of Australian politics began to seem far less entertaining and far more concerning than when I had observed it from afar. While sledging is a national disgrace when it happens on the cricket pitch, in Canberra it’s par for the course, so bad now that even growling like a dog at your “opponent” can occur. And “opponent” is mostly how Australian politicians seem to view each other – shrill, power-hungry egos vying for domination, while transformative legislative change languishes, such as the recent climate change embarrassment at Cop26. Leaving the temperate bath that is New Zealand politics made me realise how conducive that bath was to getting things done. There is a genuine level of cooperation and – don’t be shocked here – politeness that courses through government house in Wellington and extends to how the governing party and the opposition treat each other. Sure, there is some sledging, but it is more of the quick-barb style, rather than the truly, disturbingly nasty. “I’ve never particularly done things differently depending on who the person is and that’s probably a good thing, given there’s been five,” said a cheeky Ardern last week, poking fun at the opposition’s five leaders during her time as prime minister. One, Todd Muller, experienced a mental breakdown during his tenure. Politicians on every side of the house expressed genuine empathy and concern for his welfare, and his painful experience became an opportunity, eventually, for further mental health awareness and discussion, rather than cannon fodder or public shaming. New Zealand is much too small for true divisiveness among its leaders, much as people in small towns are to some degree forced to get along, decade after decade, despite their often myriad differences. Much of the credit goes to Ardern, who has created a working environment that rewards focus and dedication. Indeed, despite her robust sense of humour, Ardern is a deeply serious politician, one who joined the Labour party aged 17, motivated by a desire to “end child poverty”. The politicians Ardern chooses to promote are so thoroughly earnest and scandal-free (think Grant Robertson and Nanaia Mahuta) that the culture has become one of genuine public service. She even makes her ministers carpool in a minivan to events, scrapping the isolation and pomp of ministerial cars. This is a small gesture but it communicates volumes about her values and style of governing. Politics is far from perfect in New Zealand, and like in Australia, there have been internal sex scandals, disappointing housing reforms and complaints from the media about fair access. But the general atmosphere is one of a sincere interest in improving the lives of New Zealanders. This makes sense, because politicians in New Zealand remain, well, New Zealanders. Most aren’t personally wealthy or drawn from the corporate ranks (the new leader of the opposition National party, Christopher Luxon, is an exception) and most remain strongly embedded within their communities and family life. There is a Wellington bubble, but it’s far more humble and down to earth than its Canberra equivalent. Last week, a Green party MP cycled herself to the hospital to give birth – for the second time. Last month the prime minister was interrupted doing a Facebook live event by her daughter Neve, sneaking out of bed while her mother was trying to address the nation. These glimpses of humanity aren’t orchestrated set pieces, they happen spontaneously and on a regular basis in the course of New Zealand’s politicians living ordinary human lives. I can’t be sure but I’d put some money on Ardern’s daughter being sent to her local state primary school when it’s time. Anything else would grate against her mum’s entrenched value system, and display a schism between personal and political beliefs that in four years of leadership has so far failed to emerge. In this climate, world-leading legislation has been enacted in New Zealand, including a new law to protect pill testing, legalised assisted dying, a record increase in funding to women’s refuge and domestic violence services, moves to tackle climate change and a world-leading tobacco reform (aiming to make the country smoke-free by 2025). In Australia power often seems a goal in and of itself. It is a goal that then stymies genuine legislative reform or collaboration, much to the detriment of all Australians, who can only be feeling confused and disappointed by the year that’s been, so marked by animosity and empty showmanship. In the New Zealand model there is something to learn. Sure, the beehive lacks the fireworks of Canberra and sometimes a bit of sparkle. The finance minister is mostly interested in surpluses (and rugby) and the foreign minister’s style of diplomacy is disarmingly gentle. The climate change minister is a greenie from way back. But in the hands of these – to quote the words of Ardern – “nerds” a backbone and steadiness to political life has developed, allowing nascent transformative change to begin. And oh so needed in the current global environment, a deep and reassuring sense of calm."

          "bodyText": "Eight refugees – held by Australia’s offshore immigration regime for more than eight years – have landed in Vancouver and Toronto, sponsored by community groups in Canada and Australia to begin new lives on the other side of the world. The eight flew out of the Papua New Guinea capital Port Moresby on Thursday, joining another former Manus detainee who arrived in Canada a week ago. Abdo had been medevaced from PNG to Australia before being accepted for resettlement in Canada. “I have mixed feelings about starting this new life in Canada,” Abdo says. “It was hard leaving my friends in Australia. I wish I could have stayed. “Thank you for all [the] people that made it possible for me to become a permanent resident of Canada, I am looking forward to a bright new future. To all my Aussie friends, come [for a] visit.” The nine have been accepted for resettlement under Canada’s Private Sponsorship of Refugees scheme, which allows community groups to privately sponsor refugees to resettle in Canada, in addition to the government’s own humanitarian resettlement quotas. The scheme, which has been running for more than 40 years, has allowed more than 300,000 refugees to restart their lives in Canada. Six of the eight refugees who landed in Canada on Saturday (Australian time) were resettled through Operation #NotForgotten, a community sponsorship partnership between the Refugee Council of Australia, the Vancouver-based migrant and refugee settlement service Mosaic, and volunteer network Ads Up Canada. The other two have been sponsored by community volunteers supported by Ads Up Canada. The eight left PNG just three weeks ahead of Australia formally ending its eight-year offshore immigration regime in PNG. More than 100 people remain held there by Australia. Abdo – the Guardian is choosing only to publish his first name – was incarcerated on Manus Island, medevaced to Australia suffering acute medical issues, and then granted a temporary visa to live in the Australian community while awaiting resettlement. He landed in Vancouver on 6 December. Those resettled are the first of an expected steady stream of Canadian resettlements from within Australia’s offshore immigration system. Another four refugees currently held by Australia will arrive in Canada over the next month. Travel arrangements for a further three newly approved applicants is currently being arranged. Australians and Canadians working together The Refugee Council chief executive, Paul Power, says the resettlement of refugees from within Australia’s onshore and offshore immigration detention systems is the result of “ordinary people in Australia and Canada working together to find a solution for refugees who needed the opportunity to get on with the rest of their lives after years of mistreatment by the Australian government”. “These eight people sought sanctuary in Australia after escaping oppression in their homelands, as was confirmed when their refugee status was assessed,” he says. “Instead of being helped by Australia, they were put into detention under appalling conditions and have spent years not knowing what the future held for them and their families.” Australians have donated more than $3.8m to Operation #NotForgotten through the Refugee Council. Mosaic and Ads Up Canada have lodged sponsorship applications with the Canadian government and organised volunteer groups to support refugees after arrival. Since November 2019, applications for 156 refugees – in PNG, Australia and Nauru – and 125 separated family members have been lodged through Operation #NotForgotten. “Australians concerned about the mistreatment of the refugees sent to PNG and Nauru are very grateful to the people and government of Canada for providing a welcome and a new home for people who need the opportunity to live in freedom and start again,” Power said. Iris Challoner, the manager of Mosaic’s private sponsorship program, says the private sponsorship program is transformative, both for refugees beginning lives in new countries and the communities they are welcomed into. “Our team is privileged and honoured to have gotten to know so many Australians that are a force for better and take a stand for human rights. Ordinary Australians have made this unique collaboration possible; they saw suffering and found solutions where they could. This is what makes Operation #NotForgotten unique: it is a true collaboration of civic society across continents.” ‘A team of people who become family’ The Australian government has, for several years, speculated about implementing a scheme based on Canada’s model, which has been resettling refugees since 1979. In Canada, private sponsors, which are often community, humanitarian or faith groups, commit to providing income support for refugees for the first year after arrival. Currently, it costs the equivalent of A$21,500 to sponsor a single refugee, or A$36,500 for a family of five. Other countries have adopted the model. In October, the US, after decades of only government-sponsored resettlement, announced a Sponsor Circle Program for Afghans, specifically to assist with the resettlement of more than 50,000 Afghans currently being housed in military bases across the US, some of those who made it onto flights out of Kabul as the country fell to the Taliban. Ireland, the UK and New Zealand have committed to or established similar schemes. Australia’s Community Support Program was launched in 2017 as a pilot program, set at 1,000 places to be drawn from within Australia’s humanitarian migration program. Crucially, it was not additional to the government’s resettlement programs – every place sponsored by a community group would subtract one from the government number. Australia’s pilot – as the government’s own reviews have conceded – is riven with systemic flaws. The Australian program is: small, limited to just 1,000 places a year; expensive, more than three times the cost of comparable schemes overseas, costing about $100,000 to sponsor a family of five, with an application fee alone of $19,000; restrictive – available only to refugees between 18 and 50 who have functional English and a job offer in Australia or skills that make them “job ready”, and critically, not additional: any refugee sponsored by the community subtracts by one from the government’s resettlement commitment. The Department of Home Affairs’ own review of its existing Community Support Program this year found it was structurally flawed, and ineffective in resettling significant numbers of refugees. The review, by the commonwealth coordinator-general for migrant services, Alison Larkins, said while the CSP was “well-intentioned” it was: prohibitively expensive; not additional to the existing government humanitarian program (which has been reduced to 13,750 and was less than half-filled last year); and consistently under-subscribed because it failed to “harness broader community goodwill and support”. The findings, presented to the government in May, said “community organisations generally report being unwilling to engage in (and bear high financial costs for) sponsorship without it generating places in addition to the current humanitarian intake”. In a speech last year, Larkins said international evidence demonstrated “governments alone can’t make the difference”. “In Canada, you can directly see the importance of community in creating economic participation for refugees through their community sponsorship model,” she said. “Seventy per cent of privately sponsored refugees in Canada declared employment earnings within their first year of arrival compared to 40% of government assisted refugees.” Australia’s immigration minister, Alex Hawke, has previously said he was a “strong supporter of the community support program”. A spokesperson for the home affairs department said the government was “currently considering the findings of the review and anticipates being able to offer a further update soon”. “The government looks forward to ensuring Australia’s Community Support Program becomes a genuine, successful partnership between community, business and the government, to provide beneficial outcomes to our refugee and humanitarian arrivals in Australia.” Challoner says the nature of Canada’s private sponsorship program “sets people up for success”. “Sponsors commit to 12 months of sponsorship support. As a result, privately sponsored refugees arrive with a built-in social support system. They have a safe and clean place to live, and a team of people who become family, supporting all aspects of their settlement experience. “Done right, private refugee sponsorship can change attitudes across the world about refugees, re-unify families that are separated … It enables ordinary citizens to truly make a difference … to be the change they want to see.”"

          "headline": "Why Elon Musk will be remembered as an automotive pioneer",
          "bodyText": "As I write, Tesla, the manufacturer of electric vehicles (EVs), has a market capitalisation of $1.051tn, which makes it the world’s sixth most valuable company by market cap. Tesla shares are trading at $1,047, which is 64% higher than at this time last year. Elon Musk, the founder and CEO of the company, currently has a net worth estimated at $300bn, which makes him the richest person in the world. Enormous wealth, like power, acts as an aphrodisiac that warps people’s perceptions of those who possess it: it’s as if they’re surrounded by a reality distortion field. Similar force fields have enveloped Bill Gates and Steve Jobs in their time and now it’s Musk’s turn. Because he’s uncommonly voluble on social media, especially on Twitter, where he has 65.7 million followers, his every utterance is assiduously parsed by besotted fans (all of whom call him “Elon”, as if he were a buddy of theirs). This gives him an influence way beyond that of any other corporate executive, influence that, on some occasions, even affects global financial markets through what the normally sober Financial Times calls the “Tesla-financial complex”. A closer examination of his Twitter feed, though, yields an impression of a really complex individual: a baffling combination of formidable intelligence and ungovernability – part visionary, part genius, part fruitcake and part exploiter of tax loopholes and public subsidies. And it raises the question: what (or where) is the real Elon Musk? The answer, I suspect, lies in his mastery of the business of manufacturing complex products. One sees it, for example, in the way SpaceX, the aerospace company he set up to reduce the colossal costs of space travel, has become the first non-state organisation to: successfully launch, orbit and recover a spacecraft; send a spacecraft to the International Space Station; manage the first vertical takeoff and vertical landing for an orbital rocket; and send astronauts to the International Space Station. Anyone who thinks this stuff is easy has never done it. Compared to SpaceX, you’d have thought that the business of manufacturing electric cars would be child’s play, especially since, compared to vehicles powered by internal combustion engines, they’re considerably simpler. (Basically, an EV is like a massive skateboard where the huge battery is the board.) Even so, when Tesla started making them in 2008, the world (not to mention Ford, General Motors, BMW, Mercedes, VW and Toyota) sniggered, which, oddly enough, reminded this columnist of the way Nokia and Motorola sniggered in 2007 at the idea of Apple making a mobile phone. The story is the same in the case of the car. Tesla did eventually figure out how to make them – making bodyshells out of aluminium and then kitting them out with all the stuff that goes into a vehicle using a combination of robots and humans – and now its Model 3 is emerging as the bestselling new car in a number of markets. But it turns out that, just as with Apple and the smartphone, mastering the art of conventional manufacturing was just the beginning. Some time ago, Musk seemed to have had an epiphany, perhaps triggered by a conversation with a grizzled veteran of car manufacturing named Sandy Munro, who allegedly likened the rear end of a Tesla shell during manufacture to a patchwork quilt. Why, Musk mused, couldn’t the entire bodyshell be die-cast in one piece from molten aluminium, just as reproduction toy cars are? You can guess where this is heading. Tesla bought a number of colossal press-casting machines – inevitably christened “Giga Presses” – from Idra, the Italian company that makes them. And they are now deployed in some Tesla factories turning out the rear half of Model Y bodyshells as single pressure-moulded pieces. Suddenly, a task that required 70 different parts to be assembled by 300 robots is being done by a single giant machine. The obvious next step is to use the same process to make the complete bodyshell in one fell swoop. This step – and the huge investment needed to implement it – suggests a new way of thinking about Musk: as the spiritual heir of Henry Ford. Since the early days of the car, there have only been three major paradigm shifts in the manufacturing process. The first was Ford’s introduction of a moving production line, memorably satirised in Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times, which could turn out a completed Model T in 90 minutes. The second paradigm shift came from Toyota in the postwar years – the famous “lean” production method that involved minimising inventories and arranging supply chains for just-in-time delivery of components that arrived just before they were needed at the relevant stage in the manufacturing process. Although invented in Japan, and initially ignored by the US car industry, in the end every car has been made the Toyota way. Lastly, the arrival of the Giga Press and the thinking behind it is what suggests that, in the end, Musk might be remembered not so much as the oddball who dreamed of colonising Mars (or possibly expired thereon), but as the guy who found a new way of making terrestrial vehicles. He will doubtless be frustrated by this thought, but – hey! – that’s a price the rest of us might be prepared to bear. What I’ve been reading Words of wisdom How to Fix Social Media is a long, thoughtful and historically informed essay by Nicholas Carr in the New Atlantis. Woolf at the door The Work of Living Goes On: Rereading Mrs Dalloway During an Endless Pandemic is a lovely essay by Colin Dickey on the dystopian undercurrents in Virginia Woolf’s famous novel and its echoes in our attempts to “move on” from Covid. On the bright side… Why Humans Aren’t the Worst (Despite, Well, Everything Happening in the World) is the title of an intriguing interview with the journalist and historian Rutger Bregman by Kara Swisher."

          "bodyText": "Omicron could cause between 25,000 and 75,000 deaths in England over the next five months without tougher Covid restrictions, experts have told the government. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) also warned that Omicron, first discovered in southern Africa, is likely to be the dominant coronavirus variant by the end of the month. Even in the most optimistic scenario, projected infections could lead to a peak of more than 2,000 daily hospital admissions, with a total of 175,000 hospital admissions and 24,700 deaths between 1 December and 30 April. The scientists, who advise the government as part of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) and the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (Spi-M), used experimental data to look at how the transmission of Omicron might develop as the country heads into 2022 without more stringent restrictions beyond Boris Johnson’s “plan B”. Another 633 Omicron cases were recorded in the UK on Saturday, marking the largest daily increase since the variant was detected. It brings the total number of confirmed Omicron cases to 1,898, according to the UK Health Security Agency. Overall, a further 54,073 new Covid cases were reported on Saturday with 132 deaths. Dr Nick Davies, from LSHTM’s Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, who co-led the research, said on Saturday: “These are early estimates, but they do suggest that, overall, Omicron is outcompeting Delta rapidly by evading vaccines to a substantial degree. “If current trends continue, then Omicron may represent half of UK cases by the end of December.” They also found that booster jabs provided additional protection against Omicron, with a higher uptake likely to reduce the number of infections, hospital admissions and deaths. Bringing in additional control measures early next year beyond plan B, such as restrictions on indoor hospitality, the closure of some entertainment venues and restrictions on how many people can gather in one place, would reduce hospital admissions by 53,000 and deaths by 7,600, scientists predict. Dr Rosanna Barnard from LSHTM’s Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases, added: “In our most optimistic scenario, the impact of Omicron in the early part of 2022 would be reduced with mild control measures such as working from home. “However, our most pessimistic scenario suggests that we may have to endure more stringent restrictions to ensure the NHS is not overwhelmed. Mask-wearing, social distancing and booster jabs are vital, but may not be enough. “Nobody wants to endure another lockdown, but last-resort measures may be required to protect health services if Omicron has a significant level of immune escape or otherwise increased transmissibility compared to Delta.” However, Prof Paul Hunter, of the University of East Anglia, said any model was “only as good as its assumptions”, adding that one key assumption here was that severity of disease outcomes for Omicron was the same as for Delta. “Although we will not know for certain for a few weeks, indications from South Africa do suggest that Omicron does cause less severe disease than Delta,” he said. He added: “If Omicron is indeed associated with less severe disease – as is, in my view, likely to be the case – then these models would overestimate hospital admissions and deaths, possibly substantially. “As better data becomes available in the coming weeks, we can expect these models to be refined.” Prof Eleanor Riley, from the University of Edinburgh, said earlier on Saturday that Omicron was spreading so fast that people were “very likely” to meet someone infected with the Covid variant unless they were “living the life of a hermit”. Riley also warned that “a lot of people” could still end up in hospital even if Omicron is found to provoke milder symptoms than the Delta variant. Riley told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “Omicron is spreading so quickly that, I think, unless you are living the life of a hermit, you are very likely to come across it in the next few weeks. “I don’t think anyone should be going around thinking they are not going to catch it. I think that situation has changed.” A spokesperson for the government said it continued to look closely at all of the emerging data, adding: “Plan B remains a proportionate response based upon what we know, so we encourage everyone to follow the rules by wearing a face covering, working from home if you can, testing regularly and coming forward for your booster when called.”"

          "bodyText": "On Sunday, Clapton Community FC will become the first seventh-tier side to compete in the third round of the Women’s FA Cup when they travel south to play Plymouth Argyle. By beating Hounslow 3-1 on penalties, the Greater London Premier League club became the first to beat a side from four tiers higher in the competition. But instead of being rewarded for their success or handed the funds to further support the London club’s impressive development, Clapton have found themselves out of pocket. The huge discrepancy in prize money dished out to teams competing in the men’s and women’s FA Cups means they will earn just £1,250 should they win, contrasting starkly with the £82,000 offered to men’s teams at the same stage. “We’re reaping the benefits of the Women’s Super League being successful,” says Alice Nutman, the club’s captain. “But if you have that success at the top it means that is going to have a knock-on impact lower down. We’re going to see increased numbers of girls and young people playing football, and if we don’t have investment at that stage, if we don’t have viable options for them to go into the game, then investing in the top is pointless. Top-down development, trickle-down economics, we know they don’t work, and the same is true in football.” Nutman adds: “We’re not asking for equal pay. That’s a myth. We’re asking for investment in grassroots and we’re asking for spaces in which women and non-binary people are able to play football, which currently do not exist. “Unfortunately, when the FA is the body that banned women’s football for a 50-year period, you then need to do things to reverse that and, at the moment, that’s not happening. For anyone tier three and below that money makes a huge difference. “It means that you’re not living hand to mouth each month. We struggle to pay for our training pitch. That’s the reality of playing grassroots football in this country as a woman.” Set up in 2018 by fans and players unhappy with the direction of Clapton FC, Clapton Community FC is fan-owned and pioneering a different way of doing things. For supporters who have fallen out of love with the commercialism of the game, clubs such as Clapton offer something different and Nutman believes breaking the mould is what women’s football should try to do more often. “That’s the next step for women’s football, to not try and fit the same model. We’re not able to fit the same model because we didn’t play for such a long period of time [due to the ban]. So it’s about how can we get to the same level of eliteness and the same level of engagement in a better way.” Having the ideological engagement in what the club are doing has been vital during their extraordinary FA Cup run. A broad and active fanbase believes in Clapton’s success off the pitch as much as on it. “The positives of us being a fan-owned club means that lots of [the financial difficulties caused by FA Cup progress] have been hidden from the players,” Nutman says. “There’s been lots of squirrelling away behind the scenes in order to get the cheapest possible transport, in order to get some accommodation. That’s organised by people who own and have a hand in the club. Teams who are higher up are in very similar situations, they also don’t have the funding from the FA that is going to make this possible.” To meet the soaring costs, by being drawn away in each round, Clapton set up a crowdfunding appeal which exceeded the £3,000 target in two days and is now more than £4,000. “We’re so very, very grateful for everyone,” says Sophia Axelsson, who plays and also leads on financial strategy for the women’s first team. “But it’s also come at a very, very tricky time for us because we’ve also started a fundraiser to build changing rooms at our ground, which we don’t have. Had we been the men, we would have been able to build these changing rooms already with the success that we’ve had. But because we’re women, we have to do fundraisers for literally everything that we do within the club.” Against Hounslow, with the score at 0-0 at the break, belief suddenly filtered through the team. “We didn’t know, before we played the game, that it would be the first time a team had ever done it,” Nutman says. “And I’m glad we didn’t, because that would have added to how nervous we were feeling. “In a similar way to going into this weekend against Plymouth, it looks like something that shouldn’t happen. It looks like something that we shouldn’t be capable of. But the FA Cup means we’re playing 90 minutes, anything could happen. That’s why football is so glorious.” Should they beat Plymouth, the fourth round could see them drawn against a WSL side. “The thought of getting through is us being able to live out the dreams that we had when we were 20 years younger than we are now. Most of the squad are in our 30s,” says Nutman. Axelsson adds: “I would lie if I said that some of our players hadn’t already dreamt about it. Having a home tie against Arsenal and having their team bus rock up at our community changing rooms in Walthamstow would be pretty incredible. “We’d love to continue this journey that we’re on, this adventure, we’re making memories for life. We’re very proud of where we’ve gotten so far. If we could go even further that would just mean the world.”"

          "bodyText": "Isaac West was searching for a moment of authenticity. He had known Sudanese models Juor and Odur for a few years; both live in the US, as does he. Their brief was to portray a moment of tenderness between a couple. “You’re caring for your girlfriend by cutting her hair,” was West’s direction for Juor, who had the razor switched on. The Liberian photographer adds: “He messed up her hair a bit – he’s a model, not a barber! Luckily, Odur had a real appointment in the diary, so she didn’t mind.” For the International Center of Photography exhibition Inward: Reflections on Interiority, West had been tasked with exploring the introspective using an iPhone. This shot was inspired by his new relationship with his girlfriend, Naima. Clearly a true romantic, he is also a fan of minimalism (“People try too hard to do too much,” he says) and vibrant colours (“I chose the yellow cloth because I wanted the dark skin to bounce off it”). “I love shooting dark-skinned models,” West says. “The secret is in the editing. Most people don’t know how to shoot or edit dark skin – they don’t get the tone right. I want to see contrast, rawness and richness. “People get in touch to say thank you. They say, ‘I used to hate my hair and skin. Now I see myself differently.’”"

          "bodyText": "“I’m still pinching myself that my dad, my own flesh and blood, had Ernie on one hand and Bert on the other,” Eli Attie says. “It is like he got to sit at Abbey Road studios and watch the Beatles record I Want to Hold Your Hand.” Attie’s father was the photographer David Attie who, in 1970, visited the set of Sesame Street in New York City during its first season. His images lay forgotten in a wardrobe for the next 50 years, until Eli recently discovered them, leading to them being gathered together for a new book. They are a glimpse behind the curtain of a cultural phenomenon waiting to happen. Here are not only Bert and Ernie but Kermit, Big Bird, Oscar the Grouch with his original orange fur (he was green by season two). And here are the people who brought these characters to life, chiefly Jim Henson and Frank Oz, the Lennon and McCartney of Muppetdom. What also stands out in Attie’s images are the children visiting the set. As in the show itself, they are clearly so beguiled by the puppets, they completely ignore the humans controlling them. Eli himself was one of those visitors, although he has no memory of it. “I was in diapers, and as the story goes, I was loud and not to be quieted down, and was yanked off the set,” he says. His parents and older brother Oliver at least made it into the photos. Oliver was even in an episode of the show, in the background in Hooper’s Store, Eli explains, with just a hint of jealousy. Above: Bert and Ernie with puppeteers Daniel Seagren, Jim Henson and Frank Oz Left: Cast member Bob McGrath, an actor and musician, in a segment called The People in Your Neighborhood. Right: Henson (left) and Oz – the Lennon and McCartney of Muppetdom – operate puppets for a sketch titled Hunt for Happiness Fifty-two years and more than 4,500 episodes later, Sesame Street remains the premier address in children’s entertainment. It is still watched by hundreds of millions around the world, and broadcast in more than 140 countries. One attempt to statistically measure the show’s impact on American society failed because nobody could find a large enough sample group who hadn’t watched it. Sesame Street’s place in US culture was bizarrely underlined last month when Big Bird announced on Twitter: “I got the Covid-19 vaccine today! My wing is feeling a little sore, but it’ll give my body an extra protective boost that keeps me and others healthy.” He was promoting the rollout of vaccinations to five- to 11-year-olds, but Big Bird’s tweet, combined with Sesame Street’s recent introduction of a new Korean American muppet, has prompted a conservative backlash. Texas senator Ted Cruz responded: “Government propaganda … for your 5 year old!” Cruz later doubled down, tweeting a cartoon of the Sesame Street characters sitting around the Thanksgiving dinner table, with a dead, cooked Big Bird in place of a turkey. Others piled in. The influential Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) expressly banned Big Bird and other Sesame Street characters from its next conference, and CPAC organiser Matt Schlapp called for PBS, which broadcasts the show (although new episodes now air on HBO Max), to be defunded. “They just won’t stop in their push for woke politics,” he complained. Arizona state senator Wendy Rogers went even further, declaring: “Big Bird is a communist.” * * * Beyond the optics of beating up on universally beloved children’s characters, in the context of David Attie’s images, these takes could hardly be more wrong. Attie had been commissioned to photograph Sesame Street by Amerika, a Russian-language magazine funded by the US state department and distributed in the Soviet Union. Essentially, it was a cold war propaganda project. Soviet officials would regularly return copies of Amerika to the US embassy unsold, saying their citizens were not interested. In truth, the magazine was so sought after, it became a black-market commodity, explains Eli Attie. “One embassy official said to me they had traded two copies of Amerika for these impossible-to-find ballet tickets in Moscow at the time,” he says. So Sesame Street was used as government propaganda, just not in the way Cruz and Rogers might imagine. The choice of a New York street scene was a radical move in children’s TV in the 60s. You could say that Sesame Street had a political mission from the outset, as the new documentary, Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street (to which Attie’s book is a companion piece), lays out. One of the show’s co-founders, the broadcaster Joan Ganz Cooney, was involved “intellectually and spiritually” with the civil rights movement. The other, psychologist Lloyd Morrisett, was concerned about a widening education gap in the 1960s US, which was leaving behind socioeconomically deprived children, particularly African Americans. These children were often spending long hours at home watching television while their parents were busy working. Instead of jingles for beer commercials, Cooney and Morrisett reasoned, why not use television to teach them literacy and numeracy? Above: Big Bird with actors Loretta Long and Matt Robinson, AKA husband and wife duo Susan and Gordon. Below: According to Big Bird’s operator Caroll Spinney, his ‘sometimes sad, very complex character’ gave the show its depth. * * * With an $8m federal grant, the newly formed Children’s Television Workshop spent two years researching how to make content that would not only be educational but entertaining. That’s where The Muppet Workshop came in (even if the hippy-ish Henson was initially distrusted by his more academic colleagues). Not to mention the songs, the anarchic comedy sketches, the surreal animations, and the improvised child-with-muppet segments. The whole thing was an experiment. Nothing like it had been done before and there was no guarantee it would be a success, but everyone seemed to be on the same page. As Cooney puts it in the documentary: “We weren’t so worried about reaching middle-class children but we really, really wanted to reach inner-city kids badly. It was hardly worth doing if it didn’t reach them.” This explains why the show was set on an ordinary New York street – a radical move for children’s TV, a familiar place for the target audience. Equally radically, the show was multicultural and inclusive from the start, with white, Black and Latino actors alongside non-human characters of all colours. Even the title sequence and the guests reflected the US’s diversity (the first season featured James Earl Jones, BB King, Mahalia Jackson and Jackie Robinson). As the long-running writer and director Jon Stone said of the show’s inclusive approach: “We’ve never beaten that horse to death by talking about it; we simply show it.” Muppet designer and performer Caroly Wilcox goes to work with Henson. Sesame Street has taught kids about all manner of life topics. Not only racism (most recently with the introduction of two new African American characters, post-Black Lives Matter) but also poverty, addiction, autism, HIV and Aids, public health (Covid was not Big Bird’s first jab, he also got a measles vaccination in 1972), and gentrification (in 1994, the street was under threat of demolition from a loud-mouthed property tycoon named “Ronald Grump”, played by Joe Pesci). Sesame Street has even tackled the concept of death: when Will Lee, who played storekeeper Mr Hooper, died in 1982, the show featured a wrenching segment in which neighbours, clearly tearfully, explain to Big Bird that Mr Hooper is dead and is never coming back. Spinney, who played Big Bird for almost 50 years until his death in 2019, jokes with children on set. It wasn’t just “inner-city kids” Sesame Street was popular with. While his father was working, Eli Attie’s artist mother would also put him and his brother in front of the TV to watch it so she could paint. “There was a block of hours that it was on public broadcasting stations in the New York region. So she just thought: ‘Hallelujah. I can place them here, they’re entertained,’” he says. “We were learning to count, we were learning to spell and we were learning a kind of comedy: we both became fans of Monty Python and standup comedy and I’m sure this was the gateway.” Attie went on to become a TV writer and producer, working on shows such as The West Wing, House and Billions. Above: Filming on set of Sesame Street. Below: Henson with the Dentist and the Bus Driver from the song The People in Your Neighborhood, which was about different occupations. Sesame Street’s inclusive, humane, progressive agenda has always had its enemies. Mississippi broadcasters refused to air the first season back in 1969 on account of the show’s desegregated setting (they backed down after a few weeks). In the past decade, the conservative chorus of disapproval has been getting louder. Before Cruz and co, the show and PBS have been targeted by the likes of Mitt Romney, Fox News, and, inevitably, Donald Trump. “Sesame has never been a political show; it has been a very socially relevant show,” says Trevor Crafts, producer of the Street Gang documentary. Although the political climate today has echoes of the 1960s, when Sesame Street was created, he feels. “It was a very similar time. There was a lot of social unrest, and here we are again. It just shows that you need something like Sesame Street to sort of increase the volume of good in the world. And also to know that through creativity, you can make change. Positive change can occur if you’re willing to see a problem and try to fix it and do it creatively.” Spinney with Oscar the Grouch. Henson had wanted Oscar to be magenta, but television cameras couldn’t process the shade. In season two, Oscar became green. Long gets a peek into Oscar’s trashcan. Now in her 80s, she went on to be one of the longest-serving members of the original cast. Where some might see a political agenda, many more would simply see a model for the kind of society the US would like to be. “I think it showed everybody: ‘This is who we should be in our hearts,’” Eli Attie says. “It was utopian. It was optimistic, it was challenging and smart. And it didn’t talk down to children.” As well as a family album, his father’s photos capture that spirit of playful idealism. “I see now that’s part of who I am,” he says. “And it’s part of who we all are.” • The Unseen Photos of Street Gang: How We Got to Sesame Street by Trevor Crafts, with photographs by David Attie, is published by Abrams on 23 December at £28.99.

          "bodyText": "When The Matrix asks us all to take the red pill again on 22 December, Carrie-Anne Moss, 54, will return to the role that made her famous. Moss first played Trinity, a motorbike-riding, badass, PVC-clad hacker, in 1999, and despite the character not surviving the original trilogy, she is back, along with her co-star Keanu Reeves, for the fourth instalment, The Matrix Resurrections, directed by Lana Wachowski, this time without her sister Lilly. Moss, who was born in Canada, started her career as a model and had several small parts on television and in films before The Matrix struck gold. She played Marvel’s first on-screen lesbian character, Jeri Hogarth, in the Netflix series Jessica Jones, and away from the acting world, she runs a “labour of love” lifestyle site called Annapurna Living. She lives with her husband and three children in the countryside in California, which means she does not see the current trend for Matrix-inspired fashion such as big stompy boots and tiny sunglasses out on the streets. Was returning to the world of The Matrix a tough decision? Oh, no. I was absolutely over-the-moon excited about the prospect. It was something that I never imagined happening. People had mentioned it to me in passing, and I was always thinking: ‘No way. Never gonna happen.’ There are obvious reasons for that, the main one being that Trinity dies in the third film. When myself, Lana, Keanu and a few others sat together to read it for the first time, I was thinking: ‘What is this going to be like? How is she going to do this?’ It’s something that I never imagined, and I was really blown away. The Matrix came out in 1999, but it has been a near-constant part of the cultural conversation ever since. How does it feel to have been such a big part of that? It’s interesting. I’m definitely honoured to be in a film that made such an impact, and I’m deeply respectful of the part that I play in that story. I also have my own personal life that doesn’t include any of that, and so I don’t really feel the cultural impact. At the same time, when I do feel the weight of it, I’m moved that I got chosen to be that part of this film, and what it means to people, and I don’t take that lightly. It’s not just some job I did. When I did the first Matrix, it seemed to really impact women a lot. Women would come up to me, women directors, and stuntwomen, and they would thank me for opening this door or that. So I hold it with a lot of reverence, and a lot of deep respect. I respect this character more than any character that I’ve ever played. I chose not to play similar characters. I didn’t want to give Lana and Lilly’s hard work and beautiful artistry to any other film-maker. Were you offered roles like Trinity a lot? It did happen, and then it was just really clear. I think it didn’t even get past anybody to get to me because I was just like: I’m not going to do that. I think a lot of people interpreted it as that I didn’t want to stereotype myself, and it had nothing to do with stereotypes. It only had to do with my respect for the film-makers, and the film, and I didn’t want to sell that out. It was a no-brainer. I’m grateful now, coming around full circle to it, and getting to be in it again. There’s a real purity about it for me. What do you think those women were thanking you for? I don’t know. When I did the first film, I was super-young; I didn’t really understand all the different things that were happening, it was just such a whirlwind. When I saw the movie I was overwhelmed by it. I’d never seen myself in that way on a big screen. One of the things that I love about Trinity has to do with the gaze of thefilm-makers. It’s Lana, and how she shoots. She loves Trinity so much. I can really appreciate it, in hindsight. I didn’t feel that she was overly sexualised, and I don’t think they would have picked me anyway if they were looking for that. I am grateful, in Hollywood terms, that it wasn’t taken in that direction. I watched an interview you did around the release of the first Matrix, and you talked about trying to shoot a scene in heels, which was a problem for you. I checked the trailer for Resurrections, and Trinity appears to be wearing flat-soled boots. Is that progress? In the first one, there was one scene where they had me in a kind of a stiletto, and I couldn’t do the scene. I had auditioned with that scene, and then suddenly there we are on the day shooting it, and I was unsteady. It was the whole thing in the nightclub, where I’m whispering in the guy’s ear, and I’m supposed to be really grounded and strong, and yet I could barely stand straight. And so they took those off and gave me a boot with a nice solid heel. Well, footwear matters. Yeah. I’m a clog girl, personally. What did you have to do to get back into Trinity mode? A lot of the preparation was physical training. I had weight to lose, I had strength to gain, I had fights to learn, I had big scenes to mentally prepare for. For months leading up to it, it was a lot of physical work, to get into Trinity in a way that wasn’t me trying to be someone I used to be, and not trying to be 30, or trying to have the body I had when I was 30, and at the same time, being gentle with myself about that, too. When I had babies, I gained weight, and it took me years to come back into my body that I felt strong and comfortable in. I wonder if it’s less of a big deal than it was to have female action heroes in their 40s, 50s and 60s? It’s been normal for male actors for a long time, but I think fewer people would bat an eyelid about women doing those sorts of parts now. I haven’t really thought too deeply about it. Except that for my own personal journey, I didn’t want to add any desperation on to myself, because in a way, I would feel like I was doing all the women my age, who were 30 [once], a disservice. This feeling that I have about Trinity is that it’s not just about me, and I take that to heart. If suddenly I show up and I’m like … I don’t even know what that would look like, but let’s be real, seeing yourself on screen is not easy. It wasn’t easy when I was 30, either. But what I do feel happy about in seeing the movie is that I didn’t really even think about it. How much truth is there to the rumour that Keanu Reeves is the nicest man in the movie business? Ha ha! He’s a very kind person, and he’s so good at what he does. He is very committed and disciplined. And he works harder than anyone I’ve ever met. It was a pure pleasure to get to partner with him again, in this way. It was as if no time had passed. We all have those friends where you can just pick up right where you left off. He’s a great listener. It’s really lovely to be around a man who listens in the way that he does. He’s very thoughtful in his listening. He deserves all of that good press about his compassion and kindness. You said you made a decision not to play characters like Trinity, but there has been a thread of authority running through your characters recently. You were a doctor in Humans, a lawyer in Jessica Jones … Well, I think the common denominator is who’s playing them. They do all look like you. It was interesting to me that [Jeri Hogarth in Jessica Jones] was originally a guy. The character was written as a man, and when I talked to them about it, I didn’t want them to change it too much. I liked this idea that she had this stereotypical male kind of energy. That was quite fun to play. Actually, I really enjoyed doing that. It was my first [big] job after I had children. When I got that job, and I went to New York, it was as if I had walked into an entirely new world, with technology, and all of this stuff. I couldn’t even order a coffee! It was really a culture shock. Krysten Ritter, my co-star, I was always asking her things, she was helping me put Uber on my phone, little things, but New York was a real learning curve for me. It was quite jarring. I was quite comfortable at home, so I was stepping out of my comfort zone. You don’t seem like a very Hollywood person to me. I’ve never really been interested in any of that. I never went to any Hollywood stuff, premieres or events or whatever, unless it was something that I was part of, or I was supporting a friend. Sometimes in the beginning, my team would say: ‘Maybe she’d go to that thing.’ And I’d be like: ‘I don’t want to have to get dressed and figure out what to wear, and I don’t know how to do my makeup, and I don’t know how to do my hair.’ And I’m OK that I don’t know how to do that stuff. I would rather be at home with my family any day. I’ve worked really hard to have this connected family life, and that means a lot to me. It’s not because it’s perfect or easy, but it’s where I belong, in my heart. When I leave to go to work, I ultimately always love it, because you’re forced to get out of your comfort zone. It’s so healthy. But when I come home, I love my simple life. The Matrix: Resurrections is in UK cinemas from 22 December."

          "headline": "Fears half of poorer pupils in England could be barred from university",
          "bodyText": "Nearly half of all disadvantaged pupils in England could be prevented from going to university under government plans for a minimum GCSE entry level for higher education, university leaders are warning. Vice-chancellors believe that the government is poised to introduce a new entry threshold for a place on university courses as a means of reining in its rising student loan debt, with outstanding loans reaching £140bn last year. They are expecting the government to announce that students will not be eligible for a student loan unless they have at least a level 4 (the equivalent of an old grade C) in maths and English at GCSE. An analysis of Department for Education (DfE) GCSE results data conducted by the Million Plus group of modern universities and given to the Guardian shows that under the plan, 48% of all disadvantaged students in England would be ineligible for a student loan to pay the £9,250-a-year fees. Prof Rama Thirunamachandran, chair of Million Plus and vice-chancellor of Canterbury Christ Church University, said: “This policy entrenches inequality between rich and poor, north and south and black and white. It is introducing an 11-plus type system by the back door.” The government’s figures show that 52% of disadvantaged young people get grade 4 in English and maths GCSE compared with the national average of 71%. “So you are almost saying to a generation of disadvantaged kids: ‘You can’t get a student loan,’” said Thirunamachandran. “That is embedding inequality, not levelling up.” Million Plus analysed GCSE results in maths and English by parliamentary constituency and found the policy would hit young people in poorer areas of northern England far harder than in wealthier areas in the south. Under the proposed threshold, for instance, 54% of pupils in Great Grimsby would be ineligible for a student loan, as would 50% in Leeds Central, 49% in Bootle, Knowsley and Nottingham North, and 47% in Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough. In contrast, in the south only 12% of pupils would be excluded in Hitchin and Harpenden, 14% in St Albans, and 15% in London and Westminster, Chipping Barnet, and Richmond Park. Thirunamachandran, said: “The question is, if you are a parent in one of these less privileged regions in the north, will you simply accept that your child doesn’t have the same right to go to university as someone in a more privileged place in the south? That’s the political gamble the government is taking.” It is thought that the government believes many voters would consider it reasonable to expect students to have a good level of numeracy and literacy, making the idea a politically safe way to reduce student numbers. Claire Callender, professor of higher education at Birkbeck University and University College London’s Institute of Education, said: “This is a cap on student numbers through the back door – but not a cap on all potential students, just the most disadvantaged and those most affected by Covid.” She argued that a minimum entry level requirement signalled “an abandonment of any government concern about widening HE participation and nurturing social mobility” and said it would “cement existing social divides amongst young people at a time when they are widening rather than narrowing”. Sir David Bell, a former permanent secretary in the DfE and now vice-chancellor of Sunderland University, said the entry threshold would be seen as “a cap on aspiration”. “Politicians and policymakers always underestimate that really deeply felt aspiration to get to university,” he said. “They often falsely assume that people in a city like Sunderland just don’t want to go, but it’s simply not the case.” In its interim response to the Augar review of post-18 education in January the government said: “We are currently too skewed towards degrees above all else.” And last year the universities minister, Michelle Donelan, accused universities of “taking advantage” of disadvantaged students by mis-selling them dumbed-down courses that left them saddled with debt. Bell said the idea that universities are interested only in “piling students in” like “cash cows” was “offensive and unfair”. “We genuinely want them to succeed,” he added. “It is universities like ours that do the majority of the heavy lifting on social mobility.” He said universities such as his were very experienced in making nuanced decisions about applicants’ potential, and whether they would cope with a degree course. Sunderland takes a high proportion of mature students, many of whom do not have traditional qualifications and would be excluded under the proposed new system. Lee Elliot Major, professor of social mobility at the University of Exeter, who is leading a research project on how to help those who leave school without basic literacy or numeracy, said: “This is effectively closing off university prospects at age three for many poorer children. Our research shows the depressingly strong link between achieving poorly in early-age tests and failing to get passes in English and maths GCSEs at age 16.” Children from the lowest fifth of family income backgrounds are five times more likely to leave school without passes in English and maths GCSEs than those from the highest fifth of incomes, his research shows. “This move exposes the fundamental flaw at the heart of our education system: we already label a third of pupils taking English and maths GCSEs as failures – this will only condemn them further,” Elliot Major said. Academic staff at modern universities also say courses such as paramedicine, nursing and social care would all lose students under the proposed model, just as England is experiencing staff shortages in these professions. Dr Signy Henderson, dean for student success at Cumbria University, said its paramedic science degree would suffer. “We all know how desperately the country needs more well-qualified paramedics,” she said. “We often have learners who have real potential, but who went to schools where they say no one pushed them, or grew up in homes where no one understood the value of good GCSEs.” The DfE said it would not comment on speculation about discussions around minimum grade requirements and possible exemptions, which it said were ongoing. However, a spokesperson said: “This is a government that has boosted aspirations and grown opportunities for disadvantaged people across the country, and this year a record proportion of disadvantaged students has started university as a result. We are committed to continuing to level up opportunity.” He added: “But we also want to make getting on as important as getting in, which is why last month we asked universities to reboot their widening access plans with ambitious targets to support students both before and during their time at university, by reducing dropout rates and improving progression into high-paid, high-skilled jobs for disadvantaged students.”"

          "bodyText": "When Karen Elson was a young hopeful trying to make it in Paris, a model scout took her to a nightclub. After long days on the Métro trekking to castings that came to nothing, and evenings alone in a run-down apartment, she was excited to be out having fun. The music was good and the scout, to whom her agent had introduced her, kept the drinks coming. She started to feel tipsy. A friend of the scout’s arrived, and the pair started massaging her shoulders, making sexual suggestions. “I was 16 and I’d never kissed a boy,” she recalls. “It was my first experience of sexual – well, sexual anything, and this was sexual harassment. They both had their hands on me.” She told them she wanted to go home, and left to find a taxi, but they followed her into it, kissing her neck on the back seat. When they reached her street, she jumped out, slammed the taxi door and ran inside. The next day she told another model what had happened, and the scout found out. “His reaction was to corner me in the model agency and say: ‘I’ll fucking get you kicked out of Paris if you ever fucking say anything ever again.’” Twenty-six years later, Elson is telling me this story from her sixth-floor suite in the Ritz hotel in London. The scout did not get her kicked out of Paris. She got booked for a shoot in Tokyo by an up-and-coming young American designer called Marc Jacobs, then Donatella Versace hired her as a fitting model to help her fine-tune her clothing. On Elson’s 18th birthday, Steven Meisel photographed her for the cover of Italian Vogue, her strawberry blond hair chopped into a Louise Brooks bob and tinted crimson, her pale skin exaggerated to alabaster, and a career as a supermodel began. Karl Lagerfeld called her “the beauty of the new millennium” and she is still going strong. At Paris fashion week this autumn, she walked in the Balmain show between Milla Jovovich and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy; in Milan, she was on stage alongside Kate Moss and Gigi Hadid for a collaboration between Italian powerhouses Fendi and Versace. Today, the trappings of success are all around. A vast bouquet sits in its cellophane, a plate of fanned sliced fruit is untouched on the desk. But Elson takes a sip from a bone china teacup and tells me that the legacy of her 25 years at the top of the modelling game is “a shit ton of PTSD”. Her distinctive Elizabethan colouring is still radiant against black cashmere, her complexion still peachy and wrinkle-free (more of which later), but her verdict on fashion lands with a punch. “Modelling looks like it’s all glamour, and it really is not,” she says. “I survived sexual harassment, body shaming and bullying. And I am supposedly one of the lucky ones.” Not long after that night in Paris, Elson was living in Milan, signed to “an agency run by women who gave it to me straight: ‘Do not go to clubs, because the men who take models to clubs are sleazy and you will be in danger.’” Some of the girls in Elson’s apartment were not so lucky. “I remember one waking up with bruises on her neck. We were all horrified. They were young models, full of hopes and dreams, and the people who were supposed to be their guardians were preying on them. The agents had prestige names on their books, girls who were in Vogue and getting big campaigns, but they also had young models they went to nightclubs with.” Models who are earning little money are given free drinks in clubs, sometimes taken to fancy restaurants, in return for being arm candy. “Sometimes there is a fine line between modelling and escort work, and the girls don’t realise it. I’m not shaming them for that.” Last year, a Guardian investigation by Lucy Osborne revealed decades of alleged abuse by former Elite Models boss Gérald Marie. This summer, the model Carré Otis filed a suit against Marie – who denies all allegations against him – for rape and sex trafficking, abuse she claims began when she was 17. Elson, who has led calls to reform the model agency system, booking most of her own shoots for the past four years, immediately offered her support. “We need to figure out why the fashion industry enables so much toxicity and [we need to] finally make positive changes,” she wrote on Instagram. For a time, Elson was also represented by Marie. “My impression was he was a sleazy man,” she says, speaking publicly about him for the first time. “But I never had anything happen with him. To be blunt, I don’t think I was … well, that I was a bit odd-looking and ginger granted me some protection. Not always, but sometimes.” Elson has seen how a toxic blend of international travel, lack of transparency and an unequal power structure can shade modelling into trafficking. In March, she began running “model mentor” workshops online, giving advice to young people in the industry. A young eastern European woman at one session told Elson her passport had been confiscated when she tried to leave an agency. “I was like: withholding your passport, that’s human trafficking. And her agency was also telling her she’d get kicked out of the country if she left.” In 2001, the Victoria’s Secret televised lingerie show was in its pomp, with 12 million viewers tuning in. Rupert Everett was the host; Mary J Blige performed that year’s inescapable hit, Family Affair. It was a high-profile, lucrative job, but Elson recalls “walking out and seeing a bunch of lecherous men in the audience. I could smell the misogyny. I didn’t feel beautiful, I felt ridiculous. I felt like someone else’s fantasy of a redhead, in a red G-string and devil horns, or whatever the fuck I was wearing.” Later, I look up the pictures. Elson is in a red G-string and corset, though no devil horns. Most of the other models toss their ringlets and flash toothy grins; Elson, half hidden under long straight hair, looks stone-faced. “I felt sad the whole time I was doing it,” she says. Elson has never been a cookie-cutter beauty queen. Growing up in Oldham, “with frizzy red hair and ghost-white skin and no boobs” at a time when every teenage boy she knew had a poster of Cindy Crawford on his wall, she kept her early modelling ambitions quiet. After signing to Boss Models in Manchester, she left school early every Thursday to go there, claiming she was off to see the orthodontist. The day after she finished her GCSEs in June 1995, she caught the train to London, dragging her suitcase straight to the office of Models 1. Photographer Tim Walker’s Vogue portraits of Elson have featured her in bed with a giant crocodile, or in white tuxedo trousers with braces and no blouse. He met Elson and fellow model Erin O’Connor for the first time in 1997 and thought they didn’t look like models: “They looked like people I knew, art college friends.” With her marble skin, flaming hair and fine bone structure, Elson can look “androgynous and ethereal, so I wasn’t so much the sexualised object,” she says. But being pigeonholed as otherworldly came with its own issues. “I was put in this box where I was a freak, and as a result it was as if I wasn’t real. I wasn’t supposed to have feelings.” Having reached the supermodel ranks, she experienced a kind of impostor syndrome. “I just wanted so badly to fit in. I wanted to be Claudia Schiffer and instead I felt like the red-headed stepchild.” Despite Elson’s slender frame, through much of her career she has been bullied over her weight by people in the industry. A well-known Italian designer once described her, to her face, as “a beast” and “disgusting”. A US model agent offered to pay her money for every pound she could lose. Once, in desperation to get work, she booked into a “health spa” in California where she fasted for seven days. She flew straight to Milan for fashion week (“looking skeletal”) and the compliments – and bookings – flooded in. Just before our interview, Elson texts to say she is about to order room service, asking if I want anything. When her lunch arrives, she ignores the food, saying she feels too self-conscious to eat during the interview. (It is under a silver dome, but I think it’s a salad.) Clumsily, I comment on her “self-control”, to which she replies with a wry smile that “self-control is my achilles heel”. *** Eating disorders have plagued her since she was seven when, unsettled by her parents’ increasingly unhappy marriage, she stopped eating and was admitted to hospital. “Food has always been attached to trauma for me,” she says. “And then I went into an industry that played into my biggest insecurities.” With the help of “a great therapist, who used to be a ballerina and understands body dysmorphia”, Elson has reached a “safety zone”. “I sincerely do eat these days. I will never do another diet as long as I live because they make me feel like I’m losing my mind, but if I’m on set and a dress doesn’t fit, it’s really hard not to go to that place where you start thinking, if I was 12lb skinnier … I’m not going to do anything drastic any more, but the thoughts still appear. I run really fast four times a week and, yes, I love it mentally, but I also love how it makes me look, and it’s important to be candid about that. It’s a rollercoaster for me still.” Her therapist would like her to give up modelling, she says. Behind the lip service to diversity, fashion’s obsession with thinness persists. “I looked at photos from a catwalk show recently and the models were so, so thin. Not the kind of thin you get by going for a healthy jog in the morning – the kind you get when you stop eating. I find it heartbreaking to see that still.” Recently, someone in the industry greeted her with: “You’ve lost so much weight in your face, you look great!” she recalls. “I said to him, ‘You know, “Hello, how are you?” would be nicer.’” But there have been good times, too. She danced for Alexander McQueen’s landmark Deliverance show in 2004 and this year starred in a mini-musical for Moschino. When she feels a connection with a photographer on set, being a model is like being “lightning in a bottle”, she says. In her memoir The Red Flame: a Journey of a Woman, she writes about her breakthrough shoot with Meisel. “We shot for two glorious hours. I had never felt more excited. I left the studio to go back into the snow with only a single subway token, but I had never felt so joyful.” But while her unique looks caught the eye of the most creative photographers, being stereotyped as edgy often meant being expected to take her clothes off. “I would suddenly be given a see-through dress, or a pair of knickers and no top, and told: ‘That’s the image.’ My opinion didn’t come into it,” Elson says. Sometimes the results were poetic, beautiful images of which she is proud – her memoir includes nude portraits by Walker, Peter Lindbergh, Mert and Marcus – but there are other images she dislikes because she felt uncomfortable on set. These days, she has learned to set out boundaries. “If someone wants to take a nude, they have to explain the context, why it’s necessary and how they intend to ensure I feel safe and comfortable.” She laughs. “Funnily enough, no one ever asks me to be nude any more.” Because our society struggles to distinguish what a woman looks like from who a woman is, models have become ciphers for femininity. Debate about them is charged because it is never just about models, but about the institutionalised misogyny of a world where the female experience can feel like a never-ending beauty contest in which even the winners are shortchanged. “Power is so elusive as a model. Even as a supermodel, it doesn’t feel like you really own your power,” Elson says. Her words remind me of a point made by Emily Ratajkowski in her essay collection My Body – that exploitation is inevitable in “a value system that revolves around men and their desire”. Elson is encouraged “by Emily taking control of her own voice, the way other people have taken control of her image”. Yet when she describes Ratajkowski in person, Elson’s articulate, crisp sentences dissolve into breathlessness. She was “blown by how beautiful, how ridiculously beautiful, she is. It’s like … how is your stomach so flat? How is that even possible? Everything about her is just … And God Created Woman, you know?” Everyone, it seems, is conditioned to objectify Ratajkowski-level beauty, even supermodels campaigning against objectification. There is a fractiousness in the conversation around models that model and labour activist Sara Ziff, founder of the Model Alliance, has termed the “empathy gap”. Ziff argues that the job’s ultra-glamorous image does a disservice to most models by giving the impression that anyone with their picture in a magazine is flying first class with suitcases stuffed with cash. “The biggest misconception about modelling is the money,” Elson says. “Most working models are barely getting by.” Elson’s father was a joiner in construction; her mother stayed at home, occasionally taking odd jobs to make ends meet. Elson and her twin sister, Kate, shared a bed held up by tin cans. She has rarely known the luxury of not worrying about money. Because her off-kilter looks tended to appeal more to editorial clients than to commercial ones, her income has been erratic. “I’d get home from a shoot and once all the expenses were added up, I’d be in debt.” For a prestigious magazine, a 20-hour shoot might pay a flat fee of only £150, “and if you’re flying yourself somewhere, the debts can rack up”. A lack of financial transparency is symptomatic of the way models “are made into powerless, passive entities in their own industry, rather than treated as professionals”, she says. “The agents’ attitude was always – you’re just a pretty face, get out there and milk it until the wrinkles arrive, then you’ll be carted back to your home town.” Elson says she would ask an agent how much she’d be paid for a job and “practically hear the eye roll over the phone – here she goes again, being difficult”. Now she is represented by a talent agent and a publicist: “I’m never signing with another model agency as long as I live.” In 2005, Elson, ghostly in white tulle and teetering on her heels, starred in a music video for Blue Orchid by the White Stripes. Within a few weeks, she and frontman Jack White had eloped to the Amazon rainforest where they were married by a shaman. They divorced in 2013. Her memoir makes no mention of the restraining order she took out against him that year, saying only that “eventually the dust settled” and the two are now “loving co-parents” to their children Scarlett, 15, and Henry, 14. Having long harboured musical ambitions, Elson released her first album as a singer-songwriter, The Ghost Who Walks, in 2010, followed by Double Roses seven years later. Her music – a gothic kind of blues, part folksy Americana, part Left Bank chanteuse – has won over sceptics of the “model marries rock star, makes record” narrative. (“Ethereal pop majesty with a mesmerising talent,” wrote this paper in 2017.) An EP of covers recorded during lockdown, Radio Redhead, will be followed next year by a third album, Green. Yet music, Elson has discovered, can be as misogynistic as fashion. “In fashion, the misogyny is more superficial – the men don’t necessarily want to sleep with me, they want to objectify me in a picture. In music there are still powerful straight white men who operate under the myth of the tortured genius. There have been men who said they believed in my talent and then it turned out they wanted to sleep with me. It was humiliating.” We are living in the era of supermodel reparations. Paulina Porizkova and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy have joined Elson in offering support to Carré Otis. Linda Evangelista, who has posted about being “permanently deformed” by complications after a cosmetic procedure on her face, is “a good friend. It is so difficult to be a supermodel getting older and have what you looked like 20 years ago held up as a comparison the whole time. I’ve had two kids, and to walk on set and be given an outfit that would work on a 17-year-old is hard.” Evangelista speaking out “is really brave because it goes against decades of conditioning to be the beautiful face and stay silent”. At 42, Elson’s own face is wrinkle-free. “I have had Botox, and I like it,” she says. “I haven’t done filler yet, but I probably will.” She kneads her sculpted cheekbones with manicured nails, miming an imaginary lift. She’d love to champion natural beauty, she says, but she isn’t going to pretend she’s not “feeling the pressure. Let’s just talk about it, you know? The cloak-and-dagger around Botox isn’t helpful, because not admitting to it perpetuates images that aren’t realistic.” Elson’s next appointment has arrived – a film crew, pacing the corridor outside – and she still hasn’t had a chance to eat her salad. She promises she will call to say goodbye properly, and a few days later is on the phone from Nashville, Tennessee. The city is home, she says, because, years ago, “my husband Jack and I fell in love with Nashville and bought a house here, kind of impulsively. Two kids later, I looked around and I was like – huh, I guess I live in this town now,” she laughs. “Having kids taught me boundaries, and Nashville gave me an escape from fashion. The realness to life here is such a blessing.” To her kids and her neighbours, she isn’t a supermodel; she is “a dorky British woman, sitting here on my bed with a cup of tea, my big tom cat Fergus on my lap.” She has come a long way from Paris, in every sense. “You know what’s really messed up about fashion? The moments when I was totally exhausted and fragile were when people loved me most. It was like, she’s major! But at the expense of my health and my sanity. And I got to a point where I thought, I’m a grown fucking woman, you know? I’ve got two kids. I’m a good mother. I don’t want to be a broken doll any more.” • In March, Elson will appear in a Sky Documentaries series, telling the story of sexual exploitation in the modelling industry. Building on an investigation by journalist Lucy Osborne, first published in the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, it will be produced by Wonderhood Studios and the Guardian."

          "headline": "Zopa exits peer-to-peer lending to focus on banking",
          "bodyText": "It once hoped to make banks a thing of the past by cutting them out of the equation, but now Zopa is shutting down its “peer-to-peer” (P2P) lending arm after 16 years – so it can concentrate on being a bank. The company has contacted its 60,000 existing P2P investors to let them know that it will be handing them back their money – leaving them to find a new home for their cash at a time of ultra-low savings rates. P2P platforms bypass the banks by linking savers looking for a better return with individuals or small businesses looking for loans. Until recently, billions of pounds were tied up with Zopa and its competitors. However, the coronavirus crisis and increased scrutiny from regulators such as the Financial Conduct Authority – which has dubbed P2P a “high-risk investment” – have caused huge turmoil for the industry and led to some players quitting the market. When it launched in 2005, Zopa (it stands for “zone of possible agreement”) was hailed as a radical online financial “exchange” allowing millions of ordinary people to borrow from and lend money to each other. Its aim was to leave “faceless corporations” out in the cold, claiming it could offer consumers better rates of interest than they could get from banks. But in recent years, with some of the shine coming off the P2P sector after the collapse of some smaller players, Zopa has adapted its business model to embrace what it initially stood against. It was granted a full UK banking licence in June 2020 and now offers products such as credit cards, personal loans, fixed-rate savings accounts and car finance. Zopa is closing the P2P side of the business with immediate effect and will be buying its investors’ loans at their current face value, without any of the fees that they would normally incur for a loan sale. This means they will receive back the money they have invested with the site, plus any interest that borrowers have paid up to the date of sale. Everyone should get their money back by 31 January 2022. All of the loans are being bought at face value, including those currently in arrears. There will be no impact on borrowers as Zopa’s banking arm already services them. The company told customers: “Sadly, over the last few years, customer trust in P2P investing has been damaged by a small number of businesses whose approach led to material losses for customers investing in those platforms. Linked to this, the changing regulation in the sector has made it challenging to grow and remain commercially viable.” For some investors, Zopa has been a key part of their portfolio. The company says that since launch, the average return has been 5%, and that even during the pandemic it was able to deliver an average of 3.9%. That compares with the 1.37% to 1.75% it was this week offering those who put their cash into its fixed-rate savings accounts, which involve tying up your money for between one and five years. Those who want to stick with peer-to-peer will find that there are limited options. RateSetter, formerly the UK’s biggest P2P site, shut down the investment side of its business in April, while the other former big player, Funding Circle, now concentrates on small business loans. However, there are still a number of platforms open for business. One of the better-known players is Lending Works, which was this week saying people could earn projected returns of up to 4.5%. Some P2P sites – in many cases ones that most people will not have heard of – are offering up to 12%. These include the P2P property loans platform Blend."

Important goal, and we were in the game, and it’s with VAR there’s a wait to celebrate. I felt I was in a good position. We keep fighting and keep believing, we can turn it around. We want to finish as high as possible so the top half is a good start. BM: The main taker is missing and I am hoping to score. You have to believe in yourself. The socials are in. Telling it like it is, nothing more. Brentford up to ninth, and Watford’s capitulation an early Christmas present for Burnley, Newcastle and Norwich. The team who wanted it more won it, though they needed William Troost-Ekong’s meltdown at the end to seal the win. Watford had looked dangerous and then tried to hang on for a clean sheet, an odd strategy considering they haven’t kept on all season. Cue Hey Jude. 90+7 min: Can Watford stop the steal? No, they have offered so little after their goal. And Brentford have won it! Straight from the Toney playbook. A stutter step, a delay and he slots home. Bachmann goes the wrong way. Surely the winner. Oh my. Norgaard to Ghoddos. And Ekong clatters him down! No Ivan Toney to take it. 90+3 min: Claudio not impressed on the touchline. His team ran out of gas. Brentford have all the energy. 90+1 min: Watford make a late change. Off goes Dennis. 90 min: Five minutes added on, and Onyeka booked for a Fernandinho/Busquets tactical foul when Watford threatened to escape. 89 min: Brentford the more likely now. Watford are pinned back. Joao Pedro has to hack the ball off the line. That Claudio change seems to have been fatal. Cleverley is not the world’s best player but he links midfield and attack. That was lost. And so might this game be. 87 min: Bachmann went to the ground when someone from Brentford tried to get the ball off him to kick off again. The replays made him look a bit of a wally. No clean sheet for Watford. Janelt cuts it in, and Jansson nods in, and Femenia plays him onside. There’s a lengthy VAR delay. Bachmann goes down hurt, though not in the fashion of David De Gea the other week. 83 min: Watford closing in on a first clean sheet of the season. It couldn’t happen here, could it? Onyeka scampers to the left wing, but the ball is cleared away. Just. 81 min: Brentford need to find that final pass, that cool finish. Both disciplines looks a little beyond them at the moment. On the touchline you can hear the squawks of Thomas Frank. Josh King hurdles a flying challenge by Ghoddos, and the Brentford sub is booked for his troubles. 79 min: Those subs have briefly sapped the momentum that had built up for Brentford. Sissoko is getting back to help out. 76 min: Changes for both teams. Watford introduce Ken Sema on for Cucho Hernandes. Off goes Rico Henry for Onyeka for Brentford. 73 min: Brentford’s final ball is letting them down, but Josh King concedes a handy free-kick. Sissoko whacks it clear. Bachmann is forced to make a low save as Brentford ratchet up the pressure. Then Bachmann comes out again and almost makes a mess. Somehow that ends up in a Watford break. The ball goes from Dennis to King, but the shot is unconvincing. Chances at both ends. Good stuff now. 71 min: Jensen is booked for what briefly looked a last-man foul on Sissoko but there were others on the scene. Cucho Hernandez takes and lands his shot somewhere near the slip road for Didcot Parkway. 69 min: Double change for the Bees. Ghoddos on, Jenson off. Forss on, Wissa off. 68 min: Yellow card for Janelt for smashing into Joao Mario. Thomas Frank is furious about that on the sidelines. 66 min: All Brentford, all business. Kucka comes across to clear the ball just as they threaten to get around the back through Janelt. This is relentless pressure. 65 min: Peter Oh zings in: “The update about Norgaard taking a shot right to the family jewels reminds me of the title of another Blur song I like: Tender.” 64 min: Brentford have gained control of midfield since Tom Cleverley departed, which may need some more tinkering from Claudio to counter. 62 min: Paulo gets in touch: “Did Bachman turn on his overdrive for that play I imagine he was just takin’ care of business. Ok, I’ll leave now.” Not ‘arf. 60 min: Risky business at the back from Brentford but they play it out well. The ball is launched to the back post and Henry suddenly runs into trouble. Femenia clears. Relief for Watford. They had been overloaded. 58 min: First Watford sub, off goes Cleverley, and on comes Joao Pedro. Claudio bringing on a forward? Does he smell blood? Or is he just tinkering? 57 min: Admir gets in touch: “Indeed, Pozzos have proven themselves as the best gem finders at Udinese. Alexis Sanchez and Bruno Fernandes almost played together for Udinese. Oliver Bierhoff was replaced with Marcio Amoroso. Speaking of Amoroso, that’s the best example of their model. Udinese got big money plus Stefano Fiore for him before eventually selling Fiore himself for big money to Lazio.” 55 min: Bachmann has to come all way out to smash clear. There’s a Stephen King Running Man gag in there somewhere. Meanwhile, Norgaard takes the ball right to the goolies. That hurts. Ouch. He’ll be OK to continue but singing his carols in soprano this Christmas. 53 min: Watford get a free-kick on the right-hand side of the pitch. This time, Tom Cleverley’s dead-ball skills are found wanting. 50 min: Brentford keeper Fernandez hoiks a ball off the field with a clearance. He rather got away with that. Justin Kavanagh gets in touch: :That sounds like a fun night out (remember those!) at the Community Stadium. Perhaps the King Bee on the PA will give Elton’s Don’t go breaking my heart spin as the teams come back out, what with Watford leading and all tha’.” Was Kiki Dee a Brentford fan? Did she hobnob with Rick Wakeman at the old Griffin Park? 49 min: Baptiste surges through and tries to play in Mbuemo, but Femenia defends well for Watford, stepping across to clear the danger. 48 min: The ball goes off at the sideline and Thomas Frank gets it. He’s angry, no longer the fun-filled figure of the early weeks of the season. 46 min: We are back back back with no changes made by either team. Matt Burtz gets in touch: “The Beatles made their way across the pond in short order, but in the ‘90s Blur did not except for “Song 2” (fantastic song IMO), so it was only a few years ago that I heard “Park Life” for the first time. I like it, but then again I haven’t had to hear it for the last 25 years.” It was more having to hear it at every pub and disco I went to in the 1990s. (That phrasing makes me read like I am very old indeed.) Half-time reading from Barney Ronay. Both teams have had chances but the difference between the teams is the superior finishing of Emmanuel Dennis where Brentford have missed Ivan Toney. It’s been breathless stuff. They leave the pitch to the sound of Smalltown Boy. RIP Steve Bronski. 45+1 min: Just a minute added on, as both continue to push for another goal. Dennis seems to be fine as he makes another attempt to win a high ball. 44 min: Two Sissoko fouls and yet no booking. And rightly so, as neither was a bookable offence in the midfield. The ref tonight is Michael Oliver, by the way. 42 min: Panic in the Watford box as Charlie Goode climbs highest but can’t direct his header in. Both teams are highly vulnerable at set pieces. 41 min: Another speedy move from Brentford. Norgard’s pass was a beauty, but Mbuemo can’t play in Wissa or Henry. They do seem to lack that little bit of quality. 39 min: Dennis is back, thankfully, the fear was of an achilles injury. That would be very doomy indeed for Watford. 37 min: Uh oh, Dennis is down after what looks an innocuous tackle, and it looks like the after-effects of that climb. He limps off but in some pain, and tries to job but not convincingly. 35 min: Watford break at speed. Sissoko cuts in from the wing, and spins a ball out wide. Dennis climbs highest, as he can, with real hang time, but he can’t keep the his header down. 33 min: Brentford coming back into it? The passing does seem to be of the long-ball variety. Watford’s neck muscles getting some work out tonight. 31 min: There’s a tussle between Zamburek and Dennis, and it looks like a penalty call, but one waved away. Dennis seems to want to change his boots. It is a tad soggy out there. 29 min: Brentford look rattled. Ivan Toney and Sergio Canos are both much missed. 27 min: Mbuemo whacks a snap shot wide after the ball spills from a corner. Meanwhile. two Prem legends in Claudio Ranieri and Mike Dean are in deep discussion on the touchline. 25 min: Emmanuel Bonaventure Dennis’s goals look like Watford’s best route to safety. It has to be said that the Pozzo family are masters of the market. They find jewels in the market where nobody else is looking. One of the finds of the season. Tom Cleverley pings a perfect corner and Dennis climbs highest and furthest to nod in. His seventh of the season. What a find he has been. 23 min: Chance for Watford, and King smashes the post after cutting in from the left, and Brentford clear behind. 22 min: Bachman in overdrive! And he needs to be, making a fine save. Mbuemo shoots from distance after a speedy break from Brentford. The best football of the game so far. 19 min: Meanwhile, both teams pushing on at either end. It’s pretty open and the next goal could come either of them 16 min: Mary Waltz is in: “I was youngest of six and grew up immersed in the Beatles. My older brother had a band and tried to make me a Stones devotee but my heart belonged to the Beatles. But I heard Hey Jude so many times that I cringe at the sound of it...There is such a thing as Hey Jude PTSD.” I have the same feeling with House of Pain’s Jump Around, the worst record of all time. Blur’s Park Life another. I think it’s the way everyone else dances to them while I cuss in the corner and am just too cool. Still, at least we’re true heads, Mary. 15 min: Brentford pressure. Baptiste and Henry both surging forward and already panic stations for Watford. 13 min: The home fans are making a hell of a racket and so are the Watford fans. It can be a decent noise down Vicarage Road, too. 11 min: Henry, for Brentford, speeds out to the left, and whips in a cross. Bachmann claims the ball. Good goalkeeping. 9 min: Jensen picks the ball up deep for Brentford and whacks it long but beyond Wissa. He’s having to fill the huge gap left by Ivan Toney’s absence. 7 min: More Brentford pressure. A long throw launched in by Sorensen but Watford counter the aerial bombardment. This is quite end to end, though a little lacking in quality. 5 min: A couple of corners are played in and Watford scrabble away both of them. Watford look vulnerable, as they have all season, and perhaps even more so under Ranieri. 3 min: It’s Watford who seem to have the early impetus here, with Brentford sat back deep. But it’s Brentford who have the first shot as Baptiste steps up, and fires a snap shot that is tipped over. 1 min: And away we go...and it’s an energetic start. Some goals have to be fancied as neither team is much cop at defending. To the football, and Brentford go into a pre-match huddle. It’s very loud by the M4 tonight. There’s a Friday rave on at the Brentford Community Stadium, with the Chemical Brothers following the Nightcrawlers, and now The Streets. What is about rave and nu-rave in the Premier League? Then comes The Beatles, those lovable mop-tops are currently in the Top 40 due to that Peter Jackson marathon. From Wiki: “Although McCartney originally wrote “Hey Jude” for Julian, Lennon thought it had actually been written for him.” It was doing this performance on David Frost’s programme that meant the lads wanted to do the Get Back thing. (It says that at the start of the eight hours.) Claudio Ranieri speaks to Sky Sports. This team [Brentford] is very well organised and press very well. All the matches are very difficult but if we want to climb the table we have to make a point. That is very important for us today. We have our philosophy as do Brentford. We try to do our best but we know we concede some goals. We must not concede, keep a clean sheet but try to win the match. We have to stay together, attack together. They work in transition, we have to mark them. Brentford begin the match four points above Watford. The Brentford manager, Thomas Frank, as quoted by the BBC. I am sure that they look and think that they are a bigger club and better team than us. That is said with the biggest respect. I tried to count how many Premier League games their last starting line-up had played and then counted how many we had played. I then counted the value of the two teams and then there’s the experience of the grand maestro Claudio Ranieri who is a Premier League winner and me, a young Dane. Some Brentford news ahead of the game, the club’s co-director of football Rasmus Ankersen is set to leave the club. Some social media quotes from him in this lengthy thread, including this: Everything good comes to an end. I loved every minute of the journey, and I am really honoured to have played a small role in your long history. I want to wish all the bees fans the very best going forward. I have no doubt that there are great things waiting for you. For Watford, Jeremy Ngakia, Cucho Hernández and Juraj Kucka replace Joao Pedro, Danny Rose and Imran Louza. Rose looked tired against Manchester City last week. Three changes for Brentford from their 2-2 draw with Leeds last week. Mathias Jensen and Yoane Wissa start. Ethan Pinnock isn’t in the squad as he is another victim of Covid. Sergi Canos is suspended, rather than Covid positive. Brentford: Fernandes, Goode, Jansson, Janelt , Roerslev, Norgaard, Baptiste, Jensen, Henry, Mbeumo, Wissa. Subs: Cox, Thompson, Forss, Ghoddos, Onyeka, Bidstrup, Sorensen, Stevens, Young-Coombes. Watford: Bachmann, Femenia, Ekong, Cathcart, Ngakia, Kucka, Cleverley, Sissoko, Cucho, Dennis, King. Subs: Elliot, Rose, Louza, Joao Pedro, Sema, Fletcher, Tufan, Kabasele, Angelini. Friday night football, it’ll never catch on. With Christmas parties aplenty cancelled because of the Great Unpleasantness, including that at No 10, a nation will be rapt by a battle between two clubs on the outer fringes of the London conurbation. (Yes, yes, Watford is its own town and in Herts.) In football terms, we have a battle of 13th hosting 17th. Brentford are with the Covid-ed out Ivan Toney, and that’s a massive blow. Sergio Canos, too. With just one win since 3 October it’s been a lot of running to stand still for Brentford. They will take on a team that finished above them last season in the Championship but is already under new management. Has Claudio Ranieri changed much? Aside from beating Everton 5-2 and Manchester United 4-1, they have lost six from eight matches, though their last two opponents were Chelsea and Manchester City. So neither’s on an upward curve going into that busy Christmas period and those questioning their life choices by reading - or indeed writing - this blog are in for a game where the outcome is enigmatic. Kick-off is at 8pm, join me."
