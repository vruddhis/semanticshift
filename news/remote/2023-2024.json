          "bodyText": "The UK’s economic performance in 2024 was mixed to say the least: while inflation fell below the 2% target in early autumn – and has been outstripped by annual wage growth of 5.2% – it is on the rise again. Meanwhile, forecasts for the pace of interest rate cuts have been trimmed and businesses have warned they expect an imminent slowdown in activity. As the year nears its end, people from across the country have shared their financial hopes and concerns for the coming year. ‘I’d love to have a few extra months off with our newborn’ I’m about to start maternity leave and – after aggressively saving for the last few months – I’m hoping my husband and I have budgeted accurately enough to manage without too much financial stress once my income drops to standard maternity pay (SMP). We’ve made a huge effort to live within our means and pay off any debts, so I’d love to have a few extra months off with our newborn without risking using all of our savings. Even though the government is raising SMP in April by £3 [a week], it’s still less than half of national minimum wage and likely to be approximately £145 per week after tax, national insurance and pension contributions – a big drop from what we’re used to. Given inflation and the extortionate nursery fees I keep hearing about, I’m really worried about having enough to cover the cost of childcare when I go back to work, or the risk of an unforeseen expense forcing me to do so early. For many millennials, it’s just not affordable to have children any more; I know we’re the only couple in our friendship group who want to and are able to. Ashley, 33, a marketing specialist from Leicester ‘Hopefully, I’ll pay off my Covid debt’ I’m hoping to finally pay off the hideous debt load I was put in during Covid. Or move it into “affordable” debt products. To be able to use gas central heating again. To buy a passport. James, a homeowner working in IT, from Birmingham ‘I hope I’ll be able to buy a small home’ I hope that there is a house price crash and that, with the money I have, the purchase of a small home becomes possible – without being tied to the risk of equity extraction and terrifying maintenance charges. My financial concern for next year is that investors will continue to be allowed to buy up smaller houses to trap the less rich in eternal debt to landlords and freeholders. We cannot have a healthy demand economy when so much income goes to housing costs. Nor is it healthy for society for there to be so much homelessness, resentment and bitterness. Building more houses for them to be bought up by extractive investors, both domestic and overseas, will achieve nothing. Rose, retired, from Cornwall ‘Without a promotion, I’ll soon have no juice left’ I desperately need a promotion. I’m happy in my current role but promotion is the only means by which to secure a pay rise that would be even close to covering the increase in the cost of living. Competition is fierce within the ranks of civil servants at delegated grades, as everyone is in the same boat, and there is a distinct lack of decent roles being advertised outside of Whitehall. I worked very hard to secure a sufficient deposit to buy my flat earlier this year, but service charges are a significant worry. After taxes, student loans and essential living costs, I have about £800 disposable income left – £600 after depositing for long-term savings. This year’s public sector pay rise worked out at 5.45% for me. It gave me about an extra £50 a month. But income tax, council tax and utility bill rises, as well as increased student loan contributions, mean that I’m still around £60 per month worse off than this time last year. And this doesn’t even begin to account for other inflationary pressures, or income erosion due to frozen tax bands. I’m beginning to feel like a lemon that’s been squeezed one too many times. If they keep going, I’ll have no juice left. A civil servant from Manchester in his 30s ‘The end of remote working means a costly move’ I hope to be able to move back to the south, ideally without compromising too much on the quality of the house and neighbourhood. [My concern for next year is that] potential clients are increasingly asking for hybrid or on-site work. My immune system is compromised and I have successfully worked entirely remotely since the pandemic. But it now seems that clients want everyone on site, and this is impacting my ability to earn a living. Andy Hilton, 57, a freelance IT consultant and blood cancer patient from Coventry ‘I worry about Trump’s effect on the global economy’ I’m hoping for reduced interest rates – the mortgage is high enough – and want to look at how I can get more for my money through savings. I’m generally happy with how my finances are, have zero debt outside of mortgage and monthly credit card usage, which is low. My concerns? The effect Trump may have on the global economy with his policy ideas. That the Bank of England gets jumpy about inflation, and adjusts interest rates up. The fact that there appears to be rampant profiteering by utility companies. And the knock-on effect of national insurance increases for employers who will clearly pass that on to us. A 38-year-old paramedic from Leicestershire ‘I hope to secure full-time work to support my family’ I hope to secure a reliable source of full-time income to cover my bills, meet my student loan payments, and have enough left over to finally begin saving. A little bit of extra income would allow me to buy my four-year-old son a bike he so desperately wants. Graduating in August with an MSc in creative writing will be a huge milestone, and my highest hope is that it spurs me on to have a wonderful career in the literary world that supports myself and my family. The cost of living has made simply feeding my family and meeting rent incredibly difficult. Juggling parenting, university and work is stressful enough, and I spend much of my free time figuring out ways to make ends meet. Rachel, 28, a full-time master’s student and a part-time barista living in Edinburgh with unsettled status ‘Having to pay for private healthcare affects our retirement planning’ My wife and I both don’t have much of a pension because we spent many years working overseas, in jobs without pension schemes. We do have investments that would be more than enough for a decent retirement, but – medical costs! My wife has had two carpal tunnel ops this year, nearly a grand each. I need another surgery soon that will be close to three grand. Worst of all, she really needs a knee replacement, that’s going to be £15,000. Having to pay for medical treatment [because of untenable waits to be seen on the NHS] blows a huge hole into financial planning. I’m hoping to be able to reduce working hours a bit more, but that depends on whether we can handle the salary drop and whether my employer would permit it. At our age we need more time to look after each other, and we may not have that much time left. John, 65, a computer scientist from the Isle of Wight"

          "bodyText": "We Live In Time We’re overdue a genuinely good romantic-comedy with a few drops of weepie thrown in. This could be it. Screenwriter Nick Payne and director John Crowley give us a non-smooth-running love story in nonlinear form, in which Florence Pugh’s chef Almut and Andrew Garfield’s breakfast cereal executive Tobias meet cute when Almut runs Tobias over in her car on the day his divorce comes through. • 1 January Nosferatu It’s the great cinephile passion-project remake – last undertaken by Werner Herzog with Klaus Kinski in the title role. Now Robert Eggers has revived FW Murnau’s 1922 silent horror classic as a huge movie event. This time it’s Bill Skarsgård as creepy, emulsion-white Count Orlok – the vampire (based on Dracula) who preys on a delicate Englishwoman played by Lily-Rose Depp. • 1 January Nickel Boys This amazingly moving and occasionally scary film, adapted from Colson Whitehead’s novel, is about two black American boys sent to a racist and abusive segregated reform school during the Jim Crow 60s (and based on a real institution). The intense and immersive film is shot using first-person point-of-view shots, and its tragedy is at odds with these ecstatic images. • 3 January A Real Pain Succession fans in need of a new Kieran Culkin fix will want to see this smart, funny film in which he co-stars with its writer-director, Jesse Eisenberg. They play Benji and David, two American Jewish guys who take a trip to Poland, home of their forebears, and visit the grim sites of the Holocaust – with their relationship under increasing strain. • 8 January Babygirl Nicole Kidman has form when it comes to representing transgressive age-gap relationships. Here she plays a high-flying CEO who has a thrilling affair with a much younger male intern played by Harris Dickinson. The drama promises to provoke progressive assumptions and question ideas about corporate power dynamics and sexual politics. • 10 January Maria Screenwriter Steven Knight and director Pablo Larraín have confected this intense biopic about the final years of the OG diva herself, Maria Callas, played by Angelina Jolie. We begin with her haughty and secluded existence in retirement in Paris, a haunted figure in dark glasses, before flashing back to a childhood in Nazi-occupied Athens and her relationship with Aristotle Onassis • 10 January A Complete Unknown A biopic about Bob Dylan is not necessarily going to please all the purists, vinyl connoisseurs and superfans – nor indeed the great Nobel laureate himself. But Timothée Chalamet brings to this role such amazing chutzpah, vivacity, stamina and fun – he sings all the tracks himself – and there’s great stuff from Edward Norton as Pete Seeger. • 17 January Vermiglio A gorgeous Italian movie in the manner of Ermanno Olmi or the Taviani brothers, set in a remote wartime village – rich, compassionate, detailed. In the Alpine community of Vermiglio, a schoolteacher has to decide how to react when his eldest daughter falls in love with an army deserter that the villagers are protecting. A lovely film. • 17 January Emmanuelle Here is a high-risk movie brand reboot, and Audrey Diwan is the formidable director who has taken it on, as well as co-writing with Rebecca Zlotowski. It’s a remake of the once controversial softcore 70s erotic classic Emmanuelle, reinvented for a sex-positive age. Noémie Merlant plays the title character, who goes on a voyage of steamy erotic discovery in Hong Kong. • 17 January Here Richard McGuire’s groundbreaking graphic novel Here is adapted by Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Eric Roth. We see the family history of Richard and Margaret (played by Tom Hanks and Robin Wright) in a nonlinear style, as the film ranges over everything that has taken place in the part of America where they live – beginning with the dinosaurs. • 17 January The Brutalist Brady Corbet’s stunning new film is a brilliant, mysterious epic with something of Orson Welles, Paul Thomas Anderson and Ayn Rand. An architect and Hungarian Holocaust survivor played by Adrien Brody arrives in the US penniless after the war, and is taken under the wing of an impulsive plutocrat played by Guy Pearce, who asks him to design a huge modernist building in tribute to his late mother. • 24 January Presence That remarkable and restless movie creator Steven Soderbergh returns with a lo-fi psycho-supernatural thriller shot in a single location: a haunted house, where we see things from the point of view of the ghost. A family move into a recently renovated house (Chris Sullivan and Lucy Liu play the mum and dad) and we see their problems from this uncanny standpoint. • 24 January Hard Truths Mike Leigh gives us an uncompromising late-career classic: a fierce study of depression performed by Marianne Jean-Baptiste, who last worked with Leigh in Secrets and Lies in 1996. She plays Pansy, a middle-aged woman whose melancholy manifests in a nonstop aria of anger – an uncompromising stream of rage against anyone and anything and everything. It’s a fascinating performance. • 31 January The Seed of the Sacred Fig The fugitive Iranian director and pro-democracy activist Mohammad Rasoulof (who is wanted by the police in his home country) was unlucky not to win a major award in Cannes for this movie – a drama revolving around a lost gun that spans the real and the surreal. It is about the anguish of its dissenting citizens in a country where women can by judicially beaten and bullied for not wearing the hijab in public. • 7 February Bridget Jones: Mad About the Boy She’s back. Bridge returns for a fourth film in what can only be called the Bridget Jones franchise, which also plugs into the current movie craze for toyboy shenanigans. Renée Zellweger is once again Bridget, whose circumstances are changed and she has a new love: a pert young man played by Leo “One Day” Woodall. Excitingly, Hugh Grant returns in the role of super-cad Daniel Cleaver. • 13 February On Falling This outstanding debut feature from Scotland-based Portuguese film-maker Laura Carreira takes a close look at something that really hasn’t been properly addressed in any art form: the human cost of the online shopping revolution. Joana Santos gives a great performance as a woman who works at a vast fulfilment centre in Scotland, a job that undermines her sanity and humanity. • 7 March Julie Keeps Quiet First-time feature director Leonardo Van Dijl made an impact in Cannes with this very disturbing drama about abuse. Tessa Van den Broeck plays young tennis player Julie, who is poised to become a star. But she and all her contemporaries are stunned by news that her coach is under investigation for something unspecified, and a previous pupil has taken her own life. Should Julie keep quiet? • 7 March Sister Midnight Bollywood star Radhika Apte is tearing it up with her deadpan black-comic performance in Karan Kandhari’s much-admired movie. She plays Uma, a young woman from the provinces who arrives in Mumbai to get married, but discovers her husband is a drunk no-hoper and her home is a chaotic mess. • 14 March Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning Can it really be true that this is the final Mission: Impossible film? Well, the pressure will be on to go out with a real bang, given that, as IMF agent Ethan Hunt, Tom Cruise has consistently delivered solid gold action thrills with his own gasp-inducing stunts – and incidentally established himself as an Anglophile supporter of the UK’s movie industry. • 21 May The Battle of Baktan Cross That great alpha auteur Paul Thomas Anderson returns with a crime drama starring Leonardo DiCaprio, with a musical score by Jonny Greenwood, and reportedly inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s novel Vineland about American conformism, authority and the war on drugs. • 8 August"

          "bodyText": "Throughout 2024, the Guardian aimed to report on every woman allegedly killed by a man, drawing on the work of campaigns such as Counting Dead Women, the Femicide Census and Killed Women. In recent years in the UK, a woman has been killed by a man every three days on average, yet most of their stories have gone unheard. The Guardian wants to help change that. This year, the toll of women whose deaths have led to a man being charged has reached 80. Here, we mark each of their lives. None of these incidents are linked in any way other than that a woman has been killed and a man charged in connection with her death. Karen Cummings Died 14 December, aged 40 Hundreds of people gathered in Northern Ireland after the death of Karen Cummings, a much-loved children’s nurse who was found dead on 14 December. At least 600-strong, they lit candles, made speeches and held a minute’s silence. Some held up banners bearing the names of 25 women killed in Northern Ireland since 2020. Cummings was found unconscious with a serious head injury in Laurel Heights in Banbridge, on Saturday 14 December. She died at the scene. Glenn King, 32, of no fixed address, and Kevin McGuigan Jr, 42, of Annacloy Park, in Hillsborough, have been charged with her murder. Astra Sirapina Died 10 December, aged 62 West Midlands police said the force’s thoughts were with the family of Sirapina, 62, who was found with serious head injuries at a house in Coventry on Tuesday 10 December. Police had received calls raising concerns about her safety and wellbeing. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Arturs Putrasevics, 39, of no fixed address, was arrested and later charged with her murder. He was also charged with possession of a bladed article in a public place. Margaret Maude Hanson Died 9 December, aged 84 Margaret Hanson, a mother and a grandmother, was found dead at a property in Galashiels, in the Scottish borders, at 3am on 9 December after police were called. Her family said they were “devastated at the loss of our mum and gran”, adding: “Margaret will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved her.” Her husband, John Hanson, an 84-year-old retired nurse, was charged with her murder. Kristine Sparane Died 26 November, aged 37 Staff at Kristine Sparane’s local supermarket recalled how she would bring her five-year-old daughter, Mary, every evening to pick up croissants and doughnuts. Sparane, 37, was a beloved member of her local community in Spalding, Lincolnshire. They rallied round to raise funds for her daughter after her body was discovered at her home on the evening of 26 November. When officers arrived at the property they arrested Brian Simpson, 64, of Nene Court, Spalding. He was later charged with Sparane’s murder. Phoenix Spencer-Horn Died 18 November, aged 21 Phoenix Spencer-Horn, 21, was described as a “gorgeous girl with her full life ahead of her” after she was found dead at a house in East Kilbride, Scotland, on the afternoon of 18 November. Police are believed to have been called after she failed to turn up for work on Monday morning. “I am absolutely speechless. Phoenix you did not deserve this, how can this world be so cruel? RIP angel. A friendship I will never forget,” a friend wrote online. Flowers were placed outside the cafe where Spencer-Horn had worked in her hometown of Strathaven, and her family raised more than £6,000 to “give Phe the day she deserves” because she “was and is adored”. Any surplus would be donated to the domestic abuse charity Women’s Aid, they said. Ewan Methven, 26, from East Kilbride, was charged with her murder. Carol James Died 15 November, aged 81 Carol James died in her home in Bexleyheath, south-east London, on the morning of 15 November. The cause of death was compression of the neck. Her husband, Brian James, also 81, was charged with her murder. He was treated in hospital for a head injury before being taken to Lewisham police station. He was deemed not in a fit state to attend a hearing several days later. Cheryl McKenna Died 11 November, aged 44 Cheryl McKenna, a mother, daughter, sister and aunt, had been a “huge and integral part” of her family, her relatives said after her death. The body of McKenna, 44, was discovered by police officers at a property in Other Road, near Redditch town centre, early on the morning of 11 November after reports of a stabbing. Two ambulances and the Midlands air ambulance were dispatched to the address but McKenna was pronounced dead at the scene. Chris Hemming, 46, of Other Road in Redditch, was charged with her murder.

I will carry our younger giggles, adventures and memories with me.” James McCrindle, 53, has been charged with murder and James Paita, 40, has been charged with assault to severe injury, danger of life and attempted murder. Catherine Flynn Died 24 October, aged 69 Catherine Flynn loved her garden. It was “her little wonderland”, her family said. But her “welcoming and warm” sanctuary in Rhyl, north Wales, was violated on 24 October when an intruder left the 69-year-old with life-threatening injuries. She later died in hospital. Flynn’s family said her death had “left a huge hole in everyone’s hearts”. “Cathy was a wonderful mum, nan, great nan, auntie, and sister, and also a second mother to many and a great friend,” they said. Dean Mark Albert Mears, 33, was charged with murder and burglary with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Rhiannon Skye Whyte Died 23 October, aged 27 Rhiannon Skye Whyte was described by her sister as “quirky, unconventionally funny and family oriented”, “the most selfless, giving, loving person” – and a massive Disney fan. Her death came as a “catastrophic” loss to her four siblings, her son, and many other family members, she said. While on the phone to her best friend, after finishing a shift at a nearby Radisson hotel, Rhiannon was stabbed at a railway station in Walsall. She died two days later on 23 October. Deng Chol Majek, 18, was charged with her murder. Luka Bennett-Smith Died 20 October, aged 19 Luka Bennett-Smith was found with multiple stab wounds at a home in the St Andrew’s area of Bristol on the evening of 20 October. Emergency services were called but she died at the scene from her wounds. A police officer described it as a “tragic incident”, and said her family had asked for privacy to “come to terms” with what had happened. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons because he is under 18, has been charged with her murder. Mashal Ilyas Died 9 October, aged 24 Mashal Ilyas, 24, was found by police in a home in Atherton, Greater Manchester, after neighbours raised concerns for her welfare. Despite paramedics’ attempts to save her, she was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. Police initially dismissed the possibility of suspicious circumstances, but a subsequent Home Office postmortem upgraded her case to a suspicious death investigation. Nadeem Muhammed Begum, 52, of Oxford Road, Atherton, was later charged with her murder. All of these women mattered. They need to matter much more to politics Jess Phillips, minister for violence against women and girls Mary Ward Last seen alive on 25 September, aged 22 Mary Ward had been in contact with the police before her death, aged 21, to report that she had been the victim of a violent crime in the weeks before her death. Her body was discovered at her home in south Belfast on 1 October. After her death, the PSNI assistant chief constable Davy Beck said officers were giving support to her family, whom he acknowledged were “experiencing unbearable suffering knowing that their loved one was taken from them in such a cruel way”. Ahmed Abdirahman, 31, was arrested in Dublin on 9 October and charged with murder. Rachel Simpson Body discovered 13 September, aged 43 When mourners arrived to celebrate the life of 43-year-old Rachel Simpson, many of them were dressed in her favourite leopard print. “She was a champion for the underdogs and always cared for those who needed it most,” said Cher Simpson, her sister. “She would have fought an army for you, a fiercely loyal person and if she had your back you knew about it.” The east Belfast woman had two daughters, Lucy and Sophie, and a son, Nathan. Nathan Simpson was charged with the murder of his mother, a week after his release from prison. Juliana Falcon Died 13 September, aged 48 Juliana Falcon, 48, was “a strong loving mother to four beautiful children, who were her absolute world”, said her family. She was the type of woman who always put others first, a keen athlete who loved raising money for charity, they said. Falcon was discovered by police in a flat in Luton at about 5.30am on Friday 13 September, alongside her 16-year-old son, Kyle Prosper, and 13-year-old daughter, Giselle Prosper. Nicholas Prosper, 18, has been charged with murder, firearms offences and possession of a bladed article. A trial date has provisionally been set for 3 March 2025. Barbara Nomakhosi Died 6 September, aged 35 Barbara Nomakhosi was a thoughtful woman, said her family. Kind and hard-working, she was well-suited to her work as a carer. “Barbara loved her family,” said her family. “We loved Barbara so much and life will not be the same without her.” Nomakhosi, 35, was discovered by officers at an address in Bury, Greater Manchester, at about 10.30pm on Friday 6 September. They identified Molifi Elvis Mosia, 41, identified at an inquest as Nomakhosi’s husband, as a suspect; he was involved in a fatal collision between an HGV and a pedestrian on the M65 motorway at about 9pm on the same day. Davinia Graham Died 31 August, aged 67 Davinia Graham was known as Dee to her friends. A woman who had dedicated her life to helping others while working at Cheltenham general hospital, the 67-year-old was “very much loved”. Honouring her love of animals, her family asked for no flowers, instead requesting donations to a local animal shelter. On Saturday 31 August atabout 3.30am, the emergency services went to a property in Cheltenham where a woman had been seriously injured. When they arrived they found she had died at the scene. Charles Graham, 77, has pleaded not guilty to her murder, with a trial set for March 2025. Cher Maximen Died 31 August, aged 32 Cher Maximen, 32, was “a fun-filled force of nature”, according to a friend.

Her family described her as “amazing” and “beautiful” with a heart of gold. Shakiel Thibou, 20, from west London, was charged with her murder.

A 52-year-old man has been charged with her murder. Of women killed by men, 53% were killed by a current or former partner Source : Femicide Census Montserrat Martorell Died 24 August, aged 65 Montserrat Martorell was Spanish and had been living in Londonderry. The 65-year-old was found dead in the bedroom of a ground-floor flat in Londonderry on Saturday 24 August when firefighters were called to reports of a fire. Police said she had suffered a “horrific attack and sustained multiple injuries”. Dozens of people attended a vigil and in the city in her memory after her death. One woman told the BBC: “I’ve left roses on the steps of the Guildhall tonight in her memory. Not a lot is known about Montserrat so I want her family and friends out there to know that Derry is here to show love.” Ciaran Murray, 28, from Londonderry, has been charged with her murder. Victoria Thomas Died 20 August, aged 45 Victoria Thomas’s family say they are “broken” and will miss their much-loved “daughter, mother, sister, aunt, niece and friend” for ever, after the 45-year-old was found dead in Cardiff. Thomas died in the early hours of 20 August after she was found at a house on Caerphilly Road in the Welsh city.

At 68, she is believed to have worked as a carer and in a charity shop. Romano had previously fundraised for South East and Central Essex Mind, a charity whose mission she had said “means a lot to me”. In early February, she was found seriously injured by police officers responding to reports from neighbours. Despite the efforts of paramedics, she was pronounced dead at the scene. Her son, Sebastian Compton, 47, was subsequently charged with her murder. Compton’s plea hearing at Chelmsford crown court was postponed on grounds of mental health. Claudia Kambanza Died 26 January, aged 22 Claudia Kambanza’s family said her sudden death had torn their hearts apart. Aged 22, Kambanza was said to be “kind and bubbly” and “a very strong young woman who was warm-hearted”. The second born of three siblings, she was an “accommodative spirit” who loved to dance. A TikTok account shows Kambaza enjoying rides at the funfair or playing pranks on people. She was stabbed on Hinderwell Street in Hull on 26 January at about 3am and died shortly after being taken to hospital. Mateus Johannes, 28 and believed to be her boyfriend, was charged with her murder and the possession of a bladed article in a public space. Kambanza’s family has created a GoFundMe page to repatriate her body back to Namibia, where she was originally from. “Her sudden death has torn her parents’ heart apart,” it says. Tara Kershaw Died 20 January, aged 33 Tara Kershaw was loved by many: her two young daughters, her siblings and their children, her parents and many members of her wider community. Her family described her as a “loving and kind soul”, someone who “had a face that was well known all over”. That’s why they “struggl[ed] to come to terms” with the fact that she could die in her own home in Great Yarmouth, aged 33, of injuries consistent with compression to the neck, by someone that police thought she had known. A man who lived at the same address, Adam Barnard, 40, has been charged with her murder. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has announced it is investigating Norfolk police’s “conduct, action and decision making” after it emerged the force had previous contact with Kershaw. Kanticha Sukpengpanao Died 19 January, aged 36 Kanticha Sukpengpanao’s love for her nieces was such that she had travelled from her home in Thailand to Norfolk to visit them. It was while on this trip that she would be found dead alongside the children she had come to see. The discovery of her body, alongside those of 12-year-old Jasmin Kuczynska and eight-year-old Natasha Kuczynska, and her brother-in-law, Bartlomiej Kuczynski, shocked those living in the town of Costessey, near Norwich. Sukpengpanao has been described as a supportive friend and a loving aunt who will be missed by many. A friend told the Mirror: “Kanticha was very nice and caring to all friends of her … she helped everyone.” Sukpengpanao and the children died of stab wounds. Kuczynski died of a single stab wound in his neck. Norfolk police have confirmed they are not seeking anyone else in connection with the deaths. The force has referred itself to the police watchdog over reports Kuczynski made a 999 call from the property to which officers were not dispatched. Alison McLaughlin Died 5 January, aged 53 For Alison McLaughlin, 2024 had got off to a happy start. The 53-year-old had become a grandparent to baby Alilynne. But three weeks later, she was found dead in her home in Greenock, Inverclyde, on 5 January. McLaughin was found lying next to her dead husband, Neil McLaughlin, 57, after neighbours sounded the alarm. Described by friends as a “lovely couple, always happy”, the picture circulating in news reports shows a well-groomed pair. Police are treating her death as murder and Neil McLaughlin’s as suicide. DI Gordon Smith, of Police Scotland, said: “Our thoughts remain with the family and friends of both Alison and Neil. They have asked for privacy at what is a very difficult time for them.” Maya Bracken Died 4 January, aged 56 “Lovely” was the word that kept cropping up when people spoke about Mayawati – or Maya – Bracken, 56. A friend described her as “an amazing, quirky, hilarious woman who made everyone smile who met her. RIP to a beautiful lady.” Another added that she was “such a lovely lady”. On 4 January, police were called to reports of an incident and found Bracken stabbed in the chest in a Lexus on the A340 Tidmarsh Road in Berkshire. About an hour later there were reports of a second death. Julian Bracken, 18, believed to be her son, was found dead on the tracks near Pangbourne station. Thames Valley police said no further suspects were being sought. Tia Simmonds Died 3 January, aged 32 Tia Simmonds’ body was found in the storage area of a converted loft in her home, lying face down covered in items of clothing and bedding, according to the prosecutor working on her case. The 32-year-old was discovered at the home she shared with her husband, Shane Simmonds, in Lewisham, south-east London, on 3 January. Simmonds, 38, was charged with his wife’s murder the following day. He was also charged with two counts of rape in relation to a teenage girl and has since been remanded in custody, with a trial date set for 14 October. Keotshepile Naso Isaacs Died 1 January, aged 33 Keotshepile Naso Isaacs, known as Naso, arrived in the UK a year ago from Otse, a village in south-east Botswana, with the dream of building a new life for her and her three sons. On New Year’s Day, those dreams were destroyed when she was found dead, aged 33, at a property in the Scottish seaside town of North Berwick. Her husband, Mompati Dodo Isaacs, 37, was charged with her murder. Neighbours, who had made a “report of concern” to the police, described Naso as “a loving mum to her boys, who must be absolutely devastated”. Friends on social media paid tribute to a “beautiful soul”.

          "bodyText": "The search for a 23-year-old hiker missing in Kosciuszko national park since Boxing Day has entered its sixth day, with the man’s sister expressing fears about potential threats to his safety. Hadi Nazari, an experienced hiker whose birthday was on Tuesday, has not been seen since friends saw him descending the Hannels Spur Trail at Geehi, between Khancoban and Thredbo, on Thursday. When he did not arrive at the Geehi campground as expected, his two friends – aged 23 and 24 – began searching for him. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Acting Supt Jillian Gibson said the area being searched was some “of the most rugged terrain in New South Wales”. “It’s very steep, it’s very vegetated and it’s quite remote. “At this point we’ve had no indications of where he is. It is dense bushland with high altitude and scaling it is very difficult.” Gibson said heat was also an issue, but Nazari was “well resourced” and had likely “just got separated” from his friends. Specially trained volunteer bushwalkers from the VRA and State Emergency Service have been assisting. Some of those expert hikers had been airlifted into rugged and remote areas to increase the capability of searching those areas, Gibson said. Police said further assets have been deployed, including a helicopter with infra-red capabilities to try to locate Nazari, but have so far been unsuccessful. Zahra Nazari, the missing man’s sister, told the Nine network’s Today Show that “not seeing him for so many days [and] not able to talk to him for so many days” was the “biggest trauma” of her life. “It’s a remote area,” she said. “There might be other insects, or [there] could be animals as well, which is a threat to him. “[I] just want to go outside and scream, you know. I just look at his pictures all the time. I pray to God he comes back, he comes back soon.” Nazari is described as being Asian in appearance with a slim build and is about 172cm tall. He was last seen wearing a grey, long-sleeved shirt, grey pants and carrying a blue backpack. “While there are concerns for the man’s welfare, police have been told the man is an experienced hiker and is carrying camping equipment and wearing clothing suitable to the conditions,” NSW police said. It comes after a hiker suffered a snake bite, dehydration and a rolled ankle while lost in the Snowy Mountains in October. Lovisa Sjoberg, 48, was found after a six-day search. A local police commander said Sjoberg was “pretty fortunate to be alive”. Anyone with information regarding Nazari was urged to contact Crime Stoppers. • This article was amended on 7 January 2025 to correct the age of Hadi Nazari from 24 to 23."

          "headline": "Chinese hackers breach US treasury network, gain access to some files",
          "bodyText": "Chinese state-sponsored hackers breached the US treasury department earlier this month, accessing several employee workstations and unclassified documents, according to an agency spokesperson. The breach was orchestrated via a third-party cybersecurity service provider, BeyondTrust. Hackers were able to gain access to a key used by the vendor to override certain parts of the system, according to a letter the treasury department sent to lawmakers on Monday that was reviewed by the Guardian. “The compromised BeyondTrust service has been taken offline and there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to treasury systems or information,” the treasury department spokesperson said. The hack comes amid reports that Chinese state-sponsored actors also breached three of the largest US telecommunications companies earlier this month. During that breach, called Salt Typhoon, cybercriminals were able to gain access to lawmakers’ phone calls and text messages. Lawmakers across the political spectrum condemned the hack. After the alert from BeyondTrust, the treasury department contacted the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa), the Federal Bureau of Investigation and third-party forensic investigators to determine the impact of the incident. The treasury department said more details will be made available in a 30-day supplemental report. “Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems and the data it holds,” the spokesperson said. “Over the last four years, treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.” BeyondTrust said on its website that it had recently identified a security incident that involved a limited number of customers of its remote support software. The statement said a digital key had been compromised in the incident and that an investigation was under way. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington rejected any responsibility for the hack in a response to Reuters, saying that Beijing “firmly opposes the US’s smear attacks against China without any factual basis”."

          "headline": "Tom Jenkins’ best sport photographs of 2024",
          "bodyText": "It’s been quite a year, and one totally dominated by the “big three”: the men’s Euros in Germany and the Olympics and Paralympics in Paris. This a personal selection of my favourite pictures, a few of which haven’t been published before. Some have been chosen for their news value; others are here because there’s a nice tale behind them. Luke Littler, World Darts Championship final, Alexandra Palace – 3 January Lens 24mm, 1/1600, f2.8, ISO 5000 My year began just up the hill from my house, documenting the amazing rise of Luke Littler. The relatively unknown 16-year-old from Warrington had shocked the world of darts and captured the nation’s attention as he progressed through the tournament. As well as photographing the final itself I wanted to find a picture to illustrate how his life was changing so rapidly and that now, suddenly, all eyes were on him. As the fireworks went off and the crowd went crazy, Littler nervously walked on stage for his final against Luke Humphries. I decided to nip behind a row of other media to capture this scene. Arsenal v Newcastle, Premier League, Emirates Stadium – 24 February Lens 24mm, 1/1600, f4, ISO 4000 For this picture I have to thank one man in particular: not the athletically leaping Gabriel (although admittedly he does help) but Arsenal’s set-piece guru and now cult-hero, Nicolas Jover. I had noticed in several previous Arsenal games the tactics they had started to employ at corners, often crossing the ball into the space well short of the near post. So for this match I decided to tuck a remote camera behind one of the stanchions that help to hold up the back of the net and angled the lens slightly up and away from the goal. It also really helps that the pitch at the Emirates falls away very sharply after the deadball line so you can really get the camera at worm’s eye level. Fortunately, I managed to guess correctly where the ball might come and the fixed focus was on the right spot to capture Gabriel twisting in mid-air to powerfully head the ball towards goal. Jürgen Klopp, Carabao Cup Final, Wembley Stadium – 25 February Lens 400mm, 1/1600, f4, ISO 3200 Liverpool’s League Cup final against Chelsea was held just a few weeks after their legendary manager had shocked the footballing world by announcing he would step away from the club at the end of the season. So all day I had in the back of my mind that this could be their last trophy together, and possibly his last ever final. Despite being racked by injuries and having to use very young and inexperienced academy players, his team somehow managed to win 1-0 after extra-time. Klopp seemed particularly thrilled and in the celebrations that followed I kept a close eye on him, capturing the moment when he spotted someone in the crowd and, with his famous pearly-white teeth glinting in the floodlights, pointed very deliberately to his heart and club crest. Arsenal Women v Spurs Women, Emirates Stadium – 3 March Lens 130mm, 1/16000, f4, ISO 500 I know, another corner picture at Arsenal – sorry! This one’s a bit different though. Sometimes, when the light is really nice, it gives the photographer a challenge: how to make the most of it without letting the technicalities get in the way of telling the story. At this lunchtime kick-off in early March, the low sunlight was beautiful so I positioned myself to shoot full-backlight. As a corner was about to be taken I decided to take a bit of a risk and quickly whack up the shutter speed to expose just for the highlights. Of course this would have been a terrible exposure if something important, like a goal, had happened. Luckily (for me at least) it didn’t. Cheltenham Festival – 15 March Lens 70mm, 1/12800, f4, ISO 4000 Runners in the final race of the meeting, the Martin Pipe Conditional Jockeys Handicap Hurdle. In some ways this picture has a lot of similarities to the previous one. The weather of the Festival this year had been rather bleak, there had just been a heavy shower, and I was out by the final hurdle waiting for the final race of the meeting to start. It was dark and miserable, and I was looking forward to getting home. Then, suddenly, the clouds parted and the course was bathed in the most gorgeous crystal-clear light, the sort that you only seem to get straight after a storm. Because it was so late in the day the huge stands were casting shadows over where I was positioned, so I ran down the course and found this patch of sunlight just seconds before the runners passed by. Cambridge v Oxford Women’s Boat Race, River Thames – 30 March Lens 200m, 1/2500, f9, ISO 200 The two crews approach Hammersmith Bridge. I suppose this is another image that entirely owes its place in this selection to the light – if it had been an overcast day I am sure my picture would also have been dull. I also think that the bird flying by needed to have been in exactly the right spot for the composition to work. Photographing the races on the Thames was particularly interesting for me this year because I had just completed a story I had spent a lot of time on, trying to show how and why Cambridge had become so dominant in the Boat Race. So I was quite invested in seeing the Light Blues triumph again, which they duly did in both men’s and women’s open races. British swimming championships, London Aquatics Centre – 7 April Lens 27mm, 1/2000, f2.8, ISO 6400 Competitors in a women’s 800m freestyle heat enter the pool. These championships held particular significance given that selection places for both Olympics and Paralympics were up for grabs. I was there for a couple of days and decided for one of the less important heats to head underground to the portholes built into the side of the pool. I remember using them in 2012 and it quickly came back to me how difficult the shooting conditions were. The domed shape of the glass meant it was extremely hard to focus – you had to be exactly parallel and right on the pane. Plus the best pictures always happen when the competitors dive in, but you can’t hear much down there, so you don’t know the precise moment to fire. Just to make it a bit harder, there is very little light down there and you have to pre-focus on nothing, the auto-focusing of the camera being too slow and unpredictable through the thick glass. What I certainly didn’t bargain for was this swimmer seeming to belly-flop into the water while starting her heat of the 800m freestyle. Grand National meeting, Aintree – 11 April Lens 24mm, 1/2000, f8, ISO 2000 Jockey Alex Chadwick falls off The Big Lense at The Chair in the Randox Foxhunters Open Hunters Steeplechase on the first day of of the 2024 Grand National meeting. I’ve done it so many times before, but I still get an excited tingle waiting at The Chair, listening for the runners and riders approaching. It’s still a really hard fence to jump, despite the adjustments made to make it much safer over the years. One of those safety measures has been to soften the top of the fence with more loose spruce – so when a horse hits it, the spruce flies dramatically everywhere. As the action at The Chair happens so quickly, I often use a couple of remote cameras to see the drama from a variety of angles and widen my chances. This picture was taken from low down on the inside of the course, the area where the majority of the runners seem to go. England Women v Ireland Women, Six Nations rugby union, Twickenham – 20 April Lens 560mm, 1/2000, f4, ISO 800 Ellie Kildunne, the flying England full-back, breaks through a tackle like she has done so many times this year. She has been fantastic, so I wasn’t at all surprised when she was recently crowned World Player of the Year. Not only is she supremely talented but she also makes brilliant pictures. Hair flying everywhere always looks great on camera – it’s the reason I also love taking Marcus Smith and Chandler Cunningham-South of the England men’s team in action. Tip for any young rugby player: if you want to have your picture in the paper, grow your hair! Ipswich Town v Huddersfield Town, Portman Road – 4 May Lens 400m, 1/2000, f5.6, ISO 400 It was blindingly obvious that there would be a pitch invasion the day Ipswich won promotion back to the Premier League for the first time since 2002. Thinking it would happen, I spent some time before the match working out my plan of action, deciding whether it was best to go onto the pitch with the fans or go upwards for a slightly elevated position. I decided on the latter, finding a corner in the main stand that I could squeeze into. It would give me a nice angle of the supporters running on and was near the tunnel, where the players would eventually have to head. Five minutes before the final whistle, with Ipswich leading 2-0, I rushed off to my pre-researched perch. It gave me a lovely, and safe, view of the wild celebrations – including this picture of home-town hero Harry Clarke pretending to drink champagne from a blow-up bottle as he was lifted up by adoring fans. Juan Postigo Arce, G4D Open, Woburn – 15 May Lens 40mm, 1/4000, f2.8, ISO 250 The G4D Open, essentially the Open Championship for disabled golfers, was held for the first time in 2023. I thought it would make a good story to see the world’s best, find out their stories and ask why golf has not been, and will not be for a long time, included in the Paralympics. Probably the star of disabled golf is Spaniard Juan Postigo Arce, who was born without his lower right leg and knee. He had previously played with a prosthetic, but it had been too painful. The first time I saw him fully swinging a driver and crushing the ball 300 yards down the fairway it blew me away. Manchester City v West Ham United, Etihad Stadium – 19 May Lens 24mm, 1/1600, f6.3, ISO 800 Phil Foden scored his and City’s crucial second goal on the final day of the season to virtually seal for his team the Premier League title for the fourth consecutive time. This was another example of beautiful light creating a nice opportunity but also making it technically tricky, especially with the shadow moving so quickly across the penalty area during the first half. As this was taken on a remote camera setup before kick-off, it meant an element of guessing the right exposure and crossing fingers was needed on my part. Fortunately Foden and the despairing keeper Alphonse Areola were lit up in the last few moments of sunlight. Carlo Ancelotti, Champions League final, Wembley – 1 June Lens 400mm, 1/1600, f4, ISO 3200 Real Madrid had beaten Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in the Champions League final and the post-match celebrations were starting to wind down. I was just about to walk back to my allocated pitch-side position to edit and transmit more pictures when I spotted Carlo Ancelotti being hoisted up by his players. I suppose the sight of a manager being thrown into the air in post-match celebrations is quite common now. But less so when that manager is 64 and dressed immaculately in a dark suit. Side-on is always the best position to be when something like this happens, as you don’t want the back of the head or the soles of the feet. I just love how the normally pretty serious Italian is laughing his head off. Too right when you’ve just become the most successful manager in Champions League history. Scotland fan walk, Euros 2024, Cologne – 20 June Lens 16mm, 1/1250, f4, ISO 400 For me, the most memorable moments at the men’s Euros in Germany were created by the fans. I didn’t think the actual football was of a very good standard, the best players exhausted after a long season. So when I was in Cologne for the Scotland v Switzerland group game I decided to photograph the Scottish fans’ organised march to the ground. Five hours before the match I got on a train to the designated spot where the walk would start, and traced the mile and a half route to the ground, working out the best spot to photograph from. I plumped for a quiet, residential area five minutes from the stadium. It was incredible to watch the Tartan Army march through, the local people hardly believing their eyes. I loved this moment – a local boy, proudly dressed in his German kit but wearing a tartan hat given to him, high-fiving fans as they walked past his front garden, singing at the top of their voices. Denmark v England, Euros 2024, Frankfurt Arena – 20 June Lens 160mm, 1/10, f11, ISO 100 Holding the Euros in the centre of Europe enabled fans to easily travel there in huge numbers. Every game was packed out, and the colour and vibrancy the supporters provided meant each stadium was rocking with atmosphere. It certainly was at this game, the Danish fans coordinated in their outfits, united as one in red and white. Wanting to create an image that illustrated this, I used a very slow shutter-speed and zoomed the lens out during the exposure. It took quite a few tries before I got something I was happy with. England v Spain, Euro 2024 final, Olympiastadion – 14 July Lens 400mm, 1/1600, f4, ISO 3200 It was England’s first ever major final abroad and it seemed everyone wanted to be there. The tales I heard of how England fans got to Berlin were incredible and numerous. But it wasn’t to be. Beaten by a clearly superior Spanish team and having lost a second consecutive Euros final, the dejection and disappointment of the English players was obvious to see. This feeling was visible on the faces of the England captain Harry Kane and the manager Gareth Southgate as they waited for the presentation ceremony. Kane knew that he had endured a very poor tournament; Southgate knew that his time in charge was coming to an end. Women’s individual sabre fencing final, Paris Olympics, Le Grand Palais – 29 July Lens 16mm, 1/2000, f4, ISO 3200 Manon Apithy-Brunet of France (right) on her way to victory against Sara Balzer of France in the women’s individual sabre fencing final. To say the Paris Olympics were beautiful is a bit of an understatement. After the disappointments of the last two summer games, especially the Covid-hit Tokyo edition, it seemed the organisers were desperate for a Games that was a feast for the eyes. Obviously excellent news for all the photographers there. So many of the locations were spectacular, none more so than the Grand Palais, with its majestic 45-metre-high, barrel-vaulted glass roof which was draped in white covers to limit heat during the day. It was when the sun had gone down that the ceiling looked its best, lit up theatrically against the backdrop of darkness. I noticed a couple of small lights were shining directly down on me, so I used a star-burst filter just to add to the night sky effect. Simone Biles, gymnastics women’s team final, Paris Olympics, Bercy Arena – 30 July Lens 400mm, 1/2500, f4, ISO 2500 Biles was a huge attraction at the Olympics this summer. Each time she competed, not only were the stands packed, so too were the photo positions. At the gymnastics, like so many of the other events, there was a two-tiered photo priority system operating. A few privileged people, those who worked for the sporting federation, IOC or major international news agencies, were given priority access to “infield”, in front of the boards, right by the pieces of apparatus. The vast majority of the photographers, including me, had to work on the outside of the boards. On nights like this, when Biles was going for gold, those positions were heaving. It was so hard to work properly, crammed together in tiny spots not really designed to hold so many. Having studied her routine, I knew Biles had this nice move on the uneven bars – but I came to the position late as I needed to cover her previous piece of apparatus, the vault. I managed to wriggle into a spot with an extremely limited view, just enough to see the precise area where I knew she would do this trick. Women’s 78kg judo final, Paris Olympics, Champ de Mars Arena – 2 August Lens 28mm, 1/1250, f2.8, ISO 3200 This was France’s big night of their Games, with two national heroes competing in judo, one of their most beloved sports. Teddy Riner duly delivered, winning gold for the fourth time, but the other hot favourite, Romane Dicko, lost her semi-final. Despite victory in the bronze medal match, Dicko dejectedly walked off the mat, head bowed. As she slowly made her way out of the arena, I spotted President Emmanuel Macron quickly leaving his seat and making his way towards her. His security guards were all flustered, obviously not happy he was making an unplanned trip. I guessed the spot where the president and Dicko would meet and as soon as she reached him she started crying. I was just a few feet away as he tenderly took her head in his hands and wiped away the tears. It was a beautiful moment, perfect for a story I was working on about how Macron, in such a tumultuous political time, was personally enjoying a brilliant Games. The moment didn’t last long though, as a security guard leaped in front of me, shoved me hard in the chest and shouted something in French that I didn’t understand. Men’s pole vault final, Paris Olympics, Stade de France – 5 August Lens 560mm, 1/15, f7.1, ISO 100 In this photo, Mondo Duplantis of Sweden speeds down the runway on the way to breaking his own world record in the pole vault. For this particular moment, I decided to set up my camera with two very different exposure settings. One, like this picture, with a very slow shutter-speed to capture a pan-blur of his run-up, the second exposure with a quick shutter-speed to capture him going over the bar and celebrating on the descent. All I needed to do was press a button on my camera when he was about to take off to shift between the two different exposures. Women’s keirin track cycling, Paris Olympics, Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines – 8 August Lens 120mm, 1/2000, f4, ISO 4000 The aftermath of a crash between Belgium’s Nicky Degrendele (left), China’s Yuan Liying (centre) and Netherlands’ Steffie van der Peet crash during a women’s track cycling keirin quarter-final. Working in the sweatbox that masqueraded as the National Velodrome wasn’t the most pleasant experience of the Games. It was incredibly hot and dry, made so to create the perfect conditions for breaking records. But they weren’t the only things breaking in there: immediately after crossing the finish line in a keirin quarter-final, three riders had a very nasty high-speed crash. It’s part and parcel of the sport I’m afraid, with cyclists racing at 40mph in close proximity. It might be very dangerous, but it’s the mix of jeopardy and speed that makes it such a watchable event. As a photographer you just have to keep concentrating all the time and never take your eye off the action. Women’s 66kg boxing final, Paris Olympics, Roland Garros – 9 August Lens 145mm, 1/1600, f4, ISO 3200 At the climax of perhaps the biggest news story of the Games, Imane Khelif, the Algerian boxer at the centre of a huge gender eligibility row, won her gold medal after victory in the final. Roland Garros was packed with Algerians that night. It was a truly incredible atmosphere. After the fight, which I photographed from the stands, I was invited down to ringside by the venue photo manager because the Algerian photographer who was supposed to be there hadn’t turned up. Ringside is a very privileged position, normally limited to just major agencies and photographers from the competing countries. I got to the spot just seconds before the presentation ceremony began. Men’s S5 200m freestyle final, Paris Paralympics, La Defense Arena – 29 August Lens 155mm, 1/2500, f2.8, ISO 2500 Going back to Paris after such a brilliant Olympics, I had high hopes for the Paralympics. The opening day, and especially the first night at the pool, did not disappoint. Witnessing these remarkable athletes in person was incredible, and few were more impressive than Guo Jincheng from China, nicknamed “The Flying Fish”. After losing both his arms in a freak electrocution accident at six years old, Guo took up swimming. He uses a technique similar to dolphins, and doesn’t wear a cap, preferring to shave his head on the day before competition. It made for a striking image as he flew off the blocks to start a race. The Games were hugely successful for him, winning four gold and two silver medals in total. France v China blind football, Paris Paralympics, Stade Tour Eiffel – 3 September Lens 17mm, 1/800, f8, ISO 2500 Looking back now, for me the undoubted star of the Paris summer wasn’t an athlete from the Olympics or the Paralympics – it was the Eiffel Tower. The setting for the beach volleyball and then the blind football was so gorgeous. It was like a magnet for all the photographers, the tower luring us in to take its photo. Probably at the Paralympics was when it looked its best, the green football pitch contrasting perfectly with the red early autumnal sunsets. When France was playing there, it was definitely the hottest ticket in town. The atmosphere was wonderful, the necessary silence – enabling the blind players to hear the ball – contrasting perfectly to the raucous disco beats and cheering crowds when play stopped. Women’s WS7 table tennis semi-final, Paris Paralympics, Arena Paris Sud – 5 September Lens 400mm, 1/2000, f2.8, ISO 4000 Bly Twomey, the 14-year-old table tennis player who was born with cerebral palsy, was one of the British stars of the Games, winning two bronze medals. Table tennis is one of the unsung heroes of the Olympics and Paralympics, not getting a huge amount of attention. So it was wonderful to finally make it there and photograph such a brilliant athlete. Early in the game – especially when she served – I noticed how her hair swung around, so tried to find an angle where I could just see the determination in her one visible eye. Men’s wheelchair tennis doubles final, Paris Paralympics, Roland Garros – 6 September Lens 115mm, 1/2500, f6.3, ISO 400 In this photo, the British pair of Gordon Reid (top) and Alfie Hewett are shown on their way to gold in their final against Tokito Oda and Takuya Miki of Japan. It was a beautiful afternoon at Roland Garros, so it would’ve been a shame not to use the wonderful red clay in a picture. I went up to the top deck to shoot down, and noticed there were small glass panels alongside the stairs near to the seats. At a certain angle these panels became very reflective. By placing my camera right up to the glass I could create a reflection that produced this rather surreal effect. NFL Academy pray before match, Tottenham Hotspur Stadium – 8 October Lens 16mm, 1/500, f4, ISO 4000 Cam Winston, the defensive backs coach for the NFL Academy, gathers all the players together in the showers of the home dressing room for a prayer just before kick-off during their match against De La Salle Spartans from California at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. In early October, I was granted exclusive behind-the-scenes access to compile a story about the NFL Academy. Now five years old, this major initiative by the National Football League was set up to provide full-time high school education for 16–19-year-olds from across the globe alongside elite training in American football. Based in Loughborough, the academy now plays several matches each year against top-level college teams from the US, including one at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium when it is in full NFL mode. It’s an amazing experience for these teenagers, being able to use the same facilities as the top professional teams. This picture shows the academy players praying together in the vast palatial shower room of the home dressing room just before heading out to play the De La Salle Spartans from California. England v New Zealand, Autumn Nations Series, Twickenham – 2 November Lens 560mm, 1/2000, f4.5, ISO 3200 The buildup to England’s first rugby union international of the autumn was dominated by a row about the famous All Blacks’ haka. The England prop Joe Marler (never one to hold back from an opinion) had posted earlier in the week that the haka was “ridiculous” and “needed binning”. He later apologised – but it certainly spiced things up. I knew I had to get a good picture of the haka, so when I got to Twickenham on matchday the first thing I did was go up into the stands to work out angles I could get to when all the crowd were in place. Of course I didn’t know at that stage which way they would be facing; the coin toss would decide that just before kick-off. So I had to have two different plans of attack, one for either end of the ground. Man City v Man Utd, Premier League, Etihad Stadium – 15 December Lens 560mm, 1/1600, f4, ISO 4000 You can’t beat a bit of pre-Christmas local derby argy-bargy. Well, actually you could that day – I was at the wrong end for all three goals, including the crucial winner for United. The experience is a familiar one for all sports photographers, and the run of thoughts that went through my head during this particular match is still fresh… City score the opening goal at the other end from me in the first half. Ok, admittedly not great, but there’s a long way to go in the game. Then Højlund and Walker butt heads in a perfect spot for me. Referee – please make this a big moment, send one off, send both off! Damn, just yellow cards. The game is pretty dire, nothing much happening, meandering to a dull 1-0 home win. It’s OK, maybe. But United equalise late at the other end (that’s really not good) then win it right at the death and the crucial goal is totally rubbish from my end (that’s really, really not good). After the match I try not to look in the faces of the photographers who were at the right end. I know I’ve had a bad game, and I’ve got a horrible, long journey home courtesy of Avanti trains. Bad day all round. A match like this just shows what a big part luck plays in my job. Some days it goes for you, some days it doesn’t."

          "bodyText": "Good morning. Israel’s bombardment of Gaza, and the regional conflicts surrounding it, has continued to be the most significant global story of this year. Fourteen months in, reports of Israeli airstrikes that leave the streets littered with bodies keep coming. According to official estimates from the Gaza health ministry, more than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed since Hamas’s 7 October attack on Israel last year. The actual death toll is likely significantly higher. Schools, hospitals, roads, places of worship, homes – nothing has been spared in Israel’s intense bombing of the Gaza Strip. Israel faces serious allegations of war crimes, ranging from collective punishment to genocide. The international criminal court’s unprecedented move to issue arrest warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, and former defence minister Yoav Gallant underscores the gravity of these accusations. And the violence has metastasised beyond Gaza’s borders, spilling into Lebanon, the West Bank and Syria. Diplomatic efforts have yielded little respite, with peace appearing an increasingly remote prospect. A senior Israeli minister recently said the country’s military will remain in Gaza for many years, confirming fears that the fateful “day after” will not come any time soon. For today’s newsletter I have interviewed Wadie Said, a professor of law and dean’s faculty fellow at the University of Colorado school of law and son of eminent Palestinian-American academic Edward Said, about the past 14 months in Gaza. In depth: ‘Palestinians are desperate to have a say in their future’ Hi Wadie – when you look back, what are your primary reflections on the past 14 months of this conflict? I would have never imagined that we would still be talking about this. It would not have been something that I could wrap my head around last November. On the one hand, worldwide support for Palestinians and their national rights has never been higher, especially in the so-called west. On the other hand, the violence is not stopping. No one is hiding the statistics – no one is hiding the number of mosques, churches, electricity generators and medical facilities that have been targeted and destroyed. And the Israeli military and government provide the thinnest justification. This does not correspond in any way to a belligerent power’s obligations under international law. But it just doesn’t matter. Has international law been effective? There’s a real concern about genocide being committed and there’s also an obligation that was imposed on the Israelis to stop doing things that could be interpreted as part of a genocidal campaign. The international court of justice issued an opinion back in January about the plausibility of what is happening in Gaza being genocide. But the situation we’ve been in for the past 14 months or so is that [Israel] refuses to be bound by any standards and any accusation or claim backed up by evidence. They just deny it or say that it is an outrage, absurd or meritless. This discussion about the law and its obligations means a lot to people the world over. The vast majority would like to think that we’re all bound by certain standards and those standards protect us. So there’s a dissonance between that and what the people in Gaza specifically, and the West Bank and displaced Palestinians, are experiencing. The utility of the law in situations like this is to insist on some sort of minimal universal standard. It’s easy to get caught up in the idea that there’s no binding enforcement mechanism for the world court but it’s about changing our understanding and popular perception so that at some point a change can happen, because the pressure will become too much. It’s been frustrating that it’s taken so long but people are going to insist on that to the extent that they’re still moved by these horrors, which they seem to be. Has the inability of the court to stop the violence affected the credibility of international law? I remember many times when accountability for powerful actors in the context of international tribunals for war crimes and other similar issues gets thwarted. I could really go on about this, about the number of disappointments. Look at the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, who was set free by Jack Straw in 2000. The Israelis don’t recognise any attempts to rein them in or any attempts to hold them accountable – they reject all of them. But, nevertheless, these international institutions on which the whole western-backed international order rests are willing to take the stand. It is quite remarkable, and it provides a record and a basis for people to rally around. It’s not just a question about whether Benjamin Netanyahu or Yoav Gallant are going to be arrested and taken to The Hague. For the first time, we are asking: can Israeli officials visit this country or that country? They can visit the United States, but what happens if their flight is diverted and they have to make an emergency landing in a place that’s a signatory to the ICC [international criminal court]? Who would have thought that this is the type of discussion we would be having? What we’re seeing is a kind of a universal struggle to insist on basic standards. What’s next for Gaza? How do I answer that? Obviously, the first thing that has to happen is the violence has to stop. The Israelis have to stop shooting and I say that very deliberately – it’s the Israelis who are doing the most deadly shooting. Foreign journalists have not been allowed into Gaza. We see Palestinian journalists engaging in the most heroic work, along with their rescue workers and medical staff. We’re witnessing some of the most amazing aspects of humanity on display every day, but we don’t really know what’s going on fully in Gaza, so it’s hard to envision what comes next. Some Israeli officials and some in the west are talking about settling Gaza and annexing the West Bank as if all of these things are inevitable. The whole discussion completely obviates, glosses over and ignores the idea that Palestinians will have a say in their own future. Palestinians are desperate for their rights, desperate to have a say in their future and desperate for their own sense of freedom. That’s not going away despite the unbelievably destructive levels of violence that the Israelis have employed to try to crush that sentiment among Palestinians. I would say the overwhelming number of people who grapple with this issue are very critical of what the Israelis have done, but translating that into tangible change has flummoxed us.

Harold Jackson’s obituary presents a comprehensive portrait of the Georgia Democrat and humanitarian, whose diplomatic endeavours beyond the presidency earned him the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. This picture essay weaves together some of the most significant moments of his remarkable journey: “Carter essentially lived in three centuries,” writes his biographer Jonathan Alter. For deeper insight into his post-White House achievements, John S Gardner’s piece illuminates how Carter transformed the very notion of a post-presidency. “Carter’s passing comes at a hinge moment when division, rancour and uncertainty prevail,” writes David Smith. “Biden, a fellow one-term president felled by inflation, is heading for the door. Trump, a chaos agent promising to wreak new havoc in the US and beyond, returns to power on 20 January”."

          "headline": "Peter Wright rolls back years to dethrone Luke Humphries at PDC world darts",
          "bodyText": "Luke Humphries left this arena stunned and staggered, left it the victim of one of the greatest ambushes ever plotted on this stage, left it a former world champion. For an ailing and ageing Peter Wright, the only conceivable reality in which he could win this match existed in his own mind, and over 40 scintillating minutes he set about carving this vision into magnificent flesh. In a way, it was a vision dreamed up days in advance, when Humphries was still the king of the Palace and Wright was simply the washed up world No 17, and the possibility of this game barely registered. But Wright knew what he was doing when he aimed a little barb at Humphries, predicting he would lose early in the tournament. “I’m one world title away from almost matching his career and I’m 25 years younger,” Humphries bit back in jest. But on some remote level, a seed had been planted. And when battle arrived, Wright did not shrink. All the old tics and tricks came out: switching his darts as if they were clubs in a golf bag, refusing bull out-shots even when Humphries was on a finish, showing the world No 1 a magnificent disrespect. But the real target of Wright’s mind games was himself: a daring experiment in manifesting, through sheer will, the man he once was. All that remained was for his darts to cash the cheques his hubris had written for him. At which point, something strange happened. The Palace crowd, often indifferent to Wright in the past, swung firmly behind him. Wright responded with darts of the finest vintage: an average of 101, backed by a 70% rate on the doubles, backed by an impeccable sense of timing and discipline and nerve and spirit. A run of 17 consecutive legs on throw was snapped only by the crucial break of throw that earned Wright a 3-1 lead in sets: an incredible 12-darter at the most important juncture of the match. Because here’s the thing. Humphries didn’t throw badly at all. He averaged 99 and hit 56% of his doubles. He was excellent, verging world class. But set play is about mastering the moments as well as the processes, and here perhaps the prickly pre-match preamble played a little percussion on his nerves. Too much chaos seems to throw Humphries. Dimitri Van den Bergh at the UK Open. Luke Littler in the Premier League final. Playing in the Grand Slam while his young son was unwell at home. Of course he can still throw brilliant darts when he’s angry, when he’s rattled, when he’s distracted, when he’s tired. But he is at his crystalline best when he keeps things simple. What he does not lack, what he has never lacked, is bottle. He kept nailing crucial doubles on his third dart. Kept holding his throw, maintaining his impeccable standard, waited for Wright to blink. But Wright did not blink. He forced a decider in set four with an 89 checkout. Opened 180-121-140 in the decider and cleaned it up in 12 legs. Humphries averaged 108 in that set, and lost it. The end came quickly after that. Wright’s wizened face crumpled into sobs, the facade finally melting. There were fist clasps and hugs from Humphries, a man who for the last 12 months has carried his champion status with real class and skill, and who will absolutely be back. He may even have learned a thing or two from the old man here. Afterwards, Wright was asked how he had done it. “Because I’m a double world champion,” he answered, still hoarse from the festive cold that has reduced him to a whisper for most of the last week. “That’s why. I’m not too old. You’ve only got to play well for three weeks in the whole year. These three weeks are all that matters.” He’ll play Stephen Bunting or Luke Woodhouse next. Wright was not the only player banking on that little nugget of yuletide wisdom. Gerwyn Price is another former champion who at times seems to be physically willing himself into being the player he used to be. He beat his fellow Welsh wizard Jonny Clayton 4-2 with a little fist pump, a mini-roar and just the slightest well of doubt over his ability to last the distance after a flawed but resilient performance. When it’s good, it’s irresistible. At one point in the second set, he was averaging 111. That he finished with an average of 92 tells you how alarmingly he dipped after that point, and a more ruthless opponent than the gently listing Clayton would probably have done him here. Instead he’s a quarter-finalist, a slowly gathering storm, a reminder that on this stage, you’re never done until you’re done."

          "bodyText": "Adam Liaw’s work has taken him around the globe. He has travelled everywhere from Singapore to Scandinavia to showcase the world’s best dishes on TV, and ventured to Africa’s Great Lakes region in his role as a Unicef ambassador for nutrition. At home in Sydney he samples cuisines of all kinds on The Cook Up with Adam Liaw, the SBS series he has hosted for more than 700 episodes. Perhaps unsurprisingly given his profession, Liaw’s holiday ritual is seeking out a great meal everywhere he goes. Here, the cook and TV presenter tells us about the dishes he goes for in each destination, as well as sharing his thoughts on what makes – or breaks – a travel companion. Who makes an excellent travel companion? Someone who makes suggestions and quick decisions, but who can also be flexible. One of my pet peeves when travelling is people who say they’re happy to go with the flow. People say that because it sounds like they’re easy-going but in my experience it’s the exact opposite. Even if it’s trying to work out where to go for dinner, a decision-maker will suggest ideas and put some thought into how to bring that idea into reality but the “go with the flow” people are the ones who will expect you to put in all the effort that goes into working out where to go and what to eat, and then tell you they “don’t really feel like eating that” and expect you to come up with another option for them to approve. After a while that gets maddening. What’s your earliest childhood holiday memory? Camping trips to the Flinders Ranges with my family. The smell of the sleeping bag, campfire smoke in our hair and hot oats with butter and brown sugar for breakfast. Describe your most memorable travel meal – good, bad or just surprising. I was visiting Burundi for Unicef last year and spent some time with the Mamans Lumières (Light Mothers) who teach childhood nutrition in the rural areas. Burundi is the poorest country in the world and we were hours away from the capital in some very remote villages teaching young mothers how to prepare a nutritionally balanced version of a traditional Burundian melange – a stew made up of beans, vegetables and dried fish. It was a meal that had a lot of purpose and not one that I’ll ever forget. What’s the most relaxing place you’ve ever visited? Perhentian Kecil in Malaysia. It’s a small island and I stayed there scuba diving for about a month. These days it is all quite developed but when I was there 25 years ago it was absolutely pristine. It didn’t even have regular electricity and we spent our days scuba diving and swapping books to read and then cooked freshly caught seafood every night. And the most stressful? Los Angeles. I’ve probably been to LA 20 times (admittedly, mostly for work) but it’s always struck me as a place where everyone is concerned with what everyone else is doing. Not a relaxing place at all. What is your holiday ritual? It differs by place and it’s always food-related. In Kuala Lumpur it’s eating hokkien mee on the first night we arrive. In Tokyo I always have rokurinsha ramen at the airport before departure. On the bullet train it’s a katsu sando. What’s one item you always put in your suitcase? An Opinel No 8 pocketknife. It’s incredibly useful for everything from slicing saucisson from a French weekend market, to fixing a broken bicycle in Laos, to cutting the tags off clothes from a Shibuya shopping spree.

          "bodyText": "It’s not as though this series wasn’t already about Jasprit Bumrah. Since the very first evening of the first Test, when he tore up Australia’s top order in the fading light of Perth, he has been both the threat and the act of making good on it. Eight wickets there, nine in Brisbane, still a chance of nine in Melbourne, even managing four in Adelaide when his team’s batting failures effectively kept him to one bowling innings. But watching a sequence of the best at their best, the marvels don’t become less marvellous. Bumrah’s fourth day in Melbourne, where for a few hours he turned the Test match India’s way from seemingly nowhere, was seeing someone at the very top of their game. Perhaps that’s what watching Brian Lara bat in 1994 might have felt like. It’s impossible to talk about Bumrah without marvelling again at his action; approaching the wicket at walking pace, arms working stiffly up and down like a man drowning kittens in a bucket, he explodes into a biomechanical miracle, bones transforming to liquid as he whiplashes the ball away at unfathomable pace and power. Then comes the result, a ball that crashes on to the seam so furiously that it can jag in either direction. Whether or not he knows, nobody else does. Through his first three of what absurdly became nine spells on the day, the fact that he only had one wicket felt like it should be referred to The Hague. He was too good for other players and too good for himself, beating the edge like a looped replay. The wicket he did take was a jaw-dropper. Sam Konstas, after his jumping and japing in the first innings, might as well have not been there. There was no scoop shot equal to this, as it ragged from outside the off stump like an off break, so violently that it took out leg stump. Konstas was doing the right thing with a forward defence that would have covered any normal inward movement. Bumrah doesn’t do normal. One over to Marnus Labuschagne in the next spell beat the edge four balls out of six, one moment threatening the shoulder of the bat, another thudding the batter in the crotch. Next up he almost had Labuschagne lbw, saved on replay by umpire’s call. Once Mohammed Siraj created an opening with two wickets, back came Bumrah to get Travis Head after consecutive tons, Mitchell Marsh the same over with a horrible steepler that clipped the bat shoulder. Then he bowled the in-form Alex Carey in the next over with a subtler left-hander’s version of the Konstas ball. The experience was electric, the MCG rocking with noise as Carey’s bails scattered. The smallest crowd of the Test was still over 40,000. Australia were suddenly in danger, six down and 196 in front. So big was the moment that Labuschagne refused singles to shield a No 8 bat who had made 49 in the first innings. Such was Bumrah’s momentum that Labuschagne and Pat Cummins couldn’t chance letting him keep it going. With application, they survived it. Mostly in short bursts, Bumrah bowled nine spells in the day, but couldn’t send down all the overs himself. Carey was his fourth wicket but the fifth wouldn’t come, first in a long stanza against Labuschagne, then against the last pair when the storm had blown itself out. Where the specialists had struggled, Scott Boland at No 11 calmly middled his defence as Nathan Lyon’s runs hurt India. Returning for the final over of the day, the exhausted Bumrah started with a full toss, before being denied that fifth wicket by an overstep. Australia closed on 228 for nine, 333 ahead. Running through entire teams is almost never how bowling works. Most of it is toil, rarely reward. The luxury of hindsight lets us airbrush the interregna, conjoining great days one to another like some Victory Centipede. Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis are remembered as destroyers, yet went wicketless in 46 Test innings between them. Even the best battle the tyranny of probability. But here we are. Australia’s lead means India’s chances of winning are remote. But the tourists’ chances were absolutely nowhere before Bumrah began his rampage. During that spell he became the first bowler to reach 200 Test wickets with an average under 20. In this series alone he has 29 wickets at 12.75. Only 13 visiting bowlers have taken more on a tour of Australia, and 12 of those played a fifth or sixth Test to Bumrah’s four. He will play a fifth in Sydney, unless his arm falls off from overuse. Five wickets there would make him second on that list. A 10-wicket match – the one bowling feat to so far elude him – would take him top. That is a lot to ask of one player, but in this series India have kept asking it. So far, even when others have not gone with him, Bumrah has kept on delivering."

          "bodyText": "The Codonopsis clematidea smells like a skunk, the Tulipa toktogulica has a peculiar, elongated bulb and the Fritillaria imperialis is exceptionally tall. But to the horticulturalists who journeyed to remote alpine meadows and forests to find these rare flowers growing in the wild this year, they are nothing less than the “jewels of the earth”. Now, the seeds from these and hundreds of other wild plants that were collected in Georgia and Kyrgyzstan have entered the living collections at the Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. After sending its horticulturalists on plant-collecting expeditions abroad, where they collaborated with local botanists to locate and sustainably harvest native flora, London’s Kew Gardens has managed to add more than 300 seeds for rare wild plants to its living collections this year. It is the single biggest introduction of wild plants to Kew’s living collections in the past decade. “Having living specimens in the collection is really important,” said Dr Ilia Leitch, a plant geneticist at Kew. “Many of the analyses to identify plants with new bioactive compounds that can be used as medicines can only be done on living plants, because some chemicals in plants are not particularly stable when you dry them out. So living plants enable you to pick up on things you might miss in dried specimens.” Kew’s plant specialists are still working to identify all the different rare species collected in Kyrgyzstan – this process is likely to take years, since some plants must be fully grown to be classified. As many as 10 to 15 could belong to new species not yet known to western scientists. “If they’ve never been studied before, you just don’t know what new treasures they hold for science, and for humanity,” Leitch said, adding that biochemical analysis of living plants can reveal properties which may be of medicinal value for sufferers of inflammation, dementia or even cancer. “Plants produce different chemicals in different parts of the plant, where they serve different functions. For example, in the leaf, the plant might produce a chemical to stop the leaf being eaten, while in the flower, it produces a scent and different colours,” Leitch said. Kew is already running a project which aims to use AI to predict which plant species contain molecules with pharmaceutical potential for malaria. The desire to find such “new treasures for science” is one of the reasons why botanic gardens like Kew are looking to expand their living collections by funding plant collecting expeditions. “With a whole plant that’s growing, you can analyse the roots, stem, leaves and flowers,” said Leitch. The DNA of a living plant can also be extracted “in the most perfect way” to sequence its genome and look at its evolution and the genes underpinning metabolic pathways, she added. “We can’t do top quality sequencing except by harvesting material from a living plant.” There are also pressing conservation reasons to carry out plant-collecting expeditions. As global temperatures rise, alpine plants – which need cooler climates to thrive – are facing decline, so collecting endangered species, like the wild tulips which grow on the mountains of Kyrgyzstan, is now a race against time. “Many of the species we’ve collected may already be at risk of extinction – but, by being able to collect seeds and then grow the plants at Kew and other botanic gardens, they are preserved. And so is their long term future survival,” said Leitch. Living plant collections are important not only for conservationists and scientists today, but for future generations who may be able to use the plants to make a scientific breakthrough that is unimaginable right now, she said: “We don’t know what new techniques for studying plants are just around the corner.” Botanical horticulturist Millie Woodley collected 209 of the new seeds that have entered Kew’s living collection on a month-long expedition to Kyrgyzstan, which was led by a team from Cambridge Botanic Gardens. “Almost every day, we set up a new camp at the base of mountains that we would climb the next day – and woke to incredible views,” the 22-year-old said, adding that the trip was the toughest thing she had ever done. “And I’d do it again.” About 93% of Kyrgyzstan lies 1,000m above sea level. “What makes these mountainous regions so exciting is the way the habitats and the plants change. You go from semi-desert to a juniper forest to a high alpine meadow. It felt like we were crossing into different worlds, where every day, every population of plants was different,” she said. She compared collecting seeds to finding the jewels of the earth. “It was so exciting not knowing what we were going to come across.” Now, she is on tenterhooks to see what will grow from everything she brought back. The first bloom of the Tulipa toktogulica, an extremely rare wild tulip species which Cambridge scientists officially described for the first time in 2022, will be particularly thrilling, but she also collected wild roses, honeysuckle and rare alliums. “The goal is eventually to have some of them actually planted in the garden and on display to the public.”"

          "bodyText": "The birth of Allanah Crameri and Braydon Newell’s son Lenny in September 2022 should have been filled with joy. But at just under 22 weeks, pregnancy complications led to a preterm labour and Lenny was born too early to survive. “I felt everything from sadness, despair, anger and shock,” Crameri says. “I came across a quote not long after our loss that explained grief like the waves in the ocean. Some days are horrible and you feel you’re drowning because the waves are so big, but then there are days where you are able to put one foot in front of the other and feel like you’re able to cope and carry the grief a bit better.” Following Lenny’s death, the family was able to hold him, and were provided with a “cuddle cot” to preserve their baby’s body, information about support services, a photography session and special keepsake book with his hand and footprints. “The midwives were amazing,” Crameri says. ‘They don’t have to feel alone’ The Crameris’ loss led to Allanah and five other mothers from Ballarat launching the organisation Babies Above in July 2024. The charity provides support and connection for families who have experienced miscarriage, stillbirth or neonatal death. They also recently received a grant to deliver special boxes to Ballarat hospitals for families who have lost a baby filled with memory-making items, self-care items and grief support resources as well as baby items to be used in hospital. While Crameri feels she was cared for “extremely well” in hospital after Lenny’s death, she says support services in Ballarat are still lacking. “We saw the importance and need to provide support to families in Ballarat so they also didn’t have to feel alone or isolated in navigating their grief. Support for fathers is also a big priority,” she says. For Crameri and her family the grief will never go away, but time does heal. “We have managed to find some hope over time once again,” she says. The Centre of Perinatal Excellence (Cope) is an organisation devoted to reducing the impacts of emotional and mental health problems in the pre- and postnatal periods. Its executive director, Dr Nicole Highet, says peer support groups such as Babies Above, Red Nose Grief and Loss and Bears of Hope are invaluable for parents who have dealt with loss. That sense of community and connection is particularly important in rural areas. “Grief and loss is a process people need to go through, and being able to talk to others and understand what helped them get through it can be so helpful,” Highet says. Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Ballarat’s Nabiheh Nosherwan and Faizan Bomassy also lost their baby, Rosie, at 22 weeks in October 2024. “It was really painful,” Nosherwan says. “But we have a belief that everyone has to leave this world, and if she wasn’t prepared for this world, I didn’t want her to suffer.” Nosherwan, who is originally from Pakistan, says she found relief through her friends and community. “It’s not easy when you don’t have your immediate family around but thank God for [our community]. I couldn’t imagine how my two daughters would have been looked after otherwise,” she says. Nosherwan says she was grateful for the support offered by the midwives at Grampians Health. “They would always come and comfort me. They were very humble and kind.” As well as directing them to appropriate support services, the couple was connected with a local funeral director who took care of the funeral arrangements. Nosherwan says they only paid for the cemetery plot and plaque. “It was a big help,” she says. Disparities in care In 2021, 3,016 Australian babies died in the perinatal period. Of those 2,278 were stillbirths and the remaining 738 were neonatal deaths. A neonatal death is when a baby dies within the first 28 days after birth, while stillbirths occur when a baby dies between 20 weeks of pregnancy and birth. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, perinatal mortality rates were higher among babies born to women who accessed two or fewer antenatal visits, those with pre-existing conditions, women who lived in remote areas, First Nations women, and women living in the most disadvantaged areas of Australia. Highet says while some families feel they are provided with adequate support after a stillborn or neonatal death, the level of support available at regional and rural health services is varied. Highet says better education and training for rural health providers could help. “This is something we would ideally love all midwives, obstetricians and health professionals to have access to,” she says. “[Perinatal loss] is a very specialised area in terms of understanding the psychology and how these families have been affected by grief and loss. A person cannot recover spontaneously from that. It’s a process.” The Australian Care Around Stillbirth and Neonatal Death (CASaND) Clinical Practice Guidelines, updated in 2024, provide recommendations for healthcare professionals around breaking bad news to parents, decision making, labour and birth, memory making and spending time with the baby, as well as ongoing support and palliative care. According to the updated guidelines, the quality of care that parents and families receive around the time their baby dies is a major contributor to their immediate and long-term wellbeing, including into subsequent pregnancies. Practitioners are also guided by the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care’s 2022 Stillbirth Clinical Care Standard. But Stillbirth Foundation Australia chair and University of Sydney associate professor, Sean Seeho, says there remains stark discrepancies when it comes to consistency of care across the country. “It is disappointing that a bereaved family’s experience following stillbirth can be so different depending on who is caring for them and where they happen to receive care,” he says. “Not dissimilar to other areas of medicine, healthcare professionals in rural and regional areas also have more limited opportunities for training and education and access to support and resources to provide the best possible care around stillbirth.” Seeho says it is imperative for hospitals and healthcare professionals to embrace the CASaND and SCCS guidelines. “In this way, all parents, no matter their location, receive the best possible care after stillbirth,” he says.

          "headline": "Beaches, beer and a rare suspended lake … why can’t Nigeria attract more tourists?",
          "bodyText": "At the top of the Ado-Awaye hills lies a lake suspended 433 metres above sea level. Local people say the lake is named Iyake (Yoruba for “crying woman”) after a weeping, barren woman who fell in the water hundreds of years ago, conferring on it powers of fertility. This belief in the divine is evident in the foothills, where a huge boulder is emblazoned with the words, written in golden letters: “Here we come: African Jerusalem.” Ado-Awaye, a tourist site as sleepy as the community it shares a name with in the south-western Nigerian state of Ogun, gets a modest 3,000 or so visitors annually. Most of these are religious worshippers who climb the 369-step path to the top, where they camp or visit the lake, which is reportedly one of only two natural suspended lakes in the world. Others are hikers or visitors to an annual festival held every November. But as Nigeria experiences its worst cost of living crisis in decades, tourism is on the back burner. Even Detty December, the country’s month-long potpourri of festivities, has been affected. And in Ado-Awaye, divine pilgrimages have slowed down. “[Just] over 2,400 came this year because of current economic challenges,” said Niyi Okunade, a prince of the community who organises site tours. On paper, Nigeria is a tourist haven. In the north, there is the colourful Kano Durbar festival, the sand dunes of Yobe and the country’s most popular game reserve in Bauchi. In the Middle Belt, teas, strawberries and apples grow in towns around the Mambilla and Jos plateaus, with some of the most beautiful landscapes on the planet. Down south, there are waterfalls, museums, colonial-era relics and carnivals, as well as dozens of beaches along the seven states that border the Gulf of Guinea where small resorts are tucked away in endless tranquillity. There are also spots where visitors can enjoy an array of street food and those seeking the coldest of drinks can request “mortuary standard” beers. On the streets, huge speakers keep the mood electric, blasting Afrobeats and other genres from Owerri bongo to Fuji music. Billionaires reportedly go whale-watching on a couple of small islands outside Lagos that connect to the Atlantic. The River Osun still draws thousands every year, despite record levels of pollution from gold mining. This year, Nigeria’s multitude of stars were joined by foreign celebrities from Chloe Bailey and Saweetie to Tyla and Gunna in Lagos for Detty December. The multipurpose 12,000-seater Lagos Arena is being built to allow events to be hosted all year round. But according to the tourism ministry, there were only 1.2 million visitors to Nigeria in 2023, 20% more than in the preceding year. The figure was on par with Ghana (1.1 million) but pales in comparison to those of South Africa (8.48 million) and Kenya (1.95 million). Ikemesit Effiong, head of research at Lagos-based geopolitical research consultancy SBM Intelligence, blames an infrastructure deficit and an undercurrent of insecurity in a few areas choking tourism. “[There is] a dearth of world-class hotels, especially in secondary and tertiary cities … a siloed hospitality culture which doesn’t integrate events, logistics and catering into a coherent whole – for example with travel packages – and a lack of customer awareness of promising locations, festivals and even the country’s tourism potential,” he said. “Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and even Ghana do a much better job of selling their countries domestically and overseas than Nigeria.” Okunade says that Ado-Awaye is lacking “modern hotel accommodation for the visiting tourists” as well as a lift or cable car system to elevate the site to world-class standards. “Government should invest more,” he believes. In the 60s and 70s, Nigeria attracted medical tourists from across the world but many of its hospitals are now shadows of their former selves. In the absence of tourists, rampaging bandits and terrorists have set up bases in remote areas; the feared Sambisa forest, where Boko Haram reportedly kept the kidnapped Chibok schoolgirls, was an abandoned game reserve. The Obudu mountaintop cattle ranch, a project in the biodiversity-rich Cross River state, and its international marathon have lost their shine since the tourism-loving, saxophone-playing governor who initiated them left office. The annual Calabar Carnival, where the singer Akon dramatically rolled about in a white balloon while headlining in 2012, has declined in status too. Many museums are semi-open, with barely any upgrades in decades. Nigeria has a wide network of underused airports and airfields and an improving rail system. But on one night this month, every conveyor belt at the new Lagos international airport terminal went out of service, leaving passengers waiting for their luggage for more than two hours. Henry Erikowa, founder of Falcorp Mangrove Park, an ecotourism resort in the former oil capital of Warri, said young people were not as interested in preserving their heritage, or working in tourism, as in the past and should be incentivised to do so. “They are all interested in oil money now,” said Erikowa, who has been looking for trainee zookeepers for years. In 2009, one of Nigeria’s most distinguished public servants launched Good People, Great Nation, a rebranding campaign for Nigeria’s image abroad. But Dora Akunyili, the information minister who made her name working to combat counterfeit medicines, failed to get a buy-in from the government she served or from the wider population. Some say a similar but better-run effort, backed by the government at the highest levels, is needed to drive the change required to make Nigeria a true tourism powerhouse. “You have to create a culture of serving people, not just have people in service roles … A lot of that work has to be top-down driven, with policymakers at the federal and state levels,” said Effiong. “Many potential Nigerian tourist hotspots are left on their own to figure this out and it makes for a hodge-podge of experiences.”"

          "bodyText": "For the benefit of the uninitiated, The Traitors is a BBC One game show involving 22 players, classed as either Traitors or Faithfuls. Staged at a Scottish castle (Ardross Castle in the Highlands, north of Inverness), it features a group of selected Traitors who must “murder” the Faithful, while the Faithful identify and banish Traitors. If a Traitor evades detection and makes it to the end, they swipe the entire prize pot, totalling as much as £120k. So, yes, it’s a gameshow, but, as those in thrall to the cloaked global entertainment franchise could tell you, it’s also so much more than that. It’s a dark and terrible dance of back-stabbing and scheming. It’s the pungent base notes of human nature. It’s the cynical celebration of deceit as a life skill. It’s “Let’s turn calculated personal betrayal into a gameshow!”. Indeed, what does the full-hearted embrace of The Traitors say about the modern British psyche, and are we ready to hear it? The Traitors has been a huge critical and commercial success. Last January, with streaming and catch-up taken into account, eight million people watched the final episode of series two, in which (spoiler klaxon) Traitor Harry Clark betrayed Faithfuls – his heartbroken friend Mollie Pearce and sceptical Jaz Singh – to become the victor. Versions of the show exist in countries including Australia, the US, New Zealand and Canada. An Irish Traitors is in the pipeline, to be hosted by Siobhán McSweeney (Sister Michael from Derry Girls). A UK celebrity version is planned, with names bandied about including Stephen Fry, Bob Mortimer, Danny Dyer and Courtney Cox from Friends. Here, then, is one significant metric of The Traitors’ immense cultural clout: the famous (even the very famous) are enthused about doing it. Not this time the defeated trudge into the I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! jungle to pay an overdue tax bill, or the grim endurance of the Big Brother mixed-sex dormitory to remind the public they’re alive and available for regional panto. Yes, there’d be exposure for celebrity Traitors and Faithfuls, and money (presumably for charity), but you rather get the feeling it would primarily be for larks. Thus far in the UK version, it’s all about the ordinary contestants – the big characters (wily Wilf; sharp Diane; perfidious Paul). The insights into the human condition (you can tell a lot about someone by how they deal with the stress of banishments at the round table). Who takes themselves too seriously or not seriously enough? The hilarious self-aggrandisement (“I can read people”). The point when an over-confident Traitor pushes the Machiavellian buttons too hard and ends up dispatched in a puff of hubris. The Traitors has also proved to be a tormented crucible for crises of confidence. While Jaz Singh, dubbed “Jazatha Christie”, rightly suspected Clark, he didn’t think he’d get the backing to vote him off. Castle politics and self-preservation play a significant part at banishments;in the early rounds, it’s evident that people vote with the herd to avoid being targeted themselves. Along with the anthropologist people-watching element, there’s the sheer theatre of it all: the swishing hooded robes; the doomy drama of Traitors’ Tower; the messages to the murder victims that they’ve been offed; the portraits on the wall of the breakfast room, with crosses scrawled over the faces of the departed; the lavish breakfasts themselves, where the Traitors must be on their amateur rep A-game: faking surprise and sadness at the non-appearance of the victim, their crocodile tears falling into the croissant baskets. While the show feels quintessentially British, it’s actually European: based on the Dutch show De Verraders, itself a spin on the party game, Mafia. Nevertheless, The Traitors seems to entwine with our national identity, and even some feudal, kinkily masochistic impulse (the intimidating castle; the autocratic Claudia). It’s interesting how differently other countries approach the formatting/casting. The US version, hosted by Alan Cumming, going heavy on celebrities; the Australians less formal, and so on. In Britain, The Traitors could be tapping into the “cosy crime” wave. That bit of us that still enjoys an Agatha Christie adaptation and a game of Cluedo. As a TV format, it may even have the advantage of being politician-resistant. After all, it seems unlikely that a political reputation could be rescued by appearing: “Oh look, they’re as conniving as we suspected them to be.” The Winkleman factor shouldn’t be underestimated. Having started out as a quasi-goth late-onset ladette, now she brings myriad atmospheres to British TV (ironic/chummy in Strictly; charmed/supportive in Channel 4’s The Piano). In The Traitors, she’s a symphony of tweed in her seemingly inexhaustible collection of upmarket hacking jackets, abandoning her mainstream mash-up presenting persona and channelling a hyper-stern Anne Robinson, with added Morticia Addams and a dash of a minor character from a Nancy Mitford novel. Crucially, Winkleman is not just the presenter, she is also the controller, as evident from the start as she stalks around the table, silently selecting her Traitors, her hand clamping commandingly on to delighted shoulders. Winkleman is both part of the intrinsic ceremony of the format, and (unsmiling, unfriendly, cold) the antithesis of what a presenter usually is. It is to her credit that The Traitors would be quite a different show without her. All that said, The Traitors is far from perfect as a format. Those tedious overlong tasks to build the prize pot are only interesting for the car rides to and from, during which Traitors and Faithfuls plot for the next banishment among the pine air fresheners and boiled car sweets. Still, never mind why we enjoy The Traitors. Should we enjoy it? There’s intense emotion to it that can’t be brushed off as mere entertainment. Clark’s betrayal of Pearce wasn’t just “great telly”, it was real – to her. If this doesn’t bother people, why not? Maybe it’s not such a major surprise: the British public has always had a naughty, even evil, side. It’s also a reminder that The Traitors is, at core, a survivalist show, a test of endurance. It’s not just about the psychology of the game, it’s also about the psychology of those watching – the thing that, for viewers, makes The Traitors more than a sofa-bound murder weekend accessible via a remote control. This is televisual darkness as stress relief. Real life is brutal: perhaps reaching counterintuitively for release in the form of synthetic orchestrated treachery makes a wicked kind of sense."

          "bodyText": "Just before midnight on New Year’s Eve, 25 years ago, Queen Elizabeth II stepped off a private barge to arrive at London’s Millennium Dome for its grand opening ceremony. Dressed in a pumpkin-orange coat, she entered the venue with Prince Philip, taking her place alongside Tony and Cherie Blair and 12,000 guests to celebrate the dawn of a new millennium. At the stroke of midnight, Big Ben began to chime and 40 tonnes of fireworks were launched from 16 barges lined along the river. The crowd joined hands, preparing to sing Auld Lang Syne. For a few long moments, the Queen was neglected – she flapped her arms out like a toddler wanting to be lifted up, before Blair and Philip noticed her, took a hand each, and the singing began. A new century was born. One politician who wasn’t in attendance at the glitzy celebration was Paddy Tipping, a Labour MP who spent the night in the Cabinet Office. Tipping was minister for the millennium bug. After 25 years, it might be hard to recall just how big a deal the bug – now more commonly called Y2K – felt then. But for the last few years of the 90s, the idea that computers would fail catastrophically as the clock ticked over into the year 2000 was near the top of the political agenda in the UK and the US. Here was a hi-tech threat people feared might topple social order, underlining humanity’s new dependence on technological systems most of us did not understand. Though there are no precise figures, it’s estimated that the cost of the global effort to prevent Y2K exceeded £300bn (£633bn today, accounting for inflation). So Tipping spent the night at 70 Whitehall, among boxy grey computers and a small group of civil servants in communication with other world governments. “We watched the sun rise across the world,” he recalls, “first in Australia, New Zealand, right through Asia. There were no reports of any real problems. Come midnight, I was actually quite relaxed about things.” After a few hours, when it became clear disaster would not strike, he walked back across the bridge to his home in Lambeth. The streets were full of drunken revellers, the mood was joyous, and the world was resolutely not ending. Y2K went down in history as a millennial damp squib, much like the dome itself, which is largely remembered for brazen corporate sponsorship, broken attractions and hour-long queues to spend a few minutes walking inside a giant human body. Curiously enough, to this day experts disagree over why nothing happened: did the world’s IT professionals unite to successfully avert an impending disaster? Or was it all a pointless panic and a colossal waste of money? And given that we live today in a society more reliant on complex technology than ever before, could something like this happen again? Though the Y2K threat was voiced publicly as early as 1958, it became a common concern only after the publication of a 1993 article in Computerworld magazine by Canadian engineer Peter de Jager, apocalyptically headlined “Doomsday 2000”. The problem was simple. Most computers at the time stored dates as six-digit numbers, so 30 August 1991 would be 30/08/91. Using two digits for the year was never a problem during the 20th century, but on the first day of the new millennium, the date would read 01/01/00, and IT professionals were concerned computers would think it was 1 January 1900, rather than 2000, causing errors in their systems. A common misconception is that the problem was a coding mistake, perhaps encouraged by widespread use of the word “bug”. In fact, storing years as two digits was a deliberate design compromise made by coders trying to save space in the days when every byte of hard drive storage cost serious money. Much of this early code was written decades earlier by programmers who never expected their software to still be in use in 2000. The concern was that, as a result, computers might get the date wrong, leading to failures in everything from personal computers to those controlling financial markets, hospitals, air travel, military equipment and social infrastructure such as traffic lights or ventilation systems. People were afraid of “cascading faults”, where one system failing would knock out another like dominoes, perhaps compromising essential services such as the electric grid or running water. After a slow start, the UK began to take the threat seriously. In 1998, Blair warned in The Independent, “Ticking away inside many of our computers is a potential technical time bomb ... unless we act, the consequences of the Millennium Bug could be severe.” Others raised awareness in different ways, such as leader of the House of Commons Margaret Beckett, who was photographed cutting a Y2K bug-themed cake featuring the government’s official bug mascot, resembling a microchip with 10 legs and malevolent eyes, which was plastered across Y2K compliance brochures, pull-outs in newspapers and billboards that asked in bold type: “Are you sure you’ve done enough?” Much of the messaging came from the government-funded groups Taskforce 2000 and Action 2000. Robin Guenier, previously chief executive of the government’s Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, led the former and was a prominent voice warning of the dangers. At the start, he says, it was tough to get people interested: “I remember one early morning TV interview when, just before I came on, the interviewer looked at his schedule and said, ‘Oh no, it’s about computers – everyone’s going to pull the duvet over their heads.’” The remediation work was not sexy. Guenier called the job of scouring raw code for dates that might be problematic an “exceptionally boring and unglamorous undertaking” that involved repeated rounds of testing, because changing code could cause issues elsewhere in the system. It was an enormous job. Martyn Thomas, who ran Y2K remediation efforts internationally for Deloitte, recalled the work for the finance division of General Motors in Europe: “We put together a small army of people, rented an aircraft hangar and bought three or four hundred PCs so we could run the scanning and repair equipment needed. And that was just one example of what was happening all over the world.” By late 1999, most UK organisations felt their systems were prepared. But the global media had other ideas and revelled in fantasies of apocalyptic doomsday scenarios. Articles in Time Magazine and Vanity Fair painted a picture of a Y2K midnight moment, when planes would fall out of the sky, people’s savings would be wiped out in the blink of a cursor, home appliances would explode and nuclear reactors would go into meltdown. It didn’t matter that few experts expected problems of this severity. In the words of Anthony Finkelstein, then a professor of software systems engineering at University College London, for many journalists at the time, the Y2K doomsday story was “simply too good to check”. “This was a beautiful, perfect story for the popular press,” says Zachary Loeb, a historian at Purdue University, Indiana, who is writing a book about Y2K. “There’s a race against time to fix the computers or something terrible is going to happen, with an immovable deadline set in stone … if you wrote this in a movie script, it would be too on-the-nose.” Y2K seized the cultural zeitgeist. You could buy A Christian’s Guide to the Millennium Bug or Y2K for Women. Episodes of Family Guy and The Simpsons riffed on the Y2K apocalypse. There was the action movie Y2K: Year to Kill. Leonard Nimoy hosted a video called Y2K Family Survival Guide in which he asked, in front of scrolling images of satellites and computer chips, “How could the omission of two simple digits affect the destiny of all mankind?” Even Raid bug spray jumped on the bandwagon with TV ads that boasted, “Raid, the official killer of the millennium bug.” While some opportunists saw a chance to cash in, others took the threat more seriously. Survivalist and fundamentalist religious groups in the US co-opted Y2K into their apocalyptic ideologies. Reverend Jerry Falwell advised his flock to stock up on food and guns, calling Y2K “God’s instrument to shake this nation”. With hindsight, it looks like a precursor to the conspiracy theorists, from QAnon to Covid sceptics, who today adopt crises to add urgency to their arguments. It wasn’t just in the US. In 1998, publisher Angela Perron and her computer programmer husband hired a lorry and drove from their Wiltshire home to a remote cottage in Moray, Scotland, where they could isolate themselves from the social collapse they anticipated around Y2K. They lived there totally off-grid, with no plumbing or mains electricity, instead relying on a generator, water from a local stream, vegetables in the garden and hens for eggs. Perron’s husband learned to shoot in case they needed to kill rabbits for food. * * * What was it about the Y2K bug that created such panic? In part, there was already something witchy about the idea of a new millennium, even before the warnings of technological collapse. Some historians believe humans also had a collective wobble about the apocalypse at the turn of the year 1000. The 1999/2000 date change intersected with another long-held fear: that our grand scientific inventions are going to lead to disaster, an idea stretching back at least as far as Mary Shelley’s 1818 book Frankenstein. It’s worth remembering that the 20th century had seen dramatic social changes resulting from new technologies, as we evolved from horse and cart to landing on the moon in the space of a single lifetime. Even in the 90s, technology’s infiltration into daily life still felt novel for many. “Doing an email was a struggle,” Tipping says. “We’ve all changed over the years.” The Y2K threat made people suddenly aware of how deeply dependent modern society was on technology. Simultaneously, they realised computers were not the sleek, perfect devices they might have assumed – in fact they were fragile patchworks of design compromises and lazy code, liable to fail at any moment. It was as if you thought you’d been standing on a sturdy suspension bridge, then looked down to realise it was a rickety platform of rotting planks held together by glue, duct tape and hope. As one computer science adage had it, “If we built houses the way we build software, the first woodpecker to come along would destroy civilisation.” “It’s frightening when you tell people they are reliant on opaque technical systems, that these are vulnerable, and all they can do is hope the nerds are going to fix it in time,” Loeb says. “Amid the hype and excitement around computers in the 90s, suddenly this is the dark side.” * * * Midnight. 1 January 2000. 01/01/00. As the Queen and Blair held hands stiffly for Auld Lang Syne, Paddy Tipping waited in the Cabinet Office and Angela Perron holed up in Scotland with her family, most IT professionals were quietly confident that nothing bad was going to happen. In any case, there was little scientific evidence to suggest that the problems would all happen simultaneously at the stroke of 12 o’clock. Martyn Thomas believed if their remediation efforts had been insufficient, faults would already have been occurring en masse throughout 1999, as systems looked ahead to dates in the future. “That wasn’t happening, so it was clear we’d cracked it,” he says. “We managed to fix enough of the problems that it wasn’t going to be a major disaster.” Just to be safe, though, he still brought in a small stock of food and filled all the bathtubs in his house with water, so he’d have a supply of the essentials in case something went terribly wrong. “But I emptied the baths as soon as the millennium was over,” he says. There were two main news stories as the BBC reported on the new year: Russian president Boris Yeltsin had suddenly resigned and ceded power to prime minister Vladimir Putin; and the UK was celebrating the start of a new millennium. “The first babies of the century have been born,” broadcaster Michael Buerk said, “and there’s no real sign yet of the millennium bug.” That’s not to say nothing went wrong. Already in the years building up to Y2K, there had been some date-related glitches. A 104-year-old American woman received an invitation to join preschool, because the system thought she was just four. Five hundred Philadelphia residents received jury summonses in 1999 to appear in court in the year 1900. A New York video rental store gave a bill for $91,250 to a customer who appeared to have returned the John Travolta military mystery The General’s Daughter 100 years late. On the millennium itself, there were many small failures around the world, mainly due to a lack of preventive action, but most were quickly remedied: police breathalysers in Hong Kong, traffic lights in Jamaica, slot machines in Delaware. Some issues were more serious: 10,000 HSBC card machines in the UK stopped working for three days. Bedfordshire social services were unable to find anyone in their care aged older than 100. The monitoring equipment in a Japanese nuclear power plant briefly shut down, though it caused no risk to the public. Some medical equipment failed, including a few dialysis machines in Egypt and equipment to measure bone marrow in South Korea. Most seriously, 154 women in South Yorkshire and the east Midlands were given incorrect test results regarding their risk level for giving birth to a child with Down’s syndrome, because the system had calculated their ages incorrectly. This directly resulted in two pregnancies being terminated, while four babies were born with Down’s to mothers who had been incorrectly told they were at low risk. The NHS issued an apology and updated its systems after the error was recognised. Though these were significant issues, there was no series of cascading faults leading to infrastructural collapse as the doomsayers had warned. President Bill Clinton called it “the first challenge of the 21st century successfully met”. Yet almost overnight, the tenor of media coverage changed. The bug became a punchline. On 2 January, the Guardian wrote, “The much-hyped Y2K disaster fizzled out like a damp firework,” asking, “Has the world been caught by a massive Y2K bug con?” In Scotland, Perron held on for a few months, then left her isolated cottage, and she and her husband divorced, blaming the strain of their millennium move. A friend reportedly said, “It is ironic that the only people who seem to have been bitten by the millennium bug are the very people who gave up everything to be safe from it.” The idea that Y2K was a hoax began to take hold in both the media and public memory. People wondered if they’d been wrong to trust the experts. Some historians believe this change of perspective was a reaction to the hyperbolic warnings in the press, which had painted a far more cataclysmic picture than experts actually anticipated, coupled with the fact that some opportunists did exploit Y2K fears to turn a quick buck. These ranged from tech companies that suggested clients get expensive unnecessary upgrades to fake Y2K remedy discs that were meant to protect home computers, but in reality did nothing other than trigger a pop-up window telling users their PCs were now safe. “People assumed it was all a big scam,” Thomas says. “If you insure your house against it burning down and it doesn’t burn down, you’ve wasted your money, haven’t you?” * * * why did nothing terrible happen? Was it because we were so well prepared, or because there was nothing to worry about in the first place? Even 25 years later, this question remains unanswered. On one side of the debate are the sceptics, including Finkelstein, who had criticised the Y2K fears since the 90s due to a perceived lack of scientific evidence. He calls the British government’s response “an overreaction”, believing there was no major threat and any issues that did occur could have been easily addressed when they appeared. A common argument is that other tech-dependent countries where there was little Y2K remediation effort, such as South Korea and Italy, did not suffer major issues compared with those that poured money into the problem, such as the UK. “Perhaps the most obvious explanation – that they got it right and we did not – is too difficult to accept,” Finkelstein wrote in 2000. On the other side of the debate are IT professionals who feel they worked hard to fix a very real threat, then became victims of their own success when the crisis was averted. “It outrages all the people working long and hard to get the job done that everybody thinks it was all a scam,” Thomas says. “People who win a war like that never get the credit they really deserve.” The problem is, it’s impossible to prove why something didn’t happen. Both sides can claim that they were proved correct by the lack of a major meltdown. “I don’t think we can settle it,” says Dylan Mulvin, a historian at the London School of Economics who has been studying Y2K for 15 years. “It represents two different ways of approaching human relationships to technology: one that emphasises a mastery over it, the other that defaults to catastrophic thinking. The only way to have sorted it out would have been to do nothing, fixed no code, and seen what happened.” The most common criticism from the sceptics is that too much money was spent on Y2K remediation. But much of this investment had long-term benefits beyond 2000, pushing companies and governments to upgrade dated IT systems. “Spending money on Y2K didn’t mean pouring money into a volcano, it meant pouring money into IT,” Loeb says. There have even been suggestions that the fact US infrastructure was barely interrupted by the 9/11 attacks the following year was thanks to reinforcements made to computer systems for Y2K. Looking back, it’s possible to see Y2K as a model for collective action, a rare moment when international governments and the private sector cooperated to head off a global threat. With other existential threats facing the world today, ranging from AI to climate change, we might wonder if, in today’s polarised age, we will be able to meet such challenges with the same unity. “There’s actually something quite inspiring about the idea of spending too much money and making too much effort to fix a problem,” Mulvin says. Still, when asked whether we learned our lessons from Y2K, every person interviewed for this piece gave the same answer: no. While our IT systems may be more robust today (and even this is a point of contention), we have not learned how to communicate more judiciously about technology. “Every new thing is hailed as if it’s going to either save the world or destroy it,” Loeb says. “What gets lost is the complexity of what’s happening in between.” So while the media frets over AI one day achieving human levels of intelligence, less grabby topics with more immediate impact are neglected, such as how unaccountable algorithms are used to evaluate people’s eligibility for jobs, healthcare or loans. * * * This past year, Y2K has been making a comeback. Not the millennium bug, but rather #Y2K the aesthetic, the fashion trend filling the TikToks and moodboards of kids who weren’t even born then. “Now is the perfect time to be nostalgic about Y2K,” says Mulvin, pointing out that people who remember it from their childhoods are now setting trends and directing the cultural conversation. This month sees the release of comedy horror film Y2K, in which household electronics come to life at a teen party on New Year’s Eve 1999 and try to destroy humanity – starting with a killer Tamagotchi. But could a real Y2K-like bug threaten our infrastructure today the way it was prophesied in 1999? There are possibilities of other date-related errors. On the scintillating Wikipedia page for “Time formatting and storage bugs”, Y2K is just one of 44 entries regarding error-causing dates, which range from 1975 to the year 275,760 and even 292,277,026,596. Already coders are talking about the 2038 problem, where it is predicted that on 19 January 2038, at 3.14am and seven seconds, computers with older 32-bit Unix operating systems will no longer be able to represent the time. Thomas isn’t worried about Y2K38, though: “Everybody knows about that one … I don’t expect it to be a problem.” He adds that most systems have already been upgraded to 64-bit, or will be in the near future, meaning they will be able to track the time for another 292bn years. The closest parallel to Y2K that actually occurred was the software outage in July 2024 resulting from a defective content update by the cybersecurity company CrowdStrike, which caused planes to be grounded on runways, errors in the London Stock Exchange and NHS surgeries being unable to access patient records – many of the same issues predicted around Y2K. Though affected companies lost an estimated $5.4bn, the outage was resolved in a matter of days. The world kept turning. “IT problems happen, and most of the time, those things get fixed without any of us realising,” Loeb says. “To the extent that people learned anything from Y2K, it’s that they don’t have to worry about the computers, because the people in IT will always fix it in time.”"

          "bodyText": "More than 1,300 tiny, critically endangered snails have been set free to roam on an island off the coast of Morocco after a breeding programme rescued two obscure species from the brink of extinction. The Desertas Island land snails had not been recorded for more than 100 years and were believed to have disappeared from their natural habitat on the windswept, mountainous island of Deserta Grande, close to Portugal-owned Madeira. Experts at the Instituto das Florestas e Conservação da Natureza (IFCN) rediscovered minute populations of two species of the snail, each consisting of fewer than 200 survivors, in conservation expeditions between 2012 and 2017 amid fears that invasive predators might have eaten the pea-sized molluscs into oblivion. The snails were taken to zoos in the UK and France, with 60 flown to Chester zoo, where the conservation science team liaised with experts in Madeira and constructed new homes for them in mini habitat tanks as part of a breeding programme to quickly boost numbers. Dr Gerardo Garcia, Chester zoo’s head of ectotherms, said the future of the species “was in our hands” when the snails first arrived. “It was a huge responsibility to begin caring for them,” he said. “As a zoo conservation community, we knew nothing about them. They’d never been in human care before and we had to start from a blank piece of paper and try to figure out what makes them tick.” Garcia said the snails “really were on the edge of extinction” and he paid tribute to his team of zookeepers who “spent countless hours caring for every individual snail”. The snails have been released into a wild refuge on Bugio, a smaller neighbouring island in the Madeira archipelago that has been off-limits to humans since 1990 to protect its fragile ecosystem, where invasive species like rats, mice and goats have been eradicated. Heather Prince, an invertebrate specialist at Chester zoo, said: “Within a few months we were able to crack the breeding of the Desertas land snails. Crucially, we were then successful in breeding multiple generations. This was key, because it meant we could then bring in the support of other zoos and establish a network, breeding them in the substantial numbers needed to have a chance of saving the species.” Each of the snails reintroduced has been individually marked for monitoring. If successful, many more will be released to bolster numbers. Dinarte Teixeira, a conservation biologist at IFCN, said: “These snails are incredibly precious. The Desertas Islands are the only place in the world where they can be found and so we’re striving to do everything we can to give them the best possible chance for the future. For 100 years we thought they’d gone for ever, but now there’s new hope.”"

          "bodyText": "Drugstore June I can’t really blame anyone for not seeing Drugstore June in theaters, considering that scattered, super-limited run lasted just a few weeks. (I caught it in a near-empty cinema, on a weekday-afternoon whim, the day after belatedly seeing the trailer online.) But now that it’s streaming on Hulu in the US, you can check out one of the least-discussed but funniest mainstream comedies in ages. Built around the standup persona of comedian Esther Povitsky, Drugstore June is very much a throwback to a time when any emerging comic figure might be awarded their own thinly conceived vehicle. It wasn’t a great trend – Drugstore June’s director, Nicholaus Goossen, made Grandma’s Boy, to cite one example among many – yet here, revived absent big-studio attention (or maybe just with extra love for the game), it produces an idiosyncratic townie detective comedy, with sheltered, self-centered, snacks-obsessed June (Povitsky) trying to figure out who trashed the pharmacy where she (barely) works. Unlike its many Sandler-crew predecessors, Drugstore June has a genuine sense of place, a playful sense of generational self-satire, and an original persona at its center. It’s all the more miraculous at a time when studios big and small don’t care much for making comedies. Jesse Hassenger The Honorable Shyne The Honorable Shyne raised the curtain with a bombshell trailer of the documentary subject reacting to the recent allegation that Diddy actually admitted responsibility for the New York nightclub shooting that cost the former Bad Boy breakout more than eight years in prison. People really got hung up on the pullquote – “He destroyed my life,” Shyne said. But had they watched the whole Hulu documentary, they would have seen that life contains multitudes: a latchkey immigration story, a tough guy phase, a carceral conversion to Orthodox Judaism that leads to him living in Israel and, finally, a political redemption in his home country of Belize. Marcus Clarke, the director, times the nearly two-hour film on the button, tarrying in Shyne’s past without making it all about that 1999 club shooting while also keeping an eye to Diddy’s downfall and the certain aftershocks. The net effect is a gorgeous parable of rugged individualism that belongs in the library of great American originals. They could’ve called it: The Book of Shyne. Andrew Lawrence Exhibiting Forgiveness In a strange, scrappy year for Oscar sure things, with a best actor category looking particularly undefined and anemic, it’s a criminal act that Exhibiting Forgiveness and star André Holland have flown so far under the radar. Premiering at Sundance to polite acclaim but receiving a blip of a release this fall, artist-turned-film-maker Titus Kaphar’s intimate and involving drama took hackneyed subject matter – fractured father-son trauma – and turned it into something real and, at times, rather radical. Kaphar pulls from his own life – Holland also playing a painter who has also struggled with his absent addict father – and tackles the grinding difficulties involved with knowing when and how to forgive. Holland is a total knockout, rarely afforded this much time as a lead, and there are scenes with him and his character’s parents (John Earl Jelks and Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) that are so thrillingly and authentically well-performed that it feels as if we’re watching it live, sitting seat-edge in some small off-Broadway theatre. It’s a tough watch, especially for those of us who know a similar pain, but Kaphar’s unsentimental insights are worth sticking around for, someone who has been there himself telling the rest of us that we can survive it too. Benjamin Lee Mothers’ Instinct How does a handsomely mounted period drama featuring two of Hollywood’s biggest movie stars wind up sitting on the shelf for over a year, world-premiering in Lithuania, kicking around European cinemas for months before quietly opening on a small handful of American screens, then limping away with about $3m? Neither audiences nor distributor Neon knew what to make of this sumptuous genre layer cake, its sincere women’s-picture pathos topped with mannered psycho-thriller intrigue and iced with strokes of camp. Cinematographer-extraordinaire-turned-director Benoît Delhomme dares to take the heaving grief of 60s housewife Anne Hathaway seriously after her son dies on gal pal Jessica Chastain’s watch, which makes for a tricky tonal negotiation as mourning turns to Hitchcockeyed vengeance, complete with rear-projection driving scenes. But does Hathaway’s mommy-turned-murderess merely want to kill her negligent next-door neighbor, or could there also be a whiff of perverse attraction in the quiet moments pregnant with homoerotic tension? As is the case with all movies about the difference between brunettes and blondes, the answer here is an immaculately needlepointed “Yes!” Charles Bramesco Girls Will Be Girls Set at a conservative boarding school at the foothills of the Himalayas in the 1990s – the first sign that it will pick the same forbidden fruit as Powell &amp; Pressburger’s Black Narcissus – Shuchi Talati’s coming-of-age drama turns a familiar good-girl-turned-bad premise into a particular tale of social mores and sexual awakening. The good girl here is Mira (Preeti Panigrahi), the first woman ever selected to serve as prefect at her school, and the bad boy is Sri (Kesav Binoy Kiron), a worldly rebel who has her reconsidering the rules she’s been chosen to enforce. Girls Will Be Girls is a satisfying and culturally specific tale of star-crossed love, but it’s distinguished by the candor with which it grapples with Mira’s newly fired libido. A true scholar, she goes online to research sexual mechanics. Scott Tobias The Grab I am generally conspiracy theory averse – people and plots are usually not both complex and contained. And though it deals with a multinational, under-the-radar effort to buy up natural resources, so too, thankfully, is The Grab. The jaw-dropping documentary, a years long joint reporting effort between the Center for Investigative Reporting and Blackfish film-maker Gabriela Cowperthwaite, builds on the standard obscure, brain-melting elements of international intrigue – offshore accounts, shady private security companies, secret Chinese government documents literally marked “not for distribution in the United States”. But it avoids easy conspiratorial thinking at every turn, instead connecting the dots on the emerging story of the 21st century: efforts, both public and private, to hoard food and water resources imperiled by population growth and climate crisis. From drained aquifers in Arizona to stolen land in Zambia, imported cowboys in Russia to the purchase of a major food conglomerate by a Chinese government-backed company, The Grab has changed how I view news, how I think about daily needs – the start of a story so vast, diffuse and mind-boggling, on a scale difficult to comprehend and more difficult to sit with, that deserves more attention. Adrian Horton The People’s Joker Just when you think you have seen more than enough Batman movies, along comes a film so irreverent to intellectual property, and yet sincerely heartfelt that it cleanses your palate of an entire franchise-load of pomposity and merchandising tie-ins. That said, Vera Drew’s queer coming-of-age story mapped on to a sleazy, mixed-media reimagining of Gotham is so outlandish and ultimately charming, who wouldn’t want to buy the T-shirt? Drew plays Joker the Harlequin, a young trans woman and aspiring standup comedian from Smallville who comes to big, bad Gotham to make all her dreams come true, but there are villains in the city, not least among them the predatory Bruce Wayne. Characters from the DC universe, notably Nathan Faustyn as a chummy Penguin, appear in unfamiliar guises, and yet it all makes a certain kind of loopy sense once you leave the lore behind. As you might expect, The People’s Joker hit a few legal difficulties on its theatrical release, but it is available to stream now. Pamela Hutchinson Rose’s War AKA Baltimore Going by the name Rose’s War for its US release (presumably to avoid any confusion with Homicide: Life on the Street or the works of John Waters), the Baltimore in this coolly cerebral thriller from British-Irish duo Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor (AKA Desperate Optimists) in fact refers to the remote settlement on the south-west tip of Ireland where heiress-turned-Irish republican Rose Dugdale holes up after masterminding a notorious (real-life) art theft in 1974. Molloy and Lawlor have been art-cinema stalwarts since the mid-00s with their quietly fascinating studies of identity and self-actualisation; it’s a bit of a mystery why they aren’t better known than they are. But this one, anchored by an impressive central performance from Imogen Poots, could amount to something of a breakthrough; charting Dugdale’s transition from deb to radical student to committed IRA soldier, it’s essentially a character study, that suggests Dugdale is as much acting a part as Doña Antonia Zárate, the subject of a Goya painting she so admires. A clever, thoughtful film, and one well worth seeking out. Andrew Pulver Sugarcane Sugarcane seemingly had everything needed to attract a significant audience – a fresh investigation breaking the story of horrific acts against Native American children, a deeper historical story of discrimination dating back centuries, top-rate on the ground reporting, two charismatic, compelling journalists to tell the story, and even Sundance’s blessing. It’s surprising then that this film has been so under-viewed. Sugarcane delves into the barbarity of the residential school programs in Canada and the US, which essentially attempted to strip Native American children of their culture, language and history while also exposing them to emotional and physical abuse. It was only in 1978 that Native American parents in the US had the legal right to refuse to place their children in these schools and Sugarcane makes clear the ongoing damage to the Native American community that exists to this day. This is an important documentary that provides essential facts about these wrongs, as well as providing a rich and valuable look into the emotional, familial and community toll exacted against Native Americans. With so many vulnerable groups currently at risk for similar treatment in a second Trump administration, this documentary is essential viewing. Veronica Esposito Red Rooms In his nerve-racking psychological thriller about a model curiously obsessed for reasons unknown with a gruesome serial killer’s high-profile trial, the French-Canadian director Pascal Plante tweaks Hitchcock for an antisocial world. As with Psycho and Rear Window, Red Rooms is all about who’s looking and where, and for the most part, the film keeps us firmly in the grips of Juliette Gariépy’s chilling stare. It’s a fixated look that makes you question whether her Kelly-Anne is up to something or simply dead inside. It’s also the perfect evocation of the hollow and soulless spaces the character inhabits – mentally and physically – and Plante scours. In a film that burrows deep – into what, I’m not so sure – his camera is often scanning, machine like, across the glass tower condos, sterile white courtrooms and the browser windows in which Kelly-Anne books gigs and bets crypto at virtual Texas Hold ‘Em tables, where no one is around to witness that killer poker face. It appear soulless, sure, but it’s also soul-shattering. Radheyan Simonpillai • Some films featured in this article may not have been released in 2024 in all territories"

          "bodyText": "Conservationists have said wildlife could be “disappearing in the dark” after figures showed that three-quarters of England’s most precious habitats, wildlife and natural features have had no recent assessment of their condition. The warning follows the publication of figures covering assessments of protected natural sites known as sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) in the last five years. SSSIs are legally protected because they contain special features such as threatened habitats or rare species, and together they cover more than 1.1m hectares (2.7m acres), about 8% of England’s land area. Nearly two-fifths of the habitats and other features for which SSSIs are protected were in an unfavourable condition, according to figures from the conservation agency Natural England. They also show that only 3,384 – or about 25% – of features had been assessed for their condition since the start of 2019 up to last month. It leaves 10,148, or 75%, without an up-to-date assessment of how they are faring. The figures, revealed after a request from PA Media, were described by conservationists as a reminder of the under-resourced state of environmental watchdogs. SSSIs are integral to Britain’s international commitment to protect 30% of its land and seas for nature by 2030, a pledge made by Boris Johnson as prime minister and sometimes called the 30x30 commitment. Richard Benwell, the chief executive of Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: “The protected site network is critical natural infrastructure supporting wildlife, health and wellbeing, and a resilient economy. But with over three-quarters of sites not inspected in the last five years, regulators will have no idea whether they are in good condition and the government won’t know where it should be targeting its efforts in order to reach critical 2030 targets. “Wildlife could be disappearing in the dark while ecosystems break down. It’s like shutting the door on a new power plant and not visiting for a decade.” More than 5,000 SSSI features, about 39% of the total, were in an unfavourable state in their last assessment, which could have been well before 2019. Of those, 10% were declining and 22% recovering. About 40% of features were in a favourable condition, more than a fifth were classed as “not recorded” due to incomplete data, and less than 0.5% had been destroyed. A spokesperson for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: “Protected sites are at the heart of our vision for making space for rare habitats and threatened species to thrive as well as green spaces for us all to enjoy. It’s why this government has wasted no time in establishing a rapid review of our plan to deliver on our legally binding targets for the environment, including measures to improve the condition of protected sites. We will deliver a new statutory plan that will help restore our natural environment.” Natural England is developing a long-term programme to determine when SSSIs need to be assessed, as well as improving monitoring with remote sensing technology and greater use of data. The amount of land that is “effectively protected” for nature in England has declined to just 2.93%, despite government promises to conserve 30% of it by 2030, according to research published in October. The land figure was found to have been falling owing to declines in quality of SSSIs, which are changing because of the climate crisis, water pollution and overgrazing."

          "bodyText": "Houthi rebels in Yemen claim to have retaliated against Israeli airstrikes on Sana’a’s airport early on Friday with a missile aimed at Israel’s Ben Gurion airport and a drone attack on Tel Aviv. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said their defences intercepted the ballistic missile before it reached Israeli airspace, though residents in the centre of the country were ordered into shelters for fear of falling debris. There were no reports in Israel of hostile drones over Tel Aviv. It was the latest in a series of tit-for-tat exchanges. Thursday’s Israeli airstrikes were in retaliation for a Houthi missile and drone launch against Israel on Wednesday. The Houthis began mounting attacks aimed at Israel and Israeli shipping at the start of the Gaza war in October 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians. A Houthi statement on Friday said Israel’s strikes “will only increase the determination and resolve of the great Yemeni people to continue supporting the Palestinian people”. Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed that Israeli strikes on Yemen would continue, saying Israel’s aim in Yemen was the elimination of the Houthi threat, which he called a “terrorist entity in Iran’s axis of evil”. “We will persist until we complete the job,” Netanyahu said. Netanyahu and his defence minister, Israel Katz, monitored the Israeli attacks on Yemen on Thursday from the air force command centre. According to Israeli press accounts, 25 fighter jets took part in 1,200-mile (2,000km) sorties that hit an array of targets across Yemen. The primary target was Sana’a international airport, where the attack left the top of the control tower a bombed-out shell and shattered windows in terminal buildings. Airport authorities said four people were killed and 20 injured. An Israeli statement said the air force also struck the Hezyaz power station south of Sana’a on Thursday, as well as the port, an oil terminal and power station around Hodeidah, saying the facilities were used “to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials”. Houthi media said a total of six people were killed in the strikes. Katz said after the operation: “As we have said, whoever harms Israel, we will harm them. We will hunt down all of the Houthis’ leaders and we will strike them just as we have done in other places.” The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was at Sana’a airport waiting to depart when the Israeli warplanes struck on Thursday. A crew member from Tedros’s plane was injured in the strike. “When the attacks on the Sana’a airport happened, [Tedros] and several UN colleagues were having their passports stamped before heading to the UN plane,” Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson, said. “They were evacuated by UN security to take shelter in UN-marked vehicles. They remained in the UN-marked vehicles until the bombing stopped, at which time the UN team left the airport and went to a safer place.” Tedros, who had been in Yemen to negotiate the release of detained UN staff and to assess the humanitarian situation, said on Friday that the crew member had undergone surgery and had been evacuated. Tedros said on social media that his delegation had flown with the wounded member of the UN Humanitarian Air Service from Sana’a to Jordan, where he would receive further medical treatment. Israel’s air force commander, Maj Gen Tomer Bar, said Israel had used only a small part of its military might against the Houthis so far. “We are capable of much more,” Bar said. Military analysts in Israel said the IDF would find it much harder to pursue a remote enemy such as the Houthis than it had been to eliminate the leadership of Hamas in Gaza or Hezbollah in Lebanon. The military commentator Yossi Yehoshua wrote in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper: “In Gaza, a two-hour drive (without traffic) from the minister’s office at the Kirya [defence headquarters] in Tel Aviv, it took a long time to find the leaders of Hamas. In the north, intelligence information was systematically gathered in order to put the assassinations of the senior Hezbollah leadership into action when the order was finally given. “Assassinating seasoned terrorist leaders who know how to hide in a faraway, chaotic country isn’t exactly a walk in the park.” The IDF is still fighting Hamas in the wreckage of Gaza nearly 15 months after it invaded the coastal strip in October last year in response to Hamas’s shock attack on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 Israelis. The death toll in Gaza is estimated at more than 45,000. On Friday, Israeli troops entered Kamal Adwan hospital, one of the last functioning medical facilities in Gaza, and ordered all those inside out into the hospital compound and a nearby school, where they began searching patients and medical staff, according to witness accounts. Hopes of a ceasefire before the Biden administration leaves office in the US on 20 January have yet to be fulfilled and winter is setting in across the strip. Several deaths from the cold have been reported, including that of a nurse from the European hospital in the south of Gaza. He was found dead on Friday morning inside his tent in the Mawasi area west of Khan Younis."

          "headline": "My son’s girlfriend has taken over his life and I fear he’s being suffocated",
          "bodyText": "A year ago, our almost 18-year-old son began seeing a girl, who is a year older than him and is his first ‘real’ girlfriend. Soon he stopped seeing his friends and he spent all of his free time with her. When they were not actually together, they were on the phone or playing remote video games. We barely saw him over the summer, as he was with her all the time. He refused to go on holiday with us unless we invited her too, which we were not willing to do . She has a number of psychological issues, including bulimic tendencies and phobias (about school, public transport), and no friends of her own. Before meeting our son, she was going nowhere in life. Her mother told us that their daughter had been making their lives a living hell, but that everything changed when she met our son. She has since returned to school (albeit remotely) and started making plans for the future. The problem (from our standpoint) is that all her plans revolve around our son. Everything he does, she wants to be part of. His dreams and ambitions are hers. Our son is now studying abroad, and we hoped it might be the start of a break, but his girlfriend is planning to move over there to be with him. We are far from happy about this, but our opinion is falling on closed ears. He is coming home for a week next month, but it has caused another huge row as he wants her stay with us for the whole week too. We refused, so he is now just staying with us for the first weekend before going to her place for the rest of the week. Her family (unsurprisingly) find the relationship wonderful. We find it terrifying. Our son is angry with us for not embracing this relationship, and we just don’t know what to do. We can’t pretend we’re happy to see him being slowly suffocated. Please advise! I do understand your worry. But what is it about her that attracted your son, do you think? Presumably you trust his judgment. This could be just that incredibly intoxicating early stage of a relationship, where everyone else is pushed out (but not you, it’s interesting to note). Do you remember back to your first relationship, what it was like and how you behaved? It may help you understand a bit more what is going on now. I went to UKCP-registered family psychotherapist Katherine Cavallo to go through your letter. She felt for you but also asked, “Is your son happy? “The feeling of needing to be together is not unusual, particularly early on, and with so many means to connect remotely these days, being together has become much easier. It’s encouraging that your son is pursuing his studies abroad, and that his girlfriend has returned to education and seems to be coping better. If they are both happy, being emotionally dependent on each another is not necessarily negative. Hopefully things will settle down and they will be able to tolerate and appreciate independence from each other and friendships will creep back in.” I can’t tell you absolutely that this relationship isn’t suffocating your son but is there evidence? Is anyone else worried? And even if this relationship were toxic you’re really better off keeping your son close so that he knows he can come to you if there are problems. If he feels he has to justify the relationship to you this process will take far longer. Plus, “it will also make him more vulnerable to the influence of his girlfriend,” advised Cavallo. I asked Cavallo at what point the relationship may become a worry: “If there were evidence that the girlfriend were preventing your son from having contact with his family; if he were becoming withdrawn or low in mood; fearful of her reaction or started to justify behaviours towards him by the girlfriend that you felt were unacceptable. But here it sounds to the contrary. It sounds like your son wants you to embrace and celebrate his new relationship and his anger may be a reflection of his hurt that you can’t do this.” Cavallo recommends inviting them somewhere neutral if it’s easier and starting again. Try to get to know the girlfriend. Your son is growing up and becoming independent, which is how it should be. Let him know you support him and he can come to you whenever, and he will. • Every week, Annalisa Barbieri addresses a personal problem sent in by a reader.

          "headline": "Deserted beaches, wild rivers and seaside chill: four days walking in NSW’s largest coastal park",
          "bodyText": "The tiny town of Brooms Head in northern New South Wales is not much more than a headland, a row of Norfolk Island pines and a sprawling caravan park separating the main road from the beach. It’s the kind of place with one shop, where the bestsellers are bait, mixed lollies and icy poles. On a day trip there from nearby Angourie, our family lay sprawled on the beach, eating Cornettos in the sun, when four men walked past wearing packs – big, proper ones, adorned with damp swimmers. I gave chase. “Excuse me,” I asked one. “Where are you going?” “To Red Rock,” he replied, pointing at a headland just visible on the southern horizon. This was their second day on the four-day, 65km Yuraygir coastal walk, staying in campsites along the way. It was 2020 and an idea was born. One day my kids (then 5, 8 and 11) would surely, finally, be big enough for proper adventures. And when they were, this would be the place to start. Which is how my twin sister Laura, our five kids – aged 9 to 15 – and I came to be setting off into a raging headwind from Angourie Point in July 2024. Massive waves were rolling into the famous surf break but we turned south, leaving the wetsuit crowd behind. It was the winter school holidays, but over the next four days we saw only four other walkers. We soon settled into a steady rhythm of talking and walking over varied terrain. There were kilometres along wide, deserted beaches made moody by swollen clouds, the sand hard-packed by days of rain. Then sections through the coastal heath behind, where pandanus palms shed leaves in shiny strips among tunnels of tea tree. Headlands gave views along sweeping sand and inland to the triangular Clarence Peak, while cosy clearings hid basic campsites dotted with big kangaroos. After 13km we reached Lake Arragan campground, a smattering of tents and cars accessible by road. In summer the tea tree-stained lake is busy with kids, canoes and fishing, but the only person braving the wind was a kitesurfer on the beach. Five kilometres of sand later, we reached Brooms Head general store, our freshly renovated three-bedroom flat perched above. Keys, wine and dinner supplies in hand, we retired upstairs for hot showers, drinks on the balcony overlooking the beach, dinner, cards and comfortable beds. Yuraygir is the wildest stretch of coastline between Sydney and Brisbane – 65km of beachy bliss on land traditionally owned by the Yaegl and Gumbaynggirr people. Protected from development by coastal ranges and rivers, parts of it were logged, mined for sand and used for grazing until gazettement in 1980 made it NSW’s largest coastal park. Three tiny towns (Brooms Head, Minnie Water and Wooli) are conveniently spaced to offer food and shelter, while campsites allow a wilder experience. The village of Red Rock (the headland is the site of a massacre of Gumbaynggirr people in 1841) marks the end of the track. If you want to continue walking, Red Rock is also the start of the Solitary Islands coastal walk, extending 60km south to the town of Sawtell, near Coffs Harbour. It’s an accessible, versatile adventure, perfect for hardcore groups and lightweights like us who want to walk through wilderness, not carry much and stay in comfort. The temperate climate makes it perfect for walking year-round. Even in winter we mostly hiked in T-shirts, donning puffer jackets and fleeces when we stopped, while the summer challenge would be fitting in enough swims without getting burnt. Pelicans farewelled us from Brooms Head while whales beckoned along the long, wide stretch of north Sandon beach. Driving on this beach (and a few others) is allowed; at first it’s disconcerting when a four-wheel-drive roars past, but it’s so wide there’s plenty of room. The sand was interrupted by one of NSW’s cleanest rivers, the Sandon, deep and wide enough to make us grateful we’d arranged a lift. The manager of the Sandon River campground, Geoff Harper, was waiting to take us across in the trusty Bobsta, a custom-made, flat-bottomed punt decorated with a snarling shark. But first he had a surprise. Shortly before, he’d found a stranded loggerhead turtle and put in a call to Ballina’s Australia Seabird &amp; Turtle Rescue. “Lucky” lounged in a dinghy awaiting his checkup, blinking at us wisely as we oohed and aahed. The next day Geoff messaged to tell us the turtle had lived up to his name: he was fine and would be released back into the wild. As Geoff zipped us across the river, he listed the sharks that came here to feed on fishermen’s scraps (bull, lemon, white pointer) making us even more grateful we weren’t swimming. His answer to the “how far to go to Minnie Water” question was spot on – two hours and 45 minutes – but he should know. He grew up here, used to run barefoot to Minnie Water for icy poles and has walked that leg of the journey 63 times. On we went, past tiny Sandon village. If you squinted, it was like time-travelling back to the 1920s: the front yards of the three dozen houses (mostly fibro shacks) were decorated with boats and buoys, reachable only via the 12km beach to Minnie Water. That night at the Minnie Water holiday park, we were joined by my husband, bringing wine, salad and succulent Yamba prawns to our caravan-park cabins. He joined us for the next two days as we walked along beaches and rock ledges, crossed two more rivers (by boat at Wooli, swimming the Corindi River at the walk’s end), past pelicans, oystercatchers and massive, bone-white cuttlefish gleaming like aliens on the sand. The area feels more remote than it looks on the map, both in location and attitude. It’s still normal to smile and stop for a chat here. Friendliness was universal, from random dog walkers to the staff in the eclectic Minnie Water general store (selling coffees, burgers, booze, handmade jumpers, secondhand surfboards and more) and locals in the Wooli hotel motel (our third night’s accommodation). People offered us lifts and advice and sent updates about sick turtles. But the best bits of the trip were the hours of talking, connection in every combination. Having the time and space to talk about things that otherwise get crowded out, something aided by exercise, movement and nature and supplemented with chocolate. It proved that – surely, finally – we’re ready for proper family adventures. Accommodation and food There are plenty of food and accommodation options, including where we stayed – the Brooms Head general store (from $190 a night), Minnie Water holiday park (from $105 for a cabin) and Wooli hotel motel (from $120 for a single room). The first two are serviced by a general store, while the latter has a restaurant offering lunch and dinner. Other options include Brooms Head holiday park (from $89 for a cabin), Minnie Water beach house (from $336) and Wooli River lodges (from $160). For those who want to camp, there are lots of national park options including at Lake Arragan, Illaroo, Boorkoom and Pebbly Beach, as well as the holiday parks at Brooms Head and Minnie Water. You can mix and match where you stay depending on your walking pace, timeline and craving for wilderness or creature comforts. All national park camp sites have toilets but only some have drinking water – check carefully before you leave. Transport and logistics Either do a car shuttle from Angourie and drop a car at Red Rock or arrange a transfer with Coffs Harbour Taxis (0400 113 699), Woolgoolga Taxis (02 6654 1273), Yamba and Maclean Taxi Services (02 6620 9215) or Grafton Taxis (02 6642 3622). Woopi Connect is an on-demand shared bus service that fits up to six passengers and services the area south of Red Rock. Public transport services are sporadic and require multiple indirect connections. Tour companies such as Life’s an Adventure and Home Comforts Hiking offer guided walks for private groups. River crossings To organise crossing the Sandon River, contact Geoff Harper on 0407 362 118. Wooli River Boat Hire (0439 409 909) arrange crossings of the Wooli River. There isn’t a commercial service for crossing the Corindi River to Red Rock. Common approaches are to swim (only at low tide, at your own risk, after doing your own research) or hope to meet a friendly local with a boat along the way! If conditions are not safe, finish your walk at Wooli as this is the last road access. Further information The walking was not difficult and rarely boring. Care, time and thought were needed on some sections. See the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service website for updates on the walk, including warnings about the dangers of big seas along rock ledges and current alerts about track closures and baiting operations.

          "bodyText": "When an army captain, on leave during the first world war, visits a family friend for the weekend at their country pile in Essex, he is hoping for some sunny respite from the frontline. Captain Hastings and John Cavendish are childhood friends, so Hastings is well acquainted with his family, who also include John’s brother Lawrence and their stepmother Emily. The widowed Emily, we learn, has recently married Alfred Inglethorp, an American 20 years her junior, much to the ire of her children who believe him to be a gold digger. One night, Emily is taken ill and cries out from her bed. By the time Hastings and Lawrence arrive on the scene – they are forced to break down the door, as it is locked from the inside – she is dead. The next morning Hastings announces he has called a friend to investigate: a moustached Belgian named Hercule Poirot. Published in 1920, The Mysterious Affair at Styles is the first novel by Agatha Christie and comes laden with her future trademarks: a body, a detective, assorted red herrings and a tense drawing room reveal. This audio edition, skilfully adapted by Anna Lea and featuring music by Johnny Flynn, is a starry ensemble piece with Harriet Walter as the complex, ill-fated Emily, Himesh Patel as the inquisitive Hastings, who is still in recovery after “taking some shrapnel”, and Baby Reindeer’s Jessica Gunning as Emily’s friend Evie. But the real star here is Peter Dinklage whose Poirot has a rich, resonant voice and a charisma underpinned by just the right amount of conceit. • Available via Audible Originals, 3hr 53min.

          "headline": "The pāua and the glory: cafe’s creation sparks pie mania in New Zealand",
          "bodyText": "Celebrities have raved about them, politicians have bulk-ordered them, local people line up and tourists drive hours for them. The legendary pāua pie – a flaky pie filled with a New Zealand seafood delicacy – is enticing crowds to a remote cafe on the isolated East Coast. The savoury pie may be one of the closest things New Zealand has to a national dish. From the basic mince pie found in corner stores and petrol stations to the more inventive gourmet pies offered in cafes and fine dining restaurants, wherever you go, there are pies. But one pie, made at Cafe 35 on the shores of Tokomaru Bay, is standing out from the crowd. The NZ$12 (£5) pie, a light pastry filled with minced pāua – a unique New Zealand variety of black foot abalone (an edible sea snail) – in a creamy spiced sauce has gained cult status, drawing customers to the sleepy beach community, nearly 60 miles (100km) up the coast from the nearest city, Gisborne. The cafe sells roughly 25,000 a year, and during summer, up to 350 a day, says Sue Clarke, who runs the cafe with her partner, Peter Cunningham. Not bad for a settlement with a population of 500. “It can be nuts. We have people outside the door, we’re carrying them as quickly as we can make them, and people are grabbing them off the tray before we can even put them out.” Pāua is treasured not only for its meat, but for its iridescent shell that shimmers blue, purple and green, and which has long been used in Māori art and adornments. Customers frequently reminisce to the owners about their childhoods spent collecting pāua – something that has become harder to do with dwindling stocks. Demand for the delicacy and shifts in ocean ecosystems, brought about by climate change and increased ocean sediment in the area, following 2023’s Cyclone Gabrielle, is likely to have contributed to depleting numbers. “[Pāua pie] does evoke a lot of emotion in people. It reminds them of their childhood; it’s nostalgic but it’s also rich and tasty,” Clarke says. The former model Rachel Hunter has plugged the pie on social media, while the former prime minister Jacinda Ardern and the veteran broadcaster John Campbell have both stopped in for a taste, Clarke says. In 2022, the then Labour minister Kiri Allan ordered 70 of the Cafe’s pāua and pork belly pies to parliament to feed staff during the lengthy budget day announcements. “That was a real highlight,” Clarke says. “It was so much fun getting down there on the plane and carrying these crates of pies … They went down a treat with the politicians.” But it is everyday New Zealanders helping spread the word, posting their pāua pie experiences on social media, blogging about them and leaving glowing reviews online. The cafe does not advertise and its popularity relies almost entirely on word of mouth, Clarke says. The pie is “black gold wrapped in pastry” and worth an “11/10” rating, according to one Tripadvisor reviewer. “On the coast for a holiday and when we heard there’s pāua pie we thought … why would you waste it in a pie? Well shut the front door, it is freaking yum,” they said. Pāua pies have started appearing at various cafes around the country, but reviews on Facebook regularly herald Cafe 35’s as “the best pāua pie in the land” and a must-try – even if it means driving hours around the rugged East Cape to get it. Pies are an iconic New Zealand dish and “the ultimate fast food”, Clarke says, adding she is not surprised the cafe’s unusual take on the classic has become so popular. “There’s no pretence with our pies. It’s about people coming in, kicking their gumboots off, and enjoying the pie.”"

          "headline": "Japan’s ‘cat island’ falls victim to demographic crisis",
          "bodyText": "The reason for Aoshima’s nickname was clear before we had set foot on the island. As our tiny vessel slowed to a halt and its handful of passengers prepared to disembark, the quayside was alive with orangey-white blurs – a whiskered welcome party that forms as soon as its members hear the hum of an approaching motor. The only human here to greet us is Naoko Kamimoto, appropriately dressed in a pinafore with feline designs, who secures the boat with a rope as half a dozen cats swirl around her feet. Cats lazing in the sun among the Kamimoto’s fishing nets. A 35-minute ferry ride off the coast of Ehime prefecture in Shikoku – the smallest of Japan’s four main islands – Aoshima is the best-known of the country’s 11 “cat islands”. Despite the absence of a single shop, restaurant or guesthouse, this speck in the Seto Inland Sea has become a must-see for visitors intrigued by a remote community where cats easily outnumber humans. But Aoshima’s days as a feline-fixated tourist destination are numbered. A decade ago there were about 200 feral cats here – the descendants of animals enlisted by fishers to destroy rodents who were gnawing through the nets they used to catch huge quantities of sardines. Kamimoto, who moved to the island after she married Hidenori, a local man, believes the number is now closer to 80. They are all aged over seven, and a third are battling illnesses, including blindness and respiratory diseases, caused by decades of inbreeding. “I know immediately if a cat is missing. If they don’t show up for about a week, we assume they’ve gone away to die and so we try to find their bodies,” says Naoko, 74, adding that the location of the animals’ graveyard will remain a closely guarded secret. The decline in the cat population is about more than the passage of time, however. Aoshima is the victim of a demographic crisis that is afflicting thousands of rural and island communities across Japan. Almost 900 people lived here just after the second world war, but the number had dropped to 80 around a decade ago, as ageing fishers and their spouses moved to the mainland, leaving their cats behind. By 2017, there were just 13 residents. Today, four are left: Naoko and Hidenori, and another couple who prefer to keep out of the spotlight. “I’m not looking five or 10 years into the future,” says Naoko. “We just take it one day at a time. But the time will come when there are no people left, and no cats. All we can do is make sure we look after them for as long as we’re here.” In anticipation of the day when the last resident leaves, in 2018 local authorities conducted a mass spaying and neutering programme carried out by experts from the Ehime Prefecture Veterinary Medical Association. While one resident opposed to the programme reportedly hid several cats, no kittens have been born since, according to Kiichi Takino, a member of the Aoshima Cat Protection Society, an NGO that monitors the animals’ welfare. “We’re trying to prevent the worst-case scenario,” says Takino, who likens the island to a feline nursing home. “If the cat population had been allowed to grow while the number of people continued to decline, the situation on the island would have eventually become intolerable.” While the Kamimotos are in good health, there is no guarantee that they will spend the rest of their days on Aoshima, where there are no medical services. “If it becomes deserted in the near future, and there are still cats left, volunteer groups and individuals will take in as many cats as possible,” says Takino, adding that some could also be housed in shelters. “It’s really sad, but I think the people will disappear before the cats. The island has almost 400 years of history, but it will become extinct. The best we can do is to look after them until the very end.” Fumiko Ono, a professor in the faculty of veterinary medicine at Okayama University of Science, says there was no alternative to the sterilisation programme. “Given the ageing and declining population of the island, castration and neutering of cats was the best choice,” she says. Mrs Kamimoto feeds the cats with food donated by supporters. Ono, who is part of a team that has been monitoring the cats’ health, added: “It’s difficult to predict, but even if the islanders continue to look after the cats, the feline population is likely to decline as they get older. It may become too difficult to manage the animals, so we believe additional measures need to be taken, such as transferring some of the cats to new homes.” The signs of decline and decay are visible in the thin strip of flat land that was once home to a small, closely-knit community of fishing families: empty homes with broken windows sealed with yellowing newspaper pages; a discoloured, rotting wooden balustrade on what was once a grand old house. The only school, a walk up a hill past a Shinto shrine where fishers once prayed for safety at sea, is eerily silent. About 20 tourists boarded the afternoon ferry to see the cats. In the afternoon, the second and final ferry of the day brings dozens of tourists, who have an hour to explore and play with the cats in a designated feeding area before returning to the mainland. They take photos and empty packets of treats on to the ground, their new furry friends unfazed by another encounter with a group of cooing strangers. Naoko – known to many as the “cat mama” – is the animals’ unofficial guardian, feeding them twice a day, administering medication and keeping an eye on them while they interact with visitors. “People see images online and think they’re being neglected, but nothing could be further from the truth,” she says. “Some are blind, some are really thin, and others look normal. But that’s the reality for wild animals in a place like this.” Despite their obvious affection for the four-legged islanders, the couple do not allow them in their home. “We think of them as pets, but they have their territory and we have ours,” Hidenori, 74, says. “Plus they leave hair all over the place.” There is another flurry of activity when Hidenori, a fisher, returns from the sea with his catch. Spurred into action by the prospect of a fishy treat, the cats stir from their afternoon slumber, some stretched out on concrete warmed by the sun, others curled up in the shade between disused buoys and decaying fishing nets. “Aoshima isn’t a sight-seeing spot or a cat theme park,” says Naoko, the cats again teeming around their protector’s feet. “It’s still a living, breathing island.”"

          "headline": "‘I thought it was fake news’: secrecy around North Koreans fighting in Kursk",
          "bodyText": "At dusk one afternoon last week, two dozen wounded North Korean soldiers were brought to one of the main hospitals in the Russian city of Kursk. They were ushered into a specially designated floor, guarded by police, with access limited to translators and medical personnel. “We were told in the morning to prepare for a special type of patient,” said one of the medical staff at the hospital who treated North Koreans. “We’d heard rumours that North Koreans were fighting there, but I didn’t believe it. No one had actually seen them before,” the medic said. “I thought it was all fake news until they arrived,” the medic said, adding that most of them had shrapnel injuries. A second medic at the scene said communication with the North Koreans was “impossible” without translators. They added that some North Koreans looked “frightened and nervous”. Both medics requested to speak on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution for discussing the topic. The arrival of the North Korean patients marked a rare moment of interaction between locals in the Kursk region and North Korean soldiers, whose presence remains shrouded in secrecy. Up to 12,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to assist Russia in the war, according to US and South Korean officials. Most of these forces have been involved in Moscow’s counteroffensive to reclaim swaths of Russian land in the Kursk region, a territory Ukraine has held since the summer following a surprise incursion. Russia has not officially acknowledged the deployment of North Korean soldiers. During his annual press conference last week, president Vladimir Putin listed by name several units active in the fighting in the Kursk region but conspicuously avoided any mention of the North Koreans. And early signs suggest that North Korean troops may be suffering heavy casualties. On Monday, South Korean military officials reported that more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded since their deployment alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. This figure, if confirmed, points to a dramatic number of losses among North Korean troops within just weeks of their arrival. (Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, later claimed the number had exceeded 3,000). In a statement, the South’s joint chiefs of staff (JCS) officials also said that North Korea appears to be preparing to deploy additional troops and equipment to Russia. Both Seoul and Kyiv say Moscow is going to great lengths to deny North Koreans are fighting on the battlefield. The North Korean troops have reportedly been given uniforms and fake IDs to disguise themselves as Russian Yakuts and Buryats, ethnic minorities from Siberia with similar physical features to Koreans who have been employed since the start of the war. On Sunday, Ukrainian military special forces released what they claimed were images of three deceased North Korean soldiers. The post was accompanied by graphic photographs of the three soldiers in body bags, their bodies bloodied and bruised. According to the special forces, the soldiers had been issued fake Russian military documents, complete with fabricated Russian names and birthplaces. In the city of Kursk, the regional capital with a population of roughly half a million, the arrival of North Koreans – reportedly deployed to the region as early as October – has gone largely unnoticed. Interviews with half a dozen residents in the Kursk region, all of whom reported no trace of North Korean soldiers, suggest that Moscow is tightly restricting the movement of these foreign troops, confining them to remote military barracks far from civilian areas. Details about their exact locations and living conditions remain scarce. Instead, their presence has become a topic of speculation in online chatrooms, where locals quiz each other about whether anyone has actually seen North Koreans on the streets. Some residents in Kursk have also questioned the narrative that Russians would need to rely on North Koreans to reclaim their territory. “I don’t think the North Koreans exist; our army is strong enough without them,” one Kursk resident told the Guardian. Some of the injured North Korean soldiers appear to be driven to hospitals outside Moscow, bypassing smaller hospitals close to the battlefield. Last Wednesday, the Ukrainian security service released what it claimed was an intercepted conversation between a Russian soldier and his wife, a nurse at an unnamed hospital near Moscow. In the clip, which has not been independently verified, the woman mentions that about 200 wounded North Koreans had been brought for treatment. “These Koreans are elite or something. We clear out specific fucking wards for them … What, are they a privileged class?” the nurse said. “Well, they’re ‘imported’,” her husband responds. According to South Korean intelligence, most of the North Koreans fighting are from the elite Storm Corps unit, which it described as having “high morale” but “lacking an understanding of contemporary warfare”. From the start, military observers questioned the effectiveness of deploying members of an army that has not fought any wars since the 1950s, compounded by language barriers and unfamiliar terrain. Even in elite units such as the Storm Corps, North Korean soldiers are systematically underfed and malnourished, according to accounts from defectors shared with the BBC. The South Korean group Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB) this week noted that captured footage of the soldiers reveal many of them appearing youthful, raising doubts about the extent of their military experience. Lee Seong-kweun, a South Korean MP, on Monday said that the high number of North Korean casualties could be attributed to the “unfamiliar battlefield environment, where North Korean forces are being used as expendable frontline assault units, and their lack of capability to counter drone attacks”. Analysts suggest that North Korean troops have been particularly vulnerable to various types of Ukrainian killer drones, which have become a defining feature of modern warfare. Graphic videos shared by Ukrainian forces showed drones circling above North Korean troops as they scrambled to escape in an open field in Kurshchina, in the Kursk region. In one grainy clip circulating on pro-war Russian telegram channels, a North Korean soldier is seen describing the experience of being hunted by Ukrainian drones to a Russian fighter. “The drones kept coming,” the North Korean soldier is heard shouting in Korean. “I fired three shots with this,” the soldier said, raising three fingers and then pointing to his gun. While the North Koreans had no say in whether they would be deployed, some former soldiers believe many would have wanted to go and would not lack motivation. “If the party wants you to go, then you go,” said Ryu Seonghyun, who defected from the North Korean army in 2019, speaking at a recent roundtable discussion organised by NKDB. Seonghyun explained that many soldiers see it as an opportunity to “change their fate” and experience life in a new country, far from the harsh conditions back home. On Friday, South Korea announced that Ukraine had captured the first North Korean soldier fighting for Russia. Images circulating online depicted a gaunt, severely injured fighter who was taken into custody while in dire condition. Later that day, Seoul announced that the soldier succumbed to his wounds. Former North Korean soldiers say that during their time in the army, surrendering alive was never considered an option. “In the army, you never realise that you can choose to become a PoW,” said Seonghyun. Seonghyun recalled a famous military song entitled Save the Last Bullet, in which soldiers are told to save the last bullet to end their own lives. “No matter what happens, you cannot be a prisoner,” he said."

          "headline": "Gavin and Stacey’s Christmas special was a joyful reminder that TV can still be a shared experience",
          "bodyText": "Settling down to watch the finale of Gavin and Stacey on Christmas Day, I felt as if I were stepping into a time machine travelling to the mid-00s. It wasn’t just the familiarity of the characters or the reassuring running gags (what did happen on that fishing trip?) but – with the episode going out at 9pm and not available on streaming beforehand – the knowledge that the nation was enjoying it together. When we were first introduced to the titular Welsh-English couple back in 2007, a little-known company called Netflix was still five years away from arriving in the UK, while the newly launched BBC iPlayer was creaking on to laptops in Adobe Flash. These were the last glory days of broadcast television before it became largely obsolete, alongside Snow Patrol and low-rise jeans. Then the dawn of streaming arrived, and for the next decade, British viewers went our separate ways: scrolling through a mountain of different services and seeing what increasingly unhinged content the algorithms offered us. Until this Christmas Day, that is. According to early figures, a whopping 12.5 million people tuned in to find out whether Smithy said “yes” to Nessa. This was the return of the “water-cooler moment”, except rather than chatting at the office, millions of us simultaneously laughed on our sofas while wearing novelty expandable pants. The BBC’s stellar Christmas lineup means that will have been a common theme this week, with households pausing the merriment/blazing rows (delete as appropriate) to enjoy long-awaited shows live, including Outnumbered and the first new Wallace and Gromit feature film in 16 years. Notably, the BBC has also chosen not to put the EastEnders Christmas, Boxing Day or New Year’s specials on iPlayer before they air. Britain rarely has these national TV moments any more. Changes in viewing habits and the shift to streaming services mean there are fewer opportunities for shared screen time, outside the occasional summer when England make it to a World Cup finals. Shows that provided some of the biggest cultural impact of recent years – from Squid Game to Bridgerton – were streaming hits built on our own schedules, binged in one weekend or watched months after the zeitgeist demanded. Even the Olympics – previously a guaranteed spot to bring the nation together – have been dampened by the BBC losing rights to Discovery. It feels a very long time since 30 million of us watched Dirty Den hand wife Angie divorce papers on Christmas Day (because it is: it was 1986). There’s a clear generational divide here: fewer than half of generation Z watch TV on a television, a fall of more than 25 percentage points in just over five years. On top of this, the advent of social media and the rise in working from home has changed the way we talk about popular culture. Nowadays, it’s less dissecting a cliffhanger around a literal water cooler with colleagues and more muting 14 words on X to avoid some bloke you’ve never met spoiling the ending. And yet the tide appears to be turning, at least partly. The cost of living crisis combined with an oversaturated streaming market caused the number of homes with services such as Netflix and Disney+ to plummet from 2022 – ending a decade of almost uninterrupted growth. The critically acclaimed series that are exclusive to streaming mean a subscription – or three – is still worthwhile (from 2024, see Only Murders in the Building, The Bear and Baby Reindeer). But the experience feels increasingly frustrating, whether that’s the repeated price hikes, the fact that content is split across multiple platforms, or that it takes 11 minutes to find the “continue watching” tab. Once Amazon Prime put adverts in its shows this year, just like err … television, you had to wonder what exactly the point in paying for streaming was. It’s no wonder viewers are increasingly nostalgic for the old-fashioned primetime slot. When ITV U-turned and put Gail Platt’s Coronation Street exit on the streaming platform ITVX before it was broadcast on Christmas Day, fans complained it robbed them and veteran actor Helen Worth of “event TV”. The episode was a suitably damp squib: only 2.4 million people tuned in live to see Platt leave the cobbles after 50 years. Even before Christmas, there had been a gradual return to “event television” during 2024, much of it on terrestrial. Back in January, viewers screamed at their screens as Harry won The Traitors, with the Guardian live blogging the 70-minute special. The successful reboot of Gladiators pulled in 6 million viewers to watch the return of the Travelator live, making it the biggest entertainment launch in the UK for seven years. Just this month, more than 8 million of us watched Chris McCausland lift the glitterball trophy on the live Strictly Come Dancing final. Meanwhile, some of the best dramas of 2024 have been enjoyed collectively – with the help of some clever scheduling. Rather than putting the whole series on iPlayer at once, the BBC chose to drop only one episode of mega-hits such as Sherwood and Wolf Hall every Sunday – presumably to avoid social media users leaking the fate of Cromwell to viewers who had avoided the spoiler for 500 years. That ITV broadcast Mr Bates vs the Post Office over several nights in a row helped make it feel as if a miscarriage of justice was being exposed in real time – with the resulting public outage quickly dominoing on to Post Office execs and MPs. Perhaps I am a massive luddite, but I hope 2025 brings more of this. Whether it’s giving your flatmate running commentary through Doctor Who as if you’re on Gogglebox or guessing the Masked Singer contestants with strangers on Bluesky, television, at its best, is a shared experience. In an increasingly chaotic and divided world, there is something soothing in the simple unity of picking up the remote, turning on your favourite show, and knowing someone, somewhere is doing the same. We may never return to the days of 30 million viewers on Christmas Day but the small joy of “event television” is worth holding on to. Frances Ryan is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "It is a cold winter’s day to be lying on a beach, but the seal pup suckling from its mother doesn’t mind. A few metres away, a pregnant seal is burrowing into the sand, trying to get comfortable, while a third seal, which has just given birth, is touching noses with her newborn pup. The shoreline – a mass of seals and their white pups – is one of Britain’s greatest wildlife success stories: a grey seal colony on the east Norfolk coast. More than 1,200 seal pups were born between the colony in Horsey and a neighbouring beach in November, and 2,500 more are expected to be born before the breeding season ends in January. It is a dramatic increase since 2002, when the seals first formed a colony at Horsey and 50 pups were born. Standing on a sand dune that overlooks the North Sea, Richard Edwards, a volunteer seal warden, is keeping a close watch over the colony from a distance. “We can all take pride that this is happening on our doorstep,” he says. “It’s incredible.” Why go to the wilds of Africa when there is such an extraordinary spectacle on the Norfolk coast, he asks, adding: “This is Britain’s wildlife safari.” Seals are flourishing about 50 miles farther south, too. In 2021, a group of grey seals established the first seal colony in nearby Suffolk and began breeding on a remote shingle beach at Orford Ness, now a National Trust site but once the location for cold war weapons-testing. “One day, there were none, and the next day there were 200,” says Matt Wilson, a countryside manager for the trust. “Since then, they’ve come back each year, and the juveniles have stayed.” Grey seals are known to form breakaway groups when colonies reach a certain size and Wilson says he is “fairly sure” the seals migrated from north Norfolk. In just three years, the number of pups born at the site has increased fivefold, with more than 600 seals recorded there this year. “Mortality seems to be much lower than in other colonies,” he says. The first seal pup of this season was born there just over a month ago. The 10-mile beach at Orford Ness, which is closed to the public in winter, is a safe haven for seals during their breeding season, says Wilson. “We don’t get a lot of big boats coming close to shore and disturbing the marine environment locally. Also, in bad weather, the seals can come farther inland to shelter behind a ridge.” This is crucial to the survival of the species because as sea levels rise and storms become more frequent and severe, conservationists fear the mortality rate of seal pups is rising. Sue Sayer, founder of the Seal Research Trust, says: “In Cornwall last year, we had more seal deaths than births – and over half were of seals under a year old.” If seals cannot move inland during a storm, pups can become separated from their mothers by a high surge of water or get washed out to sea. Edwards says: “They die of hypothermia or starvation, or drown.” In Norfolk, the charity Friends of Horsey Seals has created a safe, fenced-off area of the dune where seals can retreat inland during a storm, and access to the seals’ beaches is restricted over the winter breeding season. Volunteer wardens such as Edwards patrol the site daily to raise awareness about the need for the public to keep their distance and keep dogs on leads: a female seal, if scared enough, will desert her pup and head into the sea. Wilson and Sayer speculate that more seals are breeding on the east coast because offshore windfarms may have provided a new footing there for underwater vegetation, crustaceans, molluscs, small fish and other marine life, creating a fish nursery that the seals are feeding on. The structures also form a physical barrier near the coast, pushing shipping traffic further out and preventing commercial fishing boats from competing with seals by the shoreline. Another likely cause of the population growth is that grey seals have been displaced from northern Scotland, where numbers of sand eels – which seals love to eat – have declined. “The seals seem to be moving south, and this is likely to be to do with food,” says Sayer. These seals may be preying on other displaced species, such as anchovies from the Bay of Biscay, which are becoming more common in southern British waters due to global heating, she suggested. Cleaner water in the North Sea may also have contributed to the increase in seal numbers on the east coast, she added. In 2021, an analysis of two decades of research by the North Sea Foundation revealed there is now 27% less beach waste on non-tourist beaches than there was 10 years ago. Another reason why seals are thriving in Britain today is that people are no longer hunting and killing them. “We only stopped culling seals in 1978 and it only became illegal for a fisher to kill a seal in March 2021,” says Sayer. For Wilson, the new seal colony in Suffolk is a source of hope. “We do a lot with wetland birds and waders,” he says. “Some species, particularly large gulls, have seen dramatic declines of up to 90% in their numbers, just on our site, never mind the national picture. “So, to have a species going in the opposite direction – literally, swimming against the tide – is amazing.”"

          "bodyText": "Konstas’s joyous, impudent 65-ball 60, a debut innings like no other, gave Australia a grip on the game that they may not relinquish. India loosened it slightly during the last session, when they reduced Australia from 237 for 2 to 299 for 6, but overall it was Australia’s day. And it was undeniably Sam Konstas’s day. 86th over: Australia 311-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 6) A swinging yorker from Bumrah is played well by Cummins, who clips it into the leg side for a couple. Those are the last runs of a terrific day’s play, one that will be forever associated with the audacious brilliance of Sam Konstas. 85th over: Australia 308-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 6) Cummins edges Deep wide of third slip for four. He was worried for a split-second and and snapped his head round to follow the ball, but it bounced well short. Deep gets a move on to ensure there will be time for one more over. 84th over: Australia 303-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 1) Bumrah swings one back into Cummins and goes up for LBW. Too high, maybe leg side as well. Cummins takes a couple of leg-byes later in the over before pushing a single to get off the mark. That should be Bumrah’s last over of the day; if so he’ll end with slightly unusual figures of 20-7-72-3. 83rd over: Australia 300-6 (Smith 68, Cummins 0) A leg-bye brings up Australia’s 300. They’re still ahead in the game but India have done well to peg them back from 237 for 2. Deep ends an excellent over with a good delivery that Smith edges onto his inner thigh. He felt that. Good lord, that’s unplayable! Akash Deep, given the new ball ahead of Siraj, starts with a monstrous seaming lifter that Carey tickles through to Pant. It’s Deep’s first wicket of the innings, deserved reward for some terrific bowling. He’s arguably been India’s best bowler today, even though Bumrah has three-for. 82nd over: Australia 299-5 (Smith 68, Carey 31) Bumrah is taking the second new ball now. Two late wickets would make this a pretty good day for India. Carey takes his innings in his hands by running down the track to chip over the leg side. The ball teases mid-on before dropping safely for a couple of runs. A square drive for two more brings up a busy fifty partnership from 76 balls. 81st over: Australia 292-5 (Smith 68, Carey 24) No he’s not; Reddy is going to continue with the old ball. I’m not sure what happened there because Bumrah looked ready to go. There are suggestions it might be because of the light but then Reddy is a seam bowler and I don’t think the umpires can distinguish between fast-medium and medium. Anyway, Reddy bowls another uneventful over that yields just a single for Carey. “A much earlier OBO post enthused about how young Konstas’ knock would be a thrill for the massive Greek community here, especially in my old hometown of Melbourne,” writes Gervase Greene. “It reminded me how remarkable it is that such a huge diaspora here, ridiculously abundant with gifted football and soccer stars, has somehow missed the top cricket tier. For example, even the brilliantly intimidating Marcus Stoinis, I’m fairly sure, has never played an actual Test match. Go figure.” While I’m all for diversity and brilliantly intimidating cricketers, Stoinis isn’t a Test player, is he? 80th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 68, Carey 23) A maiden from Washington ends act one of this Test match. The second new ball is available and Jasprit Bumrah, back on the field, is going to take it. 79th over: Australia 291-5 (Smith 68, Carey 23) We won’t get the full 90 overs in today, probably more like 84 or 85. Jasprit Bumrah is still off the field but you’d imagine Deep and Siraj will take the new ball in his absence. Reddy has an LBW shout against Carey turned down. It was a nice delivery that jagged back off the seam but Carey got a thick inside edge onto the pad. 78th over: Australia 288-5 (Smith 66, Carey 22) Smith has slowed down slightly since pulling Siraj for six, though it’s unlikely to affect his concentration. It feels like he’s taking a bit of downtime ahead of the second new ball, which will be available in two overs’ time. 77th over: Australia 286-5 (Smith 65, Carey 21) Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has bowled only two overs today, almost strikes with the first ball of a new spell when Smith plays a lazy shot that bounces just over the stumps. That was really close. 76th over: Australia 282-5 (Smith 63, Carey 19) Washington has been tidy without really threatening. The wicket of Labuschagne came from an unforced error. But he is at least holding up an end to get India through to the second new ball. “I’m going to claim providing Geoff with that Mr Smith Goes to Washington line a few years ago,” writes Ray Murphy. “He even replied at the time giving an ‘elephant stamp’ for creativity.” Bumrah had some treatment during the drinks break and is now leaving the field. He’s walking freely but that’s a concern for India; it looks like a calf problem. Might just be cramp. 75th over: Australia 279-5 (Smith 62, Carey 18) Carey sniffs at a good delivery from Siraj and is beaten. A misfield from Bumrah at long on – not his first of the day – turns one run into two, and there’s another misfield in the covers off the next delivery. Oh dear. Time for drinks. 74th over: Australia 276-5 (Smith 62, Carey 15) Carey jumps all over Washington Sundar, slog-sweeping handsomely over wide mid-on for six more. He has quietly had a terrific year with the bat, averaging just shy of 40. “Packing up the house for a move to the UK,” writes Don. “Not a single box was filled during Konstas’s fab knock. Since then we’ve done ten. I wonder how the cloning boffins at CA are going? A couple of Heads, a couple of Konstases and a handful of Cumminses should just about do it! That’s an Ashes series I’d like to watch.” Especially if England had a load of Brooks, Roots and Woods. 73rd over: Australia 269-5 (Smith 62, Carey 8) Siraj replaces Bumrah, who took care of business in a short spell of 3-0-14-2. He’ll be back with the second new ball you’d imagine. Smith punches a nice drive for three; the loss of those three wickets has not changed his batting one iota. To prove the point, he pulls the last ball of the over mightily over square leg for six. This is the best I’ve seen him bat in a long time. A couple of you have mentioned the Mr Smith/Washington line a few overs ago. I can’t take credit for that; Geoff (I think) referenced it during the 2020-21 series and it’s been burned in the memory ever since. Steal from the best and all that. 72nd over: Australia 258-5 (Smith 53, Carey 6) “Packing up the house for a move to the UK,” writes Don. “Not a single box was filled during Konstas’s fab knock. Since then we’ve done ten. I wonder how the cloning boffins at CA are going? A couple of Heads, a couple of Konstases and a handful of Cumminses should just about do it! That’s an Ashes series I’d like to watch.” That brief innings from Mitch Marsh continued a run of form that is becoming a concern. These are his scores in Tests this year: 54, 5, 21, 10, 40, 0, 0, 80, 6, 47, 9, 5, 2, 4. 71st over: Australia 254-5 (Smith 50, Carey 5) Bumrah is slightly too straight to the new batter Carey, who is able to work him behind square for a couple of singles. Smith pushes another into the off side to reach a serene, authoritative half-century from 71 balls. He’s looked terrific. A poor over by Bumrah’s standards ends with a wide delivery that Carey cuts for two. 70th over: Australia 248-5 (Smith 48, Carey 1) Carey pushes Washington for a single to get off the mark. I’m surprised Rohit hasn’t gone in for the kill and brought Siraj back at this end. I know the second new ball is due after 80 overs but if necessary you could leave it until the morning; this is the time to strike. 69th over: Australia 246-5 (Smith 47, Carey 0) Since drinks Australia have lose three for 12 in four overs. Smith is squared up by Bumrah and gets a leading edge into the off side for a single. Again, India won’t mind that as it gives Bumrah the chance of five deliveries at Marsh. That’s all he needs. Marsh drives nicely for four, is hit on the glove by a nasty lifter and then top-edges a lusty pull through to Rishabh Pant. He’s usually so good on the pull but that zipped off the pitch and was on him too quickly. I’m not sure it was short enough for the shot either. 68th over: Australia 241-4 (Smith 46, Marsh 0) Smith carries on as if nothing has changed, rolling his wrists to collect a single off Washington’s first ball. Marsh defends the rest of the over. 67th over: Australia 240-4 (Smith 45, Marsh 0) Even on a day when he’s been nowhere near his best, Bumrah has taken 2 for 53 and is on the prowl for more. Bumrah returns in the hope of getting Travis Head early. Smith drives his first ball for three, the third run coming after a misfield from Siraj. I wonder if that was deliberate to get Head on strike. If it was, Siraj is a twisted genius because Head has gone for a duck! He shouldered arms to an immaculate delivery from round the wicket that came back just enough to trim the off bail. Now then. 66th over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 42, Head 0) The new batter is India’s Kryptonite. But if they can get him early they’ll be back in the contest. The drinks break has done for Marnus Labuschagne. He charged the first ball of the next over and swished a drive towards mid-off, where Kohli leapt to take a good catch. Labuschagne leaves the field in a manner that almost redefines the phrase “trudging off”; he can’t believe he’s given his wicket away like that. 65th over: Australia 237-2 (Labuschagne 72, Smith 42) Yikes. Out of nothing, Deep gets one to spit from a length and beat Labuschagne. It straightened a touch as well, which might actually have saved Labuschagne. This has been an impressive old-ball spell from Deep, one that deserves better than figures of 6-1-26-0. 64th over: Australia 233-2 (Labuschagne 69, Smith 41) Mr Smith goes after Washington, charging down the pitch to blast a straight drive for four. This is looking very ominous for India, not just in this game but also ahead of the Sydney Test. Khawaja, Labuschagne and Smith are all in a far better place than they were at the start of the series. 63rd over: Australia 226-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 36) Labuschagne and Smith are the most prolific third-wicket partnership in Australian Test history, with around 2350 runs at an average of 60. It’s been a while since their last century stand, though, which was at Lord’s in 2023. They may rectify that in the next hour. Smith mistimes a pull over midwicket for three to take the partnership to 72. “Is there any shade on the ground?” says Adam Humphries. “If there is, I’d be parking Bumrah in it and bringing him on late in the day. Seems to be the Aussies’ day, but the visitors might get a bit lucky as the finish of play approaches with a rested strike bowler.” It must be so difficult to resist the temptation to bowl him, especially when you’re in as much trouble as India are here. I agree, though; I’d be inclined to let him rest until either the second new ball is available or Travis Head arrives at the crease. 62nd over: Australia 223-2 (Labuschagne 67, Smith 33) Washington appeals unsuccessfully for LBW when Labuschagne misses a reverse sweep. Scratch that, replays show he gloved it. Rohit looked slightly more inclined to review that than the Deep appeal, but not with only one left. 61st over: Australia 221-2 (Labuschagne 66, Smith 32) For the third time in this spell, Deep begs Joel Wilson to give Smith out LBW. It was a good delivery which straightened off the seam to hit Smith on the back leg, but it looked quite high and there’s no chance Rohit Sharma can risk his last review on that. Replays confirm it was bouncing over and was probably going down leg. A maiden from Deep, perhaps his best over to date, includes a beauty that beats Smith outside off. 60th over: Australia 221-2 (Labuschagne 66, Smith 32) Washington Sundar replces Jadeja, who grazes with figures of 14-2-54-1. Four singles from the over, all taken with minimal risk. It feels like India are entering a world of pain. 59th over: Australia 217-2 (Labuschagne 64, Smith 30) Deep beats Labuschagne with a clever wide outswinger. Given Labuschagne’s recent struggles, it’s odd that India haven’t tempted himwith more deliveries like that. Runs continue to flow, with 40 in six overs since tea. Labuschagne pulls for three, Smith fences through the slips for three more and then a Bumrah misfield gives Labuschagne a second run. “Hey Rob, multicultural crowd of over 80,000,” says Ray Murphy. “Is there a better Leviathan-sized ground in the world to watch cricket?” I’m probably not the best person to ask, but none come to mind. 58th over: Australia 208-2 (Labuschagne 58, Smith 27) Smith rocks back to cart Jadeja wide of mid-on for four more. That brings up a ruthless fifty partnership from 82 balls; Smith celebrates by mauling the next delivery back over Jadeja’s head for four more. 57th over: Australia 199-2 (Labuschagne 57, Smith 19) I’m not sure Rohit would have reviewed that if the score was, say, 50 for 2. It was on the desperate side of optimistic. Smith is not out! Smith shuffled a long way across, missed a flick to leg and was hit on the knee roll. But it was doing too much and would have missed leg stump, so India are down to their last review. India review for LBW against Smith! Deep has another huge LBW shout turned down, but this time Rohit goes upstairs. My hunch is umpire’s call on line, though it’s really close. 56th over: Australia 197-2 (Labuschagne 56, Smith 19) Labuschagne, who is batting with increasing fluency, glides Jadeja for two and then spanks an inside-out drive to the extra-cover boundary. Lovely batting. India have got problems. 55th over: Australia 190-2 (Labuschagne 50, Smith 18) Akash Deep, on for Bumrah, has a big LBW shout against Smith first ball. It’s turned down by Joel Wilson and Rohit Sharma declines a review because of height. It was pretty close, mind, and would have been umpire’s call had they gone upstairs. Smith takes seven from two deliveries later in the over, flicking to fine leg and driving three more through extra cover. Labuschagne fiddles a couple through the slips to reach a vital, hard-fought fifty from 114 balls. Australia are in such a good position here. 54th over: Australia 181-2 (Labuschagne 48, Smith 11) Labuschagne sets the agenda for the evening session by running down the track to slap Jadeja over mid-on for four. While it’s too early to be talking about a 12th Test hundred, he does look comfortable out there. The players are back out there. It’ll be an extended evening session, with 37 overs still to be bowled. Ravindra Jadeja will take care of the first. Teatime reading A cracking piece here from Jack Snape on a debut innings like no other. More than anything, Konstas had belied expectation. On debut, against Bumrah, in the first session on Boxing Day, it should be not be possible to play the way Konstas did. He charged down the pitch to Siraj short of a length, cut a middle stump-bound yorker for four, and produced more ramps than Arisa Trew’s backyard. 53rd over: Australia 176-2 (Labuschagne 44, Smith 10) Finally, on the stroke of tea, Washington Sundar comes on to bowl. He starts around the wicket with a slip, leg slip and short leg. Labuschagne is beaten by a good delivery that zips across him from round the wicket, then strides forward to drive classily to the long-off boundary. That’s the end of a good session for Australia, who consolidated the work of Sam Konstas by scoring 64 runs in 28 overs for the loss of Usman Khawaja. India’s tiring bowlers are facing the prospect of a Headache in the evening session. 52nd over: Australia 171-2 (Labuschagne 40, Smith 9) It feels like Australia have weathered the brief storm that followed Khawaja’s unexpected dismissal. Jadeja, who is bowling accurately but with little help from the pitch, is milked for three singles. 51st over: Australia 168-2 (Labuschagne 39, Smith 7) Labuschagne and Smith are taking no risks against Bumrah, unlike Sam Konstas earlier in the day. I’m wary of recency bias but all but we’ll surely reflect on that as one of the most audacious debut innings ever played. Kevin Pietersen dumping Glenn McGrath back over his head for six comes to mind, but he was 25, not 19. Ashton Agar’s 98 was awesome in a different way. 50th over: Australia 165-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 6) Smith mistimes a pull off Jadeja but it beats Sundar at mid-on and runs away for four. Just under ten minutes to go until tea; as things stand it’s Australia’s session. 49th over: Australia 161-2 (Labuschagne 38, Smith 2) Bumrah snaps an absolute jaffa past Labuschagne’s outside edge. Kohli appealed from slip but nobody else was interested. This is a good spell for India, who are building some pressure, and Australia will be happy to get to tea without losing any more wickets. A yorker from wide on the crease is jabbed into the ground and over gully for a couple by Labuschagne, who flicks two more behind square to end the over. 48th over: Australia 157-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 2) Smith drives Jadeja for a couple to get off the mark. “Always love the almost poetic description we get from you,” writes Mark in Cleveland, though I should stress he’s talking about Geoff rather than me. “This piece from earlier only needed a tweak to become a first innings Haiku. Khawaja this time. Stretching for a ball, to slip? Again, Deep sorrow. 47th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Bumrah tries an elaborate off-break that is defended by Labuschagne, then walks back to his mark smiling at anything and everything. Geniuses are rarely as happy-go-lucky as Bumrah. Another maiden ends with Labuschagne edging a good one short of slip. Labuschagne has slowed down as his innings has progressed: 21 from the first 43 balls, 13 from the next 47. 46th over: Australia 155-2 (Labuschagne 34, Smith 0) Jadeja is bowling very straight to the right-handers as usual, with a slip and short leg in place. Labuschagne waves a quick single to mid-off and Smith defends the last two balls. 45th over: Australia 154-2 (Labuschagne 33, Smith 0) That’s such a bonus for India, especially as Bumrah is at the start of his spell and could do some game-changing damage. The new batter Steve Smith nicks his fourth ball on the bounce to second slip, a lovely delivery that squared him up. A wicket maiden. “T20 has ruined Test cricket,” writes Simon T. “Should’ve seen off the new ball with solid defensives or (preferably) studious leaves. Good luck to the young fella but I’ve hardly settled in to my salmon sarnies &amp; Chardonnay…” Jasprit Bumrah strikes with the first ball of a new spell! It was a rancid delivery, short on leg stump, but Khawaja was through his pull shot too early and toe-ended it in slow motion to midwicket. Bumrah puts his hands over his face in mock-embarrassment. All those snorters he bowled this morning and he gets a wicket with that. 44th over: Australia 154-1 (Khawaja 57, Labuschagne 33) Labuschagne dances down to Jadeja, is nowhere near the pitch and switches to a defensive stroke. A maiden. 43rd over: Australia 154-1 (Khawaja 57, Labuschagne 33) Labuschagne times Siraj sweetly through mid-off, the first boundary in eight overs, anf dollows up with a clip through midwicket for three. Australia are in such a good position, one that would have been unimaginable this morning when seven of the first 10 deliveries went past the outside edge. 42nd over: Australia 146-1 (Khawaja 56, Labuschagne 26) Labuschagne waves Jadeja inside out for a couple to extend this methodical second-wicket partnership to 57. This is such a great opportunity for Australia to take control of the match and series. Perth is starting to seem forever ago. 41st over: Australia 143-1 (Khawaja 55, Labuschagne 24) Khawaja, who is back in his bubble after three difficult Tests, flicks Siraj for another single. Labuschagne drops another on the off side and Khawaja flicks a third to fine leg., Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy, ostensibly picked as bowling allrounders, have bowled two overs between them. If India lose this series they will lament some peculiar selections. That said, they are desperately missing Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Shami. “A decade or so ago there was a lot of online action around watermelon boy,” writes Pete. “Has there been another fruit-based crowd hero since? I’ll be on the lookout from my couch today.” He’s not among the crowd but Sam Konstas blew a few raspberries in India’s direction. 40th over: Australia 140-1 (Khawaja 53, Labuschagne 23) Jadeja spits one past Labuschagne, who was beaten more by the bounce than the turn as he tried to cut. He decides to take precisely no risks for the remainder of the over. “Christmas Day here in North Carolina,” write Alex and Katelyn. “The first time I told my half-Swedish, half-American partner I loved her was during an Australia-Pakistan match last year and we are freshly engaged sitting down to watch a spot of today’s action. No sound on, as a compromise.” That’s really rather lovely. Congratulations! 39th over: Australia 140-1 (Khawaja 53, Labuschagne 23) Khawaja flicks Siraj through square leg for a single; Labuschagne steals another on the off side. You never know with such things but it does feel like Konstas deserves an assist for some of these runs; from an Australian batting perspective, his innings has changed the mood of the whole series. Thanks Geoff, hello everyone. Any chance we can pause this match and relive Sam Konstas’s knock again? There have been something like 91,515 innings played in Test cricket; few, if any, were as eye-catchingly unique as Konstas’s 60. 38th over: Australia 138-1 (Khawaja 52, Labuschagne 22) The medium mediums of Nitish Kumar Reddy frighten nobody, especially when he bowls a bouncer that Labuschagne happily ducks, genuflecting. Wendy Cowling has finished off dinner recently. “Mixture of fruity and nutty Christmas pudding with top-quality vanilla ice cream - was a great success, although a brother-in-law poked at his serving after the first spoonful and in a suspicious voice said: ‘I think this has spices in it.’” Mystifies me how some people live their lives afraid of any food that isn’t a petrol station sausage roll. Drinks break. From here, your guide will be Rob Smyth. Please direct to him your emails, and hopefully he’s not blocked from his inbox by a rogue workplace router. 37th over: Australia 137-1 (Khawaja 51, Labuschagne 22) Siraj again, flying down the leg side. It feels like with Konstas having made the runs, these two can just squash the life out of India’s fast bowlers, then the rest can come in and profit. Trouble looming for India if they don’t break this pairing soon. Siraj settles for trying to break Labuschagne’s pair, again zeroing in on the testicles. If only someone hung a box on middle stump, Siraj might bowl full enough to hit it. 36th over: Australia 136-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 22) Very late in the piece, India’s fourth seamer has a shot. Innocuous first offering in the 120s. 35th over: Australia 134-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 21) Struck again by Siraj is Labuschagne, though this time mercifully it misses the box and hits more thigh. It draws an error to follow, a top-edged hook shot that lands safe and picks up four runs fine. It’s all going Australia’s way today, aside from the nut shots. Then a couple to square, and another near collision as Labuschagne dashes a single and clips Siraj, who gives him a long look. “Is Marnus channeling Wally Grout here?” asks Greg Wood. “Don’t rub em, just count ‘em?” 34th over: Australia 123-1 (Khawaja 50, Labuschagne 14) Khawaja moves again, a lovely on drive from a rare overpitched Deep delivery. Rather more streaky as he reaches for a rising ball and slices it between slip and gully. Konstas reached fifty in 52 balls, Khawaja in almost twice as many. Neil Brandom is far from Melbourne. “It’s Christmas afternoon in Orange County, California. We get the sketchy Fox coverage through Willow. More importantly, your OBO alerts me to sneak away from our Christmas gathering (who know nothing of cricket) to watch highlights.” Tactical, I like it. 33rd over: Australia 119-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 14) Straight in the bowl of Jatz crackers there from Siraj, who is booed as he starts a new spell. Labuschagne the unlucky wearer of the contact, and he makes it two on two the next ball! This time he’s down for longer, on his knees on the pitch. He looks up to Siraj with a rueful smile, as if to say, would you mind aiming somewhere else? Good inward movement from Siraj, but if I may repeat a point, the length isn’t threatening the stumps. It’s only threatening a length. Labuschagne needs a physio visit after the second blow, really just to give him time for a drink and a breather while he pretends to have a chat. 32nd over: Australia 119-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 14) The nicks aren’t carrying. Khawaja this time, stretching for a ball, short of slip. Again, Deep sorrow. 31st over: Australia 118-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 13) An overstep for Bumrah in the over, his first of those today, though his rhythm is still good enough to get an edge from Labuschagne from a different ball. It doesn’t carry to slip though. “Slumped in front of the telly is the only way to spend Boxing Day. The swirling heat outside makes it even better, though that’s tempered by the thought of those facing a fire threat in western Victoria,” writes David Meiklejohn. “Question: is Kohli in trouble? Or are the conspiracy theorists (ICC=BCCI) right and he’ll get off with a light slap on the wrist?” Well, it’s not a conspiracy theory when it’s demonstrably true, as that contention is. The Indian board sets terms at ICC meetings and the others are financially obliged to accede. So, the chance of Kohli being suspended is non-existent. If he were to be, India would probably refuse to play in Sydney and CA would be out millions of dollars. He might get some demerit points. 30th over: Australia 116-1 (Khawaja 42, Labuschagne 12) Runs at last! Four of them, Khawaja getting a full piece of a pull shot off a fast bowler for the first time today. Out through midwicket. Thoroughly beaten on the next two balls though, trying to drive. Deep is coming around the wicket and seaming the ball away. Gosh, he’s been an unlucky bowler in this series. Beats Khawaja a third time, again forcing the rabbit hop on the crease. I can’t fathom how that movement helps the batter control a shot. Any batting coaches out there, drop us a line. 29th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Four maidens in a row. Labuschagne handles Bumrah watchfully but without any alarms in this over, trying to defend incoming balls to leg, trying to leave outside off. 28th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Deep is giving Khawaja a hard time. Another ball that beats him, another jumping fend at it. There is still enough there for the bowlers, but India can’t break through. Three overs since lunch, no run. 27th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Bumrah from the Shane Warne Stand End. Rides his little imaginary horse up to the crease, then catapults. Labuschagne gets one off the gloves trying to glance, then one towards gully trying to press. Another appeal for a leg-side catch but nobody except Bumrah thinks there was a touch. In fact that was miles from the glove. Rohit pretends to review and then pulls out, laughing. 26th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) We’re back with Akash Deep, and it’s another maiden, in that groove outside Khawaja’s off stump. The opener is still playing on his toes a lot of the time. Trying to catch up on a few emails. One from Ibby Usman, before the break. “That’s absolutely embarrassing from Kohli. 35 years old, tens of thousands of runs, however many centuries, and he’s shoulder barging a 19 year old, then playing the victim. Never thought I’d say this, but I wish Warner was out there when that happened.” I generally try not to make assumptions about what players are thinking, rather than doing, but it’s hard to see how Kohli could have been genuinely surprised by the contact after walking towards the other player. We’re about to resume after lunch. It’s still hot and still cloudy in Melbourne. India need to find a way to get some equilibrium back after that break. Shiona Biswas is feeling upbeat. “It’s a working holiday season for me albeit while also spending time with old friends. Having grown up on the other side of the world in India, tuning in to the Boxing Day test brings me extra cheer today.” Glad to hear that. What a session. A hundred runs in it, Australia already on top, and it came from an injection of what could be deemed audacity or foolishness, depending on your view, that was undeniably allied with a lot of skill. Sam Konstas said that he would take on Bumrah and take on India, and he did: scooping, ramping, reversing, charging, all of the above. It won’t always work, and it very nearly didn’t work a number of times here, but it got him a score and it got Australia the impetus. Now they have a big advantage on which to build a lead. 25th over: Australia 112-1 (Khawaja 38, Labuschagne 12) Two more for Khawaja off the outside edge, he’s building a handy score here. He needs one, and it needs to be bigger than this. It’s still cloudy at the G, as Bumrah gets bounce and Khawaja fends it away, lucky that it goes to ground. The clock ticks past lunch time. Khawaja glances a run. Bumrah appeals for a leg-side catch from Labuschagne, but no dice. And that’s that. 24th over: Australia 109-1 (Khawaja 35, Labuschagne 12) Deep rolls back in, Labuschagne wristing two runs through midwicket. Khawaja drives what should be one but Siraj misfields at mid off, conceding three. “In all of the Konstas hype, can we not add that he is debuting in the city with the largest Greek population outside Greece, and about the sixth or seventh largest with Greece included? I hope everyone is raising a spanakopita to him in Melissa’s Cafe, Smith Street, my first stop every time I am in Melbourne.” We can add that, Peter Salmon, this is an open forum. Wait, that’s Roman. Lucky I’m not agora phobic. We did a homemade spanakopita for Christmas lunch, it was top notch. 23rd over: Australia 103-1 (Khawaja 32, Labuschagne 9) Bumrah back for a quick burst before lunch, maybe two overs, and he’s nasty immediately. Two balls in a row leaping at Khawaja’s gloves, played off the handle almost as the batter flinches. Then pad, but via an inside edge. No run from the over. Sam Konstas is down at the edge of the player’s race signing shirts and taking selfies. Why not? The crowd wave is circling the ground. Atmosphere here is top notch. 22nd over: Australia 103-1 (Khawaja 32, Labuschagne 9) Jadeja to Labuschagne, a deft late cut brings four runs. Next ball, another one, finer! Bumping up the scoreboard close to lunch. I’ve finally worked out how to route some emails off my phone through about three other intermediaries to have them show up as text messages. Every other website at the MCG is blocked, somehow. Anyway, here’s an expert on my opening subject: his name is Russell Yule. “My great-great grandfather emigrated from a Scandinavian state a while back to England before my great grandfather emigrated to Queensland in the early 1900s. Our family name was changed to ‘Yule’ because the original ‘Juïlle’ wasn’t, ahem, gaining traction, so great granddad went with a phonetic spelling. My understanding is that the Yule log was a large log that had been chosen based on its ability to burn for a long time. This was to celebrate a Pagan winter solstice celebration in the long hall where the party would last as long as the log was burning. Generally it was considered poor form if the log burnt out in less than 8 days. If you’re snowbound for a while, you might as well enjoy it… There are some sacrifices to be made. The Yule Goat (or reindeer buck) was a big part of the celebration in order to safeguard the New Year harvest. There was also a pig sacrifice as well but since the wet blankets at head office decided that sacrificing live animals was not okay, sacrifices were made. Smaller Yule Goat ornaments are now made from straw, (and apparently available from Ikea!), which burns well. It is a common game to try to sneak a Yule Goat ornament under a neighbouring friend or family Yule tree. Once discovered the game is to sneak it on to someone else’s Yule tree. Oh those wacky Scandos! The Yule ‘Pigs’ are now often made from the corn meal from the last ear of corn from the previous harvest. A pig head is baked from the cornmeal and rather than being even is broken up and spread over the corn field to promote a prosperous harvest. There is also a Yule Cat that decides, based on whether children get new clothes or not, if children have been good/worthy of presents. The thinking being that only good children would get new clothes. There’s a thought that bad children would then be offered to the Yule Cat who would spirit them away. Possibly based on the very real fact that children who didn’t get new clothes wouldn’t survive the winter.” 21st over: Australia 92-1 (Khawaja 29, Labuschagne 1) Some leaving, a run, a leg bye, another quiet Deep over. Super weird seeing players just carry on like the game is normal, after that opening stand. It’s like the awkward resumption of conversation after a fight at family Christmas when the offending parties have been ushered outside. 20th over: Australia 90-1 (Khawaja 28, Labuschagne 1) Normal service resumes, then, with two of Australia’s regulars in the middle. Oh, what a piece of bowling from Jadeja! Just as I was thinking about Australian tons on debut, about Ponting’s 96, and all that stuff. Around the wicket, down the line of the stumps, drawing a big forward defensive lunge from Konstas. The ball straightens just enough to beat the edge and strikes his back leg. Konstas doesn’t bother reviewing. Immense ovation for the young player as he walks off though, and the MCG gives you a long runway to keep soaking up that applause. He was chancy, he was dramatic, and he found his own unique way to nullify the threat of a Bumrah opening spell. 19th over: Australia 89-0 (Konstas 60, Khawaja 28) Three more for Konstas, driving Deep at the top of the bounce out through cover. “Are middle aged men allowed to swoon?” a friend messages me. 18th over: Australia 86-0 (Konstas 57, Khawaja 28) Jadeja goes through Konstas, past the bat, but the ball is just too far down leg. Umpire says no and it’s a good call. Jadeja agrees, eventually, and that’s a good call too. Konstas drives a run, then gets the strike back, and drives another. Seems to have settled down from his early adrenaline rush. 17th over: Australia 83-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 27) Another drinks break, in the heat. India have been thoroughly disconcerted, it must be said. You could see Kohli speaking to teammates after that collision complaining the Konstas had put a shoulder into him, miming a big shoulder movement coming forward. But Kohli is the one who made a beeline close to the other player. I’m sure there’ll be much more about that later. Konstas does the remote camera interview at the drinks break, but won’t say anything about the bump when asked. Akash Deep resumes after the break, and gets through a maiden over in the channel outside Khawaja’s off stump. Three overs for five runs, he has. Siraj meanwhile has gone at 4.8 an over, and Bumrah at 6.3. 16th over: Australia 83-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 27) Spin, at last. Jadeja to Khawaja though, I want to see what Konstas does against slow bowling. Presumably he’ll try to murder it. No need though, as Khawaja pulls the second ball for four. It wasn’t short, but Khawaja gets down very low with a straight front leg to manufacture the length and get power through his shot. Punches one off the back foot. 15th over: Australia 78-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 22) Again, Deep makes things slow down a bit. Bowls most of the over to Khawaja. One run from a top edged pull. 14th over: Australia 77-0 (Konstas 55, Khawaja 21) A remarkable morning. It’s not even midday yet, and the kid has 50 at almost a run a ball. He’s taken down the biggest threat by treating him like a T20 bowler. Gets there with an inside squeeze to leg, and he makes Khawaja work those twilight-of-a-career legs to race back for two. Salutes the crowd, then follows up by slotting Siraj for a monster pull shot over the longest part of the ground. Just lands inside the rope. He’s done that a lot today. Hopefully the memory of that gives him some solace as he gets his box crushed next ball. 13th over: Australia 65-0 (Konstas 48, Khawaja 20) We get a brief pause for breath, as Konstas faces four balls from Akash Deep but elects to have a little look at him before trying anything. 12th over: Australia 65-0 (Konstas 47, Khawaja 17) More Siraj. Try a spinner, surely? Khawaja tucks one, Konstas flays a cut shot to deep third for two. Misses a hook shot at a bouncer. 11th over: Australia 62-0 (Konstas 45, Khawaja 16) It’s official, Konstas is winning the battle. He’s got Bumrah into a sixth over in this heat, he’s just had an earful from Kohli, and he smokes an off drive for four! Finally a normal shot, and an imposing one. Feeling good about that, he smacks one over long on for six! Reaches for it outside off stump, again the length is fuller, and he gets the length to land it on the rope just around from the old Bay 13. Four more! T20 shot again, backs away and squirts the full straight ball away through backward point this time. Then opens his stance again and tries to pound more over long off, this one mistimed for two runs. This is absolutely extraordinary. He’s taken 18 off that Bumrah over after 14 off an over earlier. Nathan McSweeney would have done the same. 10th over: Australia 44-0 (Konstas 27, Khawaja 16) Early drinks break. Apologies I haven’t got to any emails, the internet connection at the ground has somehow torpedoed access to that server while allowing everything else. I’ll just have to believe that they were witty, erudite, and insightful. I can imagine a bunch of confused late-night English readers trying to work out how Zak Crawley is playing for Australia: tall, right-handed, and throwing the bat without concern. Konstas plays through cover for a couple, then charges Siraj and belts back a drive that hits the bowler. Again Siraj has a few words and the crowd get on his back. Kohli doesn’t say anything, skipping down level with the batter to field, but looks at him with what I would interpret as contempt. Konstas doesnt’ mind, charging again to belt a cut shot for four! Then pulls, splices, high over the leg side for one, into a gap. Huh, now Kohli really is getting into Konstas. They bump shoulders at the end of the over, Kohli walking beside the pitch towards Siraj. Kohli moves his line partly but not enough, perhaps expecting Konstas to do the same. They clip quite forcefully, then Kohli turns to give the young player an earful. Khawaja comes up and shoos Kohli away, Umpire Gough gets involved as well. Boiling over. 9th over: Australia 37-0 (Konstas 20, Khawaja 16) Change in the field for the bouncer, Bumrah to Konstas. Deep square leg, deep fine leg, deep third set quite fine. Two slips, gully, point. Konstas is clueless to the ball cutting in, but it goes too far to leg before hitting his pad. Then he edges on just short of slip! Kohli diving across can’t get it. Skews a single through square leg and gets off strike. Bumrah’s first crack at Khawaja and he immediately goes past the left-hander’s edge. But Khawaja gets the last ball of the over off his pads for four, behind square. Nicely timed. 8th over: Australia 32-0 (Konstas 20, Khawaja 12) Still digesting this. Bumrah’s over went for 14. It’s not like he was collared though. I wouldn’t say that Konstas hit any of those scoop shots flush, or that it seems a viable long-term strategy. But he’s shaken things up. Khawaja pulls three more from Siraj, Konstas gets one off an inside edge, Khawaja drives two. Runs flowing. 7th over: Australia 26-0 (Konstas 19, Khawaja 7) Finally, Konstas connects with his scoop shot! Not completely cleanly, it takes the inside portion and goes much straighter than intended, over the keeper more than fine leg. And it trickles to the rope rather than racing. But he does get four. And goes again! For six! That one is cleaner, and it’s a reverse. Absurd shot. Bumrah has had enough and goes for the yorker. It’s a pretty good one, tailing in at off stump. But Konstas is either expecting it, or is fast enough to adapt. He gets in position, has the bat down for the full pitch, then seeing the line, falls with his body towards the leg side rather than continuing to the off, and opens the face to hit it very fine over deep third. It carries the rope by a few inches. Third ball, charges and tries to flat bat through cover, misses. Fourth ball, leaves. Fifth ball, plays the same reverse scoop to another full ball, and it lands just short of the rope. Replay says four, not six. This is utterly absurd. 6th over: Australia 12-0 (Konstas 5, Khawaja 7) Siraj to Khawaja, across him. It’s been a tale of two battles so far, all of Khawaja down one end and Konstas down the other. Khawaja has soft hands as he runs one into the gully, no score. Finally the ends change, as Khawaja pulls without timing it, clunking three through square, and Kinstas will face Siraj for the first time. Smashes his pad first ball. Was there an inside edge? Guess not, the ball lands with the cordon. Konstas follows up with a huge charge and swing! Baseball style, aimed nowhere and everywhere, and fresh air again. Siraj doesn’t much enjoy that audacity, and has some words. The big screen flashes a close-up of him speaking and the crowd immediately razzes him. But Konstas gets a score to follow, three runs through square leg on the flick. Australia double their score that over. 5th over: Australia 6-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 4) The Bumrah-Konstas show resumes, and the new guy tries the scoop again! This ball was even less the one for it, fuller but wide of the off stump. The bat is nowhere near it. Rohit chuckles, Kohli just shakes his head in mild disapproval. You can’t bat like that after two career runs, buddy, he seems to be thinking. Bumrah ends the over by nearly bursting through, taking a sliver of bat onto the other player’s foot. 4th over: Australia 6-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 4) What do you know – an incorrect review with Siraj’s encouragement. The ball does bend in to the left-hander and smash Khawaja on the pad, but it’s near the knee roll and he’s on the march towards the bowler. Always going over, but India burn one early to see the green light. Siraj at least turned to the umpire eventually, after running down level with the batsman first. Then swings one down leg side, and Khawaja gets a little inside feather on it to fine leg for four. 3rd over: Australia 2-0 (Konstas 2, Khawaja 0) Huge ovation for Konstas with his first Test runs, getting a straighter ball from Bumrah that he can stab off his pads through square leg for two. Then plays a very clunky forward defence and gets bat on ball again. Bumrah could be bowling fuller, everything so far is over the stumps. He’s enjoying the contest though, smiling at Konstas every couple of balls, as if to say, I can work you out, young feller. So Konstas plays the scoop! Eleventh ball of his Test career, against the best quick in the world. And misses. The ball goes over his off bail. A bit fuller… Bumrah walks back chuckling and shaking his head. And last ball of the over, beats him again! 2nd over: Australia 0-0 (Konstas 0, Khawaja 0) Now then, India need quality from the other end. Some support for Bumrah. It did start to come in Brisbane, before the last-day rain. Siraj with the new Kooka, and he does beat Khawaja with a good one, Khawaja playing on the top as he has done so often while getting out this series. And again, fourth ball, sparring, kangaroo style, bounce and movement. Khawaja survives the over. 1st over: Australia 0-0 (Konstas 0, Khawaja 0) There’s a real good lip curl from Konstas on the close-up cam, waiting for Bumrah. The crowd hushes in anticipation… and sighs as he leaves the ball. A big jerky action, shouldering arms over the top of the ball and pulling his bat around to face back down the pitch. Plays and misses at the next one, a pearler that goes away off the pitch. Bumrah doing heaps early. Draws another leave third ball, but the fourth and the fifth are lovely. Beaten, beaten again, both times drawing Konstas into the defensive shot before seaming past the edge. Perfect seam position, upright then scrambling away. And the sixth ball same again! Just misses the edge. Bumrah excited, but doesn’t go through with his appeal. Didn’t bowl an in-ducker in that over, I wonder if he’s going for an extended setup. Konstas beats Khawaja to the middle by about 150 metres. Runs out there and regards the pitch. The young and the old. Anthems go around the ground. We’re not full yet, but well on the way to full. Mitch Starc has had a haircut. Boland has too. Marsh and Konstas have not, by the looks. The Torres Strait and Aboriginal flags fly on poles between the larger Australian and Indian national flags, which are held flat like bedsheets ready to be folded. Done, away we go. And a big piece of news about India’s XI. I wasn’t expecting this. Gill is out so they can play two spinners, with Jadeja at six. Rohit goes up to three. Australia Usman Khawaja Sam Konstas Marnus Labuschagne Steve Smith Travis Head Mitch Marsh Alex Carey Pat Cummins Mitchell Starc Nathan Lyon Scott Boland India Yashasvi Jaiswal KL Rahul Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Rishabh Pant Ravindra Jadeja Nitish Kumar Reddy Washington Sundar Jasprit Bumrah Mohammed Siraj Akash Deep Weather report from the ground: it is already hot out there, but it’s currently cloudy. So that’s some measure of relief at least. I suspect it will burn away soon, although there’s also a chance of rain in the forecast and a cool change later. The whole Melbourne grab-bag. I’ll tell you what is certain: Indian support. My word, the crowd outside is at least half wearing blue India shirts. Huge lines on the way in. Huge toss to win! No surprises there, with the heat and the gusty winds blowing across Melbourne. Tell us about your day, whether you’re at the end of it on one half of the planet, or it is already yesterday on the other. Who ate what? Who annoyed who? Who is filled with seasonal cheer? Get salty, get schmaltzy, get smoochy – whatever you like. The email line is open. Here’s our lead-in piece on Konstas and his forerunner, Ricky Ponting. The biggest news for Australia is the debut of young sensation Sam Konstas to open the batting. Huge challenge for him, especially if he’s called upon immediately. Although that would give him less time to get nervous, I suppose. He seems pretty confident, but walking out in front of 90,000 would have to challenge any teenage bravado. Scott Boland is coming back for Australia replacing the injured Josh Hazlewood. Not sure what India will do yet, they always play their cards close and always seem to make a change somewhere along the line. Happy tidings of the Yule. Now that I think about it, I’ve never thought to check what Yule means. Yuletide could be the guy from The King and I doing an album of Vance Joy covers. Regardless, what with all of those logs and whatnot, I’m going to assume that most people had a festive time. In most of Australia, Christmas was stinking hot, in the UK it’s been cold and bleh to a moderate sort of level, and wherever else you were in the world, it was something else. Or still is something else, for those on the negative side of Greenwich Mean. Whatever the case, it is Boxing Day in Melbourne, and that means one thing. We are about to send 13 players and two umpires into the middle of the MCG to suffer in ridiculous heat all day. In Melbourne the temperature didn’t drop out of the 20s all night, it will be into the 30s by the time the toss takes place, and it will be up towards 40 degrees by the end of the afternoon. The following days will cool off. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I’m pretty sure the ICC doesn’t have an extreme heat policy, even though the world is getting hotter. Cricket Australia does have one, where something called the Heat Stress Risk Index can be calculated to theoretically suspend games if it gets hot enough. But at this level of heat they usually just have extra drink breaks. So, on we go. Safe to say this is a bat-first day, even though the MCG has become the best bowling pitch in the country after they renovated it for being too flat."

          "bodyText": "Good morning – I hope you had a great Christmas. If you love football, and even if you hate it, one inescapable feature of Boxing Day is the festive fixture list – and a look at today’s matches in the Premier League tells a familiar story of a game that has been swallowed whole by international investors. Ten of the 20 top-flight clubs are US owned, and many others are linked to nation states or private equity. When the Premier League formed in 1992, 21 of 22 clubs were majority English owned; today, only four are. But if these owners are expecting to make money, they have chosen a lousy economic model. Only five out of the 20 clubs now in the league made a profit in the 2022-23 season, with an aggregate loss of £685m. Why has this happened – and why does it matter? For today’s newsletter, the first in a series of conversations we’re running until new year, I spoke to Nick Miller, a staff writer at the Athletic and author of Who Owns Football? The Changing Face of Club Ownership, about how the beautiful game got gobbled up. Here are the headlines. In depth: ‘It’s become an investment vehicle for people with no real connection to the club or the game’ Thanks so much for doing this, Nick. In the book, you set out the transition in football club ownership in the Premier League from caravan park owners and package holiday merchants to public investment funds and private equity. Is it fair to say that 20 years ago ownership was a folly, an exercise in vanity or romance or somewhere in between, and at the top level that is essentially gone? Well, there’s definitely still vanity at the top level, but a different kind of vanity. The weird thing about football is that there’s so much money washing around in it, but barely anyone makes any. So sometimes people outside the game take a look at it and think: these guys must be idiots – I could do better. But romance? No, it’s too expensive. The people who have access to the funds you need to buy a big club now, they’re not going to piss it away on a lifesize Subbuteo game. There are two owners in the Premier League who are fans of their clubs, at Brentford and Brighton, but they have been successful because they don’t run it like fans. You don’t get an owner like Jack Walker at Blackburn, a local boy done good who spent enough money on his club to win the title in 1995. From that perspective, there is a kind of innocence lost. When did that start to change? Twenty years ago, as a fan, you knew who owned your own club and a few of the gobbier owners in the media, but you didn’t care about anyone else. Now you’re almost forced to care, and you wonder: if my club had one of these giant owners, would we be doing better? The first deal of this kind that I noticed as a fan was when Sky tried to buy Manchester United, which was eventually blocked by the monopolies and mergers commission in 1999. It was when you saw football becoming an investment vehicle for people with no real connection to the club or the game. It didn’t really exist as a financial mechanism before that. What happened was, there was a curious decade in the 90s where huge amounts of money were coming into the Premier League from TV deals and everything else, and the league’s profile was rocketing. But there were still the lingering effects of a view of football as, in the famous words of a Sunday Times editorial, “a slum sport played in slum stadiums and increasingly watched by slum people”. So the authorities had sort of written it off, and there wasn’t a lot of thought about who should be entitled to own a football club: it was just, if you can afford it, you were fine. Then the change starts to happen quite rapidly as people like Roman Abramovich at Chelsea and Sheikh Mansour at Manchester City come into the game. And now with Everton being sold last week to a US-based consortium, half of Premier League clubs are US-owned. You talk in the book about how clubs should be viewed as community assets, that they’re fundamentally different to a paperclip business. Is it possible to be a community asset and be owned by an opaquely structured set of financial institutions thousands of miles away? No. A football club is a community asset – it’s about giving people something to be proud of, but it’s also about their impact locally. An investment fund linked to an oil state, for example, just has a different agenda, and the purpose of the club becomes something else. *** The price of success? There’s a tension there, though, because I guess you have to acknowledge that an essential part of defining a community asset is what the people in the community think. Newcastle fans, for example, are definitely much happier with their club than they were five years ago, even though there’s a massive moral question there. But you do still have to accept that what the club is meant to be doing is just different now. I don’t blame any fan who supports their team, and the emotional and sentimental ties make it very difficult to change that – but then you will get some who will defend their owners at any cost, and claim that their investment in the area and the team makes everything fine. You have to think about what the fundamental purpose of that is, which is changing the conversation about what kind of state Saudi Arabia is, and in the end that is going to be more important than the club’s meaning to the community. If you show up at a game with a Saudi shirt on, it’s you serving their intention, not the other way round. It’s worth saying that this is part of a bigger problem – football fans have been forced to accept that the game is a rapacious, dog-eat-dog world, and the only way to survive or thrive is to fully participate. Whereas if you had a structure founded on a more egalitarian idea of what football should be, there might be more room for fans to have a more sceptical response to these owners. Exactly. The attitude that as long as they’re spending money and making my team successful, we’re not going to look hard at anything else – that is a product of not being able to compete at the top without the backing of billionaires or a nation state. But what that structure might realistically look like is hard to say. The clubs themselves would have to support it, and there are enough owners like that to mean that it isn’t going to happen. I suspect that the football regulator, which is coming in soon, won’t have that much of an impact because it’s not clear what real powers it will have, and because teams at the top have got very good at finding their way around rules and regulations. You also write about American owners who want to buy into the lower leagues because they’re captivated by the idea that you could fight your way to the top, which is impossible in the closed shop of American sports. But at the same time, it seems as if the gap to the very top is just unbridgeable now for a club coming up, and all the big clubs have already been subject to these takeovers. Does that mean we’re going to see a slowing down in the big international money coming into the English game? Everything is still so volatile, and I wouldn’t want to make any confident predictions about how it will work at the top. But I do think you’re going to see more clubs gobbling up the smaller ones to form multi-club groups. At the top, there’s so much money there now that you can’t buy your way in and expect to suddenly transform things. What you wonder is whether more people will start to get disillusioned with the game at that level because it has become so remote and start supporting their local non-league team, and there are some examples. But I’ve been expecting something like that for about 20 years, and it never quite seems to happen in a big enough way to change the game. Reading this online or on the Guardian app?

          "headline": "Canadian researchers trial nature trick to boost mood in winter",
          "bodyText": "The start of a new year: a time for optimism, ambitious plans to improve the world, and the grim suspicion that the first couple of months may well be a miserable slog through the deepest of winter’s gloom. But for those who fear the cold and dark ahead, help is on the horizon. Researchers in Canada are investigating a simple trick they hope will boost flagging spirits even when the days are short and frost is in the air. “People really need something to help them get through the winter, especially after Christmas,” said Dr Holli-Anne Passmore, the psychologist leading the study at Concordia University of Edmonton in Alberta. “If people don’t like winter in the first place, they really don’t see anything good in it.” Between January and March, the plan is for at least 100 volunteers in Edmonton – a city where winter days can mean seven hours of daylight and temperatures as low as -35C – to spend two weeks going about their normal routines, but with one small change. The participants will be instructed, while they are out and about, to pay attention to the natural amid the human-made – the frosty tree beside the tower block, the animal footprints on the snowy pavement, the icicles dangling from the warehouse roof – and make notes on how it makes them feel. Before and after the trial, named the Noticing Nature Intervention, participants will complete questionnaires so researchers can assess their levels of anxiety, stress, happiness, life satisfaction and sense of connection to the world. They will then work out whether noticing nature in a built-up environment provides something of a boost. The volunteers’ scores, along with measurements of a salivary enzyme linked to stress, will be compared with those from a control group who will go about their business without instructions to change their behaviour. The trial will run for two weeks to help people build a habit for noticing nature, but can such a simple trick really hope to have an impact? The simplicity of the intervention should not put people off, Passmore argues. “People tend to discount how good they’re going to feel when they notice nature,” she said. “Part of it is our whole western society. We want a pill, we want something new and improved, we always want the latest.” Besides its parks, trees and other plants, Edmonton is home to squirrels, rabbits, coyotes, beavers and hundreds of wild bird species. In the bustle of daily life, they easily go unnoticed. “We know that people are becoming more and more disconnected from nature,” said Passmore. “One reason is the built environment we live in, but we’re also stuck on our cell phones. Honestly, we just need to look around us.” Passmore believes winter brings its own delights: the trees sparkle with hoarfrost, animal tracks are visible in the snow, the colour palette and soundscape change. The cold is invigorating, the night sky more visible. “You are more likely to see the stars and the northern lights, because you don’t have to wait up until frickin’ two in the morning,” she said. “It’s much more invigorating being outside in the winter. I always think of it as a bit of an adventure. Every time you go out it’s exhilarating.” Gary Evans, director of the Forest Bathing Institute, which runs sessions in nature with Forestry England and conducts research with universities, urged people to wrap up warm and get out to see the nature around them. “Often people think they haven’t got the time, but it doesn’t have to take long,” he added. “Just find a manageable starting point. On your walk to work, give yourself a few extra minutes. If there are two routes from the tube, walk down the street that’s got trees. If people enjoy it, they will expand the time they spend doing it.”"

          "bodyText": "I can see why kids who find themselves at a holiday shack where the only screen-based entertainment is an old TV would be perplexed. By the time you explain all the things the remote “control” doesn’t do, all you’re left with is a limited number of viewing options at any given time, and no control over when each starts or stops. In the age of smartphones and streaming, you could call it “dumb TV”. Or you could sell it as unique, novel, a game: “surprise TV”. I don’t know who in our family started calling it this, only that the name stuck, and provided you don’t consult a TV guide (“a what?”) or watch enough to know when a certain show will come on, that’s what it delivers. We’ve developed a tradition when on holidays to live dangerously: to leave modern devices behind, throw caution to the wind and surrender to surprise TV. When we’re at home, it’s not uncommon for each child to spend their allocated screen time on a different device, often in a different “world”. When there’s just one TV and no streaming services, they’re either bored together or they’re engaged together. Sometimes, a new show will be discovered and prove all the more enjoyable because it was unexpected; at other times, the lack of choice fosters a new ability to find entertainment elsewhere. It’s not that I want to go back to “the olden days” where all TV was surprise TV. I’m a fan of watching and listening to what I want, when I want – podcasts in particular are great for this. I love the ease with which I can find interesting people talking about interesting topics; it’s led to much post-university learning. But sometimes I’m conscious of a nagging feeling that I might be missing out on opportunities to broaden my interests, develop new ones or expose myself to a greater range of perspectives. It’s one of the reasons why, in the brief pockets of time I spend driving every week, I listen to “surprise radio”. The content is curated, but not by me. Some of the shows that come on aren’t those I’d normally choose – talkback radio, for example – but that doesn’t mean I won’t get something out of them. In fact, I very often do. It was in the spirit of exiting my comfort bubble that I first agreed to attend “The Most Wuthering Heights Day Ever”: an annual event where Kate Bush fans mark her birthday by recreating the film clip to her song Wuthering Heights. If my friend had invited me on April Fools’ Day, I’d have assumed she’d made the whole thing up – but it was July. I like Kate Bush’s music – well, what I’ve heard of it – but I wasn’t familiar with the dance, and even if I had been, I’m no dancer. Picture someone who’s a natural; now picture the opposite: that’s me. And yet, dancing through laughter on a grassy hill with a friend and a bunch of strangers, all wearing outfits that more or less resembled the one the singer donned in the music video (mostly less), was, in a word, joyful. I was an ignorant impostor compared with the diehard fans, but received as warm a welcome as anyone. It wasn’t my thing. I can’t imagine any algorithm recommending it to me based on my event history, or viewing or watching history. But when it was on again the following year, I couldn’t wait to go again. Maybe it was my thing, or at least, is now. Much has been written about echo chambers and polarisation, perhaps less about how we can open ourselves up to new discoveries and surprise ourselves. We all have assumptions about what we could or couldn’t appreciate, enjoy or find interesting; agree with, or disagree with. How often do we challenge them? Once accustomed to certain technological advances, it isn’t easy to revert to older ways, but it can be done. Less curated entertainment might be more likely to result in boredom than delight, but once in a while, it’s a risk I’m willing to take. If you’re about to set off for a holiday somewhere that doesn’t have all the mod-cons, maybe now’s the time. Yes, you might end up with nothing worth watching. But what’s the worst that can happen? You turn off the TV? End up outside? Go on, I dare you! Leave choice behind, or rather, choose surprise. • Emma Wilkins is a Tasmanian journalist whose freelance work has appeared in newspapers, magazines and literary journals in Australia and beyond"

          "headline": "The Place of Tides by James Rebanks review – duck tales",
          "bodyText": "In his latest book, James Rebanks, the Lakeland shepherd turned bestselling author, sets off for the Arctic Circle in search of an elusive creature and an almost forgotten way of life. We find him in a rain-lashed house on a lonely island reading Moby-Dick. Is this a clever literary device? Are we in for a magnificent obsession and a baggy monster of a book that shouldn’t really work but somehow does? The perhaps surprising answer is: we are. Rebanks made his name with accounts of his love-hate relationship with farming: love of the land and the old ways practised by his grandad, a shepherd before him; hate for the mechanisation and pharmacology of Big Agriculture. His prose is deceptively unvarnished with flashes of colour: bright birds’ eggs in a well-found barn. Our best observers of the world around us are farmers, not only Rebanks but John Lewis-Stempel – nature writers with dirt under their fingernails. Rebanks sometimes travels for work to supplement his income, and once found himself on a boat trip to remote islands in the Norwegian sea. “My companions were all staring at a woman on the shore. Her hair was blowing loose in the wind … she made the little hairs between my shoulder blades stand up.” Had he seen a mythical huldra, part woman, part beast? In fact, he had glimpsed a figure almost as fantastical, a “duck woman”, one of the last Norwegians who scratch a living from tending wild eider ducks and selling their down to fill pillows. Rebanks went back to Cumbria and the family farm. But as the years passed, he found himself haunted by what he’d seen in Norway. “There was something alive in her that had died in me. I had seen it in her eyes.” He seeks her out, a woman called Anna, who is by now in her 70s. He arranges to stay with her and learn about her hardscrabble calling. His quarry is not the great white of Herman Melville’s masterpiece but a black-and-white seabird. It’s an existential quest, all the same: Rebanks’s Moby-Duck. Anna’s life is not for everyone, which is one reason why hardly anybody lives it any more. The island of Fjærøy is cut off except for the occasional visit of a friend with a boat. “There was no blaring TV, no internet, no social media and even the radio was mostly switched off.” And the ducks have declined as newly introduced mink have flourished. Rebanks learns to scavenge seaweed and arrange it into cushions of kelp for the mother ducks. Gradually, he discovers that Anna isn’t quite what she seems. He has a weakness for older role models who appear to have an authentic relationship with the natural world. But though she was the daughter of a duck man, she didn’t immediately follow him into the work. Instead, she spent much of her life on the mainland, where she had a steady job. Twice married, she has four children. It was only when she turned 50 that she began visiting Fjærøy. The Place of Tides may tell you more than you thought you wanted to know about ducks. And the stakes may seem small: if Anna is the last of her kind, we might end up with fewer eider and a lower tog count on our duvets, arguably the least of our worries in a climate emergency. But with the patience of a man making his rounds of birds’ nests, Rebanks shows that degradation of the environment happens in small ways and faraway places, too. And while he begins by admiring Anna for her bloody-mindedness, a woman on her own enduring a tough life, after she takes him to her home town to meet her extended family, including her ex-husbands, Rebanks realises that the broader lesson he can take from her is forgiveness. • The Place of Tides by James Rebanks is published by Allen Lane (£22).

          "bodyText": "Justin Kurzel directs a workmanlike true-crime thriller about a real-life American white supremacist movement called the Order, which, in the 1980s, murdered Jewish radio journalist Alan Berg and pulled off bank robberies to fund a planned national insurrection. Its leader, Bob Mathews, sought a creepy martyrdom involving an Alamo-style standoff with federal agents at the group’s remote farmhouse in Washington state. Screenwriter Zach Baylin (Oscar-nominated for King Richard) adapts the book about the case, The Silent Brotherhood, by Kevin Flynn and Gary Gerhardt; Nicholas Hoult plays the baby-faced Mathews, with Jude Law and Tye Sheridan as the (fictional-composite) officers battling to take him down. Kurzel contrives a solid, vehement film, with Law and Hoult proving to be interestingly cast; there are well-turned action sequences and on-the-nose dramatic beats about white-power fanatics pursuing their gruesome dream while the sweaty, unhappy good guys obsess about the job and neglect their families. But this isn’t Kurzel’s best work; it feels like something for streaming TV rather than the big screen, and is pretty two-dimensional and straightforward compared with Nitram or True History of the Kelly Gang. I wondered how Michael Mann might have played the shootouts, and how Jeremy Saulnier (who has a producer credit here) might have got more subversively inside the neo-Nazis’ granite skulls. Law’s Terry Husk – that surname being maybe another on-the-nose touch – is a federal agent hollowed out by the job, bleary and brutalised by facing down mobsters in New York City; he is estranged from his wife and daughters and is now posted to Idaho where he senses an odd pattern in recent robberies. Sheridan plays a smart young local cop called Jamie Bowen, whom Husk recruits to help, and who starts drifting apart from his young family under Husk’s macho influence. Hoult plays the noisome Mathews; he certainly conveys Mathews’s unsettling blandness, though he could have projected the actual evil and violence a little more strongly. Mathews himself is someone who neglects his (loyal) wife and the implied parallel is a little glib. The film comes alive most with moments that feel taken direct from life: the nosebleed that Husk gets while interrogating a suspect in the cells or the way he gets blood off his hands after a street shootout by wiping them fastidiously in the dust. The fight against fascism is a serious business, now more than ever, and it is right that Kurzel treats it seriously, but this means his movie feels constrained tonally and the finale is weirdly protracted and even anticlimactic. Yet The Order maintains a drumbeat of tension to the last. • The Order is in UK and Irish cinemas from 27 December."

          "headline": "Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs accused of forcing ex-assistant to clean up after ‘Wild King Night’ parties",
          "bodyText": "The detained rap mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs, already facing more than 30 civil complaints alongside federal racketeering conspiracy charges, has been hit with a claim from a former “personal lackey” who claims he was forced to clean up after Comb’s “Wild King Nights” parties were finished. Attorneys for Phillip Pines claim in a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles on Monday that between December 2019 to December 2021, Combs pressured Pines into having sex with a woman and orchestrated parties where he engaged in sex, drugs and alcohol. Pines, who says he was given the title of senior executive assistant, was allegedly asked to set up for Combs’s so-called “Wild King Nights”, according to the claim which was obtained by Variety. He also claims that Combs knowingly exposed a celebrity guest to Covid-19 at his 51st birthday party, and details a disturbing incident where Combs pressured him to engage in sex with a female guest. There are also allegations he witnessed Combs violently kicking a guest in Miami. Pines’s duties, he claims, included arranging for drugs, alcohol and sex-related paraphernalia to be brought in and clean up after the parties concluded, including removing drug evidence and bodily stains from rooms, deleting any compromising videos from Combs’s devices, and ensuring that no one spoke about the nights. Pines claims that he was asked on multiple occasions to set up rooms for Combs’s parties, providing “red lights, ice buckets, alcohol, marijuana joints, honey packs for male libido, baby oil, astro glide, towels, illegal drugs and power banger sex machines”. Pines also alleges that Combs would test his loyalty, including asking him to return to work to find the TV remote, and that his party clean-up duties were assigned to avoid additional hotel cleaning fees. Combs, who was arrested in September on racketeering and sex-trafficking charges, is currently detained at the Metropolitan detention center in Brooklyn, New York, after being denied bail on three separate occasions. At his most recent bail hearing in November, trial judge Arun Subramanian cited evidence showing Combs to be a “serious risk” of witness tampering and proof he has tried to hide prohibited communications with third parties while incarcerated for the bail denial. “There is compelling evidence of Combs’s propensity for violence,” Subramanian wrote in a five-page order. Earlier this month, Combs’s attorneys withdrew the bail appeal for their client. In a statement to Variety on the latest civil claim, Combs’s representatives said: “No matter how many lawsuits are filed, it won’t change the fact that Mr Combs has never sexually assaulted or sex trafficked anyone – man or woman, adult or minor. We live in a world where anyone can file a lawsuit for any reason. Fortunately, a fair and impartial judicial process exists to find the truth, and Mr Combs is confident he will prevail in court.”"

          "bodyText": "When an unassuming public primary school tucked away in an inner-city Sydney suburb took out the grand prize at the world’s largest architecture festival last month, it made international headlines. Crowned world building of the year, Darlington public school was the second major triumph for FJC Studio in 2024. Two months earlier, the Australian architecture firm had put Liverpool council’s new library, Yellamundie, on the international stage, when it was named one of the world’s four most beautiful libraries. Both buildings attracted high praise for the way the architects had seamlessly incorporated local First Nations culture and history into their design, a practice an increasing number of Australian architects are prioritising in their work that is making the rest of the world sit up and take notice. At the world architecture festival – which since its inception in 2008 has become the Venice Biennale of the architecture world – Darlington public school took out best in show, but 10 other Australian architects also collected major awards. Like at the Olympics, Australia is making a habit of punching above its weight in winning architecture gold, says the festival’s founder and the former deputy chair of the UK’s Design Council, Paul Finch. Only China outperformed Australia at this year’s festival. “Challenges to architects are also opportunities, because it means that their creativity is pushed and this is what we’re seeing a lot of from Australian architects,” Finch says. “There’s a particular challenge in any ex-colonial country, a tension with the original populations, and how that is represented and integrated. It’s a challenge for any architect to get people thinking about past culture and history, and even ecology and biology, which may have been either destroyed or heavily amended by the colonial experience.” Stuart Tanner, the immediate past president of the Australian Institute of Architects, said at this year’s national awards, the role that architecture can play as a vessel for social cohesion in local communities was a dominant theme. Multiple projects where connection to country had been intrinsically included from the design consultation stage onwards were recognised in November. “We’re getting stronger and stronger engagement with Indigenous place, country and the influence of Indigenous thinking around how buildings work … and how they actually speak to the significance of a place,” he says. “This is a whole other layer to architecture, which is going to, I believe, elevate Australian architecture to a level far beyond what traditionally people might think architects do.” Australia’s geographical vastness and its extremes in climate also present unique challenges for architects, says Tanner. “To be an Australian architect is to be very dexterous. You need to be able to respond to a huge spectrum of situations and to be able to respond cleverly and innovatively.” Port Hedland’s Spinifex Hill Project Space, a purpose-built art gallery and storage facility designed by Officer Woods Architects, collected the institute’s award for steel architecture in 2024. The remote Western Australia location meant the architects had to come up with a modular design that could be trucked in sections from Perth more than 1,600km away. And it had to be cyclone-proof. “There were major engineering and architecture challenges in physically making this building,” says Tanner. “But it’s how the building itself has united the community that’s really amazing. It’s created an artistic hub for Indigenous artists that really shows how great architecture, architecture that has a sort of poetry about it, can happen in so many different challenging environments.” Another standout design in 2024 that won the world festival’s masterplanning category was the city of Melbourne’s Greenline Project. The project to transform a 4km stretch of the Yarra River’s north bank into a series of interconnected public spaces is being viewed by the designers, Aspect Studios, as a civic act of reconciliation, acknowledging through its design the millennia-old relationship between the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung people and the Birrarung (Yarra). “Greenline is a great example of how we can take lost spaces in our cities and rejuvenate them and reinvigorate them to become places where people want to linger, and in doing so have a meaningful connection to country,” says Tanner. Another Australian building design recognised on the world stage in 2024 was Australia’s new embassy in Washington DC. Winning the world festival’s public building interiors category, the Bates Smart design has placed an indelible Australian landmark on the US capital’s Massachusetts Avenue, Tanner says. “It speaks of light. It speaks of authenticity, of materials, textures and place,” he says. “This will steadily play into the type of architecture that is really demonstrating Australian sophistication on a global stage.” With its LEED gold certification (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design – the world’s most widely used green building rating system), the new embassy demonstrated Australia’s leadership in sustainable design, the festival’s judges said. On the sustainability front, 2024 marked the year Australia opened its first office tower with a solar skin. The $40m Kennon-designed eight-storey building at 550 Spencer Street in Melbourne is expected to generate more energy than it consumes, through an integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) skin made up of almost 2,000 thin-film solar panels, no thicker than a traditional glass facade. A collaboration between six Australian architecture firms produced one of several notable environmentally sustainable residential projects in 2024. A seven-year collaboration between Architecture architecture, Austin Maynard Architects, Breathe, Clare Cousins Architects, Hayball and Kennedy Nolan created Nightingale Village, in the inner-city Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. The collective vision was to create a fossil fuel-free precinct in an inner-city industrial location, providing affordable housing for a diverse community. To the south of the city, a cluster of 22 carbon-neutral apartments took out the 2024 Frederick Romberg Award for Residential Architecture – Multiple Housing last month. The Ferrars and York project, by Six Degree Architects, occupies a long narrow site straddling two busy transport corridors. “They’ve taken a site which has been overlooked for years as just an empty space at the edge of the railway and created some really carefully and intelligently designed units,” says Tanner. “They’ve got beautiful light. They’re beautifully constructed. Thermally, they’re really efficient. But not only that, they’ve created a community.” On a final note, the London-based architecture, interiors and design magazine Dezeen took the redesign of a tiny cottage in Tasmania and named it one of the world’s top 10 home extensions for 2024. The Harriet’s House project, which reconfigured a four-room Georgian era stone cottage in the heart of Launceston using locally sourced Tasmanian bricks and Tasmanian oak timber, became the launching pad for emerging young Tasmanian architects Elizabeth Walsh and Alex Nielsen, who earlier this year formed So. Architecture in Hobart. The couple concede that their first client, Australian historian, curator and professor emerita at RMIT’s in the school of architecture, Harriet Edquist, could have been a daunting one. And the entire construction phase of the project took place during Covid, with Edquist in lockdown on the other side of Bass Strait. There was also the challenge of keeping to the brief of not increasing the actual footprint of the existing 45 sq metre house, and keeping the budget to about $360,000. “But she loved it, the feeling of space and the connection to the garden,” says Walsh. “So even though the internal footprint is quite small, when you open up the doors, it just feels continuous … We’ve managed to create this kind of feeling of space in quite a tight site.”"

These are not numbers. These are lives cut short. Killing children cannot be justified,” the agency wrote in a post on X. At least 45,338 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,764 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement issued earlier today. Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa is said to have reached an agreement with former rebel faction chiefs to dissolve all groups and consolidate them under the defence ministry. Israel has instructed its diplomatic missions in Europe to try to get the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen designated as a terrorist organisation. Al Jazeera is reporting that at least 20 patients and staff at the Kamal Adwan hospital in in northern Beit Lahiya were injured after the Israeli army detonated remote-controlled explosives in the health facility. Gaza’s health ministry was quoted as saying that Israeli bombing is targeting all the departments of the hospital “around the clock without stopping”. Munir Al-Bursh, director of Gaza’s health ministry, said the Israeli army had ordered officials at the Indonesian hospital to evacuate it on Monday, before storming it in the early hours of Tuesday and forcing those inside to leave.

You can find all of our latest Middle East coverage here. Mona Chalabi is data editor at Guardian US Worldwide, 104 journalists and media workers were killed in 2024 – and more than half of them were in Palestine. Journalists there have faced death more than their colleagues in any other country, according to the International Federation of Journalists. Research by the IFJ, a non-partisan organization representing the rights of media workers, found that 55 journalists were killed in Palestine this year, compared with 49 in the rest of the world. Their figures do not include journalists who have been arrested (75 Palestinian journalists have been imprisoned since October 2023, and just 30 of them have been released) nor does it include those who are injured (approximately 49) or missing (at least two). Since Israel has prohibited the entry of foreign journalists into Gaza, only Palestinians are able to report on violence and human rights abuses committed in the territory. For those Palestinian journalists who have not been killed by the Israeli military, working conditions are still near-impossible. Over 90% said they had lost equipment essential for reporting and that they were without essential protective gear such as helmets according to a survey by ARIJ, Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism. You can read the full story here: Syria’s de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa (formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani) has reached an agreement on with former rebel faction chiefs to dissolve all groups and consolidate them under the defence ministry, the new administration has said. The country’s prime minister, Mohammed al-Bashir, had said last week that the ministry would be restructured using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Bashar al-Assad’s army. Assad was a member of the Alawite minority who led a secular dictatorship. Since taking Damascus earlier this month, Jolani and his Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) have pledged to protect religious minorities and denied having plans to impose strict Islamic rule. Jolani has also said “general exhaustion” in Syria meant it did not want another war. Syria’s historic ethnic and religious minorities include Muslim Kurds and Shi’ites - who feared during the civil war that any future Sunni Islamist rule would imperil their way of life - as well as Syriac, Greek and Armenian Orthodox Christians, and the Druze community. After months of deadlock, Israel and Hamas appear to be moving closer toward a ceasefire to end Israel’s 14-month-old war on Gaza. As we mentioned in the opening summary, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that there is “some progress” in efforts to reach a deal. Last week, officials also expressed optimism, saying that a deal may be close for a phased release of the surviving hostages in Gaza in exchange for a ceasefire and the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Here is an extract from a report filed last Tuesday from my colleague Peter Beaumont: Hamas said in a statement that a deal was possible if Israel stopped setting new conditions. A Palestinian official close to the mediation efforts said negotiations were serious, with discussions under way about every word. Reinforcing the sense of optimism the White House spokesperson John Kirby said in an interview with Fox News: “We believe – and the Israelis have said this – that we’re getting closer, and no doubt about it, we believe that, but we also are cautious in our optimism.” He added, however: “We’ve been in this position before where we weren’t able to get it over the finish line.” A report in the Washington Post on Tuesday suggested that Hamas had softened its demands for a full withdrawal of Israeli troops from the Gaza Strip as a precondition of a deal… On Monday, the Israeli defence minister, Israel Katz, said that he expected the deal to get widespread support. “There will be a sweeping majority in the security cabinet and the cabinet for the emerging hostage deal.” Katz has said Israel would maintain security control over Gaza after a ceasefire. Israeli forces have killed a Palestinian man in a dawn raid on a refugee camp near the city of Tulkarm in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian and Israeli officials said. The Israeli military said the man was killed in a “counter-terrorism” operation that resulted in 18 arrests, Reuters reports. Palestinian news agency Wafa said that Fathi Saeed Odeh Salem died after snipers shot him and fired on ambulance crew. We have not yet been able to independently verify any of this information. Meanwhile, medics said at least nine Palestinians, including a member of the civil emergency service, were killed in four separate Israeli airstrikes across the territory today. At least 45,338 Palestinian people have been killed and 107,764 injured in Israeli airstrikes on Gaza since 7 October 2023, the Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Gaza’s health ministry has said in the past that thousands of other dead people are most likely lost in the rubble of the territory. Israeli forces have detained at least 15 Palestinian people across the occupied West Bank since last night, the Palestinian Prisoners’ Society and the Palestinian Authority Commission for Prisoners’ Affairs said. According to Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, the detentions were carried out in Nablus, Hebron, Tubas, Tulkarm, Qalqilya, Bethlehem, Salfit and Ramallah. These detentions were accompanied by house demolitions and the detention of several individuals without charge, Wafa reported. It is estimated that over 12,100 Palestinians have been arrested in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since last October. Human rights groups and international organisations have alleged widespread abuse of inmates detained by Israel in raids in the West Bank. They have described alleged abusive and humiliating treatment, including holding blindfolded and handcuffed detainees in cramped cages as well as beatings, intimidation and harassment. US group Hostage Aid Worldwide said this morning that it believes US freelance journalist Austin Tice, who went missing in Syria in 2012, is still alive, though it did not offer concrete information on his whereabouts. “We have data that Austin is alive till January 2024, but the president of the US said in August that he is alive, and we are sure that he is alive today,” Hostage Aid Worldwide’s Nizar Zakka said. “We are trying to be as transparent as possible and to share as much information as possible.” At a press conference in Damascus, Zakka showed an image he said indicated the locations where Tice had been held from November 2017 to February 2024. Tice was working for Agence France-Presse, McClatchy News, The Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets in Syria. Since the recent collapse of Assad’s regime, thousands of prisoners have been freed, but Tice’s whereabouts have remained unknown. In light of Assad’s ousting, the White House declared the recovery of Tice, 43, a “top priority”. Quoting Unicef figures, the UN agency for Palestine refugees (Unrwa) has said that 14,500 Palestinian children have been killed since the start of Israel’s war on the territory last October. In a post on X, Unrwa, which has been banned from operating within Israel and occupied East Jerusalem by the Israeli parliament, wrote: One child gets killed every hour. These are not numbers. These are lives cut short. Killing children cannot be justified. Those who survive are scarred physically and emotionally. Deprived of learning, boys &amp; girls in Gaza sift through the rubble. The clock is ticking for these children. They are losing their lives, their futures &amp; mostly their hope. The estimated death toll from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza (in early December this year) was more than 44,000 and a recent assessment by the UN Human Rights Office found that 44% of the fatalities it was able to verify were children. About 1.9 million Palestinians in Gaza, approximately 90% of the territory’s total population, have been displaced, many several times. Half of that number are children who have lost their home and been forced to flee their neighbourhoods. Turkey’s interior minister, Ali Yerlikaya, has released figures on the Syrians who have settled in Turkey based on their cities of origin. More than half of Turkey’s Syrian refugee population hails from the country’s north, specifically Idlib—which was ruled by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham’s so-called Salvation government—and the city of Aleppo, the country’s largest. According to the figures, around 4% of Turkey’s Syrian population comes from the capital Damascus. Aleppo: 1.2m Idlib: 187, 498 Deir ez-Zor: 106,192 Hama: 102,758 Israel has instructed its diplomatic missions in Europe to try to get the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen designated as a terrorist organisation. The Iran-backed group in Yemen has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year to try to enforce a naval blockade on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel’s year-long war in Gaza. The strikes on shipping by the Houthis, who have also launched missiles at Israel, have prompted retaliatory strikes by the US and Britain. “The Houthis pose a threat not only to Israel but also to the region and the entire world. The first and most basic thing to do is to designate them as a terrorist organization,” Israeli foreign minister Gideon Sa’ar said in a statement. The US, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Israel currently designate the Houthis terrorists, Sa’ar said. More than 25,000 Syrians have returned home from Turkey since former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad was overthrown earlier this month, Turkey’s interior minister has said. Turkey is home to nearly three million refugees who fled the civil war that broke out in 2011, and whose presence has been an issue for President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s government. The majority of the Syrian refugees who fled to Turkey have been living in Istanbul, Gaziantep or Sanliurfa. “The number of people returning to Syria in the last 15 days has exceeded 25,000,” Ali Yerlikaya told the official Anadolu news agency. Yerlikaya said a migration office would be established in the Turkish embassy and consulate in Damascus and Aleppo so that the records of returning Syrians could be kept. Turkey reopened its embassy in Damascus, the Syrian capital, nearly a week after Assad was toppled by forces backed by Ankara. We mentioned in the opening summary that there are reports of the Israeli military attacking barely functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. Al Jazeera is reporting that at least 20 patients and staff at the Kamal Adwan hospital in in northern Beit Lahiya were injured after the Israeli army detonated remote-controlled explosives in the health facility. Gaza’s health ministry was quoted as saying that Israeli bombing is targeting all the departments of the hospital “around the clock without stopping”. We have not yet been able to independently verify this information. Israel on Sunday reportedly ordered the closure and evacuation of the hospital, though the IDF later denied conveying any evacuation warnings to the facility this weekend. The head of the hospital, Husam Abu Safiya, told Reuters that obeying the order to shut down was “next to impossible” because there were not enough ambulances to get patients out. He said: We currently have nearly 400 civilians inside the hospital, including babies in the neonatal unit, whose lives depend on oxygen and incubators. We cannot evacuate these patients safely without assistance, equipment, and time. We are sending this message under heavy bombardment and direct targeting of the fuel tanks, which if hit will cause a large explosion and mass casualties of the civilians inside. Gaza’s health ministry has said the three main hospitals in northern Gaza – of which Kamal Adwan is one – are barely functioning and have been under repeated attack since Israel sent tanks into Beit Lahiya and nearby Beit Hanoun and Jabalia in October. Gaza’s health ministry was quoted by Al Jazeera on Tuesday as saying the Israeli army is “forcing the wounded and patients to evacuate the Indonesian hospital”. It said Israeli “bombing is targeting all the departments of the Kamal Adwan hospital and its surroundings around the clock without stopping”. “Shrapnel is scattered inside the hospital yard, causing terrifying sounds and serious damage,” the ministry said in a statement. “We appeal to all international and UN institutions and concerned parties to urgently intervene to protect the health system in the Gaza Strip,” it added. Welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of Israel’s war on Gaza and developments in the Middle East more widely. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said yesterday that there is “some progress” in efforts to reach a hostage and ceasefire deal in Gaza. Of the roughly 250 people who were taken hostage in the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel last October, in which about 1,200 people were killed, around 100 are still inside the Gaza Strip, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Speaking in the Knesset – Israel’s parliament – Netanyahu said: “We are taking significant actions through all channels to return our loved ones. I would like to tell you cautiously that there is some progress.” Netanyahu said he could not reveal details of what was being done to secure the return of hostages. He claimed the main reasons for the progress were the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and Israel’s military actions against Iran-backed Hezbollah militants who had been firing rockets into Israel from neighboring Lebanon in support of Hamas. “Hamas hoped that Iran and Hezbollah would come to its aid but they are busy licking the wounds from the blows we inflicted on them,” he said, adding: “There is progress. I don’t know how long it will take.” As my colleague Peter Beaumont notes in this story, sticking points that torpedoed previous rounds of ceasefire talks, including the presence of Israel troops in the so-called Philadelphi and Netzarim corridors inside Gaza, appear to have been sidelined for now, although a continuing issue is understood to be the ability of Palestinians in Gaza to return to their homes in the strip’s north. In other developments: Israeli forces have been attacking health facilities in northern Gaza, as it besieges and “directly targets” the Indonesian hospital, Kamal Adwan hospital, and al-Awda hospital in north Gaza over the past hours, according to the territory’s health ministry. Munir Al-Bursh, director of Gaza’s health ministry, said the Israeli army had ordered officials at the Indonesian hospital to evacuate it on Monday, before storming it in the early hours of Tuesday and forcing those inside to leave. Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, has confirmed that the IDF assassinated former Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this year, and warned that the military would also “decapitate” the leadership of Yemen’s Houthi rebels. The UN peacekeeping mission in southern Lebanon on Monday said it has observed recent “concerning actions” by the Israeli army in southern Lebanon, including the destruction of residential areas and road blockages. The Israeli military says three soldiers were killed yesterday in combat in northern Gaza. The military did not provide details of the circumstances. A Qatari delegation visited the Syrian capital on Monday for the first time in more than a decade and met with the country’s top insurgent commander, who said strategic cooperation between Damascus and Doha will begin soon. The Pentagon says US Central Command forces have killed two operatives for the Islamic State militant group in a airstrike in Syria."

          "bodyText": "Victorian Liberal MPs who will be away during the upcoming leadership spill could be able to vote remotely, due to an intervention by John Pesutto designed to shore up support. The embattled opposition leader on Tuesday wrote to his colleagues to tell them he had received requests from MPs Nick McGowan and Cindy McLeish to participate in Friday’s special party room meeting, despite being overseas. The meeting was called by five MPs – leadership aspirant Brad Battin, Sam Groth, James Newbury, Richard Riordan and Bridget Vallence. It is ostensibly being held to vote on a motion to readmit exiled MP Moira Deeming into the party room, but Guardian Australia understands the MPs will also move a spill against Pesutto. In his email, Pesutto said “given the time of year”, he had called a party room meeting for 15 January to allow “all members to participate in person” in a vote to readmit Deeming, who successfully sued him for defamation in federal court, after an extraordinary backflip. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email But with an earlier meeting now going ahead, he said he sought advice from the shadow attorney general, Michael O’Brien, who told him he could “exercise the authority to enable remote participation”. Pesutto said the move would “enfranchise all members” of the party room. But it will also secure him at least one vote, as McLeish is part of Pesutto’s moderate grouping. McGowan’s position on a spill is unclear and he could not be reached for comment. It is understood Croydon MP David Hodgett and upper house MP Richard Welch, who were also meant to be away during the vote, are considering changing their plans to attend in person. Despite the intervention, Battin is confident he has the support of a majority of MPs. Newbury replied to Pesutto’s email arguing the constitution only allowed MPs to participate remotely in case of health and other emergencies or natural disasters, which make it “impossible to travel”. “The constitution does not provide the leader with the power to offer a remote meeting where a member is on holidays and given five full days’ notice of the meeting,” he wrote. But remote voting would also help the moderates install their choice for deputy leader, the Kew MP Jess Wilson. They say McLeish and McGowan would support her. The moderates had been imploring Battin – a conservative – to give Wilson the position, in a show of unity between the party’s bitterly divided groups. But these hopes were dashed on Monday as Groth, the former professional tennis player turned Nepean MP, firmed up as Battin’s choice for deputy and the moderates accused him of walking away from a “unity deal”. A moderate MP said Battin and his supporters were attempting to “steal the leadership” while members were away and Victorians were tuning out over the Christmas break. Another senior Liberal MP supporting Wilson said Friday’s vote was an attempt to “deliberately disenfranchise[s] key Jess backers who are currently away”, but that remote voting would change the game. “Here’s yet another opportunity to do the best thing and move on from this shit show in a unified and dignified way,” they said. “It’s now in Brad’s court.”"

          "bodyText": "Red torrents of lava and billows of volcanic gas began erupting from Kilauea on Hawaii’s Big Island – one of the world’s most active volcanoes. The eruption was confined to the volcano’s summit caldera, in a remote, closed area of Hawaii Volcanoes national park, the Hawaii Volcano Observatory reported. Increased earthquake activity began at about 2am local time and within about half an hour webcam images began to show lava emerging through fissures in the caldera or spurting in fountains. A live stream of the eruption, broadcast by the US Geological Survey on Monday, showed spurts of red-hot lava bursting upward, followed by cloud-line plumes of volcanic gas and ash. The fountains reached up to 80m (260ft) high early on Monday morning, “The lava is coming out at a very rapid rate as it usually does at the onset of these eruptions,” said Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, during a USGS live stream. The most immediate threat was from volcanic smog that could reach homes downwind, the observatory said. Such “vog” contains sulfur dioxide and can worsen symptoms for people who have conditions such as asthma, other respiratory issues or cardiovascular disease. The area where the eruption is occurring has been closed to the public since 2007 due to hazards that include crater wall instability, ground cracking and rockfalls. Hawaii’s Volcanoes national park encompasses the summits of two of the world’s most active volcanoes: Kilauea and Mauna Loa. Kilauea also erupted in June and September this year, and with the exception of a quiet period between 1924 and 1952, it has been in eruption regularly since there have been written records. Its eruptions can last days, or go on for a year. In 2018, Kilauea erupted from May through August, destroying more than 700 homes. It is a shield volcano – a broad, massive formation shaped somewhat like a warrior’s shield lying flat, unlike composite volcanoes that form a conical peak. In 2019, the USGS scientists confirmed a growing lake of water inside Halema’uma’u crater, an active pit within the summit caldera – marking the first time in modern history that water had been visible from the volcano’s summit. In 2020, the 10-story-deep lake boiled away when lava re-entered the crater."

          "bodyText": "Martin Kettle agrees with the government favouring “English counties, not regions, as an essential building block of a modern network” (We now have a plan to make England’s local government work – but I fear party politics will trash it, 19 December). There is a key word and concept that should form the basis of good governance. It is “subsidiarity”, meaning that decisions should be taken at the level to which they apply. It forms the basis for good governance across Europe, which is based on regions. This is because there are key functions and decisions that can only be taken effectively and in an integrated way across regions. They include the strategic planning of major developments, transportation systems, infrastructure networks, housing market areas, higher-end retail catchments, health provision and higher education, as well as environmental entities such as river valleys and water-catchment areas. So please do not advocate sentiment as a basis for second-tier governance. Keep some of the old county names by all means, but surely not their Norman boundaries. Roger Read Former secretary general, Metrex, the network of European metropolitan regions and areas • Martin Kettle is right, of course, that improvements in local government need funding, and Angela Rayner is right that England is more centralised in its government than practically anywhere else in Europe. The fact is that until the taxation system is revised to favour local government, that centralisation, and the dead hand of Westminster, will continue. Sweden and the other Nordic countries show the way: Gothenburg, a city of about the same size as Sheffield, has a proposed budget for 2025 of about £3bn, while Sheffield’s budget for 2024-25 is just under £544m. So Gothenburg gets to spend just over £5,000 per head of population, while Sheffield makes do with just under £932 per head. Of course, the responsibilities of local government differ in the two countries, but these differences are massive. The reason is that in Sweden, income tax is paid to the local authority if you earn up to about £43,000; if you earn more, you pay another 20% on the difference to the state. This is a system that favours devolution, but it will never be implemented in the UK, because ministers like to manage things instead of simply leading legislation to enable others to manage. Tom Wilson Professor emeritus, University of Sheffield, and University of Borås • I would urge any areas with district councils to fight to keep them (Editorial, 16 December). Having lost Richmondshire district council, many of us feel abandoned. With no significant economic development input and a failing planning system, we have become an outpost of local government that is easy to ignore. On top of that, there has been increased centralisation, with the election of a regional mayor living, I believe, in York, 45 miles away. North Yorkshire council’s ideas for electoral division boundaries will see Richmond town split up; we will be politically neutered, left drifting and rudderless. John Harris Richmond, North Yorkshire • Angela Rayner has put the cart before the horse with her proposed reform of local government. Our district council has been a model of financial probity, while the county council is indebted and struggling to provide basic statutory services. Larger does not mean better, and makes the legislators more remote from the electorate. By all means get rid of county councils, devolve power to the districts, and then support them to work effectively.

          "headline": "UK politics: Welsh Tories criticise Of Mice and Men’s removal from GCSE course over racism concerns – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "The UK economy had zero growth between July and September and is expected to have stagnated over the entire second half of 2024, undermining Keir Starmer’s promise to reboot growth. Kemi Badenoch has said she does not believe Elon Musk is going to make a multimillion-pound donation to Reform UK, even as the party’s treasurer claimed the US billionaire was now ready to do so. The Conservative leader made the comment in an interview for the Today programme podcast during which she also defended refusing to give off-the-cuff answers to policy questions (see 11.14am), claimed her leadership was going well and that Tory infighting was over (see 9.25am) and said her comment about not all cultures being equal was a general one, and not specifically about Islam (see 11.51am). Keir Starmer and his family are to take a short overseas holiday over the new year, Downing Street has said. The Welsh Conservatives have criticised a decision to remove John Steinbeck’s 1930s novel Of Mice and Men from the GCSE curriculum because of concerns about racism. (See 3.31pm.) The Welsh Conservatives have criticised a decision to remove John Steinbeck’s 1930s novel Of Mice and Men from the GCSE curriculum because class discussions about the book, and the racial slurs it contains, have been distressing for some black pupils. As the BBC reports, Wales’ children’s commissioner Rocio Cifuentes said many black children “specifically mentioned this text and the harm that it caused them” when she spoke to them as part of research on racism in secondary schools. Referring to the decision by the WJEC exam board to take it off the GCSE curriculum from next September, she said: It’s not censorship. This is safeguarding the wellbeing of children who have told us how awful those discussions have made them feel in those classrooms. They’ve very often been the only black child in that classroom when discussions all around them are focusing on very derogatory, negative depictions of black people. But Natasha Asghar, the Conservative education spokesperson in the Senedd, said this was censorship, and that it would not solve the problem of racism. In a statement she said: Instead of banning Of Mice and Men, we should teach it within its historical context, showing students how overt racism and sexism was commonplace and accepted in the past and why this was harmful and wrong. Censorship doesn’t solve the problem; it prevents young people from confronting and understanding these prejudices some of which, sadly continue. Sadly, even in 2024 we continue to see racism and sexism in society. If we want to tackle this then instead of banning a classic text, we would do better to challenge media companies that produce music containing misogynistic language and words with racism connotations. John Swinney, Scotland’s first minister, has described the figures out today saying there was zero growth in the third quarter of the year as “deeply alarming”. Speaking to PA Media, Swinney said: The data that has come out today about the performance of the UK economy in the last quarter is deeply alarming. There’s been an absence of growth and that’s going to be added to by the decisions taken in the UK budget, when the chancellor decided to increase employers’ national insurance contributions, which is, bluntly, a tax on jobs. So, I’m really worried about what that decision will mean for the future prospects of the economy. Swinney said the Scottish government’s recent budget was aimed at making Scotland an “attractive place for investment”. But, he went on: Fundamentally, I am worried about the economic outlook that the Labour government has taken forward because of some mistakes that were made in the budget about increasing employer national insurance contributions and the implications of that will be very significant for Scotland. Natalie Bennett, the Green peer and former party leader, says today’s figures showing zero growth in the third quarter of the year highlight a key problem with the government’s approach. She posted this on Bluesky. The government’s Plan A is “rely on growth to tackle our many problems”. What is Plan B? Reminder, you can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet, and now when there is growth, the profits go to the few, not the many Paul Johnson, the outgoing director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinktank, has said it is “a little unfair” to blame the government for the lack of growth highlighted by today’s revised figures from the ONS. Speaking on Times Radio, asked if the government was to blame, Johnson said: I think it’s probably a little unfair. The government had no choice, really, but to fix some of the massive problems, and they’re right about this. The last government did leave them absolutely massive problems. I think some of what they’ve done to fix it has been less than ideal. So what we’ve essentially had in terms of tax was the last government, I thought very cynically, reduced the employee national insurance rate and then this government essentially made it up by increasing the employer national insurance rate. And in the short run, at least, that is a net loss to the economy because that makes it more expensive for employers to hire people. So I think there is a problem there … You’ve got a significant increase in spending relative, at least, to what was planned. Now again, we can see the need for this in the NHS and the justice system and elsewhere, and the remarkable thing is, we’re all complaining, as it were, about the big tax rises, but the spending rises are even bigger. So one of the issues here is the government is borrowing more. In other words, it’s pumping more money into the economy and that can have inflationary consequences. Johnson also said the chancellor may want to raise taxes again next year. Asked about what might happen next year, he replied: I’m not expecting a recession. But again, the government’s going to be talking about hard choices. They’ve got the hardest of all choices to make in the summer when they do their spending review and then I think we’ll have a lot of miserable cabinet ministers because they’re not going to get very much money. And who knows? It’s not impossible that the chancellor [Rachel Reeves] will feel she needs to come back for yet more money next autumn if the economy doesn’t pick up. Then, again, she’s stuck in this really difficult place – you increase taxes in order to fund public services adequately or because there’s no growth, you don’t have the money you need for the public services and you disappoint people on that front. Reeves has repeatedly said that, after raising taxes significantly in the October budget, she is not planning a similar tax-raising budget this parliament. At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson also rejected claims that Peter Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador to the US could be problematic because of past comments from Mandelson criticising Donald Trump. On Friday Chris LaCivita, a consultant involved in Trump’s election campaign, described Mandelson in a post on X as an “absolute moron”. He was commenting on a news story about Mandelson calling Trump a “danger to the world” and a white nationalist five years ago. Asked if the PM was worried the LaCivita comment showed that having Mandelson as ambassador could cause problems, the PM’s spokesperson replied: No. The appointment shows just how seriously we’re taking this relationship. [Mandelson] has got extensive foreign policy and economic policy expertise, particularly in the crucial issues of trade, business links. He’s got experience at the highest levels of government and he will be a significant asset in the UK’s relationship with the United States. A jailed UK-Egypt pro-democracy activist feels “hurt” by Keir Starmer not raising his case with his Egyptian counterpart, according to his family, PA Media reports. PA says: Campaigners have urged the prime minister to step up his efforts to help free Alaa Abd el-Fattah, who has been detained since 2019 and is unable to see his young son who lives in Brighton. Human rights experts, including Amnesty International secretary general Agnes Callamard, have written to Starmer insisting Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi can “resolve this case with the stroke of a pen” and they are “convinced” the prime minister’s direct intervention is needed. Succession actor Brian Cox, addressing Starmer in a video message, also said: “It’s time to make the call, prime minister. Pick up the phone and bring Alaa home for Christmas. We’re counting on you.” In December 2021, Abd el-Fattah was sentenced to five years in prison after being accused of spreading false news and the Free Alaa campaign says he should have been released in September this year based on his time served behind bars since 2019. His mother, Laila Soueif, 68, has been on hunger strike for 85 days and will continue her action in London until she hears news about her son being released or “she collapses and is hospitalised”. Starmer raised Abd el-Fattah’s plight with Sisi in August but he “did not raise the case” at the recent G20 summit attended by the pair, according to the Foreign Office. Sanaa Seif, who travelled to Cairo to visit her brother in prison last week, said: “Alaa was so, so hurt to hear that the prime minister met Sisi at the G20 and didn’t even raise his name. This is the first time Sisi met a British prime minister and didn’t have to talk about Alaa. On Keir Starmer, Alaa said ‘he’s not treating me as if I am a British citizen’.” Downing Street said today Starmer will raise the case in his next talks with Sisi. The prime minister’s spokesperson said: “It remains our priority to secure the release of Mr el-Fattah so he can be reunited with his family. We continue to raise his case at the highest levels. The prime minister raised his case with President Sisi in August. The foreign secretary has raised the case multiple times, including most recently a few days ago on 20 December. At all levels, whether ministers or officials, we continue to call for consular access to Mr el-Fattah.” Today the Daily Telegraph has splashed on a story saying that Peter Mandelson, who will be the new UK ambassador to Washington, will use Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, to help build good links with the Trump administration. Before he was appointed Mandelson said he thought it would be a good idea for the British embassy to be making use of “friends” of Trump, like Farage, and today’s story is mostly based on a briefing saying Mandelson still stands by what he said in November. But it includes a quote from “a source close to Lord Mandelson”, asked about Labour people arguing Farage should be sidelined, saying: I am sure that would be a view held by some but not those who need to conduct UK-US relations in the most optimum way. At the Downing Street lobby briefing this morning, the PM’s spokesperson was asked if Keir Starmer would be happy for Mandelson to make use of Farage’s connections in this way. The spokesperson said he was “not going to get into that”. But he pointed out that Starmer had a half-hour conversation with Trump only last week, and dinner with him in New York in September, and he said that, as the new ambassador, Mandelson was a “highly respected figure with extensive foreign and economic policy expertise”. The Financial Times’ political columnist Stephen Bush has a good short thread on Bluesky about Kemi Badenoch’s Today podcast interview, and her claim that it would be wrong to set out detailed policy now. (See 9.25am and 11.14am.) She hasn’t got this quite right, he says. Badenoch right that oppositions should set out broad principles for the most part. Starmer’s opposition had announced 200 policies about the topic du jour, by the end of its first 2 years, most of them were trivial and left no-one any the wiser as to what Labour’s guiding priorities were, BUT:🧵 She both isn’t sticking to this (the Tory party under her has already made specific commitments to farmers and private schools) and seems to have confused the lesson of “don’t just spam random policies about the news story of the day” with “you can set out your principles &amp; positions without policy” Her answer on Thames Water is a good example. There are three possible answers on Thames Water: you think privatisation can’t work, you think that privatisation can work with a different operator/regulatory backdrop, you are absolutely crackers and think status quo is working. What Farage is doing, smartly, by saying “we would renationalise” is essentially him going “I’m with you on everything” to the socially conservative voters he didn’t win last time, and laying the ground for credulous coverage of his left-right position in 2029. Badenoch is failing to set out a clear sense of where she stands, or to say to really, any group of voters “I am with you”. The dangerous lesson the Tory party has taken from the election is that the Reform vote can be won just by being louder. Downing Street has said the government has always been “upfront” about the state of the economy. Asked about the latest figures saying there was no growth in the economy in the third quarter of the year, the PM’s spokeperson told journalists at the morning lobby briefing: The government was upfront when it came in that it had a difficult economic inheritance, and that is why we’ve had to take some of the tough decisions that we’ve taken since the prime minister came into government. And it is why we have said that our priority is on delivering growth that people will feel the impact of … We will continue to work day and night to deliver growth, to deliver the investment and reform that our public services need and rebuild the country. Keir Starmer is getting a holiday. He was due to get a post-election holiday in the summer, but he cancelled it so that he could stay in the UK to deal with the summer riots. The PM is spending Christmas with his family at Chequers. But they will be going abroad “for a few days” over the new year, his spokesperson told journalists at the No 10 lobby briefing this morning. The spokesperson did not reveal any further details about where he would be going, or for how long he would be away. Asked if Angela Rayner would be in charge while he was away, the spokesperson said Starmer would remain in charge. Keir Starmer and Volodymyr Zelenskyy both agreed it was “vital” for Russia to fail in Ukraine when they spoke by phone this morning, Downing Street said. In a read-out of the call, a No 10 spokesperson said that Starmer started by telling Zelenskyy about his trip to the Joint Expeditionary Force leaders’ summit last week, and the resolve of JEF members “to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position going into 2025”. The spokesperson went on: At the summit, the group underscored the importance of matching their words with concrete action, including through further sanctions on the shadow fleet, the acceleration of lethal aid, and support for the Ukrainian defence industrial base, the prime minister added. President Zelenskyy reflected on the situation on the frontline in Ukraine and the need to ensure Ukraine could degrade Russian forces for the long haul. What happens in Ukraine in the coming weeks and months matters to Europe and Nato, and it was vital President Putin’s ambitions fail in Ukraine, the leaders agreed. Most Britons don’t want Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and Donald Trump ally, having an influence over UK politics, a poll suggests. Last week Musk met Nigel Farage, the Reform UK leader, and Nick Candy, his party treasurer, to discuss how he might be able to Farage’s party, which is closely aligned to the Trump/Musk project. A financial contribution was discussed, although Musk has denied reports saying he might give $100m. But, according to a poll by Survation, 66% of voters say Musk “should not be influential in British politics”. Only 19% say he should be influential. Asked if wealthy foreign nations should be banned from donating large sums to political parties in Britain, 55% of people told Survation that there should be a ban, and only 17% said there shouldn’t. Under UK election law, a foreigner like Musk is not allowed to donate to a political party as an individual. But Musk could get round this rule because he owns companies that operate in the UK and they would be allowed to donate. The Labour party has put out a statement about the Kemi Badenoch Today podcast interview. Referring to her reluctance to give details of policy (see 9.25am and 11.14am), a Labour spokesperson said: Every time Kemi Badenoch speaks it becomes clearer that she has no solutions to the problems the Tories created. Under her leadership, the Conservatives have made unfunded spending commitments worth billions without explaining how she would pay for any of them. The Conservatives haven’t listened and haven’t learned. Labour’s plan for change will fix the foundations and rebuild Britain. During the Conservative leadership contest Kemi Badenoch wrote an article for the Sunday Telegraph about immigration in which she suggested the UK should not be admitting migrants who do not accept British values. She said: We cannot be naïve and assume immigrants will automatically abandon ancestral ethnichostilities at the border, or that all cultures are equally valid. They are not. I am struck for example, by the number of recent immigrants to the UK who hate Israel. That sentiment has no place here … Our country is not a dormitory for people to come here and make money. It is our home. Those we chose to welcome, we expect to share our values and contribute to our society. This was seen as a hint that Badenoch might be open an immigration policy that would involved restrictions on Muslims, or people from Muslim countries. In interviews Badenoch has declined to elaborate on what this policy might mean in policy terms, although recently she did say the party might end up with an immigration policy comprising something more radical than just leaving the European convention on human rights. In his Today podcast interview, Amol Rajan asked Badenoch if she was worried about the fundamental compatability of Islam, on a strict interpretation, with western values. In response, Badenoch said she was not making a point about Islam, but about culture in general. She said: People assume that I’m always talking about Islam, but I’m not really. It’s one of many variations of culture which we have in the country because of immigration, especially the more recent immigration which has been too high. To understand what I’m saying, you have to look at where I grew up [Nigeria], where there are 300 different languages and cultures, everybody looks the same, and people don’t get on unless there is a unifying thing. But Badenoch also said that the kidnapping of almost 300 Nigerian schoolgirls by Boko Haram, an Islamist terrorist movement in north-east Nigeria, had had a big influence on her thinking. She said: One of the things that profoundly affected my view on the world was what happened 10 years ago when those 300 schoolgirls were abducted from their school by Boko Haram, a terrorist group in northern Nigeria. It has a lot of parallels with what happened on October 7. And this group had been indulged – you know, ‘It’s just Islam, they’re just people who are poor and they’re fighting for their rights’, and then it moved into something really hideous and terrible, and it’s now just a depraved group of people who assault Christians, women, destroy families. If you don’t impose strong values early on, then bad things will fill that vacuum. On Friday I flagged up in the blog a good column by Patrick Maguire in the Times in which he argued that Reform UK is outflanking Labour on the left on some economic issues, for example by advocating nationalisation of Thames Water and British Steel plant in Scunthorpe. Amol Rajan clearly read it too because he asked Kemi Badenoch about both these issues in his Today podcast interview. Asked if she would support nationalising the steel plant, Badenoch said: Remember, that steel plant was one I was helping to manage [when she was business secretary]. I didn’t nationalise it then, did I? It depends. With many of these things, it depends. I tell you what I do want. I don’t want us to de industrialise. I don’t want us to give everything away to China. Nobody wants to invest in steel these days because the Chinese have flooded the market. I remember bringing in all sorts of trade remedies to try and save our steel industry. What I’ve said before is that the government needs to step in to make sure that we have baseline resilience on steel. Does that look like nationalisation? Is it a public/private partnership. Those are details that I don’t get into because once circumstances change, you have to change. And asked about Reform UK saying Thames Waters should be sold to the taxpayer for £1, Badenoch said she could not remember the details of the position the company was in. But she repeated the point about how it was wrong to give an answer off the cuff. She explained: Aren’t you tired of people who just tell you what you want to hear? I will not do that. And that’s why I don’t answer those questions, because the answer is always, and should always be, it depends. Like the Conservatives (see 10.29am), the Liberal Democrats are also urging the government to reverse the main revenue-raising measure in the budget, the rise in employers’ national insurance, to promote growth. Commenting on today’s growth figures, the Lib Dem Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: Today’s figures show that the economy is firmly stuck in the slow lane. People are impatient for change after years of Conservative chaos, but so far this government has failed to deliver. We are urging the Government to take the brakes off growth by reversing the national insurance tax hike on small businesses and scrapping the broken business rates system to unleash the potential of our high streets too. In her Today podcast interview, Kemi Badenoch said that a belief in personal responsibility was what differentiated the Conservatives from other parties. Asked why she was a Conservative, she replied: I think it is because of the principles which I had put in me, probably by my parents, without them realising, the key one being personal responsibility. It’s the thing that distinguishes us from other parties, and often manifests itself in how much the state should do. But personal responsibility also because I think that the story of human endeavour, that adventure, the journey that we take, is often a very individual one. That’s supported by others in society, but people need to take ownership over their lives, as much as they can, and make sure they raise their children properly and they leave something behind that’s better than what they found. The Conservatives are saying the government should rewrite its “disastrous budget” in the light of today’s figures saying the UK economy had zero growth between July and September. Commenting on the figures, Mel Stride, the shadow chancellor, said: Having inherited the fastest growing economy in the G7, growth has tanked on Labour’s watch. That means greater pressure on our public finances and an economy which, far from becoming more secure, is becoming significantly more vulnerable. The Labour government must now urgently revisit their disastrous budget and align economic policy with growth not decline. Every moment of delay is further damaging business confidence, output and employment. The warning lights are flashing. The budget was announced at the end of October, in the fourth quarter of the year, not the third quarter covered by today’s revised figures. In her statement on the figures, Rachel Reeves, the chancellor, said today’s figures highlighted the extent to which Labour inherted a “huge” economic challenge. The challenge we face to fix our economy and properly fund our public finances after 15 years of neglect is huge. But this is only fuelling our fire to deliver for working people. The budget and our plan for change will deliver sustainable long-term growth, putting more money in people’s pockets through increased investment and relentless reform. The Liberal Democrats could force a Commons vote on compensation for Waspi women, Daisy Cooper, the party’s deputy leader has said, capitalising on unease among Labour MPs over the government’s decision to rule it out. Pippa Crerar has the story here. During the general election Nigel Farage went to the Gurnos estate in Merthyr Tyfdfil, south Wales, one of the most deprived wards in the UK, to launch the Reform UK manifesto. He was making a point about his party supposedly representing working and disadvantaged people. Yet, just as with Donald Trump in the US, Farage is regularly accused of leading a party that exploits the discontent experienced by the poor to advocated policies that would largely benefit his mega-rich backers who want to pay less tax. Nick Candy, the wealthy property developer who has recently become treasurer of Reform UK, has given an interview to the Financial Times (see 9.49am) that will reinforce this thesis. He claims “a number of billionaires” are now keen to donate to Farage’s party. We have a number of billionaires prepared to donate to the party, not just Elon [Musk]. The Reform party is the disrupter – this is the seed round, the series A. This will be political disruption like we have never seen before. The oldest political party in the world will be overtaken by the youngest political party on the planet. Kemi Badenoch has said she doesn’t believe Elon Musk is going to make a multimillion-pound donation to Reform UK, even as the party’s treasurer claimed the US billionaire was now ready to do so, Ben Quinn reports. UPDATE: In her interview with Amol Rajan from Today, asked about the prospect of Musk giving up to $100m to Reform UK, Badenoch said: I don’t believe that he is going to give that money but it doesn’t matter if he does. Politics in the US is very different from politics in the UK. People in this country don’t necessarily like to see politics being bought. I think it would be potentially counterproductive. A state-funded scheme that has helped save cherished community sites including mainland Britain’s most remote pub is being shut early, leaving millions of pounds unallocated, Kalyeena Makortoff reports. Good morning. The Radio 4 news is leading on a story about an interview with Kemi Badenoch in which she announces that she has not got anything to announce. Welcome to the Christmas holiday news desert. To be fair, there is some proper news happening relating to domestic politics this morning. Revised growth figures are out and they say the UK had no growth at all in the third quarter of the year (July, August and September). As Richard Partington reports, for a new government that has made boosting growth a priority, this is a setback. The growth figures came out after the release overnight of a report from the CBI saying firms are predicting a sharp fall in business activity in the new year. Some of the papers, like the Daily Mail, have splashed on the CBI story. All of which is quite a big deal – and Graeme Wearden is covering it in detail on his business live blog. It also presents an opportunity for the Conservative party. But, in an interview with Amol Rajan from the Today programme, recorded in advance but released this morning, Kemi Badenoch defended the fact that the opposition does not have a fully worked-out policy programme. She said the next election was probably a long way off, and it was important to take time working out the party’s position. Here are some of the main lines from the interview broadcast at 8.10am on the Today programme. A longer version is being released on the Today podcast. Badenoch claimed she deserved credit for ending Tory infighting. Asked how her leadership was going, she said: I think it is going well. I think it’s going as well as it possible could do. I was expecting it to be much worse. And one of the things that I’m really pleased about is that the party has downed tools on the internecine warfare, and the actual being in parliament and seeing a real Labour government reminds everyone who the real opponent is. She rejected claims that she should be setting out more policy now. She said she did not think there would be an early election, and she claimed that when the Conservatives announced lots of policy soon after their defeat in 1997, that turned out to be a mistake. She said: In 1997 what we did was rush out with a whole bunch of things that we’re going to do it: save the pound, do this, do that, kick every barking dog. It did not work. As an engineer, you have to look at the problem that you are trying to solve. The public did not kick us out because they didn’t like our manifesto. They kicked us out because they did not trust us. … We need to explain why we didn’t deliver. We need to re-earn that trust. Earning trust is not something you do with a few tweets, rushing on television and getting on Instagram. That’s not what you do. Building trust is something that takes a while. A lot of people assume that, because Labour are unpopular, that they will fall soon. I don’t think so. People are used to the drama of the Brexit years, changing prime ministers every couple of years. I even sometimes stumble on comments when you’re reading an article, ‘They should have got rid of him by now.’ It’s it’s been six weeks [since she became leader – although it actually is seven weeks]. She also said commentators should accept that it was “a marathon, not a sprint” for her party. But Badenoch also said she did not have as much time as she would like to come up with the plans for a “revolution” in how the state operates. She said: I don’t have as much time as I would like. Four years even in my view is not enough time to do what we want to do, which is a revolution in terms of how the state works and how our society functions. It is built for the 20th century and we need to change that. However, simply building a castle in the sand is not going to work either. My view is that I don’t have very much time but I have lots of things that need doing. She said the local elections would be “very difficult” for her party. (An analysis of council byelection results I posted on the blog on Friday helps to explain why.) She said she was not bothered about people disliking her. Asked why the former Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns defected to Reform UK, she said it was because Jenkyns did not like her. Asked why that was, she replied: Honestly, I don’t really care. There are loads of other people who do like me. It’s politics. Some people will, some people won’t … There’s this great song by Baz Luhrmann that you know, remember compliments you receive, forget the insults, called Everyone’s Free to Wear Sunscreen. That’s sort of how I try and live. She dismissed the threat posed by Reform UK, saying there were giving “easy answers” because they had not thought things through. She said: Reform is saying stuff because it hasn’t thought it all through. You can give easy answers if you haven’t thought it all through. I do the thinking and what people are going to get with new leadership under me is thoughtful Conservatism, not kneejerk analysis. Here is a clip from the interview. I will post more from it when I have heard the full version. We have got a Downing Street lobby briefing at 11.30am, but otherwise the diary is fairly empty.

The Guardian has given up posting from its official accounts on X but individual Guardian journalists are there, I still have my account, and if you message me there at @AndrewSparrow, I will see it and respond if necessary. I find it very helpful when readers point out mistakes, even minor typos. No error is too small to correct. And I find your questions very interesting too. I can’t promise to reply to them all, but I will try to reply to as many as I can, either BTL or sometimes in the blog."

          "headline": "Ghosts of the landscape: how folklore and songs are key to rewilding Finland’s reindeer",
          "bodyText": "The Finnish folk musician Liisa Matveinen lives in a mustard-coloured house in Ilomantsi, 12 miles (20km) from the Russian border. Large books of folk songs line her walls. Sitting in her kitchen, Matveinen sings about a humble hunter going into the woods to find reindeer. The song tells us how they were “honoured” providers of food, clothing and a sense of place, says Matveinen, who is recognised as a doyenne of Finnish folk music. Singing takes Matveinen back to a vanished world of hunting and fishing in the Finnish and Russian region of Karelia, where she was brought up and now lives. “I always come back here like a boomerang,” says Matveinen. She has a deep love for this remote part of eastern Finland, a place covered in vast peatlands and rivers where the oral poetry tradition stretches back 3,000 years. Few people now know these songs. And along with the songs, the reindeer themselves have disappeared. The last wild forest reindeer was shot in the Koitajoki area in 1919. Its horns are on display in a local restaurant, not far from Matveinen’s house. Now, a plan is being hatched to reintroduce them. The peatland has been restored and the first wild reindeer will be released here in 2028. The aim is to eventually have a herd of 300. Scouting animals – known as “ghost reindeer” – are already coming back down from their range farther north to look at these peatlands, suggesting the habitat could be suitable for them. Bringing back reindeer, however, is only one part of this rewilding project. The other components are part of an approach called “deep mapping”, which includes rejuvenating the culture and folklore associated with these animals to rebuild people’s connection to the land around them. Western organisations that protect wildlife have tended to overlook biodiversity’s links with culture and language. Recently, there has been criticism of species reintroduction projects for not thinking enough about the people who live alongside them. “Deep mapping appreciates an understanding of linguistic, cultural and biological diversity as all being important,” says Tero Mustonen, who is leading the reintroduction. He is a professional fisher and a lead climate scientist on the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report. “We are the guardians of the reindeer and they are the symbol of the boreal forest,” says Mustonen. Rejuvenating cultures The hope of the project is that once reindeer are reintroduced, communities will want to preserve them, and understand why they are important animals culturally and ecologically. For more than 24 years, the Finnish environmental non-profit organisation Snowchange, founded by Mustonen and his wife, Kaisu, has been carrying out research on oral histories among reindeer-hunting communities. The way people think about their responsibility to animals is important, says Mustonen, who would want people to hunt the reintroduced reindeer once again – provided it is done in the traditional way, with respect and in sustainable numbers. “Oral poems represent hundreds of years of knowledge,” says Mustonen. “They are just like a compass. We’re trying to rebuild culture and ecosystems as best as we can.” For reindeer to thrive here again, however, they must have habitat to return to. Close to 3,500 hectares (9,000 acres) of boreal peatlands are being restored by Snowchange, thanks to funding from the University of Cambridge’s Endangered Landscapes and Seascapes Programme. One of these landscapes is the peatland in Rahesuo. Two years ago, 160 hectares of this land began to be restored and ditches were filled in to raise the water level. Sphagnum moss is now starting to proliferate – a sign that this site is in recovery. Black-tailed godwits, northern lapwings and ptarmigans are among the bird species that bred on this bog last year. “The birds tell us it is recovering,” says Tero Mustonen. Reindeer can give birth on these peatlands, which should be relatively devoid of trees so they can see and smell predators. It will be 15 or 20 years before this peatland is fully restored (quicker than usual because the damage was only done in the 1970s). Reindeer are not the only ghosts of this landscapes. Old societies would have taken advantage of the birthing grounds and used this area to hunt. “This landscape is filled with knowledge, if you can find it,” says Mustonen, who describes peatlands as “our cultural memory”. Protecting the future Making people care about landscapes – and understanding their connection to them – could also help protect them in the future. In the past, these fragile, carbon-rich places have been destroyed for forestry plantations. In the early 1900s industrial logging and pulp companies saw these landscapes as empty spaces and so they took them over. Old-growth forests, peatlands and wetlands were lost as commercial forestry spread. Today, despite 76% of Finland being forested, woodland birds are declining because of the replacement of ancient forests with plantations. Few trees are more than 100 years old. The Siberian jay has already disappeared from southern Finland because it requires old-growth forests. Kesonsuo bog is one of the largest intact mires. You can see for a couple of miles in every direction: a flat landscape covered in brownish grasses, small trees and little ponds that glisten blue under a big sky. It is late September and the boreal winter is approaching. A flock of 200 geese fly clumsily in to land on their journey down from the Arctic tundra. Much of the Koitajoki region would have looked like this before industrial forestry was introduced, but now only 20% of the original peatland is left. “It’s a big symphony to live in the boreal with these dark forces and dramatic seasonal changes. Now we have this last burst of light before the boreal winter,” says Mustonen. Despite providing such inspiration for painters, musicians and writers, this landscape is vulnerable to extractive industries, he says. Adding meaning and revitalising people’s connection to the land is another way to protect it in the future. Mustonen does not want the past to repeat itself: “Without people, nature and culture, this land is empty for the taking.”"

          "bodyText": "There’s no room at the inn in Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire. Because there’s no inn. No shops. Only a former post office turned private residence. I can see a few barns, but there’s not much else in this tiny linear village. The official population is almost 200, though only a few dozen live in the centre. There’s a primary school that closed in 1999 and now serves as the village hall. Some people still come to post Christmas cards here to get the local postmark, organised by a small local group who stamp the envelopes that can then be posted in a little red postbox by the village hall. I find the chapel, first built in 1800, down a side road, a couple of hundred yards to the south. The settlement was originally called Dyffryn Ceidrich (Ceidrich’s Valley), but after the chapel was baptised Bethlehem – a common enough name for a house of worship in Wales during its nonconformist heyday – it came to denote the area too. The stone building is tall and austere, with long, thin windows; it would have been the focal point of community life and – as any reader of Caradoc Evans’ My People will know – quite possibly a hotbed of sin, prejudice and hypocrisy. There are some weathered gravestones, with a smattering of Thomases, Davieses and Joneses, and in the morning mist it’s quite atmospheric. Carmarthenshire is great for winter hiking. The walk from Llangadog (which can be reached by bus from Carmarthen or train from Swansea on the lovely Heart of Wales line) to Bethlehem takes around an hour. Using bridleways, paths, tracks and roads lined with species-rich hedgerows – holly and ivy abound – it’s an easy low-level rural ramble, taking in the ancient common of Carreg Sawdde. Another access walk, from the bus stop at Manordeilo, crosses the river Tywi, and uses green lanes and farmland paths. There were no cattle lowing when I tramped across the dank fields. The surrounding hills offer more uplifting biblical experiences. Where the peaks at the eastern end of the Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons) national park draw hefty numbers of hikers, the western ridges and summits are overlooked. The area is known as the Fforest Fawr Geopark – one of more than 150 such geoparks worldwide, recognised by Unesco for their distinctive geology. Fforest Fawr’s mountains and valleys are the result of nearly 500 million years of seismic shifts and weather events, containing evidence of ancient seas, mountain building and the turbulent climate changes of past aeons. Curvaceous ridges huddle around small lakes and rocky outcrops offer a glimpse into the remote past; the north-west area is dominated by Ordovician and Silurian formations – the oldest in the region, dating from 419-485 million years ago. A walk from Castell Carreg Cennen to Bethlehem – the concluding leg of the Beacons Way trail – is a fine way to see the geopark and make a Magi-like arrival in the holy hamlet. The castle is a handsome old ruin, probably built by Edward I’s loyal baron John Giffard at the end of the 13th century. It sits atop a magnificent limestone crag around 90 metres above the River Cennen. The route, through rough fields, via Carreglwyd Forest, takes in Garn Goch, a sandstone hill mantled with glacial till and topped by an iron-age hill fort with sweeping views over the Towy valley on one side and over to the high, smooth mountains of the Brecon range on the other. Its prominent position led to it being occupied since at least the bronze age. Down below, the village looks even tinier than it actually is. When congregations gathered at the chapel to hear the pastor expound on the social and geopolitical insignificance of Jesus’s birthplace and the dangers of the world beyond, they would certainly have found it relatable. The descent west passes through Gaer Fach (another hill fort) to come down to the village. It’s a 10-mile tramp, so you can easily be at a bus stop or train station by dusk. But who’s in a hurry? Unlike the shepherds and kings, you can make time to contemplate the heavens. Since 2013, the national park has been recognised as an International Dark Sky Reserve, one of only 22 in the world. On a clear night here, you can see a memorably frothing Milky Way, all the major constellations, some nebulas and, when they’re around, meteor showers. Carreg Cennen has one of the darkest skies in the park, with a limiting magnitude of 6.26 – which sounds technical, but basically means you can see all the stars in the night sky that were known before the invention of the telescope. On a good, cold night it’s like the Atacama desert on the tops of these old hills – all swirling star-clouds and dense clusters and bright white holes in the heavens. Once you decide you do need an inn, there are two main options: Llangadog or Llandeilo. Slow Ways, the ever-evolving walking route planner, has two routes that link to these via Bethlehem. Y Castell and the Red Lion in Llangadog (named after St Cadoc, patron saint of famine, deafness and glandular disorders) are both well-used locals; Y Castell does evening meals and recently held a French-themed Beaujolais Nouveau evening. The White Horse in Llandeilo is a Grade II-listed 16th-century coaching inn, with log-burners and live music on Sundays; a former Camra pub of the year, it has a range of local Evan Evans ales. There are also tearooms and coffee shops. Llandeilo is an ancient holy place and former royal capital. It’s also very pretty, with pastel-coloured Georgian houses climbing its gentle slopes, narrow streets with a surprising number of shops in the compact centre, and a beautiful single-arch stone bridge over the River Tywi. There’s enough around Bethlehem, Carmarthenshire, to fill a weekend. If you have an entire holiday period to spare, there is another Bethlehem in Pembrokeshire that’s even smaller. There’s also a Nasareth [sic] in the Nantlle valley – not far from Nebo, as it happens – as well as several Jerusalem chapels, many Bethels and Carmels, a sizeable Bethesda near Snowdonia and a Sodom in Denbighshire. Dig a bit, and Christianity is lurking everywhere. There are at least three Soars – after Zoar, where Lot and his daughters hid. “Llan” means church. Who needs the actual Holy Land when you have all these sites of salvation, spirituality and sinfulness in Britain’s oldest Christian country? What to do and see Dinefwr, Llandeilo Historic Newton House is surrounded by a National Nature Reserve and 18th-century landscape Deer Park. The Christmas calendar features Santa Sundays for kids, and the Mari Lwyd on 31 December and 3 January: a south Walian wassailing folk custom, which includes a ritual called pwnco that involves exchanging rude rhymes. Aberglasney Gardens Four hectares (10 acres) of gardens that range from sub-tropical and woodland to formal and modern. National Botanic Gardens of Wales The world’s largest single-span glasshouse, orchid-filled meadows, a National Nature Reserve, the British Bird of Prey Centre, children’s play areas and a Gruffalo Trail. Where to eat Y Polyn in Capel Dewi is a superb family-owned restaurant, serving the finest salt marsh lamb, Welsh beef and free-range, rare-breed pork. Where to stay Llwyncelyn is a large detached farmhouse that sleeps six near Bethlehem, with a hot tub, wood-burner, views of the Tywi valley from every bedroom, and donkeys. Dogs are accepted. Three nights from £473."

          "bodyText": "A state-funded scheme that has helped save cherished community sites including mainland Britain’s most remote pub is being shut early, leaving millions of pounds unallocated. The community ownership fund was launched in 2021, with the aim of handing out £150m worth of grants that would give local groups the financial firepower to take control of pubs, village shops, sports grounds and other beloved assets. However, the scheme, which was due to run to the end of 2025, is being closed early with £135m having been allocated to date. The government blamed the early closure on the state of the public finances, with officials saying the unspent money would be used to fund other government priorities. Advocates of the scheme had been lobbying Labour in January before the election to expand the scheme and solidify community rights of purchase. It was hoped an enhanced fund could lead to more communities banding together and taking control of cherished local gems, after successes such as the purchase of the Old Forge pub in Inverie, Scotland. The Old Forge is accessible only by ferry or via a two-day trek through the Knoydart peninsula on the west coast of Scotland. It was bought through crowdfunding support and cash from the community ownership fund in 2022, after a year-long struggle to raise funds and secure a sale. The fund also granted £300,000 to local people last year to buy the Vale of Aeron, a pub in Ceridigion, Wales, which was adored by the poet Dylan Thomas when he lived nearby in the 1940s. Ministers are promising to set out more details on community ownership of assets as part of changes due to follow the publication of the English devolution white paper, which was released earlier this month. The community ownership fund’s final round of grants was announced on Monday, allocating £36m to 85 projects across the UK, including 35 community centres, eight pubs and eight parks. Nineteen sports clubs and leisure facilities will be saved, including four historic swimming pools such as the 1960s Portishead lido in North Somerset, and one of the last tidal pools left in the country, the Victorian Shoalstone pool in Brixham, Devon. More than £1.7m is being used to refurbish and expand the MacMillan Hub community arts centre in Edinburgh, and another £800,000 to expand the building and outdoor spaces of an autism and additional needs charity in Belfast. The final round of funding also includes £400,000 to create a museum for the Welshpool and Llanfair light railway. In total, £135m has gone to 409 projects since 2021, with a further £8.5m used to provide support before and after applications. The minister for local growth, Alex Norris, said: “We’ve prioritised these grants to help preserve and upgrade what these vital places offer to their communities – whether that’s improving access to sport and education, tackling loneliness or boosting family services for parents and children. “This is just the start of our work to support communities and give them greater control of their assets and we’ll be setting out our full strategy next year.”"

          "headline": "Charles Handy obituary",
          "bodyText": "For a country that prides itself on its professional and financial services sector, the UK has produced remarkably few world-ranking management and organisational thinkers. At the very top of that pile, however, is Charles Handy, the writer and social philosopher – his preferred designation – who has died aged 92. As both a thinker and educator, Handy was unusual. Although a professor – he was a founding faculty member of the London Business School (LBS), the UK’s first graduate business school, in the 1960s – he never followed the conventional path, ploughing a narrow furrow and publishing in specialist journals. What he did was think, about the big human issues of business, society and democracy, turning his thoughts, often anchored in his own experience, into books, articles and talks with characteristically evocative titles such as The Age of Unreason (1989), The Empty Raincoat (1994), The Hungry Spirit (1997) and The Second Curve (2015). They gained him an international audience and global sales of more than 2m. In his ability to perceive and articulate developments in the world of work before they crystalised, and in his big-picture approach, Handy took after another atypical European academic, Peter Drucker, dubbed the “father of management”, whom Handy admired. Handy was writing about the future of work as early as 1984, foresaw an era of discontinuous change in The Age of Unreason – his breakthrough book – as well as predicting the advent of the gig economy, remote working and the fragmentation of the traditional career. The “portfolio life” was his coinage, which he defined by living it. In management terms, Handy’s legacy is his steadfast defence of the company as an evolving community of people rather than a machine or set of contracts. This was based on an unshakeable belief in humanity – “humanity will triumph – people need people”, he said in a podcast interview in 2021, at the height of a pandemic lockdown. To thrive, a company had to make space for human purpose, human balance and human fulfilment. “Doing your best at what you are best at,” was his Aristotelian recipe, adding “for the benefit of others” at the end. This fed into his belief that the organisation of the future needed to be flexible, decentralised and built on trust rather than formal hierarchy and a rule book. Born in Ireland, in Clane, Co Kildare, the son of Joan (nee Scott) and Brian Handy, a Protestant clergyman, Charles went to Bromsgrove school, Worcestershire, then studied classics at Oriel college, Oxford, from which he absorbed influences that marked his thinking throughout his life. Just as formative was his first job at an outpost of Shell in Borneo in 1956, only doubly so: first because it was while there that he met Elizabeth Hill, then working at the British High Commission in Singapore, at a party in Kuala Lumpur, and second because, with her trenchant help, it showed him what he did not want to be. They married in 1962. The epiphany came in 1965, when he found himself back in London, in an anonymous shared office at Shell HQ, greeted by a three-page list of responsibilities on his desk with no name on it. That struck him as not very human. Liz more forcefully gave him to understand that seeing the adventurous expat she had met and married turn into a dull office drudge was not part of their life’s plan. Instead he relocated to the US – another formative experience – to attend the Sloan executive study programme at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, from which he returned to London in 1967 to set up a UK version of the programme at the LBS. He endowed it with a humanistic cast far removed from the usual finance and quantitative orientation. “Charles always had a sense of what it is to be human,” his friend and close LBS colleague Lynda Gratton said. “He inspired students, readers and friends to think more deeply, question more profoundly and live a life nearer to being human – with all its complexities and questions.” Handy left LBS for a four-year stint as warden of St George’s House at Windsor Castle (1977-81), a sort of spiritual thinktank, before, again egged on by Liz, deciding to quit and go freelance as a writer and speaker. They reorganised their life, and, half-joked Handy, rewrote their marriage contract. Henceforth they would split the year in two, with the work of first one, then the other, taking priority. Liz became his formidable agent as well as resuming her own career as a successful photographer – they subsequently collaborated on several books – and their time would be spent half in their former farm labourer’s cottage in rural Norfolk and half in their London home. They also shared cooking duties for the many visitors who arrived at both places to discuss world events, photography and politics over a generous lunch. Relishing the new regime, Handy launched into a series of books that conquered an audience stretching far beyond business types. In fact, the latter were sometimes dismayed by what he had to say. He rejected shareholder capitalism, deeming shareholder ownership of companies a fiction and a fraud, and fretted that big corporations had become “prisons of the soul”. For him, “good organisations are like a small English village. Everyone knows each other and what the other does. There’s no job title, you’re just Charles or Liz, and you help each other out. It’s not owned, people belong to it.” In those circumstances, management becomes a matter of common sense, not the technocratic exercises described in the textbooks he scorned. If Handy’s writing style was conversational and accessible, his speaking could reach heights worthy of the ancients he had learned from. This was done without bravado, PowerPoint or notes, but with a quiet intensity that made every listener feel as if he was addressing them personally. It was there that his inner firebrand sometimes surfaced. Few of those present will forget his closing speech, or the spontaneous standing ovation it prompted, at the Global Peter Drucker Forum in Vienna in 2018, when he called for a Lutheran Reformation of management, urging the audience not to wait for a great leader but “to start small fires in the darkness, until they spread and the whole world is alight with a better vision of what we could do with our businesses … If not us, then who? If not now, then when?” Handy was active almost until the last. His final book, suitably titled The View from Ninety: Reflections on Living a Long, Contented Life, is due for publication in 2025. Liz died in a car accident in 2018. Handy is survived by his son and daughter, Scott and Kate, four grandchildren and by two sisters, Ruth and Margaret. • Charles Brian Handy, social philosopher and management thinker, born 25 July 1932; died 13 December 2024"

          "bodyText": "The soaring price of stamps has cast doubt on the future of Christmas cards, but despite the money and time involved it seems gen Z want to keep the festive tradition likened to sending a “long distance hug”. This year, sales of boxed cards are down 23%, and individual Christmas cards 15%, according to John Lewis’s annual shopping trends report, but people have embraced Instagram or WhatsApp to share festive greetings, or sent e-cards. Some send a combination. “I send physical cards when I can give them to people directly or in my college’s pigeonholes,” said Katherine, 18. “Postage is so expensive now. It was about 48 people this year so undoable.” Katherine, a student, also sends a “happy Christmas” text and suggests together they provide a good way of “restarting a lapsed connection”. Digital cards seem “pointless”, however, as “it isn’t part of your text chain”, she said. Physical cards are “so much more personal”, agreed Neve Spalding. Although messy scribblers beware, as the 17-year-old A-level student, who lives in Ipswich, said “your handwriting can tell a lot about how much effort you’ve put into a card”. They were two of more than 200 readers who responded after we asked for the views of gen Z (born between 1997 and 2012) and other generations on whether they preferred physical or digital cards. Over the past five years the regulated price of a second-class stamp has increased nearly 40% to 85p. Over the same period a first-class stamp is up almost 140% to £1.65. Two increases this year in first-class costs mean senders of all ages are reconsidering the tradition. “I used to send and receive around 60 cards,” said Penny, 54, from Sussex. “As stamp prices rocketed, everyone cut back year by year. This year, I have sent 25 – of which 12 were by post and the rest by hand – because I just can’t afford the stamps. I think I’m unusual among my circle that I’m still giving cards at all.” But Penny is still a believer in a ritual she thinks keeps friendships alive: “I have one particular school friend who lives many miles away. Last year, for the first time in 20 years, we finally managed to meet up. I’m certain we wouldn’t have done so if it wasn’t for our annual Christmas card contact.” Natalie Herman has painted 90 watercolour cards (she started at the beginning of November) for her friends and family. “I adore the process,” said the 69-year-old opera singer from Croydon. “I also love writing inside my handmade cards and on the envelopes with my italic fountain pen.” Chelle, 59, from Bristol, feels the same. “I love Christmas cards. Sadly, I just cannot afford the price of the stamps alongside the price of cards for the amount of people I’d like to send a seasonal greeting to. Digital just feels a little soulless to me … whereas seeing the address written in the familiar handwriting of a friend on an envelope is like a long-distance hug.” Even if it is no longer the norm to have a mantelpiece crowded with cards or strung on ropes around the room, Britons are still prolific card senders. With large numbers sold by schools and in charity shops, the total exchanged is hard to pinpoint, but research on behalf of Hallmark Cards suggests Britons bought about 30m boxes and 120m single Christmas cards in 2024. The poll of 1,000 people found young people were as likely to send Christmas cards as older Britons and were planning to send and spend more on cards than in 2023, which was not true for older people. Sales of single cards have declined 8% since the pandemic, but have now stabilised, said Joe Tipper, an analytics and insights manager at Hallmark Cards. The sales decline for boxed cards is steeper, probably driven by changing lifestyles such as remote working. However, the tradition is “still alive and well” with 80% of Britons buying Christmas cards, he said. There is also a growing tribe of e-card senders. The WhatsApp digital card company 2050cards says there has been “unprecedented” demand this year, with more than 10,000 new customers in December. Others reported using sites such as Dontsendmeacard.com to send charity e-cards, enabling them to donate what they would have spent on cards and stamps to causes they care about. Grahame Pigney, who is retired and lives in France, sends digital Christmas and birthday cards. “The cost of posting physical cards is extortionate and for around £20 per year we can send unlimited Christmas and birthday cards,” he said. Sheffield retiree Ric Morte said there was “nothing better” than receiving cards at Christmas. “For some, perhaps more elderly people, it’s one of the very few occasions they receive any post other than bills and circulars. Reading an enclosed hand-written letter, arranging them as decorations, glancing at them occasionally, remembering the past, just adds to the festive spirit. We send cards because we care. “By contrast, digital cards are a blight. Scrooge would turn in his grave.”"

          "bodyText": "When it comes to travel, Heather Ewart is a pro. In her early career Ewart worked as a foreign correspondent, hopping everywhere from Belgium to the United States. And for the past decade she has hosted Back Roads, the beloved ABC program that ventures to Australia’s small towns to meet the colourful characters who inhabit them. Along the way, Ewart has eaten unforgettable meals, learned what to pack when you’re roughing it – and witnessed great tragedy. Here, the journalist and TV host tells us about the highs and lows of her time on the road, as well as the tricks she’s learned for making every trip run a little smoother. What makes an excellent travel companion? Someone with a good sense of humour and a curiosity about new places and people. They must embrace the unexpected and be willing to stop and explore. In other words, don’t be in a hurry or tied to a rigid schedule. You can miss a lot of good sights and characters that way. My earliest childhood holiday memory is … A holiday with my family at the beach at Lorne on Victoria’s spectacular Great Ocean Road. I grew up on a sheep and wheat farm in inland Victoria and we only ever got to see the sea in January once a year, when the harvest was finished. The first time I spotted the sparkling blue ocean at Lorne, it was just magical. It’s also where we learned to swim as kids. Describe your most memorable travel meal – good, bad or just surprising. That would be at the William Creek pub on the Oodnadatta track in outback Australia. It’s in a tiny remote township with a population of about 10, and the last place you’d expect a gourmet meal. It was such a lovely surprise to find a tasty homemade terrine on the menu and a delicious Thai chicken curry. Not a chicken parma and chips in sight. The Back Roads crew and I couldn’t believe our good fortune. What’s the most relaxing place you’ve visited? Sailing down the Gordon River near Strahan in the stunningly beautiful, pristine wilderness of south-west Tasmania. It was an overnight boat trip with the Back Roads crew, and the morning mist rising from the water as the sun came up is something I’ll never forget. And the most stressful? Waco, Texas in the USA when I was a foreign correspondent based in Washington DC for the ABC in the 90s. An American by the name of David Koresh was threatening to blow up the cult headquarters he’d created on the outskirts of town. There were many followers and young children inside and the camera crew and I were in Waco for a month, never sure of what would happen each day as the FBI negotiated. He finally went ahead with the threat. It was horrible. What is your holiday ritual? Finding the best place to swim. The first thing I do and the last thing I do is to have a dip. Also finding the best location for an icy cold beer (maybe two) at sunset. What’s one item you always put in your suitcase? A travel-sized iron because on Back Roads you just never know if there’s going to be one in your motel room or camping ground cabin and my producers have the cheek to insist on pressed clothes on film shoots. It’s not my favourite chore. What’s your strategy for surviving long-haul flights? Try to adjust sleeping patterns to the time zone where I’m heading, and always pack a couple of good books. Back Roads, hosted by Heather Ewart, returns on 9 January at 8pm on ABC TV and ABC iView."

          "bodyText": "On 23 December 1935, a woman called “Mouse” set off from her home in Earl’s Court in search of Christmas in England. “In some remote corner of this island there must be a shining blazing hearth, beams laden with holly and mistletoe, and bustling happiness when the turkey and the plum pudding are cooking away in the big, old fashioned oven,” Mouse writes of her festive road trip in a diary that has been bought at auction by the Dorset History Centre with funding from charitable organisation Dorset Archives Trust – and is an invaluable source for social historians. The writer – genealogical sleuths speculate that she is Cheshire-born Doris Perry [née Bateman], aged 45 at the time of writing – undertakes the journey with her husband, who appears in the chronicle as “Jumbo” and “the Elephant” (and is presumed to be solicitor and shipping investor Arthur Vivian Perry, then aged 44). The pair travel through Dorset and Hampshire as Mouse, with her derring-do and between-the-wars style, documents run-ins with “dully lit dining rooms innocent of Christmas decoration”, “inferior port” and “the usual devastating English salads” that feature damp lettuce, beetroot, tomato and “a bottle of mayonnaise”. Their journey peaks in the happy discovery, on 27 December, of festive cheer at old coaching inn The Antelope in Dorchester. Here, our intrepid gourmands fall upon “fresh hot toast and jam” and wine that “warmed Jumbo’s marrow” in “a simply furnished, beautifully kept lounge” with a “bright fire”. The marbled manuscript is illustrated with picture postcards bought on the journey and a hand-drawn route map. Diane Purkiss, professor of English literature at Oxford University and author of English Food: A People’s History, says informal sources such as Mouse’s In Search of Christmas in England and the wartime Mass Observation diaries are an “invaluable” trove for social historians. “There’s something honest about these accounts in that they are not written for a polemical purpose, nor are they part of marketing or advertising,” Purkiss says. “They also sit separately from the food industry.” In Search of Christmas in England is in the intimate and richly detailed tradition of the diaries of Samuel Pepys or James Woodforde, the Georgian country parson who in his diaries of 1758-1802 documents “gargantuan” meals of roast beef, the fall of the Bastille and the freezing over of chamber pots in East Anglian winter. Mouse and Jumbo’s “merrie England quest” conveys an image of the then-emergent upper-middle-class motor tourism boom that is as dreary as it is today. In the 1930s, tourist-focused “experiences” began to emerge alongside sometimes misguided notions of regional authenticity. “This was also the era which invented the Devonshire cream tea as a tourist experience,” says historian Annie Gray, whose new book The Bookshop, the Draper, the Candlestick Maker explores the fate of the British high street through the diaries of centuries of shopkeepers. Mouse, tellingly, cites the “expert on country food”, Florence White, the folk food historian whose 1932 cookery book Good Things In England was pivotal in a 1930s folk renaissance that also revalued morris dancing. “This era was rather vested in ye olde ways without fully comprehending how hard life was in the past,” she says. Also striking to the modern eye is Doris Perry’s depiction of the locals. While praise is lavished on pulchritudinous settings – the “green girt street of Milton Abbas, with its pairs of soft cream tinted cottages sheltered beneath the trees”; and Studland village, “a picturesque, much wooded place” – our narrator heaps disdain on Swanage’s “bright young things” who are “large, vulgar and determined to enjoy themselves at all costs”. A lady-turned innkeeper in West Harnham, meanwhile, is “of the worst type”: “She could not even produce a glass of sherry”, and “kept us standing in the cold while she dilated on all her preparations for a children’s tea party”. Most jarring, however, is the encounter with an inadequate barmaid at the Bankes Arms hotel in Corfe Castle, a lachrymose and “red-eyed slatternly Irish girl” named Bridget who is homesick for the Christmases of Ireland. Mouse sniffily reports: “They’ll be at the dancin’ in the big farm now’! she gulped. ‘And me not there to see it! – I’d never have come [to England] if I’d known’!” Purkiss believes our author comes across as “unbelievably entitled” by 21st-century standards in her distaste for restaurants that serve such Christmas standards as “slices of cold ham and turkey”, “mashed potatoes” and “cold mince pies” and don’t offer the cosy version of Dickensian hospitality that is Mouse’s “heart’s desire”. The manuscript’s purchase is part of Dorset History Centre’s drive to increase public engagement with its archives and includes work to preserve accounts of the lives of Dorset’s long-standing GRT (Gypsy, Roma and Traveller) community with local organisation Kushti Bok, and the digitisation of the correspondence of local author Thomas Hardy. The centre plans to stage Hardy’s works in communities across Dorchester for the centenary of the author’s death in 2028. In the end there’s no holly and mistletoe to be found for Jumbo and Mouse, no rubicund coachman, no plum pudding or hot turkey. We leave a hungover Jumbo, struggling “to raise a very pink bald head from the pillow”, and Mouse as pert as ever. “Perhaps … I was born too late,” Mouse speculates after the couple’s sentimental festive journey. For all this, Mouse resolves to continue her search for the snow on the sill, the chirping robin and the hot plum pudding of ye olde merrie England. “After all,” she says, “it’s what makes life worthwhile.”"

          "headline": "Teachers should be allowed more flexible working, Bridget Phillipson says",
          "bodyText": "All state school teachers in England should given the right to work away from the classroom on lesson preparation, marking and pupil assessment to stem a growing retention crisis in the profession, the education secretary says today. Bridget Phillipson told the Observer it was vital more schools offered teachers some flexible working away from the classroom as is already the case in many academy schools, without reducing contact time with pupils. Her move comes as the Department for Education (DfE) reels from a mass of data showing high numbers, particularly of young female teachers, drifting out of the profession. A recent Working Lives of Teachers and Leaders survey shows a big jump in respondents citing the lack of flexible working opportunities as a reason for considering leaving the state education sector in the next 12 months – up from 34% in 2023 to 47% in 2024. Women aged 30 to 39 are the largest group quitting teaching, while also being the largest in the workforce. In England, the equivalent of over 9,000 full-time female teachers left in 2022-3. Phillipson said: “Children’s life chances suffer without world-class teachers in our classrooms – that’s why it’s never been more urgent that we grip the teacher recruitment and retention crisis raging in our schools. “That’s what this government will do, by taking innovative examples from academies in offering more flexibility without reducing the teaching time with pupils. Our new children’s wellbeing bill will transform children’s life chances, helping us break the link between their background and what they can go on to achieve: that means driving up standards across every school.” In the children’s wellbeing and schools bill, published last Tuesday, there are provisions for all non-academy schools to have the same freedom to allow flexible working for their teachers as academies. Dixons Academies trust, which has schools in Leeds, Bradford, Manchester and Liverpool, says it is encouraging more remote working which includes giving more planning, preparation and assessment time “and making it manageable from home or another remote location”. While seeing the right to flexible working as key to addressing retention issues, Phillipson said she was aware teachers’ face time with pupils also needs to be protected at all costs. “Both are vital. We need to get both right,” said a government source. The government has accepted the recommendations of the School Teachers’ Review Body (STRB), which provides advice on the pay, professional duties and working time of school teachers in England, to look at further flexibility in completing planning, preparation and assessment work away from the classroom to allow them to accommodate family life better. Ministers will now ask the STRB to look at what further flexibility around pay and conditions could be incorporated. Daniel Kebede, general secretary of the NEU, said: “Since the pandemic, employers across the board have introduced more flexible working patterns. In a very competitive labour market, it is extremely important that the education sector is not left behind. Allowing teachers to work from home when possible is a necessary and welcome step in the right direction to address the ongoing recruitment and retention crisis. This, however, must be coupled with improved pay and reduced workload to really have a significant impact on the numbers who are attracted to teaching or see it as a sustainable long-term career.” Almost as many teachers left the profession as joined last year. The latest DfE data showed that overall the teaching workforce grew by only 259 teachers last year – down from growth of 2,844 the year before. The new Labour government signalled an immediate shift in relations with teachers by announcing a 5.5% pay rise in July, pushing starting salaries for teachers up to a minimum of £31,650 in England and £38,766 in inner London from September. Academies can set their own pay. But the 2.8% pay rise the government recommended this month for 2025-26 has had a far frostier reception from unions, especially as it looks set to come with no extra funding. Recruitment remains a big issue across the state sector. Headteachers report that it is common to post job advertisements several times that turn up no suitable applicants. The battle to retain teachers has reached a similar crisis level, with a third of new teachers leaving within their first five years. The 6,500 new teachers that the Labour government has promised to fund by putting VAT on private school fees in its flagship announcement, risks being cancelled out by the more than 9,000 experienced women in their 30s who left last year. Emma Sheppard, founder of the Maternity Teacher Paternity Teacher Project, whose recent research highlighted that this group of mainly overworked mothers was the largest cohort leaving state education, said “too many” had decided teaching was incompatible with being a parent. “They say, ‘You want me to put children first, but not my children.’ We found that what teachers really value is ad hoc flexibility, when school covers for you because it is your child’s nativity play or the childminder hasn’t turned up,” she said. But she added schools were often so short-staffed those “small asks” weren’t possible. While pay has dominated the headlines, surveys suggest workload stress and lack of work-life balance are also major factors for those leaving. About 10% of teachers’ non-contact time, when they aren’t teaching, is supposed to be ring fenced so they can do marking and lesson preparation in school and not late at night or over weekends. But many report this is taken up with other work demands. Headteacher Andrew O’Neill said he “couldn’t recruit teachers for love nor money” when he took over then-failing All Saints Catholic College secondary school near London’s Grenfell Tower in 2016. But he said improving conditions for teachers had transformed hiring and retention. One innovation was allowing staff to come in at 10.45 one morning a week. “One teacher told me having a late start was a gamechanger for the end of term when everyone’s exhausted. She had a lie-in,” he said. He feels strongly that teachers should be trusted to do marking and lesson preparation at home, saying: “In every other profession we are happy for people to regulate themselves. Why does it have to be different for teachers?” • This article was amended on 22 December 2024 to clarify that the proposals and recommendations reported above relate to school teachers in England. Education policy is a devolved power in the UK."

          "bodyText": "As a former deputy state underwater archaeologist, Mark Wilde-Ramsing can’t help but look down. While rowing around North Carolina’s Eagles Island, at the tip of the Gullah Geechee corridor, he noticed signs of human-made structures, visible at low tide. Though he’d retired, he was still active in the field and knew his former agency hadn’t recorded the structures – which meant he had come across something previously undocumented. The next step was figuring out exactly what he’d found. Wilde-Ramsing knew the area had once been full of rice fields. His neighbor, Joni “Osku” Backstrom, was an assistant professor in the department of environmental sciences at the University of North Carolina-Wilmington whose specialty was shallow-water sonar, and he had the skills and technology to explore the area. Using a sonar device, the duo detected 45 wooden structures in the river, and the remote sensing tool allowed Backstrom and Wilde-Ramsing to acoustically map the canal beds. “The side-scan sonar system that Mark and I put together and put on these vessels has been really important in finding these artifacts because if you went diving, you wouldn’t be able to see anything,” Backstrom said. “That’s really the advantage of this custom, shallow sonar system and being able to go up through these known rice canals and irrigation areas.” Spanning 2,000 acres (809 hectares) of the northern end of Eagles Island, the 45 irrigation devices were developed by enslaved people, who would later come to be known as the Gullah Geechee. The devices were used to control water flow for the rice fields in conjunction with earthen dams and levees, Wilde-Ramsing said. Their existence provides further evidence of the engineering and technological skills that Gullah Geechee people used for rice cultivation, beginning in the late 1700s at the latest. Backstrom and Wilde-Ramsing documented their findings in a study published earlier this year. “The use of the island for this endeavor prior to the Civil War, in large part rested on the shoulders of transplanted and enslaved Africans and their descendant Gullah Geechee tradition,” the study reads. The team’s discoveries, which came after two years of research in and around Eagles Island, have helped further shed light on the ingenious, skilled work of the Gullah Geechee people. Though Gullah Geechee people have been studied for centuries, Backstrom and Wilde-Ramsing’s research is the first to focus on their irrigation systems. The research couldn’t come soon enough: Eagles Island is environmentally vulnerable, both because of climate change and ongoing development. The duo registered their sites with the state, making development more difficult as a means to ensure the protection of cultural artifacts. “The whole area was originally swamp. It was cleared mostly in the post-colonial, early 1800s period for tidal rice cultivation because that area was freshwater,” Wilde-Ramsing said. “They were able to actually use, regulate, introduce the water and drain it with the tides instead of having these big ponds and using the traditional way.” The work the Gullah Geechee people did would have been exhaustive. Wilde-Ramsing says it required removing the cypress forests, then building dams and levees. Growing rice necessitated the use of water, so they created long wooden boxes, or “trunks”, with gates on either side, that allowed them to let the water in by opening the gates. The area, Wilde-Ramsing said, is desolate, difficult swamp terrain, which makes it good for rice cultivation, but hot, buggy and humid – “really not a nice place to work in the summer”. Everyone got around via boat, and most of the boat drivers were enslaved Africans. The enslaved populations throughout the Gullah Geechee corridor – which spans the coasts of North Carolina to upper Florida – were isolated in such a way that they developed and maintained a culture different from that of most plantations. “Originally, they were sought out as slaves from coastal regions of west Africa, an area that had similar environs to those along the southern Atlantic seaboard centering on Georgia and the Carolinas, where rice agriculture was a mainstay of the economy,” the study reads. “Traditional knowledge and skills, as well as the ability to tolerate humid, mosquito-infested conditions, made this group critical to the success of rice cultivation in the Americas.” Eagles Island has a long history of slavery: formerly known as Cranes Island, it was featured on John Ogilby’s 1672 map of Carolina, and around 1737, King George II granted much of the “grand island” opposite Wilmington to Richard Eagles, an attorney and plantation owner from Bristol, England, for whom the island is named. The Eagles plantation was one of many on the island. Via Wilmington, a port city founded in 1739 that developed in large part due to its participation in the slave industry, Eagles Island was used for shipping cotton, shipbuilding and rice cultivation. That rice cultivation made Wilmington wealthy, at the expense of the enslaved Gullah Geechee, who received no wages for their labor. “I didn’t quite realize the role that rice played. It rivaled cotton during the 1840s and 50s,” Backstrom said. “It was all over Europe and the US and it was all run by African Americans. A lot of it was developed based on their skills. I’m just happy that it’s coming to light and they’re getting their – I won’t say new – but recognition that this was an amazing thing, amazing work.” Even though Wilde-Ramsing and Backstrom’s discovery likely won’t permanently stop either development or climate change, not least because the island is owned by multiple private entities, the existence of historic, cultural artifacts can ensure that the Gullah Geechee structures are at least documented instead of simply being razed and forgotten. The researchers have been in communication with East Carolina University’s maritime program, and the school plans to send a contingent to the site to study some of the characteristic types. People from the school will be able to work on noting the various structures, trying to figure out how they operated and taking samples. Backstrom said that they’ve also been in contact with researchers at George Mason University in Fairfax county, Virginia, including a professor who had ancestors in Wilmington. In terms of further discovery, a mix of approaches best suits the complicated terrain. “We’re thinking about using drone imagery,” Backstrom said. “We have some preliminary drone footage, which gives us access to these areas at dead low tide, areas that we had a lot of difficulty with, even with a very small vessel.” The area is remote, full of tight nooks and crannies. It’s “particularly challenging because of the tides and the timing”, he said. The different combinations of drone imagery and sonar mean the researchers aren’t limited by turbidity in the water. Backstrom hopes to go to west Africa, specifically to Senegal or the Senegambia region, where many Gullah Geechee people were from, to learn about the history of rice farming, including the roles women and children played. Children, for instance, tasted the water to ensure too much saltwater wasn’t being let in, and women helped in the actual cultivation of the rice, using skills from their home countries that were passed down throughout generations. The methods that the researchers used for Eagles Island can be transferred elsewhere, and Wilde-Ramsing and Backstrom will apply their discovery techniques to finding other such sites in the area. They anticipate finding others around Cape Fear, a nearby former slave center, and in places farther south in the Gullah Geechee corridor. “South Carolina was kind of the center of rice cultivation compared to here, so we’re hoping to link up with the Gullah Geechee researchers, [maybe] down in South Carolina or even Georgia,” Backstrom said. Their work will continue to expand knowledge around historic Gullah Geechee practices for generations to come."

          "bodyText": "Ian Rankin A Maigret Christmas and Other Stories by Georges Simenon Christmas can be a bit hectic, so it’s usually Boxing Day evening before I can stretch out on the sofa with the lights dimmed and a glass of something to hand. One year I found A Maigret Christmas and Other Stories in my stocking. Georges Simenon’s doughty, humane bloodhound of a character is perfect for winter nights, his Paris office heated by a stove, his pipe lit and nose attuned to the human condition. There are just three stories in this slim volume and the detective features in only one of them, but it’s still a delight of a book that I will almost certainly find myself rereading this festive season. Ian Rankin is the author of Midnight and Blue (Orion) *** Bella Mackie The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding by Agatha Christie Hercule Poirot is invited to spend the holidays at Kings Lacey, the country home of Colonel and Mrs Lacey, who promise to give him a proper English Christmas (avid Christie fans will know that Poirot abhors the cold, and he only accepts the invitation when he’s assured they have central heating in every room). Christie goes all in, vividly creating a comforting and wholesome family scene where something sinister appears to be bubbling underneath. With a warning not to eat the plum pudding, and a body found in the snow, the novel showcases Christie’s talent for weaving sinister themes into the most refined of settings. But perhaps the Christmas spirit got to her a little, as this book isn’t as dark as some of her oeuvre (looking at you, And Then There Were None). There’s a rich seam of humour running throughout, from the Lacey’s despair at their granddaughter’s rather modern choice of boyfriend, to the plot to trick Hercule Poirot devised by the children of the house. In the foreword, Christie explains that the story was inspired by the Christmases she spent at Abney Hall. “The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding,” she wrote, “is an indulgence of my own, since it recalls to me, very pleasurably, the Christmases of my youth.” There’s much talk in the book of fears that the traditions of the season are slowly being forgotten, which is entirely untrue, of course. For me, there is nothing more festive than sitting by a fire with a Christie mystery in one hand and a mince pie in the other. Bella Mackie is the author of What a Way to Go (Borough) *** Mick Herron Uncivil Seasons by Michael Malone This is a crime novel whose opening sentences always put me in a Christmas mood: “Two things don’t happen very often in Hillston, North Carolina. We don’t get much snow, and we hardly ever murder one another.” Poignant, funny, romantic and chilling, the first of Michael Malone’s Hillston trilogy felt like an instant classic, and still does. Mick Herron is the author of The Secret Hours (Baskerville) *** Val McDermid A Candle for Christmas &amp; Other Stories by Reginald Hill Between demanding visitors and Christmas TV specials, it can be a struggle to find the time and space to get stuck into a novel at Yuletide, even an old favourite. So for me, short stories have become my festive go-to. For a traditional flavour of the season, I find it hard to beat A Candle for Christmas. It brings together a baker’s dozen of Reginald Hill’s excellent short stories, not just featuring his regular pairing of Dalziel and Pascoe but also showing Hill’s range as a writer, including an outing to Italy for Sherlock Holmes. Warm, humorous and invariably clever with it, he deserves not to be forgotten. Val McDermid is the author of Past Lying (Sphere) *** Vaseem Khan The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson I first read The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo over a blistering hot Christmas in Mumbai some 15 years ago – a gift from my mother-in-law. (Make of that what you will.) Granted, the book doesn’t exactly sing yuletide, but I consider it an honorary entry into the Christmas thriller canon. A wealthy businessman employs a journalist and a kick-ass cyberhacker to investigate the decades-old disappearance of his great-niece. The story takes place on a tiny island, gripped by winter’s icy fingers, with Christmas making a guest appearance. The characters exhibit peak Scandi moodiness alongside knitted sweaters, swirling glasses of cognac, random sex, and the sort of family infighting that makes Succession look like a teddy bears’ picnic. Vaseem Khan is the author of City of Destructio &amp; Stoughtonn (H&amp;S ) *** Sarah Perry The Complete Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle In The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle, Sherlock Holmes solves the problem of a stolen gemstone turning up inside a Christmas goose. This is perhaps the most festive Holmes adventure, but really they’re all ideal Christmas reading: the London smog pressed against the Baker Street windows, and the pacing of distraught aristocrats and butchers; Holmes idly playing his violin in his dressing gown while an irritated Watson examines the outcome of an experiment involving rare poisons. My copy of the Complete Sherlock Holmes is an immense paperback showing the great detective in profile wreathed in smoke. This is the edition I borrowed from my father when I was young, and never gave back. Some girls dream of romance: I dreamed of rooms in London, a series of murders only I could solve, and a best friend almost – but not quite – as clever as I. I’m not yet sure which Holmes stories I’ll read by the fire with my cat (Mrs Hudson) on my lap. I know their solutions by heart, which is what makes them really suited to Christmas. Life contains enough nasty surprises: at this time of year I want a book I can rely on, as surely as I can rely on my mum’s mince pies. Sarah Perry is the author of Enlightenment (Vintage) *** Janice Hallett The Long Shadow by Celia Fremlin Newly widowed Imogen finds herself hosting an impromptu Christmas gathering, where at least one guest has a distinctly unfestive agenda. Meanwhile, a mysterious phone caller insists that, far from dying in a car crash, her husband was murdered … and that Imogen herself did it. As Christmas stories go, Celia Fremlin’s 1975 classic is by no means the most cheerful, but I like festive reading to stir up the dark side of the season. I was six in 75. My family Christmas was full of adults over whom two world wars hung, practically entwined with the flammable tinsel, while a younger generation could see little cheer in the future. This sense of foreboding would eventually explode into the punk movement, but not quite yet. I discovered Fremlin only recently, but it’s precisely the time in which she was writing that resonates so strongly with me: she captures the postwar era of my childhood so well. Weird as it may seem, it is the sense of dark familiarity that draws me in time and again. Janice Hallett is the author of The Christmas Appeal (Viper) *** Sophie Hannah Hercule Poirot’s Christmas by Agatha Christie The Lee family reunion on Christmas Eve is not a happy occasion – and then what little peace there has been is shattered by a deafening crash. Family members soon find the tyrannical patriarch, Simeon Lee, dead in a pool of blood. But when Poirot, who is staying in the village with a friend for Christmas, offers to help, he finds an atmosphere not of mourning but of mutual suspicion. This is the perfect novel to remind you that you’re probably having a much jollier Christmas than the characters in it! The cast, a dysfunctional extended family, make for a fascinating group of suspects, and the solution is one of Christie’s top-tier, high-concept memorable ones. The clues are expertly placed, though more than usually unobtrusive. The joy of this novel is in rereading it and seeing how perfectly it’s set up from the start. Sophie Hannah is the author of Silent Night (HarperCollins) *** Abir Mukherjee The Thin Man by Dashiell Hammett What is the festive season without a dose of mayhem and murder? Even Dashiell Hammett, the godfather of LA noir, got in on the act – sending his husband and wife pairing, Nick and Nora Charles, all the way from sunny California to the cold of a New York Christmas, where despite Nick’s best efforts, they’re pulled into investigating the disappearance of scientist Clyde Wynant, who on account of not being a fan of pies, is known as the Thin Man. Why do I love this book? Because it has everything: crime, glamour, suspense, mystery and the sharp, witty dialogue that is Hammett’s trademark. At its heart, though, is the chemistry and repartee between husband and wife, and at a time of year when nerves are often frayed by the appearance of extended family, this is especially charming. It’s a tonic when set against the usual Christmas crime fare of English country houses and murdered marquises, which, like too much Christmas pudding, can leave you with indigestion. Go on. Add The Thin Man to your Christmas diet. You can thank me later. Abir Mukherjee is the author of Hunted (Vintage) *** Oskar Jensen The Rector of Veilbye by Steen Steensen Blicher Some might contend that a 10,000-word novella by a Danish parson, written in 1829, is a wilfully esoteric choice for a Christmas read. And they’d be right. Yet still I urge you to read this short story, the original Nordic noir. It’s the perfect antidote to the schmaltz of Hallmark films and the cosiness of Christie. Instead we have the stuff of winter nights: a fallible narrator, a cold rural landscape, the machinations of a devious evil, bent on bringing down the true and the just. Our guide is the local magistrate, in love with the rector’s daughter, Mette. Her father is a good but wrathful man of God, a failing that will undo all three of them when a murder charge is brought against him. Settle in for one of the great twists in all crime fiction. With its austere Lutheran atmosphere, dug-up corpses and spectral revelations, it evokes two of my favourite festive canons: the films of Ingmar Bergman, and the ghost stories of MR James. Best read snuggled up beside a dark and tree-tapped window with a dram of aquavit. Oskar Jensen is the author of Helle &amp; Death (Profile) *** Jane Casey 4.50 from Paddington by Agatha Christie (HarperCollins) I’m not sure why Agatha Christie and Christmas go together like mince pies and brandy butter – maybe it’s something to do with the age-old mid-winter desire to snuggle down, eat high-calorie food and think about murdering your family. One of my favourites to reread around Christmas is 4.50 from Paddington, featuring the inimitable Miss Marple. It begins with a woman who is thoroughly frazzled from Christmas shopping, boarding a train to pay a visit to Miss Marple. As one train passes another, a blind flies up in the window opposite hers and she sees a man strangling a woman in an otherwise empty carriage. Mrs McGillicuddy may be tired and distracted, but she knows what she saw. However, when the police investigate there’s no body, and elderly women are all too easy to dismiss, as Miss Marple knows. She is physically frail in this post-war Christie, but her mind is as sharp as ever, and with the help of a young woman named Lucy Eyelesbarrow she identifies not only who died, but who killed her and why. Christmas is part of the story rather than the point of it – despite the country-house setting and a large cast of family members, this is not the grand Edwardian world of 17 courses for dinner and a fleet of servants. Instead, the modern world of suburban sprawl rises around the estate like a tide and staving off decline is harder by the day. However, the mystery is one of Christie’s best, with characters who feel exceptionally real and even a hint of romance. There’s a breathtaking little sleight of hand near the end where someone does something that gives them away completely – but you’ll never, ever spot it. Jane Casey is the author of The Outsider (HarperCollins) *** Charlotte Philby Carol by Patricia Highsmith My favourite Patricia Highsmith novel, Carol (published in 1952 as The Price of Salt), is delicious Christmas reading. It opens in a New York City department store in the throes of the festive season – the setting is inspired by the author’s time in a sales job in Manhattan,“vaguely depressed and short of money”, after finishing Strangers on a Train – and tells the story of a young woman named Therese, who falls for a glamorous, bored older housewife named Carol. Laced with Highsmith’s signature threat and unease, it is at once a smart, escapist thriller, and a claustrophobic, unsettling love story. Deemed shocking at the time, it still packs a punch today. Charlotte Philby is the author of Dirty Money, published by John Murray in February. *** Kia Abdullah The Hunting Party by Lucy Foley In the remote Scottish wilderness, a group of old friends gather at a luxury hunting lodge to celebrate New Year’s Eve. Spirits are initially high, buoyed by champagne and truffles, but soon the weather turns hostile – and the friends turn on each other. The Hunting Party is a modern twist on the locked-room mystery and is achingly atmospheric. The wind is “a long, melodramatic howl down the chimney” and the surface of the loch outside is “clouded, blind, scarred by ice”. I read the novel in a cosy cottage in Richmond, North Yorkshire, where the wind outside was fittingly loud. The story may be darker than normal Christmas fare, but it’s perfect for wintry evenings. Kia Abdullah is the author of Those People Next Door (HQ) *** Jonny Sweet Hangover Square by Patrick Hamilton Although it begins on Christmas Day, this is not a festive book by any traditional measure. As we meet George Harvey Bone he is entering one of his “dead” moods, a dissociative state during which his brain shuts down and he is consumed by the need to kill. With all due respect to my family, I have had a number of Christmas Days like that, too. Bone spends his conscious hours drinking excessively in Earl’s Court. He is also quite wretchedly attempting to win the affections of Netta Longdon, an out of work actor with a soft spot for fascists, who ruthlessly manipulates his advances for money and his proximity to a powerful theatrical agent. During one of these moods he plans to murder her and has no memory of this when he comes to. Hamilton started writing the book on Christmas Day 1939, a few months after war had been declared. We want the very best for Bone but we know, or suspect, that it may all be too late. It is a gripping, dire entertainment, and a possibly unique achievement in capturing so compellingly what it felt like in London on the precipice of the second world war. And a Happy New Year! Jonny Sweet is the author of The Kellerby Code (Faber) *** Lucy Foley The Sittaford Mystery by Agatha Christie The Sittaford Mystery has so much I look for in a wintry whodunnit. There is that cosy, or claustrophobic, feeling of everyone stuck inside as the weather rages. There’s the picture postcard blanket of snow covering everything. Then we have the past crimes and buried secrets coming to the surface and an escaped criminal loose on the moor. We even have skis! This is Christie in 1931, carving out a niche for herself as one of the very best in the business: Poirot and Marple aren’t even on the scene yet and, much as I love them both, it feels all the more fraught for the absence of one of these beloved and infallible detectives. I’ll certainly be reading it again this year by a crackling fire with a Marple-approved glass of cherry brandy.

          "headline": "Michael Mosley’s cause of death ‘unascertainable’, coroner says",
          "bodyText": "A coroner has recorded an open conclusion regarding the “unascertainable” death of the TV presenter Michael Mosley, who died on a Greek island after he went for a walk. Crispin Butler, the senior coroner for Buckinghamshire, said Mosley’s death “was most likely attributable either to heatstroke (accidental) or non-identified pathological cause”. Mosley, 67, went missing after going for a walk while on holiday on the Greek island of Symi in June, leading to an intensive four-day search by emergency services. He was found dead on a remote rocky terrain accessible only by boat or foot, about a 30-minute walk from where he had left his wife and friends. Extreme weather warnings had been in place that week on the island, where temperatures reached above 40C in the afternoons. In written findings, Butler said Mosley’s death was not the result of homicide, suicide or an accident related to injuries. A document from the coroner said family evidence confirmed details of the trip, and that they had been staying with friends. “On the morning of 5 June, they travelled to Pedi Beach, arriving late morning,” it said. “Michael had intentionally left his mobile phone back at the house to prevent it getting wet on the ferry. “Later in the afternoon Michael decided he was going to walk back home rather than take the ferry. He had his rucksack, one litre of water and a biscuit, and had a hat and umbrella. “Michael was described as looking energetic and cheerful as he set off. Ultimately Michael’s death was classified as indeterminate, which we would describe as ‘unascertainable’.” Recording an open conclusion, Butler said: “Michael Mosley collapsed and died on 5 June 2024 in a rocky area near Agia Marina Beach, Symi, Dodecanese, Greece. “There had been high temperatures during this time. Michael’s death was not found to be due to homicide, suicide or an accident related to injuries. “Michael’s death was most likely attributable either to heatstroke (accidental) or a non-identified pathological cause. There was nothing of note in toxicology. “No medical cause of death could be ascertained, meaning Michael’s death may have been due to a medical event or as a result of a non-traumatic accident.” Mosley was an author and television presenter most well known for popularising the 5:2 intermittent fasting diet. In 2012, he presented the BBC documentary Eat, Fast and Live Longer exploring how the diet worked, and followed this up with a bestselling book on the subject, The Fast Diet, in 2013. He regularly appeared on chatshows and presented science and healthcare documentaries for the BBC and Channel 4. Mosley wrote more books on dieting and health and presented Just One Thing on BBC Radio 4 which looked at how small lifestyle changes could improve wellbeing. In his BBC series Trust Me, I’m A Doctor, Mosley investigated and evaluated how to live healthily, exploring food and exercise trends in Britain. For his BBC4 documentary Infested! he ingested tapeworms for six weeks to investigate their effect on the human body. In The Wonderful World of Blood, he ate black pudding made up of his own blood to showcase its nutritional value."

          "headline": "Major Trump donors who complained of immigrant ‘invasion’ used Mexican workers illegally, sources allege",
          "bodyText": "A company owned by two of Donald Trump’s top mega-donors has routinely brought dozens of its workers from Mexico to staff its warehouses in Wisconsin and other locations even though they do not appear to have permission to work in the US, according to a Guardian investigation. Uline – a giant Wisconsin-based office and shipping supply company controlled by billionaires Liz and Dick Uihlein – shuttles in its own workers from Mexico, who are using tourist visas and visas meant for employees who are entering the US temporarily to receive professional training, known as B1 visas. But instead of being part of a dedicated training program, the Mexican employees stay for one to six months and – sources with direct knowledge of the matter allege – perform normal work in Uline’s US warehouses. Lawyers and immigrants’ advocates told the Guardian they believed the alleged practice is likely illegal and could be exploitative of the workers enrolled in the program. The company has allegedly used employees without proper work permits even as Dick Uihlein’s Super Pac, Restoration Pac, supported Trump’s presidential campaign with a TV advertisement attacking his opponent Kamala Harris for allowing an immigrant “invasion” at the US-Mexico border. The Uihleins have emerged as a major force in rightwing politics, spending tens of millions of dollars supporting candidates, including president-elect Trump and other rightwing politicians, who have called for a mass deportation of immigrants. They were the second-largest political donors in this year’s election, giving more than even Elon Musk, the world’s richest man. Inside Uline, a privately held company worth an estimated $8bn, the Mexico-US program is called “shuttle support” and was launched about three years ago, sources said. The Guardian’s reporting is based on interviews with sources who have direct knowledge of shuttle support and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of reprisals, and internal documents seen by the Guardian that referred to the worker program, including rules for family members and other guests who are allowed to visit the workers. Over the course of a months-long investigation, Guardian reporters also observed a dozen Uline workers from Mexico living in a hotel near the company’s Pleasant Prairie headquarters, where the company pays for their lodging, food and rental cars. A staff member at the hotel confirmed that Uline was among the first customers at the hotel to book “blocks” of suites for workers when the hotel opened about three years ago. A spokesperson for Uline and the Uihleins declined to comment. Sources who spoke to the Guardian alleged that executives at the highest level of the company, including Liz Uihlein, know about shuttle support. It is not clear why executives have turned to staff that are employed by Uline in Mexico to work at their US warehouses, but sources said it could be connected to the company’s strict and complicated hiring practices, which include follicle drug testing of employees. “They were not able to staff their warehouses, especially in Pennsylvania. So they looked at Mexico for workforce,” alleged one person with close knowledge of the matter. The Mexican workers have an implicit understanding that they should tell border officials that they are entering the US to be trained at Uline, sources alleged. One Uline document seen by the Guardian, which was used by a Uline employee in Mexico to enter the US, said the employee would be receiving training in warehouse safety, understanding how to use vehicle-mounted unit devices, and understanding how to identify warehouse locations. Legal experts said B1 visas are intended to be used for short-term visits – no longer than six months – and that workers are not meant to engage in “productive employment” in that time. Once the Mexican workers enter the US, sources alleged, they work regular shifts in Uline warehouses alongside their American counterparts. “They are actually doing work. Not training,” said one person with direct knowledge of the situation. The person added that Uline was “very careful” with the amount of time the Mexican employees stayed in the US. They are paid their Mexican wages into accounts in Mexico. Although they receive some extra compensation for traveling to the US and staying there, they are paid far less than American counterparts, sources told the Guardian. “The reason employees want to participate is because they give bonuses to those employees. They are risking their [tourist] visas. If they find out they are working, their visas would be revoked,” said one person with direct knowledge of the matter. The sources who spoke to the Guardian said Uline pays all the costs for their Mexico-based workers to leave Mexico and fly to warehouse locations in the US, including in Wisconsin and Allentown, Pennsylvania. About 60 to 70 workers from the company’s sites in Mexico may be working in the US at any time, the sources alleged. One internal Uline document reviewed by the Guardian suggests that at least some Uline workers in Mexico have been hired expressly to take part in the shuttle support program, and that workers understand that their future jobs are dependent on their participation in the program for indefinite periods. Another internal document shows that requests for Mexican participants came from a senior executive at Uline’s Pleasant Prairie headquarters, where some warehouses are based. 3,000 miles from home The corporate hotel in Wisconsin where at least a dozen Uline workers from Mexico live is about 3,000 miles (4,800km) from their homes in Mexico. Some are accompanied by their wives for their stay. Most participants in the shuttle support program are men. The hotel is comfortable, and was designed to meet the needs of long-term guests. The clean and modern suites have kitchenettes, and breakfast is served every morning: a waffle machine, granola, eggs and dry cereal, and salsa, cheese and sour cream. Hotel staff seemed to make an effort for the holidays. The lobby area included a 10ft Christmas tree and other decorations – including four knit stockings, hung over a fake fire off to the side. Still, the hotel, which the Guardian is not identifying to protect the safety of the workers, is located in a relatively remote location in landscape that would be barren but for the presence of huge warehouses – from Uline to Amazon – along the highway. Uline opened the largest warehouse in Wisconsin here earlier this month, a 1.44m sq ft facility that adds on to the company’s 9.6m sq ft footprint in the Kenosha area. One Uline worker who spoke to the Guardian but did not provide his name said he had traveled to the US for training, but then proceeded to explain how he was working in the US for a longer period and doing the same kind of work he did in Mexico. He expressed a note of skepticism about the idea that such tasks could be described as “training”. He confirmed he had traveled to the US on his own tourist visa as well as a document that fit the description of a B1 visa, meant for business-related travel – but not wage labor. ‘It really shows the cynicism’ Immigration experts – including lawyers and advocates for immigrant rights – said they believed the shuttle support program appeared to break the law. The B1 visas that are being used by some of the workers to enter the US are intended for workers to train or briefly attend a seminar or conferences, they said. “It does not allow them to obtain wages for labor in the United States, it absolutely does not,” said Marc Christopher, a Wisconsin-based immigration lawyer. “If they’re doing warehouse work, especially second or third shift, that’s not a close call.” He added that he believed it was “absolutely 100% not allowed”. Ira Kurzban, another immigration lawyer, said he believed it was “clearly illegal” for the company to be engaged in a pattern of conduct that possibly involved labor trafficking of people who were coming under “one pretense, but actually coming in for another reason”. Uline’s alleged use of its Mexican workers to staff warehouses in the US underscored the real difficulties facing some companies, Kurzban said, in being able to secure legal arrangements for workers. “This is the whole false premise of Trump. I mean, the idea that these people are taking jobs away from Americans. They’re not. We need millions of people to do this kind of work. We’ve always looked away even though we know most people who fulfill these kinds of jobs are not allowed to be working in the US.” Another immigration lawyer, Mo Goldman from Arizona, said it is a common practice for employers to call him and ask him how to legally employ foreign workers, only to find that the legal processes are “very restrictive and difficult to navigate”. “It does force employers to look at other ways to get the workers here, because they cannot find the workforce in the United States,” Goldman said. He added that there have historically been significant civil penalties that have been rendered against companies for doing such things. Christine Neumann-Ortiz, director of the Wisconsin immigrant and labor rights group Voces de la Frontera, said she believed the program was clearly undermining wages for all workers at the company. “It is a way for Uline to undercut wages for US workers, while also not paying justly the Mexican workers for what their co-workers are earning here for the exact same work, while also having to sacrifice time away from their families and communities,” Neumann-Ortiz said. She noted the irony of the Uihleins profiting “off the backs of Mexicans” even as they supported a presidential candidate – and now president-elect – who has vowed to deport immigrants, disparages them and wants to take away birthright citizenship. “It really shows the cynicism – it’s a model of international labor exploitation, while at the same time really putting money into this propaganda campaign to try to pit workers against each other.” The anti-immigrant sentiment also contradicts the reality facing American businesses, which is that they are facing severe labor shortages and have depended on the labor of undocumented workers for decades. “They want to maintain [immigration], but under very oppressed conditions,” she said. It is not the first time the Uihleins have acted in a way that appears to contradict their rightwing anti-immigration stance. ProPublica reported in 2019 that Uline had sought special visas for foreign workers even as Trump, whom Dick and Liz supported, was implementing his strictest immigration policies. The company even filed suit against the federal government in Illinois after the Trump administration rejected a 2018 petition to hire a full-time software engineer from India. In court testimony in an unrelated case, ProPublica noted, Dick Uihlein, who serves as CEO, was asked if his donations to a group supporting conservative politicians meant he did not just support immigration reform, but a more stringent immigration policy. He said: “I would say that’s correct, yep.” Election deniers and Maga firebrands Public records and media reports show the Uihleins became a major force in American politics after the landmark Citizens United decision, which upended campaign finance law and enabled corporations and other special interest groups to spend unlimited sums of money on elections. Dick and Liz Uihlein have donated millions in support of politicians on the right, including Trump and other election-denying candidates and causes. The family’s political influence has skyrocketed alongside the growth of their company, which brought in $8bn in revenue in 2024, up from $7bn in 2023 and $6.1bn in 2022. According to Federal Election Commission filings, the Uihleins spent at least $130m during the 2024 election cycle to support Trump and other rightwing Republicans. Dick Uihlein has, in particular, focused his donations largely on culture-war candidates and Maga firebrands. In 2017, Uihlein was the top funder of Republican Roy Moore’s Senate bid, continuing to run ads in support of Moore even as the Alabama politician faced allegations of sexually assaulting minors. Moore denied any sexual misconduct. In 2022, Dick Uihlein threw his support behind the Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, a far-right politician who has decried the separation of church and state and peddled conspiracy theories. In the wake of the January 6 Capitol riots, WBEZ Chicago revealed that Uihlein had bankrolled Tea Party Patriots, a group that helped organize the #StoptheSteal protest that gave way to the insurrectionary violence. A July investigation by ProPublica and Documented also identified the Uihleins as supporters of Ziklag, a secretive Christian donor network that invested in voter purges, anti-trans activism and pro-Trump electoral infrastructure. Outside of national politics, Dick Uihlein has demonstrated a particular interest in Wisconsin, where Uline is headquartered, and Illinois politics, where he and his wife live. In 2018, for example, Uihlein poured millions into an Illinois gubernatorial election, supporting the Republican incumbent’s primary challenger with ads blasting LGBTQ+ and abortion rights. During Wisconsin’s 2023 state supreme court race, Restoration Pac and Fair Courts America – groups that Uihlein has bankrolled – spent millions in support of the rightwing candidate Dan Kelly. One Mexican Uline worker who spoke to the Guardian on the condition of anonymity said he felt the Uihleins’ strong support for Trump was “a little contradictory” given the company’s practice of bringing Mexican workers to the US. “But I’m here to work, I’m not here in some illegal way,” he added.

          "bodyText": "50-31 *** 50 Karl D’Silva – Love Is a Flame in the Dark You expected Charli xcx to drop one of the British pop albums of the year – rather less so a bloke from Rotherham, known only in the deep underground, playing and recording everything himself at home. And yet D’Silva’s debut album has the huge scope of those from pop’s A-list, decked out with saxophones, massive drums, fret-scurrying guitar solos, Chicago house basslines and classic vocal melodies, resulting in industrial-leaning epics about the very biggest themes: love and existence. Don’t wait for the inevitable cult reappraisal and deluxe reissue in 30 years’ time – get on this masterpiece now. Ben Beaumont-Thomas 49 Chat Pile – Cool World The Oklahoman noise-rockers’ second album was one of the few releases in 2024 that reflected the horror and disbelief of witnessing Gaza and its people being destroyed. It is also about hard-wired failure across history – the album title is a savagely sarcastic dismissal of a planet whose human inhabitants are so wretchedly self-interested and easily given to violence. Vocalist Raygun Busch often takes the persona of a baffled functionary, operating on orders that have no reason, while his band squall and thunder through their groove-metal rhythms. BBT 48 Los Campesinos! – All Hell A triumph of tenacity and independence, Los Campesinos! self-released their seventh album – and first in seven years – and scored their first UK Top 20 hit. Their earlier twee-pop leanings have matured into bitter, morose yet spirited emo, lashing out at fascists while castigating apathy from their peers (Idles must have winced at “punks on the playlist crooning for kindness”.) But it’s not all politics: they lust in hyper-literate poetry, and hop from Bundesliga one moment to bildungsroman the next. That mix of high and lowbrow can be found throughout but most potently of all on Feast of Tongues, an anthem Coldplay could have made were it not for the savage declaration in the chorus: “We will feast on the tongues of the last bootlickers.” BBT 47 Adrianne Lenker – Bright Future Whether solo or as frontperson of her band Big Thief, Lenker keeps her release rate high, with quality and emotional intensity to match. You can almost smell the leaf mulch in her latest, recorded in a studio in a forest with pianos, acoustic guitars and the occasional touch of ambient haze. She’s holed up away from the world, rueful and hopeful in equal measure (“This whole world is dying / Don’t it seem like a good time for swimming?”) as she takes stock of hard-won wonders, be it the lessons of heartbreak, the power of language or, on the absolute blubfest of Real House, her mother’s love. BBT 46 Clarissa Connelly – World of Work Much like Julia Holter’s early work, the Scotland-born, Denmark-raised composer Clarissa Connelly’s music feels like the sort of singular study of ecstasy that could only have emerged from a remote cloister. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, both cite medieval nun Hildegard von Bingen as an influence.) On Connelly’s unique second record, there are the confrontationally drawn-out notes and complicated intonations of traditional folk songs; the off-kilter depths of Les Mystères des Voix Bulgares; in the spartan piano and dappled acoustic guitar, the gripping structural abstractions of one-offs such as Holter and Joanna Newsom. Its abiding themes are loneliness and death, but the warmth and self-possession of Connelly’s earnest inquiries into the point of it all seem to embody the lesser-known meaning of apocalypse, as revelation and the lifting of a veil. Laura Snapes 45 Mdou Moctar – Funeral for Justice Niger guitarist Mdou Moctar makes desert blues into a fractal art, each insurgent riff embroidered with detail. On Funeral for Justice, it seems like a call for his burgeoning western fanbase to play close attention – not just to be dazzled by his vaulting dynamics, but to heed his lyrics about colonialism, particularly former occupier France’s majority control of his country’s uranium supply. If justice is dying, Moctar lit the pyre. LS 44 Jamie xx – In Waves One third of the xx turned in an expertly produced dancefloor LP, finely chopping up samples and guest artists and emulsifying them into darkly throbbing Jon Hopkins-y techno, emotional trance or sparkling disco-house. The latter style provides the best track, Baddy on the Floor, made with Honey Dijon – have trumpets ever sounded more euphoric? BBT 43 Xiu Xiu – 13” Frank Beltrame Italian Stiletto With Bison Horn Grips In the goth stakes this year, Xiu Xiu’s 17th studio album made the Cure sound like Sabrina Carpenter. It’s a collection of haughty ambient balladry, skronking noise-pop and – in the underground hit Common Loon – ultra-distorted glam rock. Throughout, Jamie Stewart’s voice remains on superb, theatrical form: audibly trembling, even cowering at times; at others he strides around like a moustache-twiddling villain in a musical. BBT 42 Knocked Loose – You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To The Kentucky metalcore quintet burst into rock’s big leagues this year with a 100mph battering ram, earning a Grammy nomination and a Slipknot arena tour off the back of this magnificent LP. The guitar tone has every drop of potential loveliness scoured away, leaving rough smears of noise, while the stop-start rhythms have a profound, almost hidden funk to them – learning how to duck and weave with these haymaker blows, listen after listen, is just one of this album’s great pleasures. BBT 41 Jessica Pratt – Here in the Pitch Jessica Pratt makes music as if she’s painting watercolours, the shades of her acoustic songwriting blushing and blooming into one another with no sense of delineation. Her fourth album adds gentle percussion, bossa nova rhythms and synths for the first time, foregrounding a sense of temporal logic in songs that obsess over time – running out of it, dreaming of for ever; gorgeous koans like this, in By Hook Or By Crook: “Some people chip away time / More than they understand, an open hand / I’m waiting for way before first light / And it’s the edge worn clean again.” Pratt’s music is endlessly mysterious, but rather than create distance, her openness to the unknown plays like an invitation to wonder. LS *** 40 Doechii – Alligator Bites Never Heal You can imagine even the most modernity-denying hip-hop codgers getting on board with Doechii’s mixtape, characterised as it is by some of the year’s most technically astounding wordplay – particularly on the positively superhuman track Nissan Altima. But she’s just as good rolling over boom-bap at half the speed, and is funny and self-lacerating with it, as on Denial Is a River’s tour through drug and anger issues. As involving as the current generation of freewheeling young US MCs are – Playboi Carti, Ken Carson, OsamaSon et al – there’s something to be said for rappers who stay as perfectly on top of the beat like Doechii does. BBT 39 Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross – Challengers OST For all the frisson in Challengers, the horniest thing about Luca Guadagnino’s surprisingly chaste tennis movie might be its score. More Berghain than break point, Reznor and Ross ratcheted the tension with adrenaline-spiking techno, the beat thwacking like a tennis ball against a hard court. The Boys Noize mixed version was the one you wanted, the ride intermittently imbued with a guttural, carnal undertow, taunting “yeah yeah yeah”s and a reckless sense of velocity that mirrored the players spinning out of control as they vied for Tashi Duncan’s approval. The song Brutalizer referenced the move where a player smacks the ball directly at their opponent’s body, but in the hands of the man who sang “I want to fuck you like an animal”, its relentless, panel-beater assault suggested quite a different kind of roughing up. LS 38 Empress Of – For Your Consideration After being dumped by a Hollywood director who began his Oscars “for your consideration” campaign the next day, Lorely Rodriguez played him at his own game and turned the breakup into a concept album about want and desire – one that doesn’t waste a second moping. Instead, with co-production from Rodriguez and artists including Nick Léon and Umru, For Your Consideration is a hot, sticky, direct dance-pop record that reflects her Latin roots and unknockable self-confidence: the joke of the title is that she doesn’t care for external approval at all. On the back cover she’s painted gold like an awards statuette. “I’m choosing myself,” she told Rolling Stone. “I know this record is good.” LS 37 Jack White – No Name White’s latest had a punkish release strategy: unmarked vinyl copies were popped into customers’ shopping bags at his Third Man Records stores, then he encouraged the recipients to leak the album online. Those tactics matched the music, which is the absolute opposite to careful strategy – it’s a first-thought-best-thought ripper full of riffs that could kick a saloon door off its hinges, the production values of an amphetamine-charged 1960s teenage garage rock band and White doing a series of outrageously fun takes on the frontman: hellfire preacher, punk oik, classic rocker. If it had been his solo debut it would be canonised by now – hopefully it’ll still earn the classic status it wears so casually. BBT 36 Mach-Hommy – #Richaxxhaitian “Vagabond, nose in the bolognese, moi / Triceratops hoping I’ma stay calm …” From the opening lyrics onwards, the Haitian-American MC sets off on riveting stream-of-consciousness flows somewhere between Ghostface Killah or RZA’s delivery for Wu-Tang Clan, and fellow new-school sages such as Billy Woods and Earl Sweatshirt. The beats are full of old soul and library music samples warping in the sun alongside fresh input from jazzy outsiders such as Georgia Anne Muldrow and Sam Gendel. But rather than freestyle and meander, Mach-Hommy keeps the whole album tacking towards the mainstream, locking into keenly rhythmic verses and satisfying choruses. BBT 35 Vampire Weekend – Only God Was Above Us It takes an extremely fleet pen for a band to release an album mired in self-referentiality and pull it off – not least when that band is Vampire Weekend, who for 16 years have doubled as shorthand (often unfairly) for a particular kind of self-regarding aesthete. But their fifth album exists in the long shadow cast by 2019’s sunny Father of the Bride, Ezra Koenig plotting the distance between the band’s youthful idealism and the surrender to ideological defeat that can come with middle age. The guitars and keys often sound weathered too, but the frenzied gallop of songs such as Ice Cream Piano, or Connect, with piano as skittish as a sky of sycamore helicopters, speak to a level of insurgent awareness that would still put many of their younger peers to shame. LS 34 Amyl and the Sniffers – Cartoon Darkness “The haters” might be one of pop’s most boring subjects; anyone minded to bemoan them should take Amyl’s Amy Taylor as the gold standard. “Need to wipe your mouth after you speak / ’Cause it’s an asshole” she spits on Cro-Magnon rager Jerkin’; “there’s too many snags at the party” on Tiny Bikini – as in, sensitive new age guys, the type to tediously profess their feminist credentials. The brute disco of U Should Not Be Doing That takes aim at purist scene bores who think the Melbourne band’s international success invalidates their punk credentials – but it’s also indicative of the complex expressions of self-confidence that Taylor asserts on Cartoon Darkness, which are really her best strike against the haters. “I’m working on my worth / I’m working on my work / I’m working on who I am,” she yells frantically. Pub rock inveterates, Amyl and the Sniffers aren’t exactly the type of band to have matured on their third album, but the expansive, incantatory Big Dreams reflected a new mode, and offered a bit of Taylor’s spark to anyone in need of it: “Hey! When ya get down, oh you’re a lit one / Never been a dull one / Always been a big star.” LS 33 Coco &amp; Clair Clair – Girl From Charli xcx to Sabrina Carpenter and this Atlanta duo, cool-girl intimidation was one of 2024’s abiding musical moods. “Gotta have competition to make a diss track, ho,” Coco &amp; Clair Clair taunted on Aggy, their savage pen countered by deceptively sweet, low-slung synth-pop and nursery-rhyme-catchy choruses. You might argue that they really do seem to fear the competition from the amount of barbs that litter basically every song on their second album, but the oozy, glistening trap, nihilistic electro house and sing-songy vocals are just aloof enough to support the pose. Plus, they’re funny. “Pandemic and recession,” they sing on Bitches Pt 2. “But the dumb bitch economy is booming.” LS 32 Bill Ryder-Jones – Iechyd Da There’s a gorgeous and affecting juxtaposition throughout the ex-Coral man’s most ambitious solo album yet. The backings are sumptuous, with strings, pianos, twinkling percussion and even a children’s choir on more than one occasion – but Ryder-Jones’s voice is broken down, dejected, desiccated. He trudges through these songs like a man unable to lift his gaze from the cracked paving stones – and yet the idealism and ready beauty of his backings are like the sun on his face, encouraging him to look up. BBT 31 Cassandra Jenkins – My Light, My Destroyer “Oh, one look is all it takes,” Cassandra Jenkins sings on Omakase, one of many songs on her third album about living and dying by someone else’s gaze (or even, as on Petco, seeking solace in the eyes of a lizard). Although My Light … has more melodic heft (and tentative rockers) than her last album, An Overview on Phenomenal Nature, it still trembles with that kind of heart-in-mouth immediacy, with Jenkins the ever-alert antenna for interventions both divine and domestic. LS 30-11 *** 30 Nala Sinephro – Endlessness The cosmically spiritual music of Pharoah Sanders, Alice Coltrane and others has been a central touchstone for London’s resurgent jazz scene in the last decade, but none of its members has ventured quite so far out of the solar system as Nala Sinephro. Her 2021 debut album Space 1.8 was a classic and she matched it with another: Endlessness seemed to drift off into heaven itself, landing in a vale of loveliness, the air filled with strings, gentle saxophone and her signature burbling electronics. It’s so difficult to make purely beautiful music not seem hellishly sentimental or twee, but Sinephro’s arrangements, with space for improvisation, are alert and vital. BBT 29 Kneecap – Fine Art Having already baited unionists with a song called Get Your Brits Out and a tour called Farewell to the Union – prompting Kemi Badenoch to cancel a £30,000 UK government-funded grant, a decision that was later found to be illegal – the Belfast rap trio had seemingly even fewer damns to give this year, advocating for Palestine much more loudly than most musicians, releasing an energetic self-titled biopic, and putting out a thrilling new album that massively evolved the tinny hip-hop of their debut. Produced by Toddla T and suffused with taunts, boasts, “rhino ket” and the very occasional dab of self-reflection, these rave tracks are perfect for hanging out of a hot hatch as the trio handbrake-turn from Irish into English and back again. BBT 28 Tyla – Tyla Tying together ultralight Afropop, US neo-soul and R&amp;B, and the phosphorescent bass blooms of amapiano from her native South Africa, the production on Tyla’s debut album was expertly arranged and profoundly danceable. But the songwriting was even better – you expect even elite pop albums to have a couple of bits of padding, but every track here had a top line to cherish. Her serpentine high pitch on Jump, writhing with desire; her darting staccato on Art, softening into longer notes; her melancholy chatter on No 1, full of determination and resolve – this is pop performance at its most sensual, versatile and meaningful. BBT 27 Claire Rousay – Sentiment The Canadian-American composer Claire Rousay made her name on gorgeously mundane field recordings, making her switch to Auto-Tuned slowcore pop on Sentiment seem surprising at first. Not just intimate but insular, it creeps through her self-loathing, depression and feelings of self-abasement, her lethargic melodies forging slow earworms: “Spending half of my whole life giving you head / Just in case you need to forgive me,” she sings, numbed, on Head. The cover depicts her hiding in bed, surrounded by empty cans and her guitar: perhaps Sentiment, suggesting an ecology of lo-fi bedroom pop, isn’t so different from her earlier work after all. LS 26 Kacey Musgraves – Deeper Well After her mostly underwhelming foray towards pop for 2021’s Star-Crossed, forged in the chaos of divorce, Musgraves found more stability in her life and headed back to the “spacey Kacey” cosmic country sound she found so much success with on 2018 breakthrough Golden Hour. The lyrics are full of trees, birds, fireflies and moonlight, all fecund with life as new love takes root, and it has her wondering about how it all came to be (The Architect) and whether wealth and success are pointless: “I’d burn it all to keep you warm,” she decides on Lonely Millionaire. BBT 25 Laura Marling – Patterns in Repeat Her previous album was Songs for Our Daughter, written for an imaginary child – and the follow-up ended up being about the real thing. It’s testament to Marling’s skill (which seems to deepen with every release) that even the most strenuously unsentimental listener will be moved by the way she writes about her newborn daughter. Although bathed in the bewildering glow of new life – there’s even a bedtime lullaby, called Lullaby – there’s also a fierceness in Marling’s promises of protection, and in how she asserts the importance of being present for one’s child. BBT 24 Ariana Grande – Eternal Sunshine In the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, two young lovers sought the services of a dodgy psychiatry company to delete the other from their minds post-breakup – then attempted to outrun the memory erasers when they realised they were still in love. Refining her R&amp;B luxe sound, Ariana Grande’s seventh album dwells in forgetting, both in how embracing new love requires the optimism that everything might work out this time, and in how quickly elements of the public turned against her when she split from her husband to date her recently separated Wicked co-star. “I’ll play whatever part you need me to and I’ll be good in it too,” she taunts on True Story, but the beauty of Grande’s own Eternal Sunshine lies in its complex, self-scouring songs about living with the reality of the heart. LS 23 Rachel Chinouriri – What a Devastating Turn of Events There’s a generation of Black British female singer-songwriters shrugging at the limitations made for them: Tiana Major9, Pip Millett, Cat Burns, Poppy Ajudha, Cleo Sol and more could never be neatly tagged “R&amp;B” or “soul”, even if people still often try. Rachel Chinouriri was also frequently miscategorised, but her debut album is a reminder of how boring – and permeable – genre boundaries are, from strutting new wave to squalling alt-rock and shuffling funk-pop to shivering acoustic ballads. But what really lights up this album is her strength of feeling as she takes people (occasionally including herself) to task for not being the best version of themselves. It’s intensely relatable and righteous – no wonder Sabrina Carpenter has invited her on tour next year. BBT 22 Kali Uchis – Orquídeas A three-year stint at Rada couldn’t get you even close to achieving the inimitable vocal delivery of Colombian-American singer Kali Uchis, whose blend of withering disdain, eyelash-batting seduction and awed wonder – sometimes all at once – is something to behold. Unlike its superb predecessor, Red Moon in Venus, the majority of Orquídeas is Spanish-language, but like a melodrama with the subtitles off, anglophone listeners can still intuit so much feeling and meaning from Uchis’s actorly performances as she builds from late-evening R&amp;B to night-out Latin dance. BBT 21 Pet Shop Boys – Nonetheless After their banging Stuart Price trilogy of albums, Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe returned to swooning, songwriterly mode on Nonetheless. Pet Shop Boys’ finest album of the 21st century opens with Loneliness, a warning against succumbing to isolation. If its authoritative electropop doesn’t stir you from solitude, then their 15th album’s tales of queer dreamers, artists and lovers who went against the odds and thrived – Russian dancer in exile, Nureyev, on Dancing Star; Oscar Wilde watching boys on the promenade on Love Is the Law; the young Tennant himself as the freshly minted New London Boy – should make clear why big leaps are always worth taking. LS *** 20 Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds – Wild God Anyone who has experienced grief will tell you that life in its wake doesn’t steadily improve on a straight, proportional axis; it’s all switchback turns on a bumpy emotional journey. And so it has played out with Nick Cave’s music since the death of his teenage son in 2015. Often harrowed and angry yet still with bursts of beauty and hope, the biggest burst yet came with Wild God, a maximalist celebration of the might of existence itself. The Bad Seeds manage to mingle real heft with a still-rickety quality, like a symphony orchestra and pub band combined, while Cave, finding joy even in a frog in a gutter, is inspiringly resolute in his lust for life. BBT 19 Arooj Aftab – Night Reign Mingling 18th-century Urdu poets and Rumi, words by a friend and jazz standards, Arooj Aftab’s fourth album casts a spell that brings these disparate traditions into a singular, spectral whole. Sometimes, as with the close vocals and weighty piano of Na Gul, it’s incredibly spacious; others, like the fiercely intricate plucked strings of Last Night Reprise, close and frantic. Both modes are entirely gripping. The beauty of the playing and arrangements is often otherworldly: the harp on the mournful Raat Ki Rani billows expansively against the song’s bodily heft. For all the striking, idiosyncratic arrangements elsewhere, the straightforward conversational intimacy of Whiskey plucks at the most core heartstrings. LS 18 Waxahatchee – Tigers Blood After Katie Crutchfield leaned into her country roots on 2020’s Saint Cloud, Tigers Blood deepened her grasp on the genre, sounding as classic as Gillian Welch and David Rawlings one minute (Right Back to It, featuring the year’s breakout indie star MJ Lenderman), and delving into unpretentious southern rock the next (friend breakup anthem Bored). The comfort and ease in her songwriting set solid foundations for her voracious mind to wander, plotting the ever-changing distance between herself and others with tenderness and cryptic confidence – “There’s a lock on the door that costs more than my car, babe,” she warns on The Wolves – not to mention a voice that penetrates like a beam of light. Her second classic album in a row, Tigers Blood suggests an great catalogue forming before our eyes. LS 17 Fabiana Palladino – Fabiana Palladino Fabiana Palladino cuts a surprisingly understated figure given the stature of her debut album, which she wrote and produced – and which revamps some of the most dramatic sounds of 80s pop. The spirits of Prince, Janet Jackson, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis echo through these songs, with their luxuriant, off-kilter arrangements, skin-prickling vocals and febrile, bone-dry funk. Yet it transcends pastiche, both on the quality of the songwriting and often-minimal arrangements that speak to rather more straitened times than the opulent era of Palladino’s influences. Next up, catch her collaborating on Lorde’s fourth album. LS 16 Mk.gee – Two Star &amp; the Dream Police Whenever you think the electric guitar must have lost its potential to express something genuinely new after so many decades, someone like Mk.gee comes along. The young American parlays conservatoire-level technique into the most casual of playing, with a tone that’s half Delta blues, half Every Breath You Take. It would be simply the stuff of online guitar-nerd forums were it not for his astounding songs. They’re like transmissions from a phantom late-night AM radio station in the 1980s, beaming out peppy pop for giggly sleepovers (DNM, Candy) and yearning ballads for wistful truck drivers (Dream Police, I Want). BBT 15 Nia Archives – Silence Is Loud As the huge resurgent success of Chase and Status this year has shown, British youth will always be receptive to drum’n’bass that you can fire gunfingers and sling Dark Fruits to. So it would have been easy for the young British producer Nia Archives to do an album of straight bangers, like her enduring Brazilian-tinged 2022 hit Baianá. Instead, she created a much more exciting hybrid of vibey junglism and thoughtful, vulnerable singer-songwriting. The high-tempo, high-stimulus breakbeats on tracks such as So Tell Me and Crowded Roomz seem to bear down on Nia as she tries to get perspective on her life. BBT 14 Still House Plants – If I Don’t Make It, I Love U “It’s hard to know about anything,” Jessica Hickie-Kallenbach sings on Pant, from the London post-punk trio’s third album, “but feeling is good by me.” And Still House Plants layer feeling like a painter builds up impasto, with thick jabs of dissonant guitar that evoke Bill Orcutt’s splayed angles, discrete pockets of percussion that don’t adhere to traditional rhythmic structure, Hickie-Kallenbach repeating phrases and sounds as if summoning the strength to push at a locked door. This would all be so much avant garde noise if the effect weren’t weirdly emotional, making the familiar strange – the glowering guitar of 3scr3w3 has no attack, and seems to ooze like silt and mud at the bottom of a river – and betraying a profound effort to communicate and break through. LS 13 MJ Lenderman – Manning Fireworks The protagonists of Jake Lenderman’s fourth studio album are on their knees, puking in their cereal, turning loneliness into a fetish; so desperate for connection that they’re knocking on glass at the aquarium to get the sharks to pay them some attention. They’re losers, no doubt about it, but the precision of Lenderman’s portraits – “I could really use your two cents, babe / I could really use the change” – speaks to a real kind of affection, as do the crunchy little bar-rock hymns he writes them. LS 12 Mabe Fratti – Sentir Que No Sabes The title of Mabe Fratti’s third album in eight months means “feel like you don’t know”, and the Guatemalan cellist and her small ensemble venture into strikingly novel territory here. Moving away from the abstractions of her previous records, these are strange, stately songs led by prowling cello, starbursts of brass and otherworldly distortion and effects that recall her sometime collaborator Oneohtrix Point Never. Songs such as Kravitz, Elastica II and Descubrimos un Suspiro centre bassy grooves as self-possessed and suggestive as those of Mingus’s Solo Dancer; the space in Pantalla Azul and Quieras o No seem to open up vast new vistas. Fratti’s piercingly clear voice cuts through it all like wax through watercolour. True to its title, Sentir Que No Sabes is an album that keeps yielding new revelations – a sense amplified by its surprisingly metal and totally astonishing live incarnation. LS 11 The Cure – Songs of a Lost World Moving at the pace of a pallbearer carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders, the Cure’s return is full of sombre finality: for love affairs, for loved ones, for a planet gone asunder, and also, perhaps, for this band’s long career. Robert Smith faces death not with his chest out, but caved in with sadness and disappointment; any accrued wisdom seems stupid or unimportant. Warsong is about a couple given to feuding but its declaration “for we are born to war” can’t help but be about retributive violence on a global scale. Romance falls short (“The way love turned out every time was never quite enough”) and even art can’t provide solace: “Left alone with nothing at the end of every song” is the album’s final line. But the deep, steady grooves suggest tenacity: humanity gritting its teeth as we trudge towards a scorched future. BBT 10-1 *** 10 Kim Gordon – The Collective The free-associative nature of the lyrics on Kim Gordon’s second solo album – sports cars, sex, bowling trophies, “$20 potatoes”, each recounted in her charred, vengeful mutter – take on a dissociative affect, like waking up from a bad dream into a worse one and wondering what happened. Produced by Justin Raisen, the industrial, blown-out churn of The Collective is an intentionally abrasive strike against society sleepwalking its way into a convenience culture touted by self-styled disruptors, and a reminder that real disruption only comes from the margins: at 71, Kim Gordon stands at a frontier, agitating against the future with her massive, singular perspective. LS 9 Sabrina Carpenter – Short n’ Sweet The first time most adults heard of Sabrina Carpenter was in the fallout from Olivia Rodrigo’s 2021 breakout hit Drivers License, which appeared to cast her fellow Disney star as the other woman. While Carpenter’s 2022 album Emails I Can’t Send toyed with perceptions that she was a “homewrecker … a slut”, her sixth record leaned all the way in, Carpenter adopting a bawdy bombshell persona that revelled in the idea of her as a threat. “Yeah I know I’ve been known to share!” she laughs on Taste (which spent nine weeks as UK No 1), one of Short n’ Sweet’s many comically, casually horny hits. It was a monstrously successful concept, rebooting the classic blond pop princess with a lacerating tongue and a withering attitude to men straight out of the Lana Del Rey playbook – and most winningly, a savage sense of humour that rightly earned Carpenter comparisons to Dolly Parton. Perhaps the embarrassing boyfriend of the amazingly weird country song Please Please Please should just … stay at home; “Come right on me – I mean camaraderie,” she winks on the falsetto-drenched Bed Chem. Rodrigo witheringly cast Carpenter as “another actress”, and on Short n’ Sweet, Carpenter convincingly played the role of Nashville warbler, disco revivalist, R&amp;B temptress, each mode tied together by her sharp pen. Espresso positioned Carpenter as the girl of your caffeine-addled dreams; her versatility and nimbleness with a heel turn and a wink made very clear that she can also be the girl of your nightmares, if you want her to be. LS 8 Tyler, the Creator – Chromakopia The sepia-tinged visuals for Tyler’s surprise eighth album made it look like a complete break from the globetrotting, pastel-hued luxe of 2021’s Call Me if You Get Lost. It turned out to share quite a bit of that album’s sound – the lush, swaggering G-funk and kaleidoscope of references – but stripped away at least some of its braggadocio to reveal the conflict beneath the fur hat: about commitment, parenthood, being doomed to repeat the sins of the father – and the shock reveal that maybe a figure he’d spent his whole life demonising wasn’t so bad after all. And if the sound was somewhat familiar, he made it newly disorienting, metal samples and lavish slow jams colliding into each other. Amid all the uncertainties, though, his supreme self-worth remained as magnetic and justified as ever, and whereas women were collateral in the Kendrick/Drake beef, here guests GloRilla, Sexyy Red and frequent interstitials from his own mother, Bonita Smith, spurred him to greatness. LS 7 Fontaines DC – Romance The Irish band’s ambition gets bigger with every release, and with this fourth album they were aiming at arenas. Perhaps there’s something a bit too difficult – too poetic, yet too chippy – about them to make them cross over to the good-times crowds you need at that level; Liam Gallagher certainly isn’t a fan. But if you don’t get it, it’s your loss: who else right now has a four-album run like this? Even a sad ballad preposterously called Horseness Is the Whatness, tucked away on the final third, has a chorus you can’t believe no one’s written before, while Favourite genuinely is an arena anthem – something that sounds better with every beer you drink, until you’re flinging an arm around a stranger’s shoulders. BBT 6 Nilüfer Yanya – My Method Actor The heartbroken protagonist of the British songwriter’s third album is hollow inside, bleeding out; soul awol, amnesia reigning. The beauty lies in how she makes this state of desolation feel as opulent as a ruined palace. The palette is febrile and close, as humid as the tropics or as Sade’s sultriest moments; Yanya’s sidling, furtive guitar suddenly obliterated by pockets of thrashing rage, her usually poised voice betraying every wound inflicted on her. It’s one of the best-arranged albums of the year: judiciously applied strings up the sense of suspicion and devastation, and the tension and transitions trap you right up there with her on the knife’s edge. “I’m hardly here either,” Yanya sang on crushed standout Binding, but the 29-year-old’s utterly unique voice has never had more presence. LS 5 Beyoncé – Cowboy Carter Cowboy Carter was Beyoncé’s attempt to stake a claim for the Black history of country music, but it was no straightforward Nashville record. Instead, in keeping with the sprawling ambition of the auteurist albums she has been releasing for the past decade, it wrapped its arms around the entire American music vernacular. She wasn’t afraid to tackle country’s iconic moments, notably recasting Dolly Parton’s Jolene as a steely eyed warning shot, but it was her attempts to shape country in her own image and foreground its Black origins that felt especially fresh and thrilling: Parton and Willie Nelson made lighthearted cameos; more significantly, greater deference was afforded to Black country musicians. “They don’t know how hard I had to fight for this / When I sang my song,” she sings on Ameriican Requiem, about being snubbed by the country music industry in the past. The depth of knowledge and the conviction of performance on Cowboy Carter are a clear testament not just to Beyoncé’s fight, but her intimacy with the genre. Read more. Annie Zaleski 4 Clairo – Charm Charm dwells in a world of attraction and desire. Giddy songs such as Second Nature, with its heartbeat pulse of piano and Claire Cottrill’s nervous laughter, exist in the magnetic forcefield between two people inexplicably drawn together. But with Clairo’s typical incisiveness, her third – and best by far – album is also about what happens when the spell wears off, and when closeness becomes cloying. Co-produced with soul revivalist and bandleader Leon Michels, Charm’s world is fleshed out by vintage Wurlitzers, flurries of brass and breathy woodwind recorded straight to tape. It’s far from the lo-fi intimacy of her breakthrough work – the kind of intimacy that is forced, rather than given. Read more. Katie Hawthorne 3 Billie Eilish – Hit Me Hard and Soft Culpability in a breakup and – as with the paradox in the album title – the impossibility of identifying the villain in a complex situation are the murky themes of Eilish’s third album: sometimes anguished, sometimes vindictive, always satisfyingly messy and candid. Rather than reflect generational angst (as her debut did) or the hell of teenage fame, Hit Me Hard and Soft is insular and intimate, right down to the fantastically prosaic lyric in Lunch – about her newfound desire to intimately acquaint herself with the fairer sex – where she’s “pullin’ up a chair” and “puttin’ up my hair” as she prepares to get stuck in. Lunch is an apt title: desire nourishes and depletes across these 10 songs, and by ragged epic The Greatest (as raw as any Sharon Van Etten rager), Eilish wails in frustration about “All the times I waited / For you to want me naked”, recriminating herself and her estranged lover from breath to breath.

When it was released in March, the only way to hear it (aside from a YouTube video) was to go to a GeoCities website – a relic from the 90s internet, complete with multicoloured Times New Roman lettering – and download the audio files via Mega, the filesharing service beloved of 00s music blogs. The music itself went even further back, and indeed sideways, into a parallel dimension of 20th-century pop: doo-wop, glam, folk-rock, Nuggets-y psych/garage, Velvet Underground-style art-rock, French chanson, classic soul, 60s girl-group pop, synthwave, rockabilly and ambient all feature, emerging through lo-fi production as if corrupted on its journey from this spirit realm. Read more. BBT 1 Charli xcx – Brat (and Brat and It’s Completely Different But Also Still Brat) Brat came wrapped in a blunt, lowercase rendering of the album’s title against a sickly lime green: intended as a snub to the “misogynistic and boring” assumption that a female artist should automatically appear on her own album cover. It turned out to be a masterstroke of branding far more pervasive than any glossy photo, even influencing the US presidential race. Its sound was brash and aggressive, early 00s London club music – electroclash, acid-y bloghouse, dubstep, maximalist rave synths – shot through a chattering, trebly hyperpop filter; “Club classic but I still pop,” as Von Dutch put it. Oozing self-possession and confidence, Brat seemed to swagger even as Charli confessed to insecurity or inadequacy, a cocktail of emotions that seemed to be at the album’s centre. Read more.

          "headline": "Not too late to get seasonal vaccines in US, experts say",
          "bodyText": "Perhaps you procrastinated – that Halloween costume wouldn’t make itself and neither would the Thanksgiving turkey – and now you’ve realized, just as you’re about to gather with your friends and family again, that you’ve neglected your seasonal vaccines. Public health authorities recommend people get annual vaccines for influenza and Covid-19 in the early fall – around September and October. But infectious disease experts say even if you didn’t get shots then, it can make a difference today. “It’s not too late,” said Dr Sean T Liu, an infectious disease expert at Mount Sinai hospital in New York City. “The recommendation is still to get one if you haven’t gotten one.” Vaccines for influenza and Covid-19 are distinct but related. Public health authorities recommend that most people six months and older get them in the early fall. They are safe to receive at the same time, and especially important for the elderly or people who have never been vaccinated, the immunocompromised, and people living with chronic conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. With only about 20% of the adult population under 65 years old vaccinated against Covid-19 and about 38% vaccinated against flu, according to government authorities, Liu said it is even more important for people to go get vaccinated. “Vaccines are kind of like your community work in a sense – it’s to help the community and protect those people that may be not as healthy or get really harmed from illness,” said Liu. “Your job is to not be one of those carriers.” Each year, experts recommend people get shots in the early fall to have good protection during the flu season peak – generally around December. However, there’s variability in the exact peak each year, which is part of the reason a flu shot can still be a good idea. In 2023, the flu season peaked in late December with cases elevated until May. By comparison, in 2018 the flu season did not peak until about mid-February, but was in steep decline by April. That timing explains why the shots can still protect you from the worst of the season, generally in January and February, even if you get them later in the year. In the 2023-24 season, an estimated 40 million people got sick with the flu, sending 18 million to the doctor and another 470,000 to the hospital. An estimated 28,000 died. In the same season, more than 916,300 people were hospitalized because of Covid-19 and 75,500 died. “Our top recommendation for protecting yourself and your loved ones from respiratory illness is to get vaccinated,” said Dr Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This year the flu vaccine is trivalent – or will protect you against three strains of flu. The current Covid-19 vaccine is expected to protect people against a few variants now circulating. You won’t get maximum protection against influenza and Covid-19 immediately – it takes about two weeks for the immune system to respond to each vaccine. It is safe to get the shot together, according to the CDC. In fact, drug companies are now studying whether the shots can be combined. There are side effects, which are usually mild but unpleasant. For the flu shot, common effects include soreness around the injection site, headache, fever, muscle aches, nausea and fatigue. There is also the potential for rare but serious side effects, including Guillain-Barré syndrome, which includes tingling, numbness and paralysis. The chances of suffering from Guillain-Barré are “remote,” according to the CDC, and which studies have placed at a rate of about 1-2 cases per million. The Covid-19 vaccine has similar common, mild and unpleasant side effects, including muscle soreness, headache and chills. Although rare, there is also the possibility of severe allergic reaction and heart inflammation called myocarditis. Heart complications are more likely after a Covid infection than from the vaccine, CDC studies have found. People who have been recently infected with Covid may choose to delay the vaccine for three months after the onset of symptoms of a positive test with no symptoms, the CDC said. “Even if you are not at high risk” for severe disease, “you really want to protect the people who might be high risk for that,” said Liu. “The point about vaccines – the purpose of a vaccine – is to protect a population of people.”"

          "bodyText": "Sigourney Weaver, the latest in the line of high status screen stars to be wooed to the stage by director Jamie Lloyd, may for ever be known as Ellen Ripley to fans of her defining science fiction role on film. She is certainly in alien territory here, and plays Prospero with the steely-voiced conviction of a commander giving urgent instruction to an interstellar space crew at imminent risk of attack. She is making her West End debut in this late Shakespearean drama as its gender-reversed central sorcerer and usurped Duchess of Milan, and the remote isle of sounds and sweet airs which she sequesters appears to be floating in deep space. The dark hills and rubble on Soutra Gilmour’s set look lunar, the booms and bursts in the black background sound like explosions of interplanetary matter (the sound design and compositions are by Ben and Max Ringham) and the lights (designed by Jon Clark) look like the blazing beams of UFOs. Weaver is not a masterful Prospero: her verse delivery is flat and featureless, which leaves a vacuum in this key role. But nuanced verse is spoken by Selina Cadell, who plays Prospero’s trusty councillor Gonzalo, and Jude Akuwudike as the King of Naples. Both show Weaver’s woodenness up by contrast. But the pay-off for Weaver’s (stunt?) casting is that her science-fiction back catalogue inspires the bigger concept of Lloyd’s production, with dazzling results. You might call it a space opera, for all its music and song. Or sci-fi Shakespeare, for its mix of poetry and next-level theatrical showmanship. The swirling black emptiness around the set looks fathomless, blasts of light bring tremendous visual drama, and sheer silken sheets spanning the length of the stage are used in simple but sensational ways. The production creates its own dark magic with large-scale grandeur. The cast often stand in what seems like self-conscious “Beam me up, Scotty” lineups, and wear costumes combining 1970s space designs with 1990s high school musicals. The central love story with Prospero’s daughter Miranda (Mara Huf) and Ferdinand (James Phoon) seems like a high school musical romance too – light relief against all the brooding. Its detractors may call it an intergalactic failure, or make comparisons with Kenneth Branagh’s feverish King Lear from last year, which also had a planetary backdrop. This is not feverish in the least but it is outre, employing camp as a serious aesthetic choice. Caliban (Forbes Masson), for instance, is dressed in a gimpy black corset and pants, and looks like a cross between Big Daddy and Divine, but plays his role for pathos rather than laughs. Then there is the high-wire Ariel (Mason Alexander Park, the star of the show) an alarming, alluring spirit who descends from the rafters on a harness looking gender-indeterminate and speaking through a voice distortion machine. Music is key in the production, which feels apt on an island that magically hums with “a thousand twangling instruments”. The play’s snatched songs are put to music, and Alexander Park brings the most lustrous vocals. Lloyd does not eke out any deeper meanings from the text, but does present Prospero’s magical world with a stylised quality that carries touches of Peter Brook’s performance theatre and the avant-gardism of Lindsay Kemp. Characters move in gestural ways, at a stately pace, retreating to the back of the set to stand in heroic silhouette when they are not part of the action. Trinculo (Mathew Horne) and Stephano (Jason Barnett), who feature in the subplot of comical insurgency, behave like avant garde clowns too. Some of the ritualistic circling is overdone at the end, but still it has the feel of Greek theatre in outer space. It’s all thoroughly odd, but in an audacious and enlivening way. So, come for Sigourney Weaver and stay for the weird magic. • Until 1 February"

          "bodyText": "Keir Starmer has told the Commons liaison committee that he cannot think of anything he would have done differently in his first months as PM. (See 4.55pm.) Hospices in England are to receive a £100m-plus boost to funding amid worries that some end-of-life services could close because of the impact of the national insurance increase and wage rises. Enormous budget overruns on the HS2 high-speed railway have been blamed by its new chief executive on a “rush to start”, as the Department for Transport admitted it did not know how much it would cost. Keir Starmer has given his full support to Tulip Siddiq, the Treasury minister, after Bangladesh’s anti-corruption commission accused her and family members of embezzling billions as part of a deal for a nuclear power plant. Writers, publishers, musicians, photographers, movie producers and newspapers have rejected the Labour government’s plan to create a copyright exemption to help artificial intelligence companies train their algorithms. The Bank of England has kept interest rates on hold as it warned UK growth is on the brink of stagnation amid the fallout from Rachel Reeves’s budget and threat of Donald Trump reigniting global trade wars. The UK will not tolerate attempts by foreign countries to harass or intimidate British citizens, Dan Jarvis, the security minister, has warned, after a number of Sikhs complained they were being targeted either by or on behalf of the Indian government. Tom Bradshaw, president of the National Farmers Union, says Keir Starmer’s comments at the liaison committee about the extension of inheritance tax to cover farms (see 3.16pm) show the government did not think about the impact of this measures. In a statement, Bradshaw says: Despite ministers previously claiming this was about punishing wealthy people avoiding tax, it’s clear from the prime minister’s words today that it is simply an indiscriminate revenue-raising measure with no thought given to who it impacts. What’s worse is that the government has clearly forgotten the reason agricultural inheritance tax reliefs were brought in in the first place – which was to ensure that farms would not be sold or broken up following the death of the owner and could continue to produce high quality British food through each generation. It’s clear that this government has entirely broken with that premise, and it will be farming, then its associated industries, and then consumers who will bear the impact. Here is some video of Keir Starmer at the liaison committee. Labour has kept control of Edinburgh city council, despite being the third largest group, after maintaining its deal with other unionist groups to lock out the Scottish National party. Councillors voted in Jane Meagher today after former leader Cammy Day quit suddenly, on 9 December, after the police confirmed they were investigating allegations he had sent sexualised texts to Ukrainian women refugees. The Scottish National party, which is the city’s largest party, lost an attempt with the Scottish Greens to take control by 32 votes to 28. Labour has only 10 councillors; the SNP has 17. Meagher, latterly Labour housing convenor, appeared by video link from Tanzania, where she is on a family holiday. In a statement released by the council, she said: This has been an extremely difficult and damaging time for the Council. Today was an opportunity to restore stability and to get on with the business of running the city. As we count down to 2025 – and to the challenging budget and other decisions that await us in the new year – we need stability, confidence and consensus. As the then Labour group leader, in May 2022 Day had brokered a controversial agreement after the council elections with the Tories and Lib Dems to form a minority administration in Edinburgh which stopped short of a formal coalition. The deal was not sanctioned by Scottish Labour headquarters; Anas Sarwar, the Scottish Labour leader, had pledged there would be no coalitions with the Tories in any council. The Tories were, however, given the convenorship of two statutory committees by Day. Here are two alternatives takes on the liaison committee hearing from journalists. From Jonathan Eley at the Financial Times Bit of time spare before an internal meeting, so watched Starmer at the Joint Liason Committee The contrast between the rational, detailed and informed Q&amp;A of this forum and the idiotic performative braying of PMQs could not be greater It’s how political scrutiny should be From Jason Groves at the Daily Mail Not saying the Commons liaison committee is an easy ride for Keir Starmer, but Labour’s Tan Dhesi has just prefaced his question to the PM by saying: ‘Thank you for your service to this nation...’ In his final answer to Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the liasion committee, Keir Starmer claimed that he could not think of anything he should have done differently in his first months as PM. Hillier asked him about lessons he had learned since he had become PM, and if he would have done anything differently. Starmer devoted his answer to criticising the inheritance he was left. (See 4.19pm.) Hillier then asked again: Is there anything that you would do differently if you were starting out now, knowing what you know? And Starmer replied: No. We had to do tough stuff. We are getting on with it. I’m very pleased to be delivering, and delivering from a position of power, rather than going around the division lobbies losing every night. I’ve had too much of that. This answer has generated some surprise from commentators. This is from Robert Peston, ITV’s political editor, on social media. Keir Starmer tells the liaison committee of the Commons there is literally nothing he would have done differently as PM now that he has the benefit of hindsight. Hey ho And this is from James Ball, political editor of the New European. There is something quite telling that when Keir Starmer was asked if he had any advice for himself from six months ago all he could do was stammer through an answer about inheriting a £22 billion black hole from the last government, before saying he’d do nothing differently. Perhaps Starmer really does think there is not a single thing he could have done better. But it is more likely he just decided to say no to avoid the inevitable negative headlines that a more honest answer might have attracted. Hillier ends the session by asking if there is anything Starmer would have done differently in his first five months in office. Starmer says it is far better being in government than being in opposition. He came into politics to change things, he says. He says he expected the inheritance to be “pretty awful”, but it turned out to be “worse than I thought, in every respect”, he says. As an example, he cites prison overcrowding. During the summer riots, at a Cobra meeting, he had the prison place numbers in every jail in the country on a screen in the room because they were at “bursting point” and needed to know if they could accommodate people. He does not get round to saying whether or not there is anything he would have done differently. Hillier asks again if there is anything he would have done differently. No, says Starmer. He says he has had to do tough stuff, but he is very pleased to be delivering. And that is the end of the hearing. Meg Hillier, the liaison committee chair, is now wrapping up with some final questions of her own. Q: Are you talking to the Migration Advisory Committee about ensuring that the UK has enough skilled workers for the government’s housing ambitions? Yes, says Starmer. He says there has been too much policy making in silos. Q: Are you willing to say the country needs more skilled workers? Starmer says the UK will always need skilled workers. Q: So you would give the green light to more skilled workers coming in? Starmer says he wants a joined-up approach. He says the UK has had very high immigration because it has not trained up enough people with skills. So it will do that. but in the mean time it will not “chop the legs off our businesses” by refusing them access to foreign workers. Karen Bradley, the Tory home affairs committee chair, is asking about asylum seekers. Starmer says “safe and legal routes” for asylum seekers are needed. But the goverment should also be taking action “upstream” to tackle the problem. Q: Do you want to open more “safe and legal routes”? No, says Starmer. He says he is happy with the schemes in place for people from Afghanistan, Ukraine and Hong Kong. Tan Dhesi, the Labour chair of the defence committee, goes next. Q: On defence and security, what keeps you awake at night? Starmer says he is not kept awake at night. He says he has great faith in the military. Q: The new head of Nato has said we need to move to a wartime mindset. He says, if we are not at war, we are not at peace either. Do you agree? Starmer says we are in a more volatile world. Conflict is escalating, he says. Q: When will defence spending rise to 2.5% of GDP? Starmer says the government will set out a path to that. The defence review is reporting next year. Dhesi says it is not the time to prevaricate. He says the govenment has made several other big defence spending announcements, without waiting for the defence review to conclude. So why can’t this be addressed now? Starmer says the review is look at the risks the UK faces, what the current capability is, and whether changes are needed to address the gap. He says that is why is does not want to commit money until he has the results of that. Dhesi says the UK’s enemies are not waiting. He says deterring a war is cheaper than fighting one. So why is the UK “prevaricating”? Starmer says defence spending is at 2.3% of GDP now. And some costs, like the nuclear deterrent, are fixed, he says. Thornberry say the Israeli government is not in favour of a two-state solution. And some members of the Israeli cabinet talk about annexing the West Bank. If that happened, what could we do? Starmer says he is very worried about the situation on the West Bank. He says any response should be anchored in international law. Emily Thornberry, Labour chair of the foreign affairs committee, goes next. Q: Who are the major players in Syria? Starmer says it is fast moving situation. He says the fall of president Assad was a good thing. He goes on: But we mustn’t make the mistake of thinking that what comes next is necessarily going to be better. Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative chair of the public administration committee, asks about using technology to improve public sector productivity. Starmer says he agrees using technology can make a big difference. When he took charge of the Crown Prosecution Service, all the files were on paper, he says. He digitised it. Clfifton-Brown turns to procurement. He says today’s committee hearing on HS2 was “woeful”. Starmer agrees. He says HS2 has been a “case study of … how to mishandle a major project”. Helen Hayes, the Labour chair of the education committee, asks about support for children with special educational needs and disabilities (Send). Starmer says he has been asked about this more than anything else at PMQs. He says the government inherited a Send scheme in crisis. More money for Send has been allocated in the budget, he says. But he goes on: We’ve got to reform. We’ve got to have a much earlier intervention system in place … My own strong belief is that, even with the extra funding, which is desperately needed, if we don’t change the way special education is provided, that will be never be able to plug the gap and fix the problem that you’ve described. So yes, more money in the budget, but also early intervention and making sure that provision is [available] in mainstream schools. Abrahams asks about pensioners who do not qualify for pension credit. What extra help might they get to help them through winter. Starmer says other support for low-income household is available, from local authorities. Debbie Abrahams, the Labour chair of the work and pensions committee, gets her turn, and she is asking about help for the disabled. Starmer says the government should do everything it can to help disabled people into work. Abrahams says some disabled people cannot work. Some of them face extra costs of up to £1,000 a month. She says they must be protected. Starmer agrees. Carmichael says the government’s claim that only 500 farms would be affected is not robust. Will the chancellor hold a meeting with the National Farmers Union to discuss this? Starmer says the chancellor can manage her own diary. Carmichael says one witness to his committee broke down talking about this. A lot of people don’t find this funny. Starmer says he accepts people are not comfortable with this. He says he has met the NFU to meet their concerns. Alistair Carmichael, the Lib Dem chair of the environment committee, goes next. Q: When you decided to extend inheritance tax, were you targeting the super-rich, or family farmers? Starmer says the government needed to raise revenue. He says it was not targeting a specific group. Q: Does that mean you have dropped the idea that family farms should be protected? Starmer does not accept that. He says farms still get protection from inheritance tax that others don’t. Q: So the super-rich will still be able to shelter their money in farms. Starmer says he was not going after a particular group. Q: So you are comfortable with the super-rich using this to shelter their money. Starmer says the government was trying to get the balance right. What the very wealthy do with their money within the rules is a matter for them. Starmer says for far too long projects have been held up by issues such as newts and bats. He says he does not want to downgrade the importance of nature. But “I do think we can look at it differently”, he says. Q: Why are we not getting developments on brownfield now? Starmer says the targets were taken down by the last government. And developers buy land and then refuse to build. Q: Are you doing something about that? Yes, Starmer says. He says if developers don’t build, the government will step in. Toby Perkins, the Labour chair of the environmental audit committee, says Starmer has said he will back the builders, not the blockers. Who are the blockers? Starmer says it is people who have opposed targets, or opposed houses being built. Perkins asked him to be more specific. Starmer recalls visiting an estate near York where it took 20 years for home to be built. He says a company boss told him it would take 13 years to build an onshore windfarm, because planning would take five years, and connecting to the grid would take six years. The actual building would only take two years, he recalls being told. Florence Eshalomi, the Labour chair of the housing committee, is now asking about housing. Starmer says it will be difficult to hit the target of building 1.5m new homes over the course of this parliament. But he says he thinks the government can do it. Liam Byrne comes in again. Q: What are you going to do to stop President Trump imposing tariffs on the UK? Starmer says he is no fan of tariffs. He says he wants to improve trade with the US. But he won’t say whether he has discusse this with Trump. Q: If you do a deal with the EU to improve trade covering SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) regulations, that will make doing a trade deal with the US very difficult. How will you resolve this? Starmer says he does not accept that. I think we can pursue both. I don’t accept the argument you have got to either be with the US or be with the EU, that isn’t how it works at the moment with our current trade. We do want a closer relationship with the EU on security, on defence, on energy and, yes, on trade, and I’ve set out how we want to reset on a number of occasions. At the same time, I want to improve our trading relationship with the US. Is that going to be easy? Of course it’s not. Do I think we can make progress? Yes, I do. And that’s among the reasons that I’m making sure we’ve got a good relationship with the incoming president and that the relationship between our two countries is as strong in the future as it has been in the past. UPDATE: Starmer said: It won’t come as any surprise to you, I am not a fan of tariffs and, therefore, we have to make sure that we avoid tariffs. We have got very good trade with the US, as we have got very good trade with other countries around the world. I want to improve on that … Am I alive to the danger of tariffs? Yes of course. I’m against tariffs, but I’m not going to speculate as to what the incoming president might do. Caroline Dinenage, the Tory chair of the culture committee, goes next. She asks about copyright and AI, and why the government is giving AI an opt-out from copyright rules. Starmer says new proposals on this are out for consultation. He says the the government wants to benefit from the advantages of AI, while protecting the rights of creatives. He says he thinks they have got the balance right. But the government is going out to consultation to make sure. Dinenage says the government is planning to take away the copyright rights of creatives, while allowing them to opt back in to get copyright protection. She says that is like allowing a burlgar to “nick all your stuff”, unless you have a sign up saying that is not allowed. Starmer says he does not see it like that. Dineneage suggests that he is biased in favour of tech companies, at the expense of creative industries. Starmer does not accept that. He stresses his support for the creative sector. Byrne says having rising living standards over the course of the parliament, one of the goals in the Plan for Change, is not ambitious. It has been achieved in every parliament since the 1950s, he says. Starmer says he was disposable income to go up. But he also wants productivity to rise, and that is harder, he says. Byrne says firms have been hit by the impact of the national insurance increase, the rise in the national living wage and the employment rights bill. Was it a good idea to do all three at the same time? Starmer says the government had to do the difficult things first. Liam Byrne is asking the questions now. He says the manifesto goal to make UK sustained growth the highest in the G7 by the end of this parliament was not in the Plan for Change. Is that still a goal? Yes, says Starmer. Byrne says forecasters don’t think the UK will achieve this. The IMF thinks the US and Canada will have higher growth. Starmer says the forecasters are not taking into account the impact of the changes to planning and regulation that Labour is proposing. Starmer says the government is changing planning rules. And regulation too. The clear message to me is not only that there’s too much regulation in the United Kingdom, but it’s inconsistent, because our regulators are pulling in slightly different directions, and that’s why we’ve been writing to the regulators to ensure that we’ve got the priorities of the regulators in the right place. Q: When will people notice a difference? Starmer says the government has put up pay for public sector workers. And the rising in the living wage has given people a pay rise. Q: Why are you so confident about growth, when forecasters are less confident? Starmer says the forecasters are predicting growth. So things are going in the right direction. But he thinks his reforms to planning and regulation will make a “huge difference”. UPDATE: This is what Starmer said when asked how long it would take before people noticed their living standards going up. It will take some time, of course it will. One of the biggest mistakes, I think, in the last 14 years was the idea that everything could be fixed by Christmas. It can’t. The planning will take time. The change in regulation will take time, we’ve got a national wealth fund which is investing, getting record investment into the country, that will take time. But already some of the lowest paid are already feeling the benefits of a Labour government through what we did in the budget. The hearing has started. Meg Hillier, chair of the liaison committee and chair of the Treasury committee, starts by saying we have had a decade of no real growth. How are you going to turn that round? Keir Starmer says investors have not had stability. He is providing that. He says there will be plans to planning and regulation. And growth, across all parts of the country, and that is why there are local growth plans. The latest edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast is out. Here it is, with John Harris, Pippa Crerar and Kiran Stacey discussing the politics of 2024. Keir Starmer will be up at the liaison committee at 2.30pm. He does not know the questions he will be getting, but he does know who will be asking questions on what topics, because the committee has revealed this. The hearing will cover three themes. Growth and economy questions will come from Liam Byrne (Lab, business committee chair), Alistair Carmichael (Lib Dem, environment committee chair), Caroline Dinenage (Con, culture committee chair), Florence Eshalomi (Lab, housing committee chair) and Toby Perkins (Lab, environmental audit committee chair. Public services and Plan for Change questions will come from Debbie Abrahams (Lab, work and pensions committee chair), Geoffrey Clifton-Brown (Con, public accounts committee chair) and Helen Hayes (Lab, education committee chair). And global affairs and security questions will come from Karen Bradley (Con, home affairs committee chair), Tan Dhesi (Lab, defence committee chair) and Emily Thornberry (Lab, foreign affairs committee chair). The health miniser, Karin Smyth, refused to say whether the extra money for hospices announced this morning in the Commons would fully compensate them for the impact of the national insurance increase. (See 11.01am.) At the Downing Street lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson also declined to answer this question. Asked if hospices would have all their losses covered, he said he would not “draw a kind of parallel”. Back to HS2, and at the public accounts committee hearing this morning civil servants and executives from the firm declined to put a clear estimate on when high-speed trains would be running between Euston and Birmingham. The HS2 chief executive Mark Wild said: You would hope that in the 2030s you would have a functioning railway, but the truth is I do need to do the work. As PA Media reports, trains are expected to run between Old Oak Common in west London and Birmingham at some point between 2029 and 2032. Dame Bernadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, said the final leg, between Old Oak Common and Euston in central London, was due to finish by 2036 at the latest. “Our initial work, or current work, on Euston suggests we are still within that parameter,” she said. Summing up what they had learned during the hearing, Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the Conservative chair of the committee, said: We don’t know when the reset is going to take place, we don’t know what the cost is going to be, and we don’t know when it is likely to come into operation. A Spanish state-owned shipbuilder will buy Belfast-based Harland &amp; Wolff in a rescue deal that will secure all four of its shipyards and save about 1,000 jobs, Julia Kollewe and Lisa O’Carroll report. Navantia is to acquire H&amp;W’s Belfast shipyard where the Titanic was built, as well as the Arnish and Methil yards in Scotland, and the Appledore site in Devon, ending months of uncertainty for its employees. Talks between Navantia and the UK government had been taking place since H&amp;W went into administration in September after ministers refused to provide taxpayer-funded support to keep it going. In a statement in the Commons about the deal, Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, said: The former government’s inability to make a decision left the yards and the workforce in limbo and that is why I made clear in my first weeks in this job that no taxpayer guarantee or loan would be provided. And I was dismayed that when I did so, the Conservative party opposed that, knowing as they did that with a guarantee or loan, they stood at significant risk losing an eyewatering amount of taxpayers’ money. That was deeply irresponsible. Downing Street has said Keir Starmer has confidence in Tulip Siddiq, a Treasury minister, even though she has been named in a Bangladeshi anti-corruption probe, PA Media reports. PA says: Siddiq has “denied any involvement in the claims” accusing her of involvement in embezzlement, according to the prime minister’s spokesman, and continues to maintain her responsibility as a minister overseeing UK anti-corruption efforts. Pressed about whether there was any conflict of interest in Siddiq’s involvement in a 2013 Bangladeshi deal with Russia over a nuclear power plant and her ministerial role, the spokesman said: “I can’t speak to events that happened prior to a minister’s time in government.” He added there was a “very clear declaration process” for ministers, which had been followed. Siddiq has not been formally contacted by relevant Bangladeshi authorities, it is understood. The minister is alleged to have been involved in brokering a 2013 deal with Russia for a nuclear power plant in Bangladesh in which large sums of cash were embezzled. Her aunt, Sheikh Hasina, was until recently prime minister of Bangladesh for more than 20 years, and is facing a wider investigation by an anti-corruption commission in the south Asian country. Siddiq has been approached for comment, and the Labour party has declined to comment. But sources close to the minister have described the allegations as “spurious”. At the committee hearing (see 12.15pm) Mark Wild, the HS2 chief executive, also defended the decision spend £100m on what has been described as a “bat shed” to protect the animals from the trains. Keir Starmer recently said this investment was “absurd”, and an example of why planning laws needed radical reform. Asked about the cost, Wild said: I understand why that would raise public concern; it seems an extraordinary amount of money. But I would say this: I have actually visited this structure myself in my first weeks to see it, it is of great concern to me to understand. This is a considerable engineering structure. It is on a railway that will travel at over 200 miles an hour, so the engineering of this whole structure is quite considerable. At the end of the day, HS2 Ltd must obviously comply with the law, and the law says that we must mitigate damage, harm, to protected species. Asked whether he had any regrets about decision to build this, Wild replied: I can’t apologise for complying with the law. This structure is the most appropriate. It is an extraordinary amount of money but it is in the context of a scheme that is costing tens of billions and it’s built for 120 years. Dame Bernadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the Department for Transport, told the committee that the DfT and the Treasury had “challenged” the building of the bat tunnel, but found it was “the most efficient remedy” for protecting the species. The Department for Transport does not know how much HS2 will cost, MPs were told today. Dame Berndadette Kelly, permanent secretary at the DfT, made the admission at a public accounts committee hearing this morning. She said: We do not currently have an agreed cost estimate now for phase one. HS2 Ltd has provided a cost estimate of £54-66bn, in 2019 prices, but Kelly said the DfT did not “regard it as a reliable and agreed cost estimate”. She added: I say with great regret, sitting before the committee, that is the situation. She said that coming up with an agreed cost estimate would be “extremely complex” and would not be done until “well into 2025”. Explaining what had gone wrong, Mark Wild, the HS2 chief executive said there were three “systemic” and “enduring” problems. Construction started way too early. The rush to start before mature design consents was really, in retrospect, a mistake. He also said that HS2 had “not managed the risk profile in an optimal way” and that “productivity assumptions at the beginning have not come to pass”. Steve Reed, the environment secretary, has accused the Conservative of weaponising a personal tragedy as part of their campaign against what they call the family farm tax. He made the comment during environment questions in the Commons in response to a question from his Tory shadow, Victoria Atkins, about the budget plan to extend inheritance tax so that it covers some farms. Atkins said: In recent weeks, a farmer took himself off to a remote part of his farm and killed himself. The message he left his family, who wish to remain anonymous, is that he did this because he feared becoming a financial burden to his family because of changes to inheritance tax. This is the human cost of the figures that the secretary of state provides so casually. What does the secretary of state say to that grieving family? Atkins also asked for suicide figures for farmers and landowners to be published on a monthly basis “so that we – the house – and the outside community can understand the human costs”. In response, Reed said: I send my heartfelt sympathies to that family but I think it is irresponsible in the extreme to seek to weaponise a personal tragedy of that kind in this way. Where there is mental ill health then there needs to be support for that, and this government is investing in it. She knows from the last year for which data is available that the vast majority of claimants will pay absolutely nothing following the changes to APR [agricultural property relief – the inheritance tax exemption]. On suicide figures, Reed said that mental health was a matter for the NHS, and that Atkins “broke the NHS” when she was health secretary. In response to another question during the session, Reed said that Labour recognised that farmers are out to make a profit, and he claimed the Conservatives did not. He said: The shadow secretary of state, as well as the former prime minister, keep telling farmers they’re not in it for the money. We know that they are. They’re businesses that need to make a profit, and our new deal for farmers, including increasing supply chain fairness is intended to make farms profitable and successful for the future, in a way that they were not under the previous government. Conservatives argue that, for many farmers, wanting to be able to pass the farm on to the next generation is a key motive for what they do, which is why they view the inheritance tax as pernicious. Northern Ireland’s deputy first minister Emma Little-Pengelly has waded into the Waspi (Women Against State Pension Inequality) row saying the women had been treated “appallingly”. “My mother is a Waspi woman and she and many women were treated appallingly and shabbily and deserve that to be recognised,” said the DUP minister, as Labour divisions over the decision not to pay compensation to the Waspi pensioners deepened. Yesterday Scotland first minister John Swinney said the decision was a “serious embarassment” for Labour. Commenting on the announcement, Helen Morgan, the Lib Dem health spokesperson, said: This extra funding will be welcome for hospices, patients who need end-of-life care, and their loved ones, and it must be followed by a real focus on improving end-of-life care in the new 10-year NHS plan. However, it is deeply disappointing that ministers are still not protecting hospices and other crucial health and care providers – including GPs, dentists, pharmacists and care homes – from their national insurance hike. Hospice UK, which represents the hospice sector, has welcomed the government’s announcement. Its CEO, Toby Porter, said: Today’s announcement will be hugely welcomed by hospices, and those who rely on their services. Hospices not only provide vital care for patients and families, but also relieve pressure on the NHS. This funding will allow hospices to continue to reach hundreds of thousands of people every year with high-quality, compassionate care. Martin Vickers (Con) accused the government of “giving with one hand and taking with another”. He asked when individual hospices would find out how much extra they would receive. Smyth said those allocations would be made in the new year, after consultations with the sector. Paul Holmes (Con) said it beggared belief that Smyth expected MPs to be grateful to the government for giving money to hospices that it had taken away in the first place. He said a hospice in his constuency would need an extra £1m to cover the cost of the national insurance increase. He asked the minister if she could assure him that the extra funding announced today would cover that. Smyth said what beggared belief was that Tory MPs were defending the record of the last government on hospice funding. She did not address the specific question about the hospice in Holmes’ Hamble Valley constituency. Bob Blackman (Con) told Karin Smyth she still had not said whether or not this extra money would fully compensate hospices for the national insurance rise. He asked her again to answer. Smyth sidestepped the question, saying the Conservatives had 14 years to sort out hospice funding. In her response to the statement from Karin Smyth, Caroline Johnson, the shadow health minister, suggested the extra money for hospices would not fully compensate the extra costs the sector is facing because of the national insurance increase and the rise in the living wage. She said: On October 30 the chancellor decided to break her election promise by increasing employers’ national insurance contributions and reducing the threshold at which employer contributions are payable. It was later confirmed that hospices would not be exempted from this increase in costs. Now the government has announced new funding for the sector, which they had the audacity to call the biggest investment in a generation. Let us be clear what is going on: they are taking millions of pounds off hospices and palliative care charities and then think they should be grateful when they give them some of it back. This is socialism at its finest. Smyth said that Johnson should be welcoming the announcement, and that under the Conservatives the sector was not properly funded. Here is an extract from the Department for Health and Social Care’s news release about the hospice announcement. (See 10.47am.) The biggest investment in a generation for hospices has been announced by the government today, ensuring that hospices can continue to deliver the highest quality end of life care possible for their patients, families, and loved ones. The £100m funding will help hospices this year and next to provide the best end of life care to patients and their families in a supportive and dignified physical environment. Hospices for children and young people will also receive a further £26m revenue funding for 2025/26 through what until recently was known as the Children’s Hospice Grant … This investment will go towards helping hospices to improve their buildings, equipment, and accommodation to ensure that patients continue to receive the best care possible. That will include refurbishing bedrooms and bathrooms for patients and providing comfortable overnight facilities for families, improving IT systems making it easier for GPs and hospitals to share vital data on patients. The money will also help towards improving garden and outdoor spaces so patients and their families can spend time outdoors in greener and cleaner spaces. It will also help to develop and bettering outreach services to support people in their own homes when needed. In the Commons Karin Smyth, the health minister, is now responding to an urgent question on hospice funding. She says the governments wants a society where everyone can get high quality care. It also wants to shift care out of hospitals. And hospices will play a big part in that, she says. She says the government recognises the pressures facing hospices over a number of years. Today she can announce the biggest investment into hospices and end of life care for a generation. She says there will be a £100m boost for adult and children’s hospices to ensure they have the best physical environment for care, and £26m to support children and young people’s hospices. She says the details of the funding allocation will be set out in the new year. The number of people in hospital in England with flu has jumped 41% in a week and continues to be more than four times the number at this point last year, PA reports. PA says: An average of 2,629 flu patients were in beds in England each day last week, 2,504 in general or acute (G&amp;A) beds and 125 in critical care, NHS figures show. This is up 41% from a total of 1,861 patients the previous week, when 1,795 were in G&amp;A beds and 66 were in critical care. It is also more than four times the figure at this stage in 2023, when the total stood at 648, and higher than the equivalent week in 2022, when the average was 2,088. The figures have been published in the latest weekly snapshot of the performance of hospitals in England this winter. British troops could start training Ukrainian troops in Ukraine itself, John Healey, the defence secretary, has suggested. He revealed this in an interview with Larisa Brown in the Times. In her story Brown reports: John Healey said the UK needed to “make the training a better fit for what the Ukrainians need” as he left the door open for it to take place in the war-torn country instead of Britain. “We [need to] make it easier to the Ukrainians to access and we [need to] work with the Ukrainians to help them motivate and mobilise more recruits,” he said to The Times on a visit to Ukraine. Asked if this meant extending training of Ukrainian recruits inside the UK to Ukraine itself, he said: “We will look wherever we can to respond to what the Ukrainians want. They are the ones fighting.” Keir Starmer has met the Sultan of Brunei at Downing Street, PA Media reports. PA says: The prime minister greeted Haji Hassanal Bolkiah at the door of No 10. They then held a meeting in the White Room. Starmer praised the “strong relationship” between the two countries. He said he and the sultan would talk about the renewal of the garrison agreement between the two nations, and wider issues of trade and security. At 10.30am there will be an urgent question in the Commons on hospice funding. It has been tabled by Caroline Johnson, a shadow health minister. She may be hoping to clear up the confusion about what the government will do to compensate hospices for the extra staff costs arising because of the employers’ national insurance rise in the budget, and about when the announcement is coming. Yesterday Wes Streeting, the health secretary, told there would be a decision before Christmas. But at PMQs Keir Starmer said it was coming in the new year. Then there are four ministerial statement. After the usual Thursday statement on forthcoming business by Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, we’ve got: Jonathan Reynolds, the business secretary, on the future of Harland and Wolff Luke Pollard, a defence minister, on Ukraine Anneliese Dodds, the international development minister, on Syria Water bills in England and Wales will rise by 36% over the next five years, as suppliers were accused of forcing struggling households to pay for years of underinvestment to fix leaky pipes and cut pollution, Jasper Jolly and Helena Horton report. For the record, here is the full readout from No 10 about the conversation between Keir Starmer and Donald Trump yesterday. The prime minister spoke to President-elect Donald Trump this afternoon from Downing Street. The prime minister began by congratulating President-elect Trump on his recent team appointments and President-elect Trump warmly recounted his meeting with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in Paris earlier this month. Both agreed on their joint ambition to strengthen the close and historic relationship between the UK and the US. They looked forward to working together on shared priorities, including international security and delivering economic growth and prosperity. Turning to global conflicts, the prime minister reiterated the need for allies to stand together with Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression and to ensure Ukraine is in the strongest possible position. On the Middle East, the prime minister underscored the need to work together to ensure peace and security in the region. They agreed to keep in touch and looked forward to seeing one another at the earliest opportunity. Good morning. It is the last day the House of Commons is sitting before the Christmas recess, and the main event will be in a committee room in Portcullis House where Keir Starmer will have his first question session with the liaison committee, the ‘prefects’ club’ comprising the chairs of all the other Commons select committees. For 90 minutes he will take questions on the economy, public services and global affairs from MPs who know their subjects pretty well. Most of them are Labour MPs, but they include people who have only become select committee chairs because, despite serving on the front bench before the election, they were not appointed ministers, and so it is wrong to assume they are all Starmer loyalists. In theory, 90 minutes of intelligent questioning with the PM should produce a decent amount of news. In reality, past liaison committee hearings have often failed to produce much beyond a rehash of familiar No 10 lines to take. But we live in hope. Relations with the US are almost certain to come up, and Starmer may be asked about an overnight story that suggests Starmer is firming up links with the incoming Donald Trump administration. Yesterday Starmer and Trump spoke on the phone. In its readout, No 10 says: The prime minister began by congratulating President-elect Trump on his recent team appointments and President-elect Trump warmly recounted his meeting with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales in Paris earlier this month. Both agreed on their joint ambition to strengthen the close and historic relationship between the UK and the US. They looked forward to working together on shared priorities, including international security and delivering economic growth and prosperity. No 10 did not say which of the Trump appointments Starmer wanted to applaud. Some of them have horrified progressive opinion around the world. CBS has a useful list of all the names here. And, overnight, the Telegraph and the Sun have revealed that Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s chief of staff, travelled to the US last week for talks with Trump’s team. The Guardian has confirmed the story. In his Telegraph story Ben Riley-Smith says: Morgan McSweeney travelled to Florida to meet Susie Wiles, the political strategist who masterminded Mr Trump’s re-election campaign and will be his chief of staff in office. Mr McSweeney also had policy discussions in Washington with Mike Waltz, the congressman who has been named as Mr Trump’s next national security adviser. Riley-Smith also includes this quote from a “senior Downing Street source” summarising the position. The mood music was very warm. President Trump is nothing but warm about the UK. As the year closes, Team Starmer is confident the UK is in a good position for a strong bilateral relationship with the new presidency. (Do they really talk like that in Westminster? I’m afraid they do.) In his version of the story, Harry Cole from the Sun says Jonathan Powell, Starmer’s national security adviser, also attended the meeting. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Steve Reed, the environment secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Keir Starmer gives evidence to the liaison committee.

          "bodyText": "I had been seeing my girlfriend for six months when she suggested we spend Christmas with her family. This was uncharted territory for me: past relationships had either not lasted long enough or had been with people whose families did not celebrate Christmas. I felt nervous, but was determined to make a good impression on Bridget’s parents, who lived in a remote rural community in the Scottish Borders – a part of the world that was very different from anything familiar to me. Having grown up in a Muslim family, I was unused to traditions such as Christmas dinner. I worried that requesting halal meat might interfere with her family’s food plans. Bridget’s parents, being deeply kind and empathetic people, suggested that perhaps I could prepare a Christmas curry for the family. They enjoyed Indian food and this would allow me to bring a part of my cultural heritage to their home – which was how I came to be in their kitchen preparing a saag aloo, based on a recipe learned from my mother. “Remember not to make it too spicy,” Bridget may have said as I started scooping chilli powder and tandoori masala powder into a pan. I peeled and sliced potatoes, adding them to the pan along with the spinach (and just a few more teaspoonfuls of spices). Although I had been warned that a pinch of paprika was about as spicy as Bridget’s parents got, my greatest cooking fear is the thought of making a curry that is bland. “That smells so good,” said her mother. I took this as permission to add another chilli. The table was set, the family was seated and my saag aloo was served into bowls alongside warm pitta bread. Here I was, spending Christmas in a tiny village in Scotland, eating a dish my Muslim Pakistani mother had taught me. This, I thought, was the very best version of modern, multicultural Britain. I looked across the table and, to my astonishment, saw that Bridget’s parents had tears streaming down their faces. Her sister and brothers were also wet-eyed. The symbolism of this moment was, I sensed, not lost on them either. Bridget seemed less emotional. “I told you to go easy on the chillies,” she hissed. “Everyone is dying right now.” I started to panic: perhaps one rather than three green chillies might have sufficed. “I hope it’s not too hot for you,” I said to her parents. They gestured to signal that everything was fine – but I could not help noticing that they seemed unable to speak. “This is delicious,” rasped Bridget’s brother, on the way to the toilet. He returned with a roll of loo paper to pass around for everyone to wipe their tears. “It has got a bit of a kick to it,” I agreed, “but it usually gets a bit milder by day two.” Looking at the discomfort on the faces around me, I wasn’t convinced there would be a day two. The lunch was not a success – but, to my relief, it did not signal the end of our relationship. Two years later, we got married. I have spent many more Christmases at my in-laws’ home since then – although I usually leave the cooking to them."

          "bodyText": "Despite the necessity of filling in the gaps of Black American history, viewers could be forgiven for feeling a little fatigued, after a decade of highly worthy but often gruelling stories of slavery, civil rights abuses and institutional racism, from 12 Years a Slave to Till to The Hate U Give to Get Out, and many more besides. Nickel Boys is something very different: rather than more “trauma porn”, it gives us direct emotion, poetic imagery and radical invention. It owes more to Terrence Malick and Gaspar Noé than Ava DuVernay. On one level, you could categorise it as another missing piece of the historical puzzle. The setting is a segregated reform school in remote 1960s Florida, based on the real-life Arthur G Dozier school, where past abuses and unmarked graves were uncovered in the early 2000s. We follow doe-eyed Elwood (Ethan Herisse), a promising young student who’s cruelly condemned by association before he even gets to college, and thrown into what amounts to a juvenile prison, with its own rules and hierarchies and horrors. He falls in with Turner (Brandon Wilson), a more seasoned, more jaded inmate, and their fates intersect in ways we never quite understand until the final frames. Adapted from Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer-winning novel, the story is a bracing blend of historical fiction, character drama and even prison-break thriller. Not only does Nickel Boys have a powerful story to tell, it has an audacious way of telling it: the entire movie is shot in first person. We see everything through the eyes of either Elwood or Turner – the landscape, the minutiae of life, the characters’ own bodies or the faces of other characters (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, as Elwood’s grandmother, makes a particularly powerful impression). The experience is vividly immersive and intimate. We’re not watching these people; we are them. Things aren’t happening to them; they’re happening to us. As a technical feat, it’s almost unfathomable; as a viewing experience, it’s unforgettable; and as a way out of serving up yet more trauma porn, it’s ingenious. Director RaMell Ross is a multidisciplinary artist more than a film-maker, and he seems to have approached this, his first feature film, with no baggage, let alone film-school training. Ross achieved a similar mix of lyricism and earthiness in his 2018 documentary Hale County This Morning, This Evening, following ordinary Black life in rural Alabama. Nickel Boys goes even further: the point-of-view imagery becomes a collage of present-tense experience, gorgeous or ugly landscapes, fleeting impressions, details, memories, snatches of television and other media – something closer, perhaps, to waking life than conventional cinema. As well as being floored by the feeling and the ambition of Nickel Boys, you’re left wondering why more movies aren’t made this way."

          "headline": "All my Christmas huffing and puffing has prompted a new catchphrase: ‘Stop struggling, Mum’",
          "bodyText": "Every few years, the grind of modern life inspires calls for a radical rethink. We have seen this most recently in Iceland, where the rollout of a 35-hour, four-day working week has shown signs of success, and more broadly with the conversation around remote working. For obvious reasons, these productivity experiments relate to adult working life. But what if children’s increasingly frantic lives were also given a rethink? I write this under the strain of what feels like the most flat-out week of the year, in which the sheer volume of low-key demands – plays, choirs, nativities, secret Santas, whip rounds, costume days, not to mention the bizarre closure of so many after-school programmes aeons before school finishes – leaves families dragging themselves towards the finish line, gasping for air. This image isn’t, as it turns out, merely figurative. As I slog through the final days, I am so theatrically put-upon that every small gesture triggers involuntary noises – huffing, puffing, groaning, sighing, the occasional piercing shriek – something I have only become conscious of thanks to my children’s catchphrase of the season: “Stop struggling.” The struggle is real. They seem fine, buoyed up by the prospect of Christmas, but it is hard for parents at this time of year not to wonder if there may not be a better way of doing things. I find myself thinking enviously of those cousins of mine who took their kids out of school to travel the world for two years on the basis that the experience would be more valuable than traditional learning. I don’t have the resources to do that, so instead I hover over words such as “holistic” and “flexi”, and all the other terms we reach for to launder an exhausted desire to do less. “I’m opting out” has become a useful phrase that dignifies what used to be called “can’t be arsed”. Ditto boundaries and comfort levels and the right to say no, all of which may get us some way further towards equilibrium. These kinds of measures are personal, small-scale responses to feelings of being overwhelmed. But there is another approach where children’s schedules are concerned, which involves something called “flexi-schooling”, in which kids are neither fully home-schooled, nor in full-time attendance at school, but engage in a mixture of the two. Devised originally for children suffering or recovering from illness, flexi-schooling isn’t a legal right for children in the UK but is allowed at the discretion of headteachers. If permitted, you can homeschool your child for part of the week. There are obvious downsides to this, as anyone whose memories of limited schooling during the pandemic cause them to twitch their limbs or experience rapid onset breathlessness can testify. Earlier this month Sir Martyn Oliver, the head of England’s schools inspectorate, Ofsted, raised concerns about flexi-schooling from a safeguarding perspective, since it makes record-keeping around absences and children who “go missing from education” harder. Ofsted’s annual report estimated that approximately 34,000 children were attending school on a flexi, part-time basis, for reasons that went unrecorded. Ideally, he said, flexi-schooling should be used only as a short-term measure rather than a long-term way to address behavioural needs. All of this makes sense and, of course, for most parents who work, the prospect of increasing their children’s number of hours at home during the day is a nightmare, not a solution. The desire for a general lowering of pressure is real, however, which explains how often “Scandinavia” is cited in conversations around education, with its prioritisation of play and relaxed approach to the age at which kids learn to read (six to eight years old, almost two years later than UK and US models). The longer you are in the system, it seems, the less intrusion you want from the system at home. I used to be quite keen on the idea of homework, but now that my kids are enrolled at a more or less homework-free primary school all I can think is, quite right and thank God. Let them have these 10 years without hitting marks or making grades. And while the answer to the craziness of the Christmas schedule isn’t a pivot to hybrid schooling, we should regularly remind ourselves not to treat our kids like tiny executives, slogging through their five-day week plus sports and music and drama and homework. Maybe one of these days, the gurus behind the Icelandic four-day week experiment or blockbuster books such as The 4-Hour Work Week might profitably turn their attention to the under-18s.

          "bodyText": "From a toadstool with teeth to a vine smelling of marzipan and a flower that has cheated its way out of having to photosynthesise, a weird and wonderful host of new plant and fungus species have been discovered in 2024. Other plants given scientific names for the first time include beautiful new orchids, a ghostly palm and a hairy plant that appears to have stolen a gene from an unrelated family. The species are among the 172 new plants and fungi named by scientists from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and their partners. The species come from every corner of the globe, from woods near Tunbridge Wells in Kent in England, to African sandstone cliffs in Guinea and the forests of Indonesia. However, botanists are in a race against time to discover many plants and fungi before the continuing destruction of the natural world drives them to extinction. The loss of species does not only mean that their unique biology is gone forever, but also their potential for use as medicine, food and even as plastic recyclers. Some of the new species in 2024 already face extinction because of cement manufacturing, cinnamon farming and timber plantations. There are 400,000 named plant species but scientists estimate there are another 100,000 yet to be identified. Every year, scientists name about 2,500 new species of plant and the same number of fungi. “The sheer privilege of describing a species as new to science is a thrill that not many will ever get to experience,” said Dr Martin Cheek, in RBG Kew’s Africa team. “Sadly, the devastating reality is that more often than not, new species are being found on the brink of extinction and it’s a race against time to find and describe them all.” About 40% of named plant species are threatened with extinction, as habitats are razed for farmland and other human development, and as many as 75% of the world’s undescribed plant species are thought to be threatened with oblivion. Toadstools most often have gills or pores under the caps to disperse their spores but those from the genus Phellodon have rows of teeth-like protuberances. This year DNA analysis revealed three new species in the UK, from woodland near Tunbridge Wells and Windsor in England, and Abernethy in Scotland. These fungi are harmed by nitrate pollution from farming and are disappearing across Europe. Other new fungi include three species of toadstool from the genus Russula – which often give off a fishy whiff – from northern Sweden and Norway, the high Rockies in the US and British Columbia in Canada. Dr Anna Bazzicalupo, a fungi expert at RBG Kew, said: “Identifying new species of fungi is a colossal but increasingly important task as we estimate more than 2m species are waiting to be described. An overwhelming number of them are likely threatened with extinction, meaning they may disappear before they are even recognised.” The marzipan-scented liana, a woody, long-stemmed vine named Keita deniseae was collected in the Boyboyba forest of Guinea, where the plant climbs into the canopy with strange, hooked structures and bears large, edible fruit. Three more new lianas were found in southern China. These flower only at night and are pollinated by moths. One, Cheniella longistaminea, can grow up to 80 metres tall but all are threatened by plantations of timber and cinnamon, with the latter being a big export to the US. Another new liana in Vietnam, Chlorohiptage vietnamensis, grows in a limestone landscape that is being cleared for cement quarries. Scientists do not know what kind of insect pollinates its strange green flowers. Botanists also revealed a new family of cheats in 2024, called Afrothismiaceae. The rare plants, found mostly in forests in Cameroon, do not use sunlight to photosynthesise sugars and have lost their green colour. Plants usually provide these sugars to mycorrhizal fungi in their roots in exchange for minerals. But the Afrothismiaceae species take all they need from their fungal partners, giving nothing in return, and only appear above ground to fruit and flower. Another rule-breaker is a new herb from Guinea in west Africa, named Virectaria stellata, which grows on the remote sandstone cliffs of the Fouta Djallon. It has star-shaped clusters of hair, which have never been seen in this large family before. But these hairy stars do occur in the plants from an unrelated genus called Barleria. The botanists think the genes that produce the stellate hairs may have jumped from one family to the other via sap-drinking insects. Among the most spectacular new species are a bonanza of orchids from Indonesia, which still hosts many unknown species across its 17,000 islands. A climbing palm in western Borneo was also named in 2024, Plectocomiopsis hantu. Hantu is the local word for ghost, used because the plant has grey stems and white undersides to its leaves and it is known from only three rainforest locations. Local communities, however, have long used it to make baskets and for its tasty and tender roots. Cheek said: “Biodiversity loss is a crisis that affects us all. Every unknown species we lose could have been a potential new food or new medicine that we never even knew existed. We urgently need more funding, training and public awareness of plant and fungal taxonomy.”"

          "bodyText": "The Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed for the first time that one in 20 Australians are lesbian, gay, bi, trans or gender diverse, or intersex (LGBTI+). According to ABS head of health statistics, Robert Long, this is the “first nationally representative data of their kind in Australia”. Young Australians were more likely to be LGBTI+, with 9.5% of people aged 16 to 24, and 7.5% in the 25-34 category identifying as LGBTI+. Overall, 4.5% of Australians aged 16 and over identified as LGBTI+. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The jurisdictions with the most LGBTI+ people were in the ACT (5.9%) and Victoria (5.3%), statistically significantly more than other states and territories – although LGBTI+ people are found across the country. The ABS combined data from almost 45,000 people who took part in a health survey. About 740,000 people are lesbian, gay, bisexual or use a different term to describe their sexual orientation. One in three from those communities are married or in a de facto relationship. Almost 179,000 people – less than 1% – are trans and gender diverse, including trans men, trans women and non-binary people. The 2026 Australian census will include questions on gender and sexual orientation for people aged 16 years and over. Equality Australia chief executive, Anna Brown, said until now almost 1 million people have been hidden. “Our communities deserve to be counted and to feel seen,” she said. “We now know that LGBTIQ+ people live in every part of Australia, in regional, rural, metro and remote areas, and this means local councils, service providers and government agencies will be able to better serve the needs of our communities.” Brown said the estimates demonstrated the need for a more complete picture of Australia in the 2026 census. Just.Equal Australia spokesperson Rodney Croome said the data showed diverse communities were a powerful voting bloc ahead of next year’s federal election. “It is a reminder to all political parties that they must have policies recognising the human rights of LGBTI+ people and addressing the disadvantages we face in areas such as health, housing, employment, education and public safety,” he said. “This data will also help foster inclusion and equity in the broader community by reminding non-LGBTI+ Australians that we are a substantial part of Australian society and that we make an important contribution to national life.”"

          "headline": "Fleeing Xi’s China: following the trail of migrants trying to reach Australia through Indonesia",
          "bodyText": "Paul, an Indonesian fisherman, says he was working as a rideshare driver in the dusty streets of Kupang in West Timor when he came across half a dozen Chinese men on the side of the road. They were wet up to their waist, carrying a backpack each, and spoke no Indonesian. “They had walked from the beach, from the mangrove forest to the main road. They said they had difficulty with their boat engine,” Paul recalls. They asked for directions to a nearby hotel … and went on their way. Paul, a former people smuggler from Rote Island, called the police. “I used to bring people like this.” Five of the group had flown into Bali on tourist visas and travelled to South Sulawesi, allegedly to meet people smugglers who would take them by boat to Australia, a few hundred miles away. But not far from Kupang the boat ran into trouble, a court would later hear. The passengers were dropped off and they waded ashore, then made their way through a coastal village to the main road where they met Paul. They are not the only Chinese people to have passed through this small city in remote Indonesia, suspected of looking for a fisherman to take them across the sea. The men are allegedly among a growing number of Chinese fleeing their home country, where rising authoritarianism under the rule of Xi Jinping and the difficulties of a faltering economy has prompted some people to look for a way out. The phenomenon has become so widely discussed online that it has its own nickname: runxue, or run philosophy, a coded term for emigration. Some are relocating on student or business visas, joining growing diaspora communities in places like Japan or Thailand. But tens of thousands of others who don’t qualify or have the resources for such pathways are fleeing in other unconventional and often dangerous ways, known as zouxian, or walking the line. Most head for the US, trekking from South America through the hostile jungle of the Darian Gap. In September the Guardian revealed a small but growing number were also flying into the Balkans to find smugglers to take them to Germany. Now, another emerging high-stakes escape route has been revealed, through the Indonesian archipelago to a smuggler’s boat destined for Australia. The numbers are a drop in the ocean compared with the masses of asylum seekers fleeing conflict and deprivation around the world, and these Chinese migrants in Indonesia are treading a path well worn by people escaping wartorn countries like Afghanistan and Myanmar. But experts say the arrival of Chinese people on this route signals growing discontent at home. Some Chinese migrants in the US and Europe have said tightening restrictions on political, religious and social freedoms during Xi’s rule led them to flee. Others cited stifling public health policies during the pandemic, and the economic downturn, housing crunch, and youth unemployment crisis that followed. Meredith Oyen, an associate professor at the University of Maryland at Baltimore County, specialising in Chinese migration, says politics and economics are push factors. “The zero-Covid policy ended up destroying a lot of small businesses and a lot of middle class people’s economic life … The combination of that and the draconian nature of some of those policies led to frustrations and more political dissatisfactions. “Even if you’re not driven by political repression, the experience of bankruptcy in China is political, it has more blowback on your life compared to places like the US. So it feels like if you’re just going to be languishing in China and you don’t see hope for recovery in a way that makes you a welcome member of society, you might as well risk it.” The Guardian travelled to Indonesia to piece together the journey and find out why and how Chinese people are deciding to risk the notoriously dangerous – and usually unsuccessful – path. ‘Anyone coming with us?’ For many embarking on zouxian, their journey starts on the Chinese social media platform, Douyin. Douyin has become a common channel to recruit fellow migrants, with people openly stating that they want to smuggle themselves into Australia. Dozens of comments on these videos use cryptic terms to express their interest in joining. Ten months ago, a 29-year-old man from Heilongjiang with the username “Tian Ci”, posted that he’d found a boat, and was looking for “sincere people to go with”. Four months ago, he commented under a Douyin ad for an Australian immigration consultant that he was ready. “Anyone coming with us?” he said. His next stop was Bali in mid-August, where he posted a video of himself drinking beer with some Indonesian men, at Suris hotel in Kuta. A few days later he posted again: “wish you luck and wish me luck”. His IP location then switched to “unknown”. The Chinese passengers fly in to places like Bali, Jakarta and Sulawesi on the tourist visas-on-arrival Indonesia introduced this year, or to neighbouring countries like Timor Leste, Brunei, or Malaysia, and make their way over various borders to meet smugglers for the final journey to Australia. Smugglers told us that boats often leave from privately owned coastland in Kupang, or from Rote island where crew members have long been recruited from fishing villages. Some boats exit through Mulut Seribu, or “Thousand Mouths”, a chaotic network of islands and mangrove forests creating myriad exit routes to evade authorities. Others said boats also leave from the sparse southern coastline between Kupang and Timor Leste, including the tiny district of Kolbano. Outside a small store at the end of the same street where the sodden migrants had trekked in from the mangroves, a group of Timorese drivers say the road to Timor Leste is well travelled by people looking to meet smuggler boats. ‘More than one group has gone this way’ The group Paul came across didn’t make it far. Their repaired boat was intercepted by authorities, and the five Chinese passengers and six crew (including one Chinese man, Jiang Xiao Jia) were arrested. Four of the passengers were deported and the crew were put on trial charged with people smuggling and visa law offences. The Kupang court has heard allegations that the five passengers – Chen Xu, Li Ke Yang, Zhao Jin Xiang, Wang Dong Fang, and Dai Zhong Hai – paid US$5,000-$7,000 each to Jiang to be taken to Australia. They told the court they wanted to find work in Australia. Jiang, a Chinese national who police said has lived in Sulawesi for three years with his local wife and two children, denies the allegation, saying he was organising a fishing expedition. The money is significant for those who agree to smuggle people to Australia. Rote is one of the most impoverished districts of Indonesia, its people relying on farming and fishing for survival. Paul says he was recently offered 25m rupiah (US$1,560/£1,200) and a boat to take a group, but he refused, saying he has a family now and doesn’t want to risk a fourth stint in Australian detention. On a warm afternoon in Papela, a quiet fishing village on the eastern end of Rote, Abdullah Pello is sitting on his front porch with a small crowd of people smugglers and a local police officer. Pello, who says he hasn’t run a smuggling venture in 10 years, finds the arrival of Chinese a curious development. “It used to be all Middle Eastern people,” he says. “Now it’s mostly the Middle East and China.” His neighbour, Abdul Pello, says he has encountered at least two groups of Chinese migrants, including one that paid for a boat with five outboard motors to “go fast”. Another man says that in 2023 a group of Chinese people asked him to buy a boat and meet them at Kolbano. “I refused … They don’t let them enter,” he says referring to the Australian authorities. But he thinks the boat still went, with another crew not from his village. “More than one group has gone this way, all Chinese people. They only say they want to get to Australia.” It is not clear how many have tried to get to Australia. Indonesian authorities did not respond to requests for information. Cases involving Chinese migrants have been reported sporadically since at least 2020. The Timorese drivers say one vessel carrying Chinese people capsized near Kolbano earlier this year, killing all but one passenger, but the Guardian was unable to verify the story. In March 2024, Australian media reported 15 Chinese people flew into Bali on tourist visas, then went to Kupang and were reported to police after they asked fishermen how to reach Australia. They were returned home, with police saying they could not detain people for just asking questions. In April a group of 10 Chinese people walked on to an Australian airbase in northern Western Australia, claiming asylum after travelling from Indonesia. In May, two were reportedly turned around at sea near Darwin. Late last month a group of nine reportedly landed near the Coburg Peninsula in Arnhem Land. That came just weeks after four Chinese men were found on nearby Croker Island. The men were dropped off by a long shallow fishing boat, and were discovered “stressed and shaking” by Indigenous rangers patrolling for illegal fishermen. Shown a photo, the men on Rote identify the boat as a Sulawesi fishing vessel, painted black for either people smuggling or illegal fishing. Further investigation has found that the four men, at least one from Louhe city in Henan, very likely left from or near Kupang. Based on interviews with local people who recognised a photo of two of the men, the Guardian believes they were part of a group of six who stayed at the Hotel Winslow in early November for two nights. They booked on the Indonesian Traveloka app under false names, and slept in room 115, ordering in food before saying they were getting a bus to Timor Leste. In Australia they told the Garngi rangers – who gave first aid and sheltered them in their remote community until authorities arrived – that they feared persecution in China and wanted to claim asylum. “The local community and traditional owners … quickly realised these fellas were escaping something desperate,” Garngi ranger coordinator Bryan Macdonald says. “They all said they feared for their lives.” Macdonald said the community wanted to know where the men were now, but they got just “standard responses” from authorities. Australian Border Force said only: “a group of unauthorised maritime arrivals” from one smuggling venture were transferred to a regional processing centre – likely Nauru – in November. The Australian government is notoriously secretive about its highly contentious policies, refusing to discuss “on-water matters”. A 2023-24 annual report said there were “zero successful maritime people smuggling ventures”, meaning all known ventures were intercepted or its passengers captured on arrival. ‘Eventually, someone will die’ One of the biggest questions about this apparent new pathway for fleeing Chinese people is why they think it is a good idea. For more than a decade Australia has refused to resettle any asylum seekers who arrive by boat, instead sending them to draconian offshore processing centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea. For Chinese migrants, Australia’s military-led policy means that successfully landing in Australia and claiming asylum automatically precludes them from being able to stay in Australia. But the alternative – sneaking in to live an undocumented life – seems impossible. Most landing points are in the most remote parts of Australia, with harsh climates, dangerous animals, and hundreds of kilometres to the nearest town or city. “Eventually, someone will die,” the chair of the Northern Land Council, Matthew Ryan, said last month. “These poor blokes were dumped with no food or water and left to fend for themselves.” Speaking generally, the Australian Border Force told the Guardian its tough policies show Canberra “will not tolerate Australia being targeted” by “criminal people smugglers”, who it said were selling false hope to vulnerable people for financial gain. But people still want to make the trip. ‘I envy other people who can run’ The laneways of Ubud are a far cry from a camouflaged fishing boat on the West Timor coast. But a retired Chinese woman on holidays in Bali is well aware of the pathway. She tells the Guardian she dreams of “running”. “I envy other people who can ‘run’ but I am not capable of doing so myself,” she says, adding that her adult children would also “run” if it weren’t so difficult, dangerous and expensive. But she says she knows many others who have. “Some of them flee to the US, some of them make it, some of them don’t, and they share pics in the group,” she says of a dedicated WeChat group that has since been blocked. Some of the members flew to Bali and Brunei, presumably with the boat journey to Australia in mind. She says information is usually shared in these sort of groups, using coded language to try to avoid China’s strict censorship and digital surveillance. China’s internet firewall blocks a lot of international sites and information. It is one possible explanation for why people who dream of zouxian – through Indonesia, the Darian Gap, or the Balkans – do not seem fully aware of the risks. But she says life is getting economically, politically and socially tougher for people in China, especially for the young, and they want a way out. “The situation [in China] was better before the pandemic, and after the pandemic they said there would be an explosion of wealth, but there was not,” she says. “The houses, the economy, and the huge amount of foreign investment left, we all know it very well … It’s just, you know, I can’t say that freely.” China does not release statistics on people leaving, but the UN’s refugee agency – which has registered around a third of all displaced people and refugees – recorded 137,143 asylum seekers from China in 2023, five times the number registered a decade earlier at the start of Xi’s rule. By July this year it had grown to 176,239. Two of the men Paul came across on that Kupang road are still in immigration detention. A detention centre employee tells the Guardian he has been communicating with them using Google Translate, and now they just want to go home. He says neither they nor the four others since deported have received visits from Chinese consular officials, comparing them with detainees from other countries who had been visited by ambassadors. China’s embassy did not respond to queries. The highly publicised failed missions have not deterred everyone. Last week, a Chinese resident commented on a Douyin video about zouxian to Australia. “I’m at the end of the road. I can’t survive any more. I want to go. I want to go very much,” he said. On another post, a Jiangsu resident replied to a video looking for people smugglers. “Sign me up for one,” he wrote. Additional research by Elcid Domininggus Li and Fadiyah Alaidrus"

          "bodyText": "Ronald Blythe is most acclaimed for Akenfield, his 1969 portrait of an English village from the late 19th century onwards. Latterly, the saintly author, who lived hermit-like in a remote farmhouse, was revered for his poetic, and profound writing about rural life. In several million published words, Ronnie – as he was affectionately known – could be personal but never revealed his relationships or anything remotely raunchy. So it is unexpected to find this definitive biography, which spans the 10 decades of Blythe’s life, fairly steaming with sex. There are early adventures in a haystack; “some of the best sex ever” with fellow second world war conscripts; seduction by a jeweller from Bath in a Cornish field lit by glowworms; and casual assignations with everyone from a “blonde Adonis” of a civil servant to a notoriously slothful 21-stone rector. Later, as Blythe traced a path from a job in Colchester library towards writerly freedom, his sexual encounters involved Arthur Lett-Haines, artist and partner of the painter Cedric Morris; the writer James Hamilton-Paterson; and experimental nights with lesbian crime writer Patricia Highsmith. Blythe’s letters to Highsmith revealed other flings, including with a poet from Barbados who transfixed Ronnie with his physical “perfection”. Even when Blythe lived a solitary later life at Bottengoms, the ancient farmhouse he inherited from his friends John and Christine Nash, unlikely opportunities arose, including a dalliance with the stand-in postman. In another’s hands, this promiscuity might be sensationalist or spark prurient judgments, but it is sensitively treated by Ian Collins, a biographer who was also a close friend (but not a lover). What emerges is an unusually intimate and affectionate portrait. Blythe may not have been out in public – and homosexuality remained illegal in England until he was nearly 45 – but he “regarded sexuality as a fact of life to be accepted and enjoyed”. While he discussed his romances with Collins in old age, he was less willing to reveal the abject poverty of his early childhood. When he found fame after the publication of Akenfield, he would vaguely say – in aristocratic tones bearing no trace of his Suffolk accent – that he came from “an old farming family”. In fact, he was the eldest of six surviving children of Tilly, a London nurse and Albert, a Suffolk labourer who endured Gallipoli and other wartime horrors. Blythe shared a bed in their tiny cottage with a younger brother until he left home. The family were so poor that cousins brought straw for their mattresses. Blythe, sturdy but effete, left school at 14. Further education was out of the question. Collins superbly marshals a mountain of information from an epic life into often droll stories about the miracle of Blythe’s escape to earn a living through his writing. His crucial step from voracious reader-and-dreamer to writer was finding his bohemian adopted “family” of East Anglian artists through his library job. Vital friendships came in the form of poet James Turner (rendered a rather narcissistic homophobe in Collins’s telling) and the (much more sympathetic) “mother‑confessor” Christine Nash. There is an absence of anguish – in Blythe’s worldview did all those affairs really involve no bruising, no broken hearts? His later reminiscences are well-mined by Collins but, in many cases, they are all we have – recollections smoothed over with age. Survivors write their own history. So glimpses of alternative Ronnies are welcome: stoic Christine Nash complains of being unable to escape Blythe’s moaning and love quests; Hamilton-Paterson critiques his depictions of a rural world “which scarcely allows itself to be seen unless within the hermetic bounds of famous dead people’s eyes and ears”. Blythe’s gentle, loving spirit inspired a battalion of protective “dear ones” who helped him live and die at home. But this warm biography touches its subject’s inner steeliness too: the needy hearts of others were viewed as a distraction from the essential life-task of writing. When a grieving Julia Blackburn sought comfort in her friend, Blythe explained “with a sort of determined finality that he had never loved anyone enough to feel the pain of loss”.

          "headline": "Brothers cleared of Cornwall double murder after spending 20 years in prison",
          "bodyText": "Two brothers who have spent almost 20 years in prison for a double murder at a remote Cornish garage have been cleared after their convictions were overturned and a planned retrial dropped. Robert and Lee Firkins were jailed in 2006 for the murders of Carol and Graham Fisher, who were killed in what appeared to be a bungled burglary at their home in Perch, near Wadebridge. They maintained their innocence but were convicted after a man identified as “Witness Z” claimed he heard a confession from Robert Firkins while sharing a cell with him. Lawyers for the brothers successfully argued there was new expert evidence that showed Z was a compulsive liar and the convictions were quashed. James Wood KC and Sarah Elliott KC, of Doughty Street Chambers, who have worked on the case since the original trial, said it highlighted the danger of cell confessions. They said: “From the moment of these convictions, we knew the case was a gross miscarriage of justice. Based on an alleged cell confession, it illustrated the inherent dangers of this kind of evidence. “The time is now ripe for legal reform. Without independent reliable evidence supportive of the fact of the confession, cell confession evidence is so dangerous, it should always be excluded. This reform is now long overdue.” Carol Fisher, 53, and Graham Fisher, 60, were shot with a sawn-off shotgun and battered, possibly with a hammer and sledgehammer, on Bonfire Night in 2003. The Firkins brothers, originally from Essex but living in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, denied the murders, insisting they were visiting a pub and relatives at the time. They were found guilty by a jury at Exeter crown court and jailed for a minimum of 26 years. The judge, Mr Justice Owen, described Lee, 31 and Robert 32, as very dangerous men. In 2008, the brothers attempted unsuccessfully to bring an appeal but in 2020 the Criminal Cases Review Commission referred both convictions to the court of appeal in London. Elliott, for Robert Firkins, told the court in June 2023 that there was new expert evidence showing Z to be a “compulsive liar”, adding: “It is a pathological lying, it is a medical condition.” In December 2023, three appeal court judges quashed the convictions, finding them to be “unsafe”. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) applied for a retrial for both brothers, meaning that the media could not report their successful appeals. However, at a hearing at Winchester crown court this week, the CPS offered no evidence against either man. Anne Whyte KC, for the prosecution, said there was a “recent difficulty” that may affect the attendance of a witness at the retrial. She added: “In these circumstances and after consultation with police and CPS, it is no longer appropriate to continue these proceedings and therefore we are instructed to offer no evidence.” Devon and Cornwall police said they noted the decision. They said their major crime team had been preparing for the retrial but added: “Steps are already under way to manage the acquittal process including the release of Robert Firkins from prison. Lee Firkins will remain in custody due to other sentences he is currently serving.” The force said: “Devon and Cornwall police understand that whilst the original investigation was over 20 years ago, it is possible that new information exists and so anyone who wants to contact ourselves or [the charity] Crimestoppers, should do so as soon as possible.” A CPS spokesperson said: “We have a duty to keep all cases under continuous review. Following a further review of the evidence in this case, we took the decision that our legal test was no longer met and that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. That is why we offered no evidence in court.”"

          "bodyText": "The biggest shake-up in local government for 50 years – that is how Labour’s white paper, Power and partnership: Foundations for growth, has been described. It proposes a constitutional settlement extending devolution to the whole of England. The case for devolution is the stimulus it offers to local patriotism and pride in the development of public services. In a decentralised system, each authority will strive to ensure that its performance is better than that of its competitors. The emphasis will be on achievement, and mayors will compete in proclaiming how well they are doing. By contrast, if a centralised or nationalised service emphasises how well it is doing, government will shift resources elsewhere. Such organisations, therefore, can never appear to be too successful. Instead, they must always be pointing out their deficiencies. That is hardly likely to strengthen the morale or effectiveness of those working within them. Devolution in England began with the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act of 2016, the brainchild of the Conservative chancellor George Osborne. It was to be achieved by combined authorities led by a directly elected mayor. There are now 12 such mayors, and about 61% of people in England live under mayoral regimes. Such regimes provide strong and visible local leadership, with a mandate to represent their locality even in areas for which they do not enjoy statutory responsibility. They also yield a focus on accountability that is lacking in the traditional committee system, hitherto dominant in local government. Though I perhaps follow local matters more closely than most, I would be hard-pressed to name the leader of my London borough council. But 83% of people in Greater Manchester recognise Andy Burnham. So far, however, devolution has been ad hoc, creating a patchwork across England without any discernible geographical basis. More than 90% of the north is covered by devolution, but only 46% of the south. The white paper proposes devolution as the default position for local government. While a mayoral regime is not a requirement, those local authorities that choose this option will receive more powers from the centre than those that do not. Devolution, however, is hardly compatible with our fragmented system of local government. In Nottinghamshire, for example, there are a range of local authorities – including a county council responsible for infrastructure and transport, several district councils responsible for housing and commercial development, and in Nottingham itself, a unitary authority where the county council has no remit. Few voters can be aware of which authority is responsible for which service. So the government proposes a unitary system of local government based on the counties. But that means remote local authorities with a population of 500,000 or more. Will Bideford feel represented by Exeter, more than 40 miles away, or Ramsgate by Maidstone – about 45 miles away? To combat such remoteness, devolution must be complemented, as Florence Eshalomi, the chair of the Commons housing, communities and local government committee, has suggested, by devolution at local level. On the continent the standard pattern of local government is a regional layer combined with a small local layer, comprising a far smaller population than is represented even by our district councils. In England, the smallest local layer comprises the 10,000 parish and town councils. They should be strengthened and established in areas that don’t have them so that local people do not feel disfranchised. Nor is it any use devolving powers from central government without also devolving revenue-raising powers. After all, potential investors in a locality will ask not only does it have power, but also, can it offer tax incentives. Combined authorities are partly funded through their constituent councils by a levy, but they cannot raise additional resources. Metro mayors derive most of their funding from government grants. They lack power to establish their own taxes or set taxes locally. They are supplicants to Whitehall for funds. Nor is it easy to reconcile the white paper with the government’s housing proposals, which envisage central government pushing through development plans even against the wishes of localities to ensure that its ambitious building programme is achieved. In housing, the role of local authorities will be to deliver government policy, rather than to use their knowledge of local needs to decide on priorities for their own areas. This raises a fundamental constitutional problem. Which powers should be devolved and which should be retained at the centre as basic to our common citizenship? There is, in fact, a fundamental tension between devolution and territorial equity. We badly need a concordat between central government and local authorities to resolve this tension. Tacit understandings are no longer enough. For Britain is not only a constitutional and political union, but also a social and economic one. That is exemplified in the basic principle of the welfare state laid down by Clement Attlee’s government after 1945 – that standards of public services should not depend on where you live, on a postcode lottery. So the devolution of, for example, health functions, must not transform healthcare so that it becomes a mere series of local services whose quality depends on the clout of local leaders. Ideally a central/local concordat should be embodied in a constitution, but short of that, a charter could provide principled guidelines, a roadmap of the workings of government and the territorial division of power appropriate to a multinational state. So two cheers for the white paper, but not yet three. Vernon Bogdanor is a professor of government, King’s College London. His books include Devolution in the United Kingdom"

          "bodyText": "Here’s Geoff Lemon’s report from day five of the third Test at the Gabba. That’s it from the Gabba. It’s been another intriguing instalment in what is becoming an evermore fascinating Test series between these fierce cricketing foes. India destroyed Australia in the first Test to have local fans and media hitting the panic buttons. But Pat Cummins’ side responded with typical gusto by walloping India with the pink ball in Adelaide to square the series one-all. Here at the “Gabbatoir”, Australia piled on 445 in the first dig thanks to a magnificent Travis Head 152 and looked to be bossing proceedings for much of the Test. But then disaster struck with Josh Hazlewood taken to hospital with a calf strain (he has now been ruled out of the series) and Steve Smith dropping a sitter first ball of day four. Both incidents proved costly for the home side. India, always dangerous when wounded, sucker punched them on days four, rattling off 39 runs for the 10th wicket to avoid the follow-on and then did it again on day five, their bowlers running riot through the top order today to have Australia 89 for 7. A drawn third Test here in Brisbane leaves the Border-Gavaskar series deadlocked one-all and both sides heading to the greatest stage in world cricket – a 100,000+ crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day – looking to strike a knockout blow That’s where we’ll meet you next. Thanks for your company and your emails. We will see you on December 26 for more over-by-over coverage. On behalf of the Guardian team, Merry Christmas and happy holidays. We look forward to your company on December 26. That’s me over and out. Travis Head has been named player of the match for his superb 152 from 160 balls in the first innings. He also claimed the wicket of Akash Deep this morning and contributed 17 from 19 in Australia’s kamikaze second innings this afternoon. The Australian vice captain, who will turn 31 during the Boxing Day Test, is in the form of his life and seem to be batting on a different planet to his struggling teammates (barring best mate and fellow South Australian Alex Carey) no matter the wicket or state of the game: (It was a) challenging wicket. I had to work through the gears (with) different plans. Pleased I could get through those. Good partnership with Smit [Steve Smith]. I just try to sum up the conditions. What I’ve done well this series is assess the conditions. Pleased with the tempo I’ve batted with. Pretty relaxed communication. [Smith] felt like he was back in his rhythm – (that) gives me full freedom and confidence knowing he’s going to be there for a long while. I feel like I am playing the situation in front of me. Very pleased with the way I am batting at the moment. BREAKING NEWS: Ravi Ashwin has announced his retirement from Test cricket. Ashwin, a 107 Test legend of India cricket with and 537 wicket and six Test centuries to his name, has told the press conference today is his “last day as an Indian cricketer”. Australians will join India in celebrating Ashwin’s retirement. He has been a formidable foe and much-admired adversary over many years, with over 90 Australian notches on his belt. The Chennai-born allrounder fell in love with the game playing tennis-ball cricket on the streets where he perfected the soduku ball, a finger-flicked legbreak that became a weapon of mass destruction every bit as lethal as Shane Warne’s flipper. Ashwin arrived in Test cricket with a bang, taking nine wickets and winning Player of the Match. In his first 16 Tests he collected nine five-fors, and with a six demon bag of deliveries – a glorious carrom ball, a fine arm ball, and superb control over his famous fizzing offbreaks – was the fastest cricketer to 300 wickets and the second fastest to 400, behind only Muthiah Muralidaran. Farewell Ravi, and thanks for all the memories! India captain Rohit Sharma is cursing the Brisbane rain but loving the fact his batters fought so hard to avoid the follow-on and his bowlers wreaked such devastation on Australia’s top order before the heavens closed in. To have interruptions like that wasn’t great, but going to Melbourne at 1-1 is great and gives us confidence that we can go to Melbourne and pull something off there. The situation we were in just after lunch, we wanted someone to stand up and take the game through. Keeping in mind the weather, we knew it wasn’t going to be a full game, so credit to {Ravindra} Jadeja, and not to forget {KL} Rahul at the top as well. And it was great to watch these guys to go out there and do their thing. And with the ball we were very good, especially {Jasprit} Bumrah. Akash {Deep} is a feisty character – he has superb talent. He is new to international cricket, but games like this can teach him so many things. And there are a couple of guys in the group who can put their arms around him and help him. Pat Cummins is on the microphone: 450-odd was a good total. Maybe the few rain breaks helped us a little bit but it’s one of those things when you’re trying to win a Test match, whatever it takes, particularly when the ball was hard, it was quite a handful. Smithy and Trav’s innings were fantastic. Carey as well. Nath [Lyon] looked really good yesterday, Starcy got a lot of wickets. That’s all she wrote, folks. The third Test has officially been declared a draw. Players from Australia and India squads are shaking hands in the rooms and, with the series level at 1-1 with two Tests left, both squads are licking their lips for the fourth match in this Border-Gavaskar series on December 26. Heavy rain continues to fall at the Gabba with India 8-0 after just 13 deliveries of their second innings. There was another moment of intrigue within this intriguing Test when Travis Head did not take the field for those 2.1 overs. Despite his typically cavalier innings of 17 from 19 balls, rumours quickly spread that Head had sustained a groin injury. Supposedly the South Australian was seen limping and “gingerly stretching” in his 36-minute cameo. However, Cricket Australia has allayed fears by denying Head has sustained an injury and will indeed take his place in the XI in the Boxing Day Test in a week’s time. Head’s spell on the sideline did present an opportunity for Australia’s 13th man here in Brisbane, Under-19 World Cup champion Hugh Weibgen, who took the field in a baggy green cap despite not yet debuting in the seniors at domestic level. Andy Roberts – presumably not the West Indies’ fastbowling great – has emailed from FNQ. Hi Angus, Was a bit mystified at G. Lemon’s carry-on over Australia’s quick loss of wickets today. Surely it’s obvious that Pat has said, ‘Look boys, forget form or averages or anything like that. We need close to 100 runs as soon as possible so we have a chance to bowl these guys out. Swing for the fences and don’t worry if you hole out.’ No issues with the batting, it’s just an attempt to force a result rather than just submit to a draw. Still unlikely to get a win, but love that they went for it! Agree with the aggressive intent, Andy. But as per my last post, I think the freewheeling approach might backfire long term on those top-four batters who failed to push their claims in any way and only boosted the confidence – and averages – of India’s bowlers. Thanks for the email and for giving me an excuse to relive the other Andy’s awesome career via this evocatively narrated mini-doco… The light are on at the Gabba but too are the covers so let’s look back on what was a bizarre session of cricket. Australia came out swinging the bat and walked off shaking their heads as Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj and Akash Deep put them to the sword. If the home side’s intent was to get some much-needed confidence into their struggling top-order by granting a license to thrill, the tactic backfired. Khawaja (8), McSweeney (4), Labuschagne (1) and Marsh (2) were all struggling for form before this innings – none average more than 16 in the series – and single-figure scores won’t help them one bit. Serious questions must be asked about Khawaja and McSweeney at the top of the order. McSweeney has heart but looks to have serious technical deficiencies. Khawaja turns 37 today and hasn’t got going all series. Labuschagne added to his lowlight reel of ugly dismissals today with a wild slash at Bumrah and Mitch Marsh isn’t fit to bowl and isn’t hitting them consistently well enough to condone a spot in the XI with bat alone. Moreover, the form of NSW’s teenage tyro Sam Konstas continues to demand reward. Did you catch the 19-year-old’s scintillating debut in the Big Bash last night? Bad light has stopped play at the Gabba but it hasn’t stopped your emails. Adrian Goldman is a traditionalist. “Let’s return to the days of tests of unlimited length. Now that’s a serious contest! - no way to Bazball that.” Nice idea, Adrian but if timeless Tests came back, I reckon my wife – a long-suffering “cricket widow” – would file for divorce. = Bernhard Sayer from Hindmarsh Island reckons we have draws “so that we can say who’s won and who didn’t. If we start going into judges decisions, we legitimise ‘moral victories’. And I cannot support that.” Nor can I, BJ. Although Harry Brook – who famously claimed that a win in the final Ashes Test at The Oval (with England trailing 2-1 at the time) would equate to a “moral victory” in the series for England – may disagree with us. 3rd over: India 7-0 (Jaiswal 4, Rahul 3) The umpires had the light meters out before Starc rolled in for his first ball. But after that first 140kph delivery they’ve made the call that player safety is under threat so they have sent the players off. What a shame. This Test match just can’t take a trick. We will take an early tea instead. 2nd over: India 7-0 (Jaiswal 4, Rahul 3) Pat Cummins has the ball. Can he inspire something extraordinary? India need 270. Australia crave ten wickets in 53 overs. Clouds are gathering overhead as Jaiswal taps a single straight up. Rahul cops a peach from the Australian skipper which pitched on angled in on middle then straightened. KL watches a couple more then pounces on a full ball, pushing it for three past mid-off. We have a substitute fielder on: Hugh Weibgen, who captained Australia to Under-19 World Cup glory last summer, and was among the tournament’s top-five run-scorers. Hugh hasn’t played domestic cricket yet but he’s now in the middle of a Test and loving it! 1st over: India 3-0 (Jaiswal 3, Rahul 0) Jaiswal is taking strike to Starc. He’s taken guard on leg stump and is a full yard out of his crease. Starc can’t extend his record of wickets with his first delivery as Jaiswal leaves the first two before pushing to long-on for three. Starc slides one past Rahul’s groping bat to send a warning on the final ball. The lights are on at the Gabba, Australia are on the field and Pat Cummins and Steve Smith were straight in the ear of the umpire. Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul bump fists before setting up camp. Starc has the new ball. Fascinating 54 overs ahead. Here we go! There’s the declaration! Nathan Lyon was padded up to bat but it seems like Cummins feels 274 is a target too far in the 54 overs remaining today. Tantalising. The chase is on! What do ya reckon? Will India risk losing this Test for a chance at winning it? Or will they be happy with the psychological scarring inflicted with the ball and use this final session-and-a-half as batting practice? I know Geoff Lemon swore black and blue this Test would end in a draw but I still get the shivers at the run chase Rishabh Pant mounted at this ground the last time India toured. If you’ve got an opinion, a premonition or a weather prediction, do drop me a line at angus.fontaine.casual@theguardian.co.uk 18th over: Australia 89-7 (Carey 20, Starc 2) Cummins consulted Carey before walking off alone. No declaration yet, it seems. Starc strides out. He’s the archetypal ‘here for a good time not a long time’ batter so well suited to this sort of slugfest. He quickly clunks Bumrah down the ground but it catches the toe of the bat and runs for a single. Australia now lead by 274. Cummins holes out! India’s captain Rohit Sharma had seen enough. He called in Jasprit Bumrah to stop this madness and restore his side’s psychological advantage. Slower ball first up and Cummins took the bait and skied it. KL Rahul takes the catch. 17th over: Australia 85-6 (Carey 17, Cummins 22) Carey lashes at Siraj but miscues it and settles for a single. Cummins does better, flat batting it over mid-on for FOUR. The Australian captain is in a hurry. The next ball goes for SIX – his second in nine balls. 16th over: Australia 73-6 (Carey 16, Cummins 11) So Travis Head has left the building and he’s taken Geoff Lemon with him. Angus Fontaine here joining you as Pat Cummins tries to slog his first ball from Siraj all the way back to Penrith. After Carey’s single from the first, Cummins connects in a big way, driving Akash on the up for FOUR. He then goes on better, stepping back and clobbering a huge SIX over cow corner. A couple of singles makes it 13 from the over. 15th over: Australia 60-6 (Head 14, Cummins 0) Cummins at the crease, for goodness sake. With Carey. Gets through the last two balls of the Siraj over. Australia lead by 245, there are 59 overs remaining if the weather somehow allows. Stop emailing me about saying this would be a draw! It will still be a draw! India have done real damage to Australia today, though. This is embarrassing. It will cause many justifiable questions to be asked much more sternly. Time for me to go and breathe. Angus Fontaine is ready to take you through. And another one down, and another one down. Another one bites the dust. Pant is collecting catches in all sorts of ways today. He trousers another, this time a flapping top edge from Head that goes away towards third slip, and Pant trots underneath it. Australia are six down! SIX, Jeremy! 14th over: Australia 56-5 (Head 14, Carey 13) Runs still coming for Head and Carey. Leg byes, doubles, singles, and Carey finishes the over with another smoked cover drive from Akash Deep. A dozen from it! To come back to Mark’s question from earlier, about why do we have draws. I would say it’s because to earn a Test win, you have to actually beat a team, not just lead a team. If it was done on leading, nobody would declare, teams would bat to 900. But more importantly, spiritually I suppose, it’s a contest to completion. You mentioned boxing, this is like boxing that can only end by knockout. The draw retains interest, because it gives even an outmatched team something to play for. Otherwise, once they were behind, all interest and all hope would be gone. 13th over: Australia 44-5 (Head 13, Carey 6) Australia’s lead is 224, for those wondering. Make that 228! Siraj continues, and Carey rifles a cover drive. Shot. Gets off strike with a leg bye, and Head fiddles outside off, nearly nicking. Chatting with Siraj again as the bowler gets excited. 12th over: Australia 39-5 (Head 13, Carey 2) Travis Head doesn’t mind, just keeps on scoring. Throws the bat at a drive for two, a pull for one. Carey drives a couple, he likes to stay positive too. 11th over: Australia 33-5 (Head 9) Wicket last ball of the over. I repeat, only the draw is possible. Australia squeeze out a few more overs and India won’t have time to chase whatever the chase may be. It’s going to rain again, anyway. But my word, this is chaotic fun. What is going on with this Australian batting side? What is going on? Another one falls, Smith one ball after smashing Siraj over mid on for four, falls the same way he keeps falling. Closed off, glancing down the leg side, and doesn’t challenge the call when he’s given. The tiniest murmur on Snicko. 10th over: Australia 28-4 (Head 9, Smith 0) Marsh nearly got bowled earlier in the over, Akash Deep getting a ball to move in and stay low. Then nicks off. Now Smith comes out, his first time batting at six since 2014. “Geoff, do you think Australia are taking this seriously? Moving Marsh up, Khawaja smacking it around etc - are they just under instructions to have some fun?” Maybe, Neil, but they’re not having fun anymore. Oh my word, another one. Just a poke from Marsh, not a shot with any purpose behind it, outside the off stump with the ball doing a bit, and another nick through. 9th over: Australia 26-3 (Marsh 1, Head 8) Bumrah on fire, Australia shaking, so of course Travis Head comes in, smokes Bumrah through midwicket, then carves him through point. Two boundaries. Ok, Trav. “Only a draw possible now? Are you forgetting collapses?” asks John McDougall, linking me to a scorecard where Ivory Coast got bowled out for 7. Well, yes, but even if Australia are all out in short order, India won’t chase 250-plus in a session. 8th over: Australia 16-3 (Marsh 0, Head 0) Retract that statement about luck: after the wicket ball, Deep has Head chop the ball past his stumps, then clough it just short of mid off. Where is Smith? Trying a new role batting at six? If they wanted to give Marsh a hit they could just have told him to wait five minutes, at this rate. Another one down! This time it’s McSweeney with the awkward cut shot, and Akash Deep gets some of the luck he didn’t get in the first innings. Seam movement, under edge, caught. 7th over: Australia 16-2 (McSweeney 4, Marsh 0) Make that 20 wickets at 10.75 in the series for Bumrah. The rest of India’s bowlers have 22 between them. And for some reason Marsh has come out ahead of Head and Smith. There’s the other blow! The hammer falls, in the form of Bumrah. Can’t put that down to bowling genius, though. Bumrah does get extra bounce, but Labuschagne throws the bat once again. Got out cutting in Adelaide, cover driving first up here, and this time he hurls a cut shot at a line too close to his body. Top edge from the angled blade through to Pant. Gone for 1. 6th over: Australia 15-1 (McSweeney 4, Labuschagne 1) Off the mark, Labuschagne, as he gets a run from the inside half poking at Siraj. 5th over: Australia 14-1 (McSweeney 4, Labuschagne 0) In the series, 19 wickets at 11 for Bumrah! Gosh. McSweeney is trying to combat him by going on the walk, and nearly finds himself run out as Bumrah throws back at the stumps after gathering. Pant gives away a bye to let the Australians run an extra. 4th over: Australia 12-1 (McSweeney 3, Labuschagne 0) Siraj gets a much tidier over out of the way against McSweeney, one run from a defensive shot on the sixth ball. 3rd over: Australia 11-1 (McSweeney 2, Labuschagne 0) Scores of 8, 4, 13, 9 not out, and 8 for Khawaja in the series. Hmmmmm. A blow struck by India there. And the chance for another against Marnus, who defends the last two balls. That’s not a birthday present! Bumrah, around the wicket again. Khawaja, on the hop again. Prodding, reaching for the ball, it seams in a little and takes some bat on its way to the stumps. Huge cheer from the small Indian contingent here, echoing around the otherwise empty Gabba. Trouble for Usman! 2nd over: Australia 10-0 (McSweeney 2, Khawaja 8) Positive start from Khawaja. Goes after Siraj first ball, smacking a wider one behind point for four. Then gets forward and drives four more past the bowler! 1st over: Australia 2-0 (McSweeney 0, Khawaja 0) Third innings. Nothing but the draw possible now. Bumrah starts off, testing McSweeney already, moving the ball off the seam. Mac gets a couple of runs from a push behind point. Players are heading onto the field! We’re going to get play on time after the early lunch break. Occasional bursts of sunshine here in Brisbane. Still plenty of clouds about too. We’ll see who wins. Should be a resumption at some time, on current form. “Loving the OBO coverage even if we aren’t getting much cricket,” writes Mark Ferguson. “To stir the pot a little, why do we need draws in cricket? Boxing leaves it up to judges if there is no result within the allocated time, why couldn’t we do the same in cricket. Have the umpires (or independent judges) award each session and the team that “wins” the most sessions of an otherwise drawn match would be awarded the win. The “traditionalists” will hate it, and their tears are delicious. The Bazballers will love it because the team that drives the match forward will win in situations like this where a lot of time is lost to rain. Would love to hear your thoughts.” Interesting one! Let’s throw that to the crowd, see if we get any responses. I know mine, but I’ll share that a bit later. Well, the covers have come off. Umpires out there poking around. So maybe we’re a chance to get back on. Thanks for all the emails, been keeping me entertained while nothing is happening. Enjoyed this from Nick Campton on Bluesky: Me when there’s a rain delay in the city I live: Well, that’s unfortunate. Nothing you can do about it though. Hope the farmers are getting the rain, poor buggers Me when there’s a rain delay anywhere else: This is a moral failing of this city of heathens, God punishes us all for their wickedness Byron Ellis writes in. “Looking like we might be racing towards an anticlimax, following the final session heroics of Bumrah and Deep yesterday. Are they still displaying gambling ads at the ‘Gabba with all this rain? Is there a betting market on how many overs will be bowled before stumps? If not, they’re really missing opportunities to perpetuate social harms.” I’m sure all the agencies have been pumping out updates about the draw since day one… We’re going to have the lunch break from midday local time, which is five minutes from now. So we’ll see if any clean-up becomes possible 40 minutes after that. “Speaking of AI it generally fails most cricketing tests I’ve set,” says Matthew Saxon. “I couldn’t even get it to tell me Cummins’ highest Test score correctly. When told it was wrong it would come up with a new wrong answer which was even further from being correct. On being asked to review its methodology it agreed it was approaching it incorrectly. Then when asked the question again in this context it reverted to its first incorrect answer. Surely has to be some money on designing a UI for one that just admits when it doesn’t know. Would save some computing power! Have to admit though it does a good job correcting my PowerShell scripts.” That does sound very much like what I was talking about! The fact that people are now treating bots as search engines is causing a lot of misinformation spread. In terms of who might be departing the team soonest, I think that Starc has only got better in Test cricket the last few years, and is still only 34. He’ll be 35 at the end of the summer. So, could comfortably have another year or two and should play the Ashes next year. Hazlewood is a year younger, turning 34 in January, but has had many more injuries in recent years. Boland is 35 but hasn’t played much Test cricket so is probably fresher than others at that age. Cummins is only 31 and still has several years. Smith is 35, and has been well below his peak for a few years, so it’s a matter of whether something like his hundred in this match can give him a boost and get some bigger returns for the next year or two. Usman Khawaja has had the leanest run, top of 33 in his last 10 hits, but has still played some important hands as an opener in just surviving certain dangerous spells, shielding the next players in. He’s also the oldest, turning 38 today. (Happy birthday.) “In my non-AI assisted opinion (based on several years of practical research as a low grade “village” suburban cricketer) - here are my predictions for the conclusion of this sodden match,” writes Greg Wood. There is a 99% probability of beers being on ice in the Australian dressing rooms. There is approximately a 70% probability of those beers being consumed within the next three hours when the captains and umpires call this off. There is approximately a 50% probability of the Indian team being invited into the Australian rooms at some point this afternoon to share a couple of cold ones while watching rain fall. Elska Alexander writes in. “The Guardian OBO has been a wonderful way to ‘watch’ Test cricket while chasing inbox zero before the holidays here in rainy California. The Brisbane test has been incredibly frustrating for everyone (players, ground staff, fans - especially those who showed on up day 1). If it’s impossible to predict weather far enough ahead to schedule and impossible to have reserve days which tie up everyone, is it possible to get a roof over Test cricket stadiums? If not, why?” “There are a lot fewer Test matches than ODIs and T20s to begin with. Of the ones that happen, few elicit the level of excitement this series or the Ashes generate. If this tiny subset of test matches that are interesting is weather-affected, then where does Test cricket go? Roofing should be a reasonable solve - especially if the alternative is to refund 50-100K fans? And if tennis can afford it...” I think you’re right. The main issue is that cricket grounds are a) very big, so it’s more expensive than roofing rectangular football grounds or tennis centres, and b) old, so they already exist without roofing. Bearing in mind that cricket and Australian rules football use the same ovals and have the same dimensions, there is a roofed Aussie rules stadium in Melbourne (the Docklands one, not the MCG) and there will soon be a second roofed stadium in Hobart when they build the new one there. Docklands has hosted international cricket, and Macquarie Point probably will, with a clear roof to let sunlight through and keep rain and wind out. So yes, it can be done, it just costs a lot of money. And you can’t retrofit roofing, really, to stadiums that weren’t designed to have it. You pretty much have to rebuild or at least substantially remodel the whole ground. Which could happen in a Gabba redevelopment if they go ahead with one for the Olympics, or a new stadium over the river, but probably any state government will be trying to reduce costs rather than be ambitious. Still raining at the Gabba, if you were wondering. “Expanding on the selecting-players-with-dubious-fitness thing, I’m not sure why the selectors aren’t using injury as an opportunity to blood new players,” says Rowan Sweeney. “Before too long all of Usman, Smith, Lyon, Boland and Starc will all be retired, and without some forward planning, or extreme good fortune, the crunch will be real. It seems to me that bringing in a debutant to cover an injury is a great way to have, as you said earlier, a free hit. Who knows, giving players an opportunity to fully recover may even extend the careers of those players listed above...” Debutants during high-stakes series though still have to be good enough to perform. So you go for your next-best player, I think. Boland has earned the right to be the next in line by being so consistently good when selected. His age is less important than having enough reserve players, whatever their age. I think you’re right about there being a crunch coming, though. Hazlewood might not make it much longer with all these injuries. But when you’ve got great players who are still good enough, I think you largely have to keep picking them and take your chances somewhat with the next generation, who you develop as best you can the level down. “Thanks for the great coverage of this series,” writes in Ivor Shapiro. “So I asked ChatGPT4 what Australia’s tactics might likely be in this situation. The first response was vague so I pushed back and got a longer, well-argued response with Gabba-specific factors ending with the following summary.” If Australia starts their second innings with a lead of 180 runs, expect them to: • Bat for 2-2.5 hours or about 30-35 overs. • Score 120-150 runs aggressively. • Declare with a target lead of 300-330 runs. • Aim to bowl India out across 4.5 to 5 sessions. Hmmm. I’m not a GPT believer, Ivor. Aside from the main problems with LLMs that they’re environmentally destructive due to computing power and ethically bankrupt due to stealing all of the information they’re trained on, they just make too many errors if you ask them for actual facts. They can be useful if you provide your own information and ask for it to be assembled in a certain format, but people are using them to search for information and they can’t return it reliably. See the US pundits recently who used LLMs to search for prior examples of US presidents pardoning family members, then went on TV citing people who didn’t exist, like Woodrow Wilson’s imaginary brother in law Hunter de Butts. Yep. This version will have been able to scrape enough articles suggesting that teams like to set targets of 300-plus, so it’s thrown that in there. So far so good. But how is anyone supposed to bowl out a team in five sessions when there would only be two sessions available on day five? That exposes the limitations. AI is a misnomer given there’s no actual intelligence in the code. Plenty of rain incoming on the radar, by the way. We’re not looking good today. “Pretty obvious Mitch Marsh not fit enough to play as all-rounder,” writes Ross McGillivray. “Is his batting good enough to warrant selection? As every footy fan knows, playing guys with injuries in big games is fraught with danger. You can’t just jab a guy’s ankle every day in a five-day Test.” Can’t argue with the all-rounder bit, as discussed below. As for runs, I suspect Mitch Marsh is a player people are very fast to lose faith in. He was vital last summer, made big runs in all three Pakistan Tests, and Australia would have lost two of them without him. Then he made an important 40 in Wellington when the team was sinking, and a match-winning 80 in Christchurch that set up Carey to pull off that tough chase. So I think he still has credits, made some runs second dig in Perth this year when Australia were stuffed, and he’s only batted once in Adelaide and once in Brisbane since. Reckon he does still command his place for runs alone, but needs some more pretty soon. It’ll be hard to keep Cameron Green out once he’s fit again. An email from Tim Thomas: “Given the increasing unpredictability in weather patterns, is it time Test cricket took a page from the surfing world and extended the window for play. Playing 5 days of 7 or 10 with the option for some being called off due to rain or heat, seems like a nice way to ensure a result. Broadcasters and sponsors may never go for it but given how the rest of the week is looking in Brisbane, I think it’d be ideal.” The issue, Tim, is that administrators are going the other way, wanting to squeeze Tests down to four days. More predictable, easier to schedule. Extended periods would never work because there are costs to having staff and stadiums on standby and those costs increase every day, whereas broadcast revenue for a Test match is a one-off fee for the match, no matter how long it goes. So every extra day is more expenditure against no increase in income, aside from gate receipts which would negligible by day six or more. The modern schedule is already so crowded that they barely squeeze in two-Test series most of the time, much less series where matches were unpredictably a week or more. So, I like the idea (bring back the timeless Test) but it would be impossible. The WTC final has one reserve day if required, and that’s as far as we’ll get. “What do you do in the third innings?” asks Ruth Purdue by email. “Block Bumrah and smack the other bowler and see where you get to, or block out the day? Make a game of it with risk of losing?” I think if Australia had four bowlers they’d be much more inclined to do this. Marsh clearly isn’t reliably fit, despite their protestations, given they used him for two overs with Hazlewood missing. I don’t think they’d want to bowl much more than 50 overs given the workload for Starc and Cummins ahead of Melbourne. But then, Test cricket is tough and you never know when you’ll next be in a winning position. I think it’s worth going for it today, because surely on a fifth-day pitch with rain about they’re a chance to take a few Indian wickets early as they have done in all but one innings this series. Of course, all that said, we’re currently losing overs again because of weather. So perhaps there’s no point and they might as well save their bowlers and use the day as a batting net. I’ll tell you who this day’s play does matter to, once they get on. Usman Khawaja. Nathan McSweeney. Marnus Labuschagne. They all need to work their way into this series, Labuschagne’s fifty in Adelaide notwithstanding. They’re on a hiding to nothing, really, if they have to bat against Bumrah on a dark humid day with little to gain, but they have to treat it as a chance to put together a good innings without much riding on it. A free hit. Here’s a new one. We have a lightning delay. Everybody is leaving the ground, even the ground staff and the camera operators. A big dark thunderhead is cruising by like a container ship. Ten minutes for Australia to get ready to bat. Then 92 overs left in the day, rain permitting. Cummins wants to spare his quicks, turns to a part-timer, and Head delivers immediately. Not from the slap through wide long off that yields two, but the defensive shot that drags Akash Deep’s back foot out of his crease, where the boot lodges on the line trying to get back. Some dip from Head that created that. Good bowling, but a quality innings from Deep. 78th over: India 258-9 (Bumrah 10, Deep 29) Lyon another over, they review for a bat-pad catch but there’s no contact. 77th over: India 257-9 (Bumrah 10, Deep 27) So there are 98 overs scheduled for the day, plus the one ball from Cummins (that over counts as part of yesterday). Two overs for a change of innings, if that doesn’t happen at lunch or tea, so two potential changes of innings from here means four overs. Take the total down to 94 overs. Every over India faces here is one less available to Australia for batting, or one less that India might have to face later. Cummins bowls a snorter, moving off the seam. Bumrah fumbles at them, after Deep rotates strike with a push to point. 76th over: India 256-9 (Bumrah 10, Deep 27) Nathan Lyon rather than Mitchell Starc to start the day. I’d be getting Starc to fire down a yorker. Bumrah essays a sweep that misses the bat, but takes his arm, fine of leg slip for four leg byes. Runs be runs. 75th over: India 252-9 (Bumrah 10, Deep 27) Of course, Cummins only gets one ball, because they came off last night for bad light with five balls bowled of his over. Deep runs it into the cordon along the ground. Here come Jasprit Bumrah and Akash Deep with the chance to do a little more thorning in Australian siding. And Pat Cummins with a chance at a five-for. Here’s my wrap about how much fun it was yesterday. Hello world. A fun fourth day despite the rain, as India saved the follow-on in dramatic and at times humorous circumstances. Who doesn’t love a last-wicket partnership against the odds? That partnership is unbroken, so Australia still have a wicket to get on this fifth morning, at which point there are three possibilities. One big, two remote. Australia have to bat again regardless (or declare without batting). So they’ll probably just have a net and then have a little speculative bowl at India late in the day, given they’re down to three bowlers. Or Australia could smash a hundred or so runs as fast as possible and put the target above 300 and beyond India, and try to bowl them out. Or Australia could fall in a heap, thus setting India a target below 300, and India could have a shot at chasing it. Probably more likely than that, it keeps raining sporadically and we get a wet draw. One of the above, anyway. Or something even more boutique. Shall we?"

          "headline": "House of Commons should consider electronic voting, MPs say in letter",
          "bodyText": "The Commons should consider a move to electronic voting, a group of more than 60 backbenchers have said, with the current system of filing physically through voting lobbies taking up to a fifth of their working day. Of the 62 signatories to the joint letter to Lucy Powell, the leader of the Commons, 39 are Labour MPs who were elected this year, a sign of the impatience among some sections of the new intake at what they view as parliament’s arcane working practices. The letter was also signed by more established Labour backbenchers, including Stella Creasy, John Trickett and Sharon Hodgson, as well as the SDLP’s Claire Hanna and two former Labour MPs who now sit as independents, Rosie Duffield and Zarah Sultana. The letter, sent to Powell in her role as chair of the Commons’ cross-party modernisation committee, said that under the system in place even a single vote uses 162 combined hours if every MP takes part. “Spending 15 minutes corralling every MP through two corridors to say aye or no can regularly account for 20% of our working day,” the letter said. “With complicated or contested legislation that has multiple votes hours disappear. “All other work pauses when the division bell is called – delaying select committees, Westminster Hall debates, meetings and necessitating MPs to second guess when they need to be on the estate to the detriment of their ability to progress work elsewhere, including in their constituency.” Another knock-on effect, the letter argues, is on the number of votes, as there is pressure to limit how many take place to save time. “Requiring MPs to attend in person to troop around lobbies adds little to our debates – with parliamentary TV enabling all MPs to listen to a debate virtually, time walking repeatedly in a circle and travelling to be in the lobbies could be better used to serve our constituents,” the letter said. It calls on the modernisation committee, set up in September with a remit to examine parliament’s working practices, as well as its culture and standards, to look into the idea of electronic voting – including the idea of allowing MPs to vote from other locations. “The benefits would also reach well beyond the chamber,” the letter argued, noting that many legislatures already use such systems. “Remote electronic voting could also help MPs balance their work commitments with caring responsibilities and provide greater flexibility for colleagues with disabilities or health conditions.” The change should form part of wider reforms, including for parliament to “better align its hours with the normal working day”, the letter said, adding: “The moment has come to prioritise time management over tradition.” Discussing voting systems in the Commons, Creasy said: “MPs spend hours of the day literally going round in circles because unlike other parliaments we don’t use electronic voting methods to speed up the counting process. “This is a call for the modernisation committee to look at how we can be more efficient with our time so we can have more time to work with colleagues and ministers on legislation in the first place.” The modernisation committee has just completed a call for evidence on ways to improve parliament. While many more MPs are likely to share the views in the letter, some advocate physical votes as a way to see ministers and lobby them in person – while whips tend to view the current system as less likely to tempt MPs to rebel."

          "headline": "Noa-Lynn van Leuven blazes trail and feels the love at Alexandra Palace",
          "bodyText": "From every corner of the West Hall, from the stands to the table seats, came a ringing of boos. Up on the stage Noa-Lynn van Leuven held her head high. Tried to maintain her focus amid the cacophony of derision and disdain being flung her way by the crowd. Now, before your favourite patriotic news outlet gets too excited, this was no act of protest, or prejudice, or cruelty. Van Leuven was simply paying the public penalty that awaits all players when they start a leg with two 180s and then miss the seventh dart of an attempted nine-dart finish. Just a normal thing that happens all the time, and is really no big deal. As, in a way, is Van Leuven’s very presence at Alexandra Palace this year. And taken out of context, the sight of the world No 144 losing to the world No 51, Kevin Doets, in the first round would scarcely merit much comment outside of the Netherlands, from where both players hail. But then, you have the context. That context being death threats on a daily basis. Vicious messages on social media. Even now, the Professional Darts Corporation has to switch off comments every time it posts about her on X. But the 28-year-old from Heemskerk has long since accustomed herself to the savage gaze. Long since learned to shut out the noise, take solace in the simplicity and the sincerity of three darts and a target. “It’s just a great game,” she said in the wake of her defeat. “I love the game. I just want to play darts. And anyone who’s being terrible about me, it says more about them.” Van Leuven will not stop. This has been a breakthrough year for her, a year of prodigious improvement, with landmark victories against men on the Challenge Tour added to multiple wins in the Women’s Series, a debut Grand Slam appearance, and here the scent of an almighty shock. She took the first set, and would have averaged over 90 but for a farcical leg in the second. Doets eventually clinched it in 33 darts after a fiesta of missed doubles, and it proved a pivotal moment in the match. From potentially throwing for a 2-0 lead, Doets swept to a 3-1 win and a second-round meeting with Michael Smith. As for Van Leuven, she will go to Q-School next month in an attempt to win a professional tour card for the first time. “I stopped playing darts for a few years because I was unhappy with myself,” Van Leuven said. “Kevin continued playing darts. He got to the Pro Tour. He’s got so much more experience than I do. I guess that that’s what made the difference this game.” But from every corner of the West Hall, from the stands to the table seats, the crowd warmed to her. They roared her on to the stage, roared the 180s, roared her off the stage again. “To be fair, I was expecting a lot of bad behaviour from the crowd today,” Doets said. “But I don’t think I heard a single boo for her. I like that.” And it has been from within darts that Van Leuven has found some of her strongest support. Fellow players such as Fallon Sherrock, Luke Humphries and Michael van Gerwen have stood up for her. Non-darts people – with a faint veneer of snobbery – often find this solidarity surprising. But then this has always been a sport where everyone is welcome. Where it doesn’t matter where you come from, who you are, or who you were. All that matters is the three darts in your hand, and the magic bottled up in them. Sherrock knows that better than anyone, having so memorably reached the last 32 here on her debut appearance five years ago, before going to the quarter-finals of the Grand Slam in 2021. But the magic is summoned a little more rarely these days. On her fifth appearance in the Palace, she was beaten 3-2 by Ryan Meikle in a scruffy game. The left-handed Meikle will become Luke Littler’s first opponent at this tournament, and unless he shows significant improvement his chances are slim to nil. We also got the biggest shock of the tournament so far, as the World Grand Prix champion, Mike De Decker, was bundled out by Luke Woodhouse. De Decker has been on a stunning autumn streak and might have expected a shot at the Premier League next year. That feels a more remote prospect now after a meek performance under the bright lights, even if Woodhouse – a reliable performer at Pro Tour level – was one of the toughest draws he could have got first up. In the final game of the evening, Peter Wright sneaked through a bruising encounter against the hotly tipped Wesley Plaisier to set up a third-round tie against the in-form Jermaine Wattimena. Plaisier missed eight darts to win the second set, two to win the fourth, 20 in total, outscored Wright in the averages by four points. That said: the last time Wright survived an early scare like this, back in 2020, he won the tournament."

          "bodyText": "A previously unidentified disease circulating in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is a severe form of malaria, the country’s health ministry has said. Earlier this month, local authorities said the disease had killed 143 people in the south-west Kwango province in November. The symptoms of the disease are fever, headache, cough, runny nose and body aches. “The mystery has finally been solved. It’s a case of severe malaria in the form of a respiratory illness,” the health ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, adding that malnutrition in the area had weakened the local population, leaving them more vulnerable to disease. The statement said 592 cases had been reported since October, with a fatality rate of 6.2%. Reports of an unknown disease had sparked alarm, and prompted the World Health Organization (WHO) to send a team of investigators to the remote part of the DRC. However, officials had stressed there were high levels of food insecurity and malnutrition in the area that were likely to exacerbate the impact of known illnesses, including malaria. The WHO also pointed to “low vaccination coverage and very limited access to diagnostics and quality case management”. Malaria still kills almost 600,000 people a year globally, and 12% of those deaths occur in the DRC. The provincial health minister, Apollinaire Yumba, told Reuters that anti-malaria medicine provided by the WHO was being distributed in the main hospital and health centres in the Panzi health zone. A WHO spokesperson said more health kits for moderate and critical cases were due to arrive on Wednesday. The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said last week that 10 early samples from patients in DRC suffering from a mystery illness had tested positive for malaria, but that he had not ruled out the possibility that they had other concurrent diseases."

          "bodyText": "It is perhaps poetic that throughout this year, the 30th anniversary of the PlayStation, developers have found such a rich vein of horror in early 3D visuals. Crow Country, Fear the Spotlight and now Mouthwashing all make terrifying use of low-poly characters, smeared textures and muted colour palettes to generate dread and abjection – and in this sci-fi odyssey from Wrong Organ they’re also brilliantly utilised to symbolise complete psychological breakdown. The setup to Mouthwashing is simple and familiar: when a hulking spacecraft crashes in a remote part of the galaxy, the small crew slowly goes insane waiting for a rescue that is never going to come. Not helping matters is their cargo: millions of gallons of high-alcohol mouthwash – which very quickly gets abused by the desperate and deeply flawed castaways. With the captain gravely injured, you play mostly as second in command Jimmy as he takes over the survival efforts. But you soon discover everyone has something to hide, from paranoid medic Anya to bullish mechanic Swansea. Everything on the ship is given a sinister edge from the disgusting food-processing equipment to the huge LED displays continually showing images of romantic sunsets and fluffy clouds. What sounds like a tense thriller, however, is in fact a surreal exploration of social and mental deterioration. Characters hallucinate wildly, the narrative chops from before the crash to after it, swapping between the two in a dizzying chronological dance; the ship itself seems to mutate in response to the paranoid delusions of its inhabitants; the weird vaporwave soundtrack hums and blasts in discordant rushes. There are elements of Event Horizon, Solaris and High Life in the interplay of human and technological breakdown; the way the ship’s U-boat-like corridors expand and contract like intestinal passageways; the way the crew’s psychoses are reflected back at them in smashed screens and ruined control panels. It is grim, fascinating stuff. There are puzzles to solve and items to collect and combine, but nothing works as it should and the game continually plays with and questions your assumptions. It may remind some players of the cult hit Clickolding in the way it asks questions about player culpability and complicity – the things it wants you to do with the only weapons on board, the way it makes you hold the Captain’s mouth open to feed him painkillers as he moans and cries – although the visuals are nostalgic, your connection with what is happening on that ship is very real and very alive. There are serious messages too about guilt, grief and alcoholism which may land heavily with people who have been affected by these things. Mouthwashing is a difficult but engrossing experience, a work of surreal horror invoking the cinema of David Lynch and Dario Argento, but also extremely functional as a game, or at least a study of what games are and what they want us to do. That titles like this are still being made and have global distribution is one of the few bright spots in a depressing year for the games business. Book yourself in for a flight as soon as possible, you will and won’t regret it. • Mouthwashing is available now, £10.99"

          "bodyText": "It was a September night in 2020 when the fire torched the Red Mountain Travel Plaza. Residents of the Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone nation watched as the only gas station and grocery store for miles around vanished amid towering orange flames and acrid smoke. The convenience store was where the approximately 250 residents went to buy snacks, tobacco and essentials. Without it, they would have to drive more than an hour for major provisions. What’s more, a safe stashed in the back room of the store that tribal officials said held nearly $19,000 in cash allegedly burned up. These were a portion of the profits from a cannabis farm down the road – 20 acres of land that were the subject of much anger and anxiety on the reservation – and the tribe was counting on them. One tribal official alleged that law enforcement from outside the tribe suspected arson, but no one was charged. Many people in the community suspected that someone had set fire to the gas station so they could make off with the cash. That was never proved. For most at Fort McDermitt, the damage was emblematic of something more troubling: a mismanaged venture that never realized its promise. “We need to recover what we lost here,” said Jerry Tom, an elder of the tribe, whose relentless search for answers came to a head this year. “Nothing good has come of the cannabis business.” *** The Northern Paiute-Shoshone-Bannock people from Fort McDermitt call themselves Atsakudokwa Tuviwa ga yu, or People of the Red Mountain. Their territory, which straddles Nevada and Oregon, lies among wide expanses of sage brush, with the nearest town, Winnemucca, 74 miles (119km) away. Driving up Route 95 from Reno, a person can go for hours without seeing another car. The road passes several landmarks important to the tribe, including a peak that served as a lookout when fighting army cavalry in the 1860s. Bitterness still burns about the exploitation of lands once governed by Indigenous people. Tucked away in the high desert, the reservation offers little in the way of work. The lucky few have ranches, or work at the Say When Casino down the road, the tribal government or school. Many trek three hours to Boise, Idaho, or further to work in mines. Over the past decade, public attitudes and state laws around cannabis have relaxed, resulting in a booming legal weed market worth an estimated $35bn nationally. In theory, the US’s 574 federally recognized tribes have much to gain from it. In total, they retain about 56m acres of land in federal trust on which to grow, in addition to reservation lands. Being sovereign nations, they can largely use the land however they want, unimpeded by federal prohibitions on growing and selling marijuana. For Fort McDermitt in particular, profits from weed could translate into badly needed jobs and money for schooling and infrastructure. But cannabis is a risky business. Bad weather can ruin crops. It can take years to turn a profit. Due to the federal ban on weed, national agencies do not regulate Indigenous marijuana enterprises as they would casinos, leaving supervision to the Native nations, which often face limited resources and restrictions on jurisdiction. (Fort McDermitt, for instance, does not have its own police force, so it must rely on the county sheriff and Bureau of Indian Affairs officers stationed an hour or more away.) Tribes generally can’t get bank loans from big banks for the ventures and are not familiar with cannabis cultivation, so they have to bring in outside experts and investors. All of this and the cash-based nature of the business can make Indian Country vulnerable to deals that go wrong. That’s exactly what happened when three white men from Oregon – Kevin Clock, Eli Parris and Darian Stanford – and their Native American collaborators sought to make money from Indigenous land. By the time they cleared out, seven years later, more than a gas station had gone up in smoke. *** It was 2015, and the private investor Kevin Clock was looking for a win. He and his friend Joe DeLaRosa had recently visited Vancouver, Washington, to check out a popular weed dispensary, and he’d had his eye on cannabis ever since. “We realized it was a money maker,” said Clock, whose background was in “development and land use and things”, in an initial interview this spring. (He then declined to answer further questions about the operation.) That got him thinking about Nevada, where an initiative to legalize recreational weed was to be voted on the following year, and specifically Native nations, where he thought cannabis retail stores and farms could find success. Clock, a boisterous character with a knack for working a crowd, believed he could connect with Indigenous communities because he had attended high school with Siletz people in Oregon and had married a Native Hawaiian. “It’s a similar culture,” he said. To help oversee future operations, Clock roped in Eli Parris, a quiet outdoorsman from Oregon with a background in real estate and finance who grew weed privately. To facilitate Indigenous outreach, Clock counted on DeLaRosa, the then tribal chair of the Burns Paiute of Oregon. DeLaRosa, who had previously worked as the financial manager in a car dealership, couldn’t convince his own community to open a weed operation, but the team thought he could persuade sister tribes to create a “Paiute pipeline”, whereby some nations would grow cannabis and others would sell it. In January 2016, the group contacted the leaders of the Fort McDermitt Tribal Council, which governs the reservation, to propose developing a marijuana farm on tribal lands. Clock and his associates promised to bring in the necessary funding to get the operation off the ground. They said the farm would be 100% owned by the tribe and that the venture could create much-needed jobs and generate money to improve roads, housing, education and health for years to come. The project could also serve as an anchor for other businesses in this remote area. Hearings were called on the reservation to present the proposal to the community. Cars filled the parking lot and people crowded into the building. Several tribal members who were present recalled promises that the farm would enrich the tribe. Some interpreted that to mean that they would each get a per capita share of the profits, one way revenues from tribal casinos are distributed. But some residents had concerns about whether it was legal to lease land to the cannabis operation. Many of the older residents feared that introducing a marijuana business would worsen substance abuse problems already plaguing the community. Others found Clock pushy. “They came in and painted a pretty picture and promised the tribe this and that,” said Arlo Crutcher, a local rancher who attended the public meetings (and who became the tribal council chair a few years later). “I said, ‘This doesn’t sound too good.’” He felt the men dodged questions about operational matters and didn’t allow time for tribal officials to seriously consider the offer. Crutcher thought others in the community were too trusting of the men’s pitch. He noted that his tribe lacked the business savvy of richer nations with longstanding businesses. Fort McDermitt had never had an enterprise of this scale. “The investors knew they were dealing with gullible persons, and they took advantage of that.” Still, representatives from Fort McDermitt reached an agreement with Clock’s team in November 2016, heavily pushed by Tildon Smart, who soon became the tribal council chair. They established a 10-year partnership that would first pay Clock’s company back any investments and then would give it 50% of revenue, an unusually large cut for businessmen not from the tribe. Like other tribal nations in Nevada, Fort McDermitt was to collect a cannabis sales tax to fund essential services in the community. The outsiders would take care of all the financing and operations. Soon after, Clock brought in Darian Stanford, a litigator who had worked as a deputy district attorney prosecuting gang violence and major felonies in Oregon, to help with legal matters. Attorneys from a law firm where Stanford eventually worked were retained at $400 an hour, and a five-member cannabis commission was set up by the tribal council and tasked with oversight of the operation to ensure things remained above board. The commission was supposed to be accountable to the nation’s ultimate authority: the tribal council. In an unusual move, Parris, an outsider, as well as two members from the tribal council, were on the cannabis commission, placing them in a position of supervising their own efforts. According to Mary Jane Oatman, of the Nez Perce Tribe, who helms the Indigenous Cannabis Industry Association, that should have raised a red flag immediately. “There was no system of checks and balances,” said Oatman, whose advocacy group guides tribes navigating the legal weed realm. “They have members of the tribal council taking off their hats and then putting on the hat of the cannabis commission. They should have had an accountability system.” (Smart and Stanford defended the practice, saying it allowed for the easy flow of information between the council and commission.) Stanford also became the tribe’s judge a couple of years later, putting him at the center of legal disputes in the community; he recused himself from matters related to the business. Around 2018, the newly created joint venture – Quinn River Farms, named for the ribbon of water that flows through Fort McDermitt – was hard at work, purchasing soil and farm equipment, leveling land, installing greenhouses and readying a building for storing and processing the harvests. Although Clock and his associates never became fixtures in the community, Parris frequently checked in on the site. They brought in a foreman and hired dozens of tribal members who learned how to cultivate plants, cut buds and make pre-rolls. They were often paid in cash, a common industry practice but one that makes it hard to keep track of costs. This was the vision: an emerald sea of towering marijuana plants that would change lives, with goods sold to another Paiute tribe and businesses in Las Vegas, where new weed lounges and dispensaries were expected to open. Over the course of its operation, investors would pour in millions, in the hopes that it would be so successful that it could set a standard across Nevada and for other tribes. *** The outsiders moved quickly to realize that vision. The deal stipulated that a new LLC set up by Clock and his partners would act as general manager and contract with consultants on behalf of Quinn River Farms, always in coordination with the tribe. To that end, Clock’s LLC brought in Ranson Shepherd, a jiujitsu instructor originally from Hawaii who had been a part of other successful cannabis enterprises. He took over management and sales for the operation. But Billy Bell, a member of the tribe’s cannabis commission, said in a memo that he later wrote to the tribe’s lawyer that he was concerned about incomplete paperwork. (Bell declined to comment for this story.) He said he had seen one version of the agreement with Shepherd where the signatory line for the tribe, oddly, bore the name of Parris, the only outsider on the commission. The tribe was supposed to be an equal partner in the venture. Bell, however, felt it had been sidelined completely. Clock’s LLC and Shepherd “left the Tribe out of important and crucial business decision-making decisions over the cannabis project”, Bell said in his memo. Tildon Smart, the tribal chair and cannabis commission member, was perturbed as well. Promises of additional equipment were going unmet, he added. “[Clock] promised us greenhouses within so many months and that never happened,” he said. (Clock did not respond to request for comment about this and other allegations.) In a memo after one of the first harvests, Smart emailed Clock and Shepherd’s teams to share his frustrations that “everyone was doing their own thing”, and that the tribe was being “ignored” and “no longer considered partners in this project”. Elders in the community also grew suspicious, Jerry Tom among them. After being away for years working in gold mines, Tom had recently returned home to Fort McDermitt, and he was disturbed to see that while the farm had started to grow cannabis, he and other members of the tribe knew little about exactly how much money the operation made or spent. He wondered when, if ever, they could expect to see per capita payments from the venture. “Nothing was disclosed to the tribal members,” Tom said. “No one knows anything about it.” Crutcher, the rancher, concurred: “We had no clue how they were operating.” Unease over the project intensified when the 2019 harvest went poorly. The project’s leaders blamed a hard freeze for hurting crops, and therefore sales. The tribe received about $100,000 from the 2018 harvest, and at least $25,000 from 2019, but did not know if it was owed more. Bell said he feared the operation was generating more debts than revenue. Tribal members wondered about the box trucks that were leaving the farm at night and where they were going. Fort McDermitt residents saw half a dozen shipping out at a time. All transactions were done in cash, due to the difficulty of banking in the cannabis industry. Crutcher said he had seen members of the cannabis commission, investors and tribal council members bring piles of money to an administration building on the reservation to be counted. Concerns about the cannabis operation cost Smart, the tribal chair, his re-election in November 2019. His successor was eventually replaced, this time by Crutcher. During this time, Clock referred tribal members’ many questions to Shepherd, who didn’t produce detailed financial statements or invoices, according to Bell’s memo. Then in September 2020, the travel plaza burned down with the alleged $19,000 in profits inside. An internal investigation handled by Smart, now a tribal administrator, never produced definitive answers. In an interview, Smart said he had moved the cash from the tribal administration building to the gas station before the fire to keep it out of the hands of incoming tribal council members. He denied accusations by some tribal members that he took the money for himself and said it had burned in the blaze. *** With the travel plaza left in ruins, relations between the outsiders and the community went from bad to worse. In October 2021, looking to boost the business, Clock and the team brought in more investors and signed a deal to cultivate more acres. According to documents shared with Bell, the existing investors had run up more than $5m in expenses, including $63,258.85 in flights as well as interest on loans from other companies, equipment, salaries and shipping. Under this latest agreement, the new investors – a joint venture involving Shepherd and a company called Cannabis Life Sciences (CLS) – would pour another $6m into Quinn River. Shepherd had also teamed up with CLS to produce pre-rolls projected to bring in $600,000 in monthly revenue. Tribal officials were concerned that these partnerships were moving too quickly, and that deals were being negotiated without their input. Each new investor represented a hit to the tribe’s overall revenue share, steadily decreasing what the tribe expected to earn. Then jobs for local residents on the farm began to disappear, even though Clock’s group had told the tribal council that harvests had rebounded. The number of Native employees dropped and workers from outside the reservation began to appear. Even fewer cannabis crops were planted in 2022 than the year before, according to Bell’s memo. When he visited the fields that summer, a few plots lay empty. The foreman later told him that the plants eventually put in the ground might not flower due to a late start. Sales sank and workers began dismantling equipment and hauling it out. “They just packed up and left,” Crutcher said. The only public information about Quinn River’s finances, beyond what Bell and other tribal administrators could gather, is in SEC filings by CLS. One shows a loss of more than $100,000 from the business for the year ending 21 May 2022. That was the last time Quinn River sold any cannabis. CLS reported even greater losses for the year ending May 2023 and pulled out of the deal, saying the venture Shepherd was involved with had defaulted on its $3m contribution. The remaining workers were laid off. CLS declined several requests for comment. In an interview, Shepherd denied that he had defaulted, adding that his venture didn’t owe $3m, as he had already invested in the necessary infrastructure. “Why would you invest into something that you already built?” Fed up, the tribe enlisted its lawyer to contact Clock and Parris. “The Tribe needs detailed financial reports of the expenses and income to the business, not simply summaries,” the lawyer wrote. “The tribe needs to know when the expenses incurred have been paid off so that the profits can be determined.” Clock’s original group of investors – himself, Parris, Stanford and DeLaRosa – were allegedly not able to produce the requested documents. Parris said they repeatedly – and unsuccessfully – asked Shepherd for sales records, bank statements and profit and loss statements. “We never saw any paperwork.” Shepherd disagreed, saying he had handed over all the necessary documents. “We provided all documentation,” he said. Crutcher said the lawyer advised the nation to walk away from the project. “It’s expensive to go after them. So we called it quits.” (The lawyer declined to comment.) Stanford confirmed that Clock’s group had agreed to terminate the contract and blamed Ranson Shepherd for the lack of financial reporting. “I 1,000% fault Ranson for not providing the financial documents that were requested,” he said. “But I think it’s sloppy, not malicious.” The original investors’ fault lay “in not ensuring that Ranson did whatever Ranson was supposed to do”, Stanford said. In the final tally, the cash Clock’s group handed to Fort McDermitt, from 2018 harvest revenues through to April 2022, totaled $564,450, according to a statement Bell provided to the commission. Current and recent tribal leaders don’t know how this sum was calculated, what percentage of profits it entails or whether they were owed more. Whatever the sum, it was far less than they expected to earn. Under Fort McDermitt law, 4% of the profits from the cannabis business were destined for per capita payments. While the amount per person would have been minimal, Fort McDermitt citizens said they have received nothing at all. Stanford said the nation received quarterly payments and that his and Clock’s company had not made any money. “If you ask me today how much money was made at McDermitt I have no idea. I never saw a penny.” Parris concurred, saying any money the outsiders were entitled to was given to the tribe. The project generated cash to buy a fire truck and bury elders, he said. “They could have made a lot more and they should have made a lot more, but they made money,” he said. “We left the place better in McDermitt than when we got there. I can 100% sleep on that for the rest of my life.” DeLaRosa characterized the project as “successful”. He said that members of the group invested “thousands of dollars of their personal funds” to get the project up and running and never made “a single dollar”. Shepherd also maintains that the tribe was properly compensated despite his being in the red himself. He is facing a lawsuit by an investor named Ting He, who alleged that he failed to pay her back $3m, loaned in May 2021. According to the lawsuit, Shepherd said the money would be used to build greenhouses and water wells and help cultivate the cannabis fields at Fort McDermitt. In return, she would also get a cut of the harvest’s profits. The lawsuit alleges fraud and the misappropriation of funds, among other charges, and claims that Shepherd provided He with a list of bogus “expenses” incurred by a company he controls. A Nevada district court lists the suit as active, as He’s legal team has been unable to serve Shepherd with a summons and complaint, arguing that he was “no longer responding” to calls or texts or answering the door – even with cars parked in his driveway. No one in Clock’s original group was named in the suit. Asked for comment, Shepherd said: “I can’t speak on that until it’s complete.” Parris said the group had thoroughly vetted Shepherd ahead of time. When asked if he and the others could have provided oversight, he said: “If somebody signs up to do something and they just don’t do it, what can you do outside of sue them, right?” *** Jerry Tom won’t let the matter rest, not with so many loose ends. He served on the tribal council in 2019, and from then on collected whatever documents he could related to Quinn River Farms: photos, texts, Facebook messages, videos, contracts, memos, minutes of meetings, legal correspondence and more. The foot-high dossier includes overlapping agreements, some with no signatures. Cashflow statements lack invoices or balance sheets to back them up. An item listing leases for $17,000 doesn’t say who was leasing what. Two promissory notes of $600,000 were written to companies some tribal officials were unfamiliar with. “We have no idea if loans were paid on time or even at all, or who approved them,” Tom said. Without proper invoices, the tribe lacks a clear or complete picture of the project’s finances. Tom said that the tribal council and the cannabis commission failed to adequately oversee the project and share information with the community. Their meetings regarding the project were largely closed to the public, and minutes were unavailable. Tom serves on the elders committee, entrusted with protecting the cultural integrity of the tribe. In March 2024, he and other elders summoned the community to a gathering to discuss the cannabis debacle. Outside the meeting hall, a red painted sign declared: “KEEP YOUR ABORIGINAL RIGHTS!!” About 50 people filed in for a potluck supper before getting down to business. The older women chatted in Numu Yadooana, the Northern Paiute language, as they ate rabbit stew and beans. Tom served his signature pear and pumpkin pies. The five members of the committee, seated at a long table up front, called the gathering to order. “We didn’t see any documents, it was a hush-hush deal,” said Larina Bell, the incoming tribal chair. “They shared nothing with me,” said Valerie Barr, the tribe’s finance director. “I asked for an audit. The tribe has been left out, completely.” Speaker after speaker expressed anger, a feeling of being tricked, preyed upon by the outsiders. “Where is the money?” people repeatedly asked. They wanted to know why the tribe had made so little on the venture, and the status of per capita payments. The session continued for hours. Afterwards, as people stacked chairs and cleared paper plates, Tom called the meeting a “catharsis”. This was the first time the community had come together to process. “It was a trauma for our people. We have to get to the bottom of it.” *** The controversies kept piling up. Unbeknown to the people of Fort McDermitt, Clock’s group was working with four other Nevada tribes on cannabis ventures through a constellation of LLCs around the same time Quinn River took in its first harvest. Tribal representatives and Indigenous leaders who did business with them described the men’s process as cultivating a relationship with someone prominent in the tribe and keeping other officials at arm’s length. Between 2019 and 2023, nearly all of these ventures faced pushback. The Las Vegas Paiute left the partnership, according to the tribe’s general counsel. The partnership’s dissolution was hashed out privately, according to industry sources. The Pyramid Lake Paiute shut down their grow in 2019 after just a few months and pursued the outsiders in tribal court, according to minutes of the tribal council. A construction contractor filed a $2.3m mechanics lien against Clock’s group for alleged non-payment. Controversy still swirls around the Newe dispensary, opened in 2020 with the Elko, one of the four bands of the Te-Moak of the Western Shoshone. A former tribal chair of Elko, Felix Ike, complained of a lack of transparency around the decision to open the dispensary and a lack of proper law enforcement, according to reporting in the Elko Daily. He and others tried, unsuccessfully, to get it shut down. Clock denied there had been issues with these tribes. He said that the business model was to go in, get a project up and running and then hand over management to the tribe. That never happened at Fort McDermitt. As for Pyramid Lake, Stanford called the nation’s decision to shut down the grow “terrible” and costly. He blamed many of the setbacks, including at Fort McDermitt, on changes in tribal leadership. “The biggest challenge in this entire industry is turnaround in tribal leadership,” he said. “There’s no institutional memory sometimes.” DeLaRosa, the tribal liaison for the investors, said Fort McDermitt’s “desolate” location made it hard to attract contractors and created other challenges. He added that divisions within Native nations could complicate doing business. “Sometimes it’s just the dynamics of the community.” Still, Clock, Parris and Stanford kept moving. In 2021 they submitted a proposal to work with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians in North Carolina – a comparatively wealthy nation that owns a successful casino, Harrah’s, in the Great Smoky Mountains. This operation got off the ground: a glitzy 10,000 sq ft dispensary, state-of-the-art processing equipment and a 22-acre grow. The tribe financed the joint venture with more than $30m of its own money, rather than relying solely on external investors as Fort McDermitt had done. At the launch, Clock and the others seemed to be running the show. Clock darted about, slapping people on the back, while Stanford directed people on where to stand for photos. Parris and DeLaRosa also attended the event, mostly keeping to the sidelines. Morale seemed high among the 100 employees. But this project, too, faced concerns about transparency. The previous year, the then principal chief, Richard Sneed, vetoed allocating an additional $64m until the joint venture accounted for the $30m invested by the tribe thus far. He worried about potential cost overruns, and the possible use of casino revenues, which could endanger federal grants. He wanted to see a proper audit. Sneed said in an interview that he had not been able to get answers from the venture’s board or the tribal member they hired as the general manager. “I asked some basic questions. Do you have agendas for your meetings? No. Are you keeping minutes? No.” He said they had also failed to provide him a fiscal management policy and quarterly reports. Stanford, however, said an independent audit had showed everything was “100% kosher”. The venture’s general manager confirmed the audit had been done. Sneed lost his re-election in September 2023, and the project moved ahead with a portion of the $64m the tribe had planned to invest. *** More tribes may soon face a choice about getting into the weed business, after the US justice department proposed regulatory changes to allow the use of cannabis for medicinal, although not recreational, purposes under federal law. However, the troubles at Fort McDermitt and elsewhere concern Oatman, of the Indigenous Cannabis Industry Association. “The bigger systemic issue for tribal communities is that everything is so covert and underground, without the insurance and banking that allow entrepreneurs to do due diligence,” she said. “Finding a trusted partner becomes a chicken-and-egg problem because it’s a new industry. Many tribes lack the resources for the foundational work that needs to be done in terms of licensing.” She encourages tribes to exercise extreme caution when vetting partners and contractors, and not to promise away big consulting fees and equity shares. At least one tribe has steered clear after hearing what Fort McDermitt and other tribes went through. Bobbi Shongutsie of the Wind River Reservation is looking into opening a cannabis operation on behalf of her tribe in Wyoming. She toured the dispensary at Elko, set up by Clock. She didn’t like the “minimal” security nor that other tribal ventures involving the group had shut down. “That was a red flag,” she said. Her tribe decided to pass on doing business with them. A separate group of tribes in Nevada took another path entirely and set up their own self-regulated industry that doesn’t rely on outsiders. Oatman said this network, which includes Shoshone and Paiute nations, could serve as a model. Back at Fort McDermitt, the travel plaza still has not been rebuilt. Cables jut out of the cement between ruined petrol pumps, like metal cobras. The cannabis fields down the road lie fallow. Torn tarps from greenhouses flap in the wind. Around Christmas 2023, thieves broke into the building that had served as the cannabis processing facility and made off with unsold products, which tribal officials believed were not fit for consumption. Surveillance cameras didn’t work because of unpaid electricity bills. After the burglary, minors as young as fifth graders were seen with cannabis on school property. Tribal officials believe the drugs had come from the work site. About a month after the theft, officials burned 525lb of cannabis buds and trim and nearly 5,000 pre-rolls and boarded up the building. During a visit in March, Tom milled about with other elders and former employees who had lost their jobs when the operation shut down. Tom suffers from an old leg injury, and he limped slowly with a brace among the decayed plots. Crutcher, by then the outgoing tribal chair, joined, too. He pondered what to do with an abandoned storage shed, trailer and the skeletons of the greenhouses. “They promised we would make money, and then, nothing,” said Janice Sam, who used to work at the grow. Her former co-worker, Wacey Dick, was more direct: “They lied to us.” The group walked to the storage shed. It held about 20 plastic containers stacked 9ft high and filled with leftover product that hadn’t been torched, at least not yet. Loose piles spilled on the floor, rotting in the moisture. Crutcher kicked the warped door. “We’ve got to put a plan together, otherwise we’re going to continue to have people coming in and pulling wool over our eyes again.” As the end of the year drew close, tribal officials said the time for cannabis cultivation had passed. Another group of outsiders had presented a proposal to revive the farm several months earlier. The tribe refused to hear them out.

          "bodyText": "Arriving home from work the other day in the wind and rain, my mood was further darkened by news headlines about Trump, floods across the UK, and a US military expert proclaiming that the world is now at its most geopolitically dangerous since the second world war. Reaching for the remote, I switched channels in search of my go-to stress remedy – a nice juicy murder drama. It might sound counterintuitive to find solace in such grisly fare, but I find there is something soothing about following a plotline where someone, usually a woman, comes to harm or tries to outwit a psychopath, leading to an investigation. Clearly I’m not alone. On Netflix, Woman of the Hour, a film in which an aspiring actor (Anna Kendrick) crosses paths with a serial killer, topped the ratings in October until it was dethroned by Don’t Move, in which a grieving woman is paralysed by a serial killer. In September, also on Netflix, another drama about a murdered woman, The Perfect Couple, racked up 3.4bn minutes of viewing time in its first week. It became the streamer’s biggest show since Bridgerton. Intriguingly, given that the victims portrayed are so often female, it is women themselves who make up the majority of fans. The US cable crime channel ID (formerly Investigation Discovery) estimates its audience at 60% female. In a recent YouGov survey of Americans, 61% of the women said they watched true-crime content. Is consuming a relentless diet of murder and malevolence night after night a bad thing? Could it be desensitising us to violence? I knew things had spiralled out of control for me when I reached the final episode of a much-hyped psychological thriller and felt utterly cheated. The husband turned out to be a perfectly nice bloke, her children were not scheming scumbags or swindlers and the denouement involved a preposterous coincidence. “What was the point? Unconvincing and no one even got killed,” I seethed. What are we getting out of it? “It’s human nature to live vicariously through others, and that unfortunately extends to extreme events,” says Jean Kim, a psychiatrist and author of Psychology Today’s Culture Shrink blog. “Think about a terrible car accident – everyone is rubbernecking to see what happened. TV shows are a relatively safe way to watch and experience some of life’s horrors at a distance. It can also be subliminally comforting to remind yourself that, thankfully, your own life is not like that. There’s a kind of reassurance from comparison. You might be in a bad mood with your very annoying husband but then when you watch one of these shows, you can console yourself that at least he’s not a serial killer.” There is also the fact that crime dramas are constructed to keep us coming back for more. “These shows are often so thrilling, they give us a shot of adrenaline,” says Abby Robinson, the drama editor at RadioTimes.com. “Once we get a taste, we want more. We expect tension, twists and being kept on our toes, not to mention cliffhangers.” Robinson agrees that a big part of the appeal of murder stories is that they allow us to watch terrifying scenarios from a safe distance. “We want to understand what motivates these individuals, and watching them on screen allows us to engage with them without being in any danger. It’s controlled. It reminds me of when you’re a child and your dad pretends to be a monster. It’s terrifying but you’re not in any danger.” Gill Harrop is a senior lecturer in forensic psychology at the University of Worcester who was previously an intelligence analyst with Lincolnshire police. “When we’re watching these programmes on TV, we often see the perpetrator doing the bad thing, and then they get investigated and caught. So there’s something about the satisfaction of resolution, which you don’t always see in real life.” In the real world, missing people stay missing for years, and killers are not always brought to justice. When it comes to the question of why so many women consume crime stories, Harrop thinks it’s down to viewer identification. “There’s a sense of compassion for the victims. We can see ourselves in that scenario. You might think: ‘Oh, I could have taken my dog for a walk in the woods just like that character.’ That emotional connection helps to pull us in.” On screen, female victims are often central to the plot, as we have seen in other shows such as BBC Three’s A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder and Apple TV’s The Lady in the Lake. Yet this prevalence isn’t an accurate reflection of crime statistics in the real world. In the year ending March 2024, 72% of homicide victims in England and Wales were male, with similar figures for Scotland. However, the gendered nature of domestic abuse that has been portrayed in shows such as Big Little Lies and the ITV drama Until I Kill You is a reflection of reality. While those shows focus on female survivors of abuse, in reality, more than 67% of domestic homicide victims in England and Wales are women. Graham Bartlett left his post as divisional commander for Brighton and Hove police eight years ago to set up as a police procedural and crime adviser for authors and screenwriters. He has worked as a consultant on a number of TV thrillers including the BBC’s Annika, and also writes crime novels. “It’s true that the vast majority of murders are young men killed by other young men. There is a lot of debate about whether violence against women and girls is overly portrayed on screen and in fiction. When I’m working with a scriptwriter or novelist, I encourage them not to use violence against women as an excuse to titillate or entertain. It should be included with thoughtful intentions. But we also need to reflect the fact that it does go on. Also, sadly, a lot of crime against women goes unreported so we don’t know the real figures. Anything that can make it clearer that women and girls are victims of horrendous violence and abuse, not just from strangers but people in their homes, can only be a good thing.” Some people argue that there can be an educational benefit to this strand of crime as entertainment. “Women live with danger every day,” says Kim. “We will always have that fear walking home late at night or when we go to the parking lot in the dark. Maybe the compulsion for us to watch these shows is a way for us to prepare for the worst-case scenarios. We are perversely reminding ourselves of the danger and how to protect ourselves.” Harrop believes that the more knowledge and understanding we can glean about perpetrator behaviour, the better, and crime dramas play a part in this. “All the evidence suggests that people want this information. For example, one of the most recommended books for women in abusive relationships is called Why Does He Do That? by Lundy Bancroft. It really speaks to that notion of wanting to understand someone’s behaviour.” Harrop runs courses at the University of Worcester in identifying abusive behaviour and coercive control. “In my most recent work with the police and in the university, I’ve been looking at women’s safety on nights out and across a range of settings from the workplace or while out jogging, and highlighting the role that everyone, including men, have to play in addressing this.” She has also witnessed how identifying problematic behaviour on screen helps us all to be active bystanders. “You might spot behaviour in a TV storyline that you’ve observed in a friend’s new partner. That might enable you to sit down for a coffee and say: ‘Actually, I’m a bit worried. Have you watched this programme?’” She also mentions that sometimes a script can contain valuable strategies for dealing with a dangerous situation. “Woman of the Hour was directed by a woman, Anna Kendrick. The film illustrated an in-the-moment strategy I teach in my workshops. It’s known as ‘the fawn response’, when, if you are trapped in a dangerous incident with an abuser, placating them can be a more effective escape strategy rather than begging or resisting.” To what extent do psychologists believe that dwelling on the diabolical side of human nature on TV could be having a detrimental effect on us? “For anyone suffering from previous trauma, there could be a potential mental health impact of watching these shows,” says Kim. “It’s what we call repetition neurosis, where someone gets drawn to that darkness, and repeatedly watches something over and over again in an attempt to feel something, to undo the trauma. If the person understands that is what is happening, it can be a healthy thing. But if you’re just retraumatising yourself, that isn’t good. For most of us though, watching the dark side of human nature is similar to watching horror movies. Maybe it’s a way of coping with scary things.” Harrop believes that moderation is key. “Well, if you watch so much of it that you start to believe that this is how all men behave, that can be very isolating,” she says. “If you started avoiding people and changed your behaviour, that wouldn’t be good. Feeling safe is such an important human need. When watching these programmes, some people try to feel better by focusing on how this happened to the character and ask questions like: ‘Was she too trusting?’ or: ‘Did she have too many drinks?’ Essentially, they try to reassure themselves that they probably wouldn’t do that, so they’re safe. “The problem with this is that it’s victim-blaming. The only person responsible for the crime is the perpetrator and you can reinforce your own sense of safety without thinking what happened was the victim’s fault. Sarah Everard wasn’t killed because she walked home alone. She was killed because a serving police officer decided to murder a woman that night.” With the state of the world, maybe it is no coincidence that murder scripts are booming. As Kim explains: “These shows are particularly valuable at the moment, when, in the wider world, a lot of the time we are seeing the bad guys winning. Maybe these screen narratives are reassuring in a way. There is something almost energising about witnessing morally ambivalent, dark or downright bad behaviour at a safe distance. You can affirm to yourself what the line is between right and wrong. That is helpful and important right now. Because out in the real world, that line is getting murkier every day.” • This article was amended on 17 December 2024 to more accurately reflect a portion of a quotation from Gill Harrop."

          "bodyText": "An unemployed woman with cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability was signed up to 24 Optus contracts for multiple phones, smart watches and tablets over 15 months, the consumer watchdog has alleged in a lawsuit claiming the telco sold hundreds of vulnerable people phones and plans they could not afford. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission launched a federal court case against Optus in October alleging the telco had engaged in unconscionable conduct, in contravention of Australian consumer law, in its dealings with 429 customers – 363 of which were served at Optus’s Darwin stores. The regulator’s 347-page statement of claim, filed in the court and obtained by Guardian Australia, details the alleged sales tactics of some Optus staff that led to the ACCC taking action. There were 24 examples of alleged unconscionable conduct by Optus employees, the claim states. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email In one case, the woman with cerebral palsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was allegedly entered into 24 contracts with Optus between January 2022 and April 2023 – the majority in the Optus Palmerston Gateway store or the Optus Casuarina store in Darwin. The ACCC said the woman has impaired decision-making capacity. In that time she was sold an iPhone 13 Pro Max, two Apple Watch Series 7 in two separate contracts, a Samsung Galaxy A13, a Samsung Galaxy GS22, a Samsung Watch 5, two Samsung Tablet A8s in two separate contracts, a Huawei modem, a Galaxy Samsung GS23, an iPhone 14, along with mobile plans and accessories. At the time she was signed up to the 24th contact, Optus had already issued at least 31 text messages, 30 emails and four letters to her regarding missed or late payment on one or more of the contracts. The ACCC has alleged staff should have known she lived with disability and health conditions, and that the disability support pension was her only source of income. The regulator alleged a former disability carer for the customer was a member of Optus staff in the stores that sold the products. A number of the allegations in the court document included people with intellectual disabilities being sold products they did not need, including people without a car being sold car chargers. In one case, a homeless man who was deaf and mute, and communicated via Australian sign language because his hand was amputated, was allegedly sold by Optus Westfield Marion in South Australia a new Samsung Galaxy phone, a $65 per month Optus plan and a $480 accessories bundle including wireless chargers, screen protectors, a speaker and a wallet case. He was living on the disability pension, the court papers alleged. The ACCC alleged staff should have known the man, who has since died, had limited use for technology such as phones because of the amputation of part of his fingers and hand. A number of the cases detail customers living with dementia or Alzheimer’s that the regulator alleges staff should have been aware of. One man with Alzheimer’s who could only reliably remember his own name and date of birth, and had his phone number taped to his phone, collapsed in the Rosebud Optus store, in Victoria, in January 2020 after attempting to have the phone contract he signed up for cancelled. It would take a further year and a half for his case to be resolved, and he died less than a year later, the court document said. The document detailed a number of allegations about mobile plans sold to First Nations people for whom English was a second or third language, and who lived in remote parts of Australia where there was no Optus coverage. It also included references to internal emails and a report that Optus was cognisant of this potentially being an issue for the telco after Telstra was fined $50m for similar practices in 2021. A spokesperson for Optus said the company was deeply sorry for all affected customers and the alleged misconduct was unacceptable and out of step with Optus’s values. “The majority of the misconduct identified occurred at three licensee-operated Optus stores and disciplinary action has been taken, including terminating staff who were determined to be responsible,” the spokesperson said. “We are remediating affected customers – providing refunds, waiving outstanding debts and enabling them to keep devices. We are working hard to fast-track any outstanding remediation as a matter of urgency.” The new chief executive of Optus, Stephen Rue, has launched an internal review, including investigating individual cases to stop the types of alleged misconduct revealed by the ACCC, the spokesperson said. Optus said a specialist care team that provides support to vulnerable customers has been given more resources."

          "headline": "Tuesday briefing: How the UK left 64 asylum seekers stranded on an island in the Indian Ocean",
          "bodyText": "Good morning. In October 2021, a boat carrying dozens of Tamils trying to find their way to Canada sprung a leak. They were rescued by the British navy and brought to Diego Garcia, a tropical island in the middle of the Indian Ocean that was under the control of the British government, and which hosted a US military base. But their saviours became their captors – and they found themselves in rat-infested camps, largely deprived of their liberty and caught in legal limbo with no obvious way out. The authorities on Diego Garcia maintained that the asylum seekers were free to leave whenever they wanted, and that any restrictions on their movements there were lawful and necessary. Yesterday, a judge said that case had “not come close” to being made. She ruled that the asylum seekers had been unlawfully detained in conditions that one of them described as “hell on earth”. The ruling amounts to a crushing defeat for the British government, and a wholesale vindication for an almost forgotten group of people whose fate has been subjugated to geopolitical forces far beyond their control. Diane Taylor has been following the case for the Guardian. In today’s newsletter, she explains the detainees’ Kafkaesque treatment – and the hope that springs from their remarkable legal victory. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Espionage | The alleged Chinese spy with links to Prince Andrew and who made connections at the heart of the UK establishment has been named as Yang Tengbo, a businessman also known as Chris Yang. Yang ran the Duke of York’s Pitch@Palace charity project in China and was given authority to act on his behalf in Chinese business dealings. Russia | A Russian general in charge of radiation, chemical and biological protection forces has been killed in an explosion in Moscow, the country’s investigative committee has said. Lieutenant General Igor Kirillov and his assistant were said to have been killed by a device hidden inside a scooter. Germany | Olaf Scholz has lost a historic vote of confidence in the German parliament after the collapse of his government. The German chancellor had called the vote in order to deliberately lose it so that the first formal step could be made towards triggering new elections. UK news | Lucy Letby’s lawyer has announced he is seeking to reopen her appeal because the prosecution’s lead medical expert witness, Dr Dewi Evans, has changed his mind on some key evidence. At a press conference on Monday, Mark McDonald said Evans was not a reliable expert, and that not all of Letby’s convictions were safe. Politics| Victoria Thomas Bowen, the 25-year-old woman who threw a milkshake over Nigel Farage during the UK general election campaign in June, has been given a 13-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. In depth: ‘It is unsurprising that the claimants feel as if they are in a prison; that is exactly what it is, in all but name’ Diego Garcia is part of the Chagos archipelago, one of the most remote island groups in the world. Once part of Mauritius when it was a British colony, the Chagos Islands were hived off as the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) when Mauritius obtained its independence in 1968, and their residents were summarily evicted. Diego Garcia was leased as a US military base, and is now home only to the US and British personnel who keep the site running. Earlier this year, a deal was struck to return the islands to Mauritian control while maintaining the UK-US presence on Diego Garcia. In this excellent piece from July, Diane Taylor emphasises the location’s dissonance: “In many ways, the island – with its pure white sands, palm trees and azure seas – looks a lot like paradise,” she writes. But for the asylum seekers who are stuck here, 16 of whom are children, that idyll could not be further from their reality.” *** How did the asylum seekers get there? Of the 64 asylum seekers detained at Diego Garcia, 63 had been there since October 2021, when their boat got into difficulties near the island. All of them were Sri Lankan Tamils, and many said that they feared persecution if they were to return home. The legal case has been brought by 12 of them. Five other boats arrived over the next six months, carrying another 285 asylum seekers, all of whom have since left the island. “The ones who were still there were the hard core who felt very sure that they would face persecution at home,” Diane said. “They used the same word again and again: safety. That is all they want.” Even before their ordeal on Diego Garcia, the 64 had endured appalling circumstances – both at home and in their perilous journey to escape. They tell stories about torture in Sri Lanka, and the need to shield their children from the certainty they were going to die at sea as they drifted with little hope of salvation. “One woman I interviewed had been born in a refugee camp in India after her parents fled there from Sri Lanka,” Diane said. “So literally her whole life has been in these dire circumstances. It isn’t just the trauma of what happened on the island – it’s the layering with what came before.” *** Were they free to leave? The BIOT authorities claim the conditions for the asylum seekers on Diego Garcia did not amount to unlawful detention because they were always free to leave for Sri Lanka or anywhere else that would accept them. But with no safe third country forthcoming, that appears to have been no choice at all. The UK’s commissioner on the island also claimed that they could leave by boats “independently arranged”. But the asylum seekers were destitute and had no means of repairing their boats, securing provisions or buying replacements. As the judge wrote: “A Hobsonian choice between a very poor option and no option at all is not a genuine choice … it is akin to saying that a person imprisoned on the edge of a cliff is free to jump.” And she said: “It is unsurprising that the claimants feel as if they are in a prison; that is exactly what it is, in all but name.” *** What were the conditions like? The asylum seekers lived in rat-infested tents that let water in when it rained, and had no access to cooking facilities. They were denied any productive activity, and the children had only rudimentary schooling. They were denied mobile sim cards or access to wifi, and were guarded by officers from the security company G4S. Some of the Tamils told Diane in interviews that the guards would “taunt them by eating bars of chocolate that their kids weren’t allowed to have”. Perhaps the clearest sign of the removal of their liberty was the fact that their encampment was fenced in on all sides except one, which was blocked by thick bushes and trees. A previous court order said that they must be allowed access to a beach for walks. But they were prohibited from filling their water bottles from taps along the route. And they were told that public urination was an offence – but barred from using toilets they passed as they went. The asylum seekers felt themselves to be in a hopeless situation. There was a hunger strike, and many attempted suicide; one was charged with arson after trying to burn himself alive, and others swallowed razor blades and metal wire. There were multiple cases of self-harm, and a child was subjected to sexual assault by a fellow detainee. A UNHCR report on the camp said: “The cumulative impact of prolonged detention in conditions of close surveillance, mistrust in asylum procedures and the BIOT authorities, lack of agency and uncertainty about the future, are having significant consequences … The detention of and associated impact on children is of particularly grave concern.” *** Why were they treated this way? With costs forecast to reach £50m a year, it may seem hard to understand why the British authorities would not simply grant the asylum seekers greater liberty on the island, or allow them to claim asylum in the UK. The judgment makes clear that American influence was a key reason. “It looks like they called the shots,” Diane said. A US diplomatic cable quoted in the ruling says that greater freedoms would be “an unacceptable and significant security risk … the migrants cannot be permitted greater access to the facility”. Meanwhile, the judge writes, one of the UK’s objectives was “preventing a migration route to the UK via the Indian Ocean”. And, said Diane, it was significant that events on Diego Garcia were playing out against the backdrop of the Conservative government’s ill-fated attempts to establish its Rwanda scheme. “That is at the core of it,” she said. “They were worried about anything that would set a precedent for Rwanda.” When Labour came in, the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, “was frightened of looking weak on asylum issues”, Diane said. But before the ruling was handed down, the government moved to bring the situation to an end, and those remaining on the island were relocated to the UK and granted six months to remain and file asylum claims. *** What does the judge’s ruling mean? The BIOT supreme court operates in London, but the acting judge, Margaret Obi, made the decision to travel to Diego Garcia to hear the case despite an American attempt to block it. “I’ve never known a judge do that before,” Diane said. “It was remarkable.” The judge ruled unambiguously that the asylum seekers had been unlawfully detained. “It is a massive vindication for them,” Diane said. Significantly, the judgment opens the way to compensation – and that could mean a bill of millions if most of the asylum seekers make a claim. “I don’t think many of them are thinking about that yet,” Diane said. “But if they get permission to settle here, it may help them build a new life.” For now, the crucial result of the ruling may simply be recognition of what the asylum seekers have endured. One woman who Diane spoke to last week told her: “When the judge came to Diego Garcia to hear the legal case we had our first glimpse of hope. What we want for our children is that there is a full stop after the word ‘refugee’. We don’t want our children to lead the lives we led. We want them to grow up leading a free and peaceful life.” What else we’ve been reading Tonight, the BBC will crown its Sports Personality of the Year.

Michael Robbin has transformed his farm using intensive rotational grazing, dividing his land into 125 small pastures that allow cattle to graze on fresh, green grass while minimising the environmental impact. This approach, known as a silvopastoral system, offers remarkable benefits: cattle gain weight faster, emit less methane and the land captures carbon. Researchers are optimistic, noting that such methods could significantly reduce the livestock industry’s carbon footprint. While challenges remain and silvopastoral systems are not the solution for all farmers, this approach represents a model of agricultural innovation that tries to balance productivity with ecological responsibility.

          "bodyText": "Donald Trump’s transition to the White House continues apace. Trump’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F Kennedy Jr, has been meeting with senators to make the case for his appointment. At a wide-ranging press conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, Trump tried to downplay concerns that his administration (under Kennedy’s influence) to remove the polio vaccine from circulation. Here’s what else happened today: Trump suggested he might pardon New York mayor Eric Adams. He announced that Japanese firm SoftBank would invest $100bn in America and create 100,000 jobs, though in the past, similar promises have not panned out. TikTok asked the supreme court to block a law that aims to ban the popular social media app in the US. The company asked the Supreme Court to act by 6 January. Democrats float a plan for Kamala Harris to run for president again in 2028. Harris has reportedly not ruled out a second run, but is also said to be considering a bid for the governor of California. Democrats are making a last-minute push to convince Joe Biden to put the Equal Rights Amendment into the constitution, which would protect against sex discrimination and likely spark a court fight. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator who has met with Pete Hegseth, said the defense secretary nominee told him that he will allow a woman who he paid in relation to a sexual assault allegation to speak about it publicly. Biden defended his economic record with an essay in the progressive American Prospect magazine. Senator Rick Scott, a Republican from Florida, is backing Robert F Kennedy Jr for secretary of health and human services. The senator said he met with Kennedy on Monday and they had a “great meeting”. This comes as Kennedy is courting votes from lawmakers for his confirmation. “I really appreciate his message,” Scott said during a press conference following the meeting. He mentioned that he himself used to work in the hospital business. “Finally, we’re going to have a HHS secretary that wakes up every day and says, ‘How do we keep everybody healthy in this country?’” Scott said. Scott said he believes in vaccines and that Kennedy said what he wants with vaccines is “transparency”. Scott added that they did not discuss polio vaccines or abortion. Kennedy has shown support for abortion rights. Democratic party aides have begun to float ideas for a Kamala Harris political comeback, reportedly eyeing another run at the US’s highest office even as the party continues to grapple with the electoral messages contained in the vice-president’s decisive defeat in November’s White House race against Donald Trump. Harris, who has reportedly not ruled out a second run for the presidency, is now reported to be considering a run for the California governorship, currently held until 2027 by Gavin Newsom. Newsom was a rumoured presidential contender during the chaotic summer that saw Joe Biden step down from a rematch with Trump – whom he defeated in the 2020 election – and then endorse Harris as his replacement. According to the Washington Post on Monday, some Democratic party aides believe Trump – who, among other things, overcame a criminal conviction and other such charges to win – has sufficiently overturned the norms of losing White House candidates’ not attempting a second bite at the proverbial apple to give Harris the opportunity of a repeat bid in 2028, this time for the full cycle. “Since Donald Trump has rewritten the rules – the norms – I don’t believe Kamala Harris or anyone should try to go with precedent, ever,” said Donna Brazile, a Harris ally, Al Gore 2000 presidential campaign manager and political commentator. “There are no rule books.” Read more: Trump’s stance on TikTok has softened since his first term in office. Initially he advocated to ban the app, but during his run for re-election he posted on his Truth Social account that he would “save TikTok in America”. Trump launched his own TikTok account in June, which now has nearly 15 million followers. On Monday, Trump said in a press conference at Mar-a-Lago that he has a “warm spot in my heart for TikTok”. He’s reportedly slated to meet with TikTok CEO Shou Chew at his estate on Monday, according to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins. TikTok asked the supreme court to block a law that aims to ban the popular social media app in the US. Unless the court intervenes, the ban is set to go into effect on 19 January, one day before Donald Trump is sworn into office. The law to ban TikTok passed Congress last spring and was signed by Joe Biden. The US government says TikTok is a national security threat because its parent company, ByteDance, is Chinese-owned. They say China could use the app to access personal data from millions of Americans and also spread propaganda. The government has not disclosed evidence that Beijing or ByteDance has done so. TikTok argues the law is unconstitutional, unfairly singles it out and violates the right to free speech of its millions of users. “The Act will shutter one of America’s most popular speech platforms the day before a presidential inauguration,” reads the court filing. “This, in turn, will silence the speech of Applicants and the many Americans who use the platform to communicate about politics, commerce, arts, and other matters of public concern,” they added. TikTok asked the supreme court to act by 6 January. Donald Trump’s allies have become increasingly emboldened to float their most audacious ideas as Trump prepares to return to office, suggesting he run for an unconstitutional third term in 2028 and accusing the news media of having engaged in a criminal conspiracy with prosecutors against him. Those suggestions, by Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon, came at a self-congratulatory gala dinner for conservatives in New York on Sunday. At times the remarks seemed like the product of the euphoria that permeated attendees. The underlying message was clear: with Trump back in the White House and with Bannon renewing his influence with the president-elect, the most extreme and polarizing proposals at the very least were up for consideration. “The viceroy Mike Davis tells me, since it doesn’t actually say consecutive, that maybe we do it again in ’28?” Bannon said of Trump possibly running again in his remarks at the New York Young Republican Club gala dinner that also saw a Trump adviser keel over the lectern and fall off the stage. Riding the wave of self-congratulatory sentiment in the room, Bannon, who ignored the black-tie dress code with a wax jacket and black collared shirt, doubled down on pursuing a campaign of retribution against Trump’s perceived enemies in the news media and at the justice department. “We want retribution and we’re going to get retribution. You have to. It’s not personal, it’s not personal,” Bannon said to the raucous room. “They need to learn what populist, nationalist power is on the receiving end. “I need investigations, trials and then incarceration. And I’m just talking about the media. Should the media be included in the vast criminal conspiracy against President Trump? Should Andrew Weissmann on MSNBC and Rachel Maddow and all of them?” Read more: Anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr is on Capitol Hill to meet Republican senators who will decide if he should be confirmed as secretary of health and human services: Kennedy has attracted much scrutiny for his embrace of various conspiracy theories, and advocacy against vaccines. But as conservative activist Charlie Kirk wrote on X, Kennedy’s appeal to Trump supporters is that he would downsize the massive federal department he is being tapped to lead: The annual budget for HHS is over $1.8 trillion, including $130 billion in discretionary spending. A behemoth of bloat and bureaucracy. That said, there’s one thing about Kennedy that might not sit well with some Republicans: his previous statements of support for abortion. We’ll see what lawmakers have to say about that. It’s a somewhat obscure issue, but one thing Trump has made very clear he plans to do is take steps to require federal employees to work from offices that they may have stopped going to when Covid-19 broke out. He repeated the promise at his Mar-a-Lago press conference today, saying: If people don’t come back to work, come back into the office, they’re going to be dismissed. In a statement, Everett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union of federal government employees, said the issue was not as simple as Trump makes it sound: Rumors of widespread federal telework and remote work are simply untrue. More than half of federal employees cannot telework at all because of the nature of their jobs, only ten percent of federal workers are remote, and those who have a hybrid arrangement spend over sixty percent of working hours in the office. Kelley also threatened a fight over any steps Trump may take that run afoul of union contracts, saying: “Collective bargaining agreements entered into by the federal government are binding and enforceable under the law. We trust the incoming administration will abide by their obligations to honor lawful union contracts. If they fail to do so, we will be prepared to enforce our rights.” Here’s more about Trump’s plans to return government workers to their offices: Donald Trump is considering appointing Democratic congressman Jared Moskowitz to lead the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), CNN reports. Moskowitz, the former director of Florida’s division of emergency management, would be a rare registered Democrat to wind up in Trump’s administration. The congressman earlier this month announced he would join the congressional caucus supporting the “Department of Government Efficiency”, the quasi-governmental effort co-chaired by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to downsize the federal government. Trump has nominated some former Democrats to cabinet posts, including ex-Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, and anti-vaccine activist Robert F Kennedy Jr as health and human services secretary. Elon Musk is often by Donald Trump’s side these days, but the Guardian’s Edward Helmore reports that the government does not necessarily consider him trustworthy: Space entrepreneur Elon Musk is unlikely to receive government security clearances if he so applied, even as his SpaceX launch company blasts military and spy agency payloads into orbit, according to a report on Monday. The billionaire, a close ally of Donald Trump, who is set to join the incoming administration as an efficiency expert and recently became the first person to exceed $400bn in self-made personal wealth, is reported by the Wall Street Journal to have been advised by SpaceX lawyers to not seek highest-level security clearances owing to personal drug use and contacts with foreign nationals. Musk currently holds a “top-secret” clearance that took years to obtain after he discussed use of marijuana on a 2018 podcast with Joe Rogan, according to the outlet. But that may not be enough to have access to information about US government payloads in his rockets. Typically, candidates undergoing federal security screenings by the department of defense may not receive clearance if the agency expresses concerns about drug or alcohol use, criminal conduct, psychological conditions, sexual behavior or allegiance to the US. According to the Journal, Musk’s lawyers outlined scenarios in which he might inadvertently disclose secrets to foreign officials with whom he regularly speaks, including the Russian president Vladimir Putin, with whom he is reported to have been in regular contact since 2022. Musk’s use of another semi-legal drug, ketamine, in pursuit of what friends call “pure creativity”, along with reports of LSD, ecstasy and magic mushrooms, could also be an issue. Joe Biden has been briefed on a school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, which the local police chief says has left five people dead and several other injured. “The president has been briefed on the school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin. Senior White House officials are in touch with local counterparts in Madison to provide support as needed,” the White House said. Here’s more on this developing story: Regarding Israel’s assault on Gaza and the possibility for a ceasefire, Miller said: We are pushing as hard as we know how to do at this point. We believe we can get to the deal, but again it remains incumbent on Hamas and Israel agreeing to those final terms and getting it over the line. I cannot in good conscience stand here and tell you that that’s going to happen. But it should happen. US officials and other countries are trying to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas that would call for a ceasfire and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian detainees. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel in Gaza since Hamas’s 7 October attacks on Israel, more than half of whom are women and children. The US state department is holding a briefing right now, much of it dedicated to the aftermath of the rapid toppling of Syria’s government, formerly led by authoritarian leader Bashar al-Assad – and what that means for the US. Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the US’s “message to the Syrian people is this: We want them to succeed and we are prepared to help them do so.” Miller spoke to the importance of locating and finding US journalist Austin Tice, who has been missing since 2012 but is reportedly alive, to his family. Tice’s mother, Debra, went on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday and said she has met with the state department and the White House. She added: “We’re just really excited about being a reunited family.” No organization from the US government has been on the ground yet in Syria in reference to the search for Tice or other diplomatic issues since rebel forces took down the regime, the state department confirmed. Donald Trump held a wide-ranging press conference from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, weighing in on everything from pardoning New York mayor Eric Adams (he might do it) to getting rid of the polio vaccine (he’s not in favor). The president-elect also tried to tamp down concerns that his nominee to lead the health and human services department, Robert F Kennedy Jr, would make big changes, saying instead that “he’s going to be much less radical than you would think”. Finally, Trump announced that Japanese firm SoftBank would invest $100bn in America and create 100,000 jobs, though in the past, similar promises have not panned out. Here’s what else has happened today so far: Democrats are making a last minute-push to convince Joe Biden to put the Equal Rights Amendment into the constitution, which would protect against sex discrimination and likely spark a court fight. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator who has met with Pete Hegseth, said the defense secretary nominee told him that he will allow a woman who he paid in relation to a sexual assault allegation to speak about it publicly. Biden defended his economic record with an essay in the progressive American Prospect magazine. Donald Trump has a history of announcing big investments that do not turn out as advertised, and one of the prime examples from his first term was a sprawling plant in Wisconsin that electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn was to build. It never actually materialized, but despite that unmet promise, the Badger state this year voted to send Trump back to the White House. Writing before the election, the Guardian’s Callum Jones took a look at what went wrong with the much-ballyhooed investment: Less than 30 miles south of the Fiserv Forum, the Wisconsin convention center where Republicans confirmed Donald Trump as their nominee for president for the third time, lies the site of a project Trump predicted would become “the Eighth Wonder of the World”. While still in office, the then president traveled to Mount Pleasant in Racine county to break ground on a sprawling facility that the electronics manufacturing giant Foxconn had agreed to build – in exchange for billions of dollars’ worth of subsidies. Flanked by local allies and executives from the company, Trump planted a golden shovel in the ground. “America is open for business more than it has ever been open for business,” he proclaimed in June 2018, as FoxConn promised to invest $10bn and hire 13,000 local workers. Highways were built and expanded. Homes were razed. The area – a former manufacturing powerhouse – was primed for revitalization in a deal that seemed to underline the executive prowess of America’s most famous businessman, an image that has helped maintain many voters’ confidence that he could steer the US economy more competently than his rival, Kamala Harris, and could win him the White House again come November. At his just-concluded press conference in Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump was asked if he would consider pardoning New York mayor Eric Adams, who is facing corruption charges. “Yeah, I think that he was treated pretty unfairly,” Trump replied. Adams has been indicted on five federal charges related to accepting gifts in exchange for favors such as helping Turkey open a new diplomatic tower in Manhattan despite concerns about its fire safety system. Last week, the New York Times reported that a lawyer who had filed petitions seeking to revoke the approval of vaccines for polio and other preventable diseases has been by Robert F Kennedy Jr’s side in interviews to hire top officials for the health and human services department. A reporter asked Donald Trump today if he supported taking the polio vaccine out of circulation. “You’re not going to lose the polio vaccine. That’s not going to happen,” Trump said. “I saw what happened with the polio, I have friends that were very much affected by that. I have friends from many years ago, and … they’re still in not such good shape because of it.” The polio vaccine has been credited with suppressing, almost entirely, a disease that can cause lifelong paralysis in people who get it. Mitch McConnell, the top Senate Republican who survived the disease, condemned the news that Trump’s incoming administration could be hostile to the much-used vaccine. However, Trump did signal some skepticism to the vaccine mandates enacted by some states and school districts. “I don’t like mandates. I’m not a big mandate person,” Trump said. He also said that there might be a link between vaccines and pesticides and autism. “You take a look at autism today versus 20, 25 years ago, it’s like, not even believable. So we’re going to have reports,” Trump said. But he downplayed fears that Kennedy, if confirmed to lead the nation’s health department, would make radical changes. “Nothing’s going to happen very quickly. I think you’re going to find that Bobby is much is a very rational guy,” Trump said. At his ongoing press conference, Donald Trump was asked what he would say to people concerned about the anti-vaccine views of Robert F Kennedy Jr, who he nominated to lead the department of health and human services. “I think he’s going to be much less radical than you would think. I think he’s got a very open mind, or I wouldn’t have put him there. He’s going to be very much less radical,” Trump said, adding “there are problems we don’t do as well as a lot of other nations … and we’re going to find out what those problems are.” He didn’t specify what those problems were, but did promise to lower prescription drug costs by eliminating “middlemen”. “We’re paying much more than other countries, and we have laws that make it impossible to reduce and we have a thing called the middleman. You know the middleman, right? The horrible middleman that makes more money, frankly, than the drug companies, and they don’t do anything except they’re a middleman. We’re going to knock out the middleman. I’m going to be very unpopular after that statement,” Trump said. Donald Trump announced that Japanese investment firm SoftBank would put $100bn into projects in the United States and create tens of thousands of jobs. “We’ve just concluded a very productive meeting, and today I’m thrilled to announce that SoftBank will be investing $100bn in America, creating 100,000 American jobs at a minimum. And he’s doing this because he feels very optimistic about our country since the election and many other people are also coming in with tremendous amounts of money,” Trump said in a press conference at Mar-a-Lago. The firm’s founder, Masayoshi Son, appeared alongside Trump, saying: “I would really like to celebrate the great victory of President Trump and my confidence level to the economy of United States has tremendously increased with his victory. “Of course, business is important, technology is important, but one more thing I’m I’m really hoping, is that this President Trump would … bring the world into peace again. That’s my additional hope, and I think he will actually make it happen,” Son added. The announcement is the latest instance of Trump taking credit for private sector investment announcements, whether or not they actually come into fruition. Shortly after first winning the presidency, he made a much-publicized visit to a plant owned by air conditioning manufacturer Carrier, and said he had convinced them not to move jobs overseas. The company later conducted layoffs anyway. Here’s a look back: In an interview with CNN, Democratic senator Richard Blumenthal said he believes the number of Republicans who will support Pete Hegseth to lead the defense department has increased. “His chances improved last week because Donald Trump heightened the heat on a lot of Republicans, in effect threatening them with primaries and other retribution if they fail to support Hegseth. And so a lot of the Republican senators who told me, five to 10 of them, that they thought Hegseth was doomed as a nominee have now changed their story,” said Blumenthal, who serves on the armed services committee that will be tasked with confirming him. With the end of his presidency in sight, Joe Biden has published an essay in the American Prospect looking back at his economic accomplishments. “Over the last four years, we’ve faced some of the most challenging economic conditions in our history. Not only have we recovered, we’ve come out stronger, and have laid foundations for a promising new chapter in our American comeback story,” Biden writes. “It will take years to see the full effects in terms of new jobs and new investments all around the country, but we have planted the seeds that are making this happen. If these investments and actions are built upon, U.S. economic leadership will be stronger and the middle class more secure in the years and decades ahead.” The “challenging economic conditions” Biden writes about are the inflation that caused his popularity to slump early in his term and never recover, and is widely seen as paving the way for Donald Trump’s return to the White House. The American Prospect is associated with the United States’s progressive movement. Barack Obama published a similar essay in late 2016, but chose to place it in the Economist, which is British and viewed as ranging from liberal to centrist in its political leanings. Another difference between the two pieces: Obama’s was published before Trump won the presidential election, and Biden’s afterwards. Donald Trump is expected to at 11am speak to reporters from his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. The president-elect has spoken publicly only occasionally in the weeks since he won re-election to the White House, instead making his views known through posts on Truth Social, or statements from his transition team. Trump did not say what he will be talking about, but we will let you know when we find out. By all accounts, Donald Trump is sticking by Pete Hegseth, despite the sexual assault accusation and other reports of bad behavior circling around him. Hegseth was seen with Trump, JD Vance and other top Republicans and their allies this weekend, at the army-navy football game in Maryland: Republican senator Lindsey Graham says Pete Hegseth, the former Fox News host who Donald Trump nominated to lead the defense department, told him that he has allowed a woman who accused him of sexual assault to speak publicly. While police brought no charges over the alleged assault, Hegseth reportedly paid the accuser a settlement, in exchange for her signing a nondisclosure agreement about the allegation. In a Sunday interview with NBC News, Graham said that Hegseth “told me he would release her from that agreement”. Graham, who had expressed some concerns about Hegseth as the sexual assault allegations and reports of other bad behavior came to light, otherwise spoke positively about the defense secretary nominee: I’m in a good place with Pete unless something I don’t know about comes out. These allegations are disturbing, but they’re anonymous. I asked him point blank, were you drunk in a bar and got up and said, let’s kill all the Muslims. He said, no. There’s one allegation on a police report about sexual assault, that person has the right to come forward to the committee. But about mismanagement of money, about, you know, having a drinking problem and saying inappropriate things, all of these are anonymous allegations. He’s given me his side of the story. It makes sense to me, I believe him. Unless somebody’s willing to come forward, I think he’s going to get through. In addition to the more than 120 Democratic lawmakers who sent Joe Biden a letter this weekend urging him to have the Equal Rights Amendment added to the constitution, New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand is on a personal quest to get the president on board. The New York Times reports that the Democrat has made the case to whoever will listen to her that the ERA has met the threshold for ratification, and the president should order it published. From Gillibrand’s interview with the Times: Ms. Gillibrand has pleaded her E.R.A. case at every available opportunity. The third-term New Yorker has met with Jeffrey D. Zients, the White House chief of staff, and Anita Dunn, a former top adviser to Mr. Biden. Her request is for a five-minute meeting with Mr. Biden himself. She has used passing 30-second interactions in photo lines to personally pitch the president, so far to no avail. Ms. Gillibrand has presented White House officials with fat binders full of legal research and polling, which have on the cover a printout of Mr. Biden posing as if he is on a Taylor Swift Eras Tour poster. (E.R.A. — get it?) Ms. Gillibrand sat down with Minyon Moore, one of Vice President Kamala Harris’s top advisers and confidantes, to persuade Ms. Harris to champion the E.R.A. and asked her to speak to other White House officials about it. Still, nothing happened. Undeterred, Ms. Gillibrand has continued to text and harangue and flatter, all in service of procuring a brief meeting with Mr. Biden to make a more comprehensive pitch. “I’ve never done more legal analysis and work since I was a lawyer,” Ms. Gillibrand said. So far, she has been strung along. “It’s ‘I’ll get back to you; I’ll get back to you.’ Everyone always says, ‘We love your arguments.’ I never know what the ‘but’ is.” Kelly Scully, a White House spokeswoman, said senior administration officials had been discussing the proposal with lawmakers and other stakeholders. “President Biden has been clear that he wants to see the Equal Rights Amendment definitively enshrined in the Constitution,” Ms. Scully said in a statement. “It is long past time that we recognize the clear will of the American people.” Good morning, US politics blog readers. Dozens of Democratic lawmakers have proposed a novel idea for Joe Biden to secure his presidential legacy in his final weeks in office: decide that the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which protects against sex discrimination, has met the standard for ratification, and have the Archivist of the United States publish the amendment into the constitution. The proposal was approved by the US House and Senate in the early 1970s but a conservative backlash prevented it from being ratified by the necessary two-thirds of states by a 1982 deadline congress had set. In the years since, several states have voted to approve the amendment, and in a letter to Biden sent over the weekend, more than 120 House Democrats argued that the ERA has met the requirements, and should be added to the constitution as the 28th amendment, and the first since 1992. The subtext here is Donald Trump’s impending arrival in the White House, and the likelihood that Biden publishing the ERA would trigger a court fight that casts a shadow over the newly arrived president, particularly since he is viewed as politically vulnerable among women. We’ll tell you more about the ERA push today. Here’s what else is going on: Robert F Kennedy Jr, the anti-vaccine activist Trump has named to lead the health and human services department, is heading to Capitol Hill to meet with Republican senators throughout the day. Biden will at 12.15pm hold an event at the labor department to promote his administration’s efforts to help American workers, then convene a Hanukkah reception at 7.45pm. Syrian diplomats and community leaders plan to today hoist the flag of “Free Syria” at its Washington DC embassy, which has been closed since 2014."

          "headline": "NSW abortion deserts: just three of 220 public hospitals provide terminations, research finds",
          "bodyText": "Just three of New South Wales’ 220 public hospitals are routinely providing abortions, according to research by the University of Sydney. The research, which maps lack of access to abortion in the state, also reveals that a majority of the state’s cities and towns are “abortion deserts”, meaning the nearest service is more than 160km away. Abortion is basic healthcare that is legal in NSW. Despite the World Health Organization recommending that all public hospitals provide it, uncovering where it is offered, and under what circumstances, is difficult. The only public hospitals openly providing abortion outside of a medical emergency are Broken Hill hospital in the state’s far west; John Hunter hospital in Newcastle on the north coast; and the Royal Women’s Hospital in Sydney. Women elsewhere are left trying to access one of just 13 private providers, which cost a minimum of $775 if you have a Medicare card, and are not easy to find in any directory. Because there may be unadvertised abortion services at other public hospitals, Guardian Australia separately contacted all NSW local health districts to ask which of their hospitals provided abortion and what happens to people seeking abortions in their district if they don’t. None of the health districts replied. The peak body for obstetricians and gynaecologists described the lack of information about abortion access at public hospitals as “completely unacceptable”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email To better understand where women in NSW are most struggling to access abortion, researchers led by the University of Sydney and the data visualisation specialist Ri Liu, mapped access to surgical abortion (a procedure undertaken in a clinical setting) and medication abortion (taking prescribed abortion pills) across the state. They used publicly available directories but noted that not all abortion services were openly advertised or easy to find, providers could change, and that the circumstances under which abortions were provided was not transparent. The project was inspired by US researchers, who first used the term “abortion desert” to describe places 100 miles (160km) or more from the nearest abortion service. For those living in an abortion desert, transport is required. This could mean at least a four-hour round trip by car, possible overnight accommodation and additional travel funds beyond the cost of the abortion itself. “There are a whole lot of service gaps around abortion that people in the general population really don’t know about until they try to access one,” said Dr Anna Noonan, from the university’s school of rural health. “They don’t know that you can’t just go to a public hospital and say, ‘Can I have an abortion,’ or that they would be turned away,” she said. “There is research about where abortion services are, and the experiences of the people who access those services. But what we hardly ever hear is what it is like to not have access to the service at all.” Anne* is one of many in an abortion desert, living in a large regional town in NSW. When she discovered she was pregnant the news came as a surprise. Her hormonal contraception had failed and she was already in her second trimester when the pregnancy was detected. She and her partner had met later in life and both had children from previous relationships. They decided not to have another child. Anne was seen at her local hospital but there were no providers who could perform an abortion at her gestation of pregnancy. To access the procedure, she and her partner had to travel hundreds of kilometres to Sydney, each taking three days of leave from work. The couple paid several thousand dollars for a surgical termination and accommodation costs. “Luckily, we could afford to take the time off work … that time, that flexibility, that money would not be available to a lot of people in that situation,” her partner said. Guardian Australia asked all 15 NSW local health districts which public hospitals under their management offer surgical abortion, under what circumstances abortion is offered (for example, is it only offered if the health of the mother and/or foetus is at risk?), and what happens when a woman is told no abortion service is available (are they referred on, as required by law, and what does an onward referral involve?). None of the LHDs would answer any of the questions asked by Guardian Australia, despite being provided multiple opportunities to do so. Instead, Guardian Australia was referred to NSW Health, which also refused to answer specific questions about the hospitals which offer abortion, and under what circumstances. The NSW health minister, Ryan Park, also would not provide this information. “In most cases, medical or surgical abortions can be provided in the community or non-admitted settings,” he said. He did not answer where those settings were or which cases were approved. Prof Kirsten Black, the Sexual Reproductive Health Committee chair for the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said: “It is completely unacceptable that there is no transparent access to information about abortion care” in NSW. She said the only way to ensure that there was equitable access to termination services was to ensure there was public hospital availability across all hospitals in the state. “RANZCOG believes that abortion is essential healthcare,” she said. Dr Madeleine Belfrage, from the University of Sydney’s Social Sciences and Humanities Advanced Research Centre, said the researchers already knew that the distribution of services for both medication and surgical abortion in NSW disproportionately disadvantaged people who don’t live in Sydney or near the coast but the extent was “shocking”. “Seeing the sheer size and magnitude of abortion deserts across such a vast expanse of NSW shocked our team,” she said. “Perhaps even more shocking was how much the abortion deserts would shrink if all public hospitals provided this care,” Belfrage said. “It led us to question: why on earth are NSW public hospitals, particularly those outside urban centres, not providing this care to their rural communities?” She said it was clear that abortion is still not integrated into mainstream health service provision, despite being legal in all states and territories. “It is both disappointing and not a surprise to hear that LHDs were not able to confirm if, when, and where abortion services are provided within their public hospital networks,” Belfrage said. “As our maps show, in many areas of NSW the lack of local services, particularly by public hospitals, forces people seeking an abortion to travel hundreds of kilometres away. “There is no other public health service we can think of where duty of care to provide a routine procedure is obfuscated in this way, leaving communities in abortion deserts with significant unmet need,” Belfrage said. Last Thursday a report published by Family Planning Australia revealed that women in regional and rural NSW sought medical abortion at more than double the rate of city women. In remote NSW there were 10 medical abortion prescriptions issued for every 1,000 women, the latest available data, from 2022, showed. In major cities there were 4.2 medical abortion prescriptions for every 1,000 women. Guardian Australia previously reported that a small but influential number of medical practitioners who obstruct abortion care or were uninterested in providing it were also leaving women unable to access abortion in many parts of rural NSW. Black said that abortion should be provided like any other health service. “There should be available pathways through all public hospital systems,” she said. “Referral pathways must be transparent and easy to access, both for the public, and general practitioners who need to refer women who require a surgical termination or those who have had a medical abortion who require further care. “The provision of abortion services in public hospitals normalises this care and provides nurses, midwives and doctors with training and experience in termination services.” *Name has been changed for privacy • Do you know more? melissa.davey@theguardian.com The Abortion Desert Map was developed by the Access All Areas research collective at the University of Sydney and Ri Liu, an independent data visualisation specialist.

          "headline": "UK politics: Starmer accused of ‘sycophantic’ tone towards Chinese as Yang Tengbo denies being a spy – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "The alleged Chinese spy with links to Prince Andrew and who made connections at the heart of the UK establishment has been named as Yang Tengbo, a businessman also known as Chris Yang. In the Commons Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, accused Keir Starmer of being “sycophantic” to the Chinese president. (See 4.04pm.) Dan Jarvis, the security minister, said at least Starmer did not take Xi Jinping to the pub, as David Cameron did. A flat tax rate is an “attractive idea”, which the Conservatives would aim for if in power, Kemi Badenoch has said. Chris Wormald, the new cabinet secretary, has told the country’s half a million civil servants they must “do things differently” to deliver Keir Starmer’s plans for government. UK businesses are cutting staff numbers at the fastest rate since the global financial crisis, according to a closely watched business survey blaming the government’s tax-raising budget. A woman who threw a milkshake over Nigel Farage during the general election campaign has been given a 13-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months. In a post on social media, Farage said the sentence was too light. We now live in a country where you can assault a Member of Parliament and not go to prison. The latest example of two-tier justice. The removal of district councils in England could leave to parish and town councillors playing a bigger role, says Prof Joanie Willett, a local government specialist at the University of Exeter. In a comment on the government’s plans, she says: Removing borough councils raises questions about the potential for town and parish councils to take a step up in local governance, with a more important profile. This could boost democracy, if town and parish councils can be adequately supported. And here is some more expert reaction to the English devolution white paper. From Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive at the LGIU (Local Government Information Unit), a thinktank The government’s devolution agenda as set out in today’s White Paper is ambitious and far reaching. At LGIU, we have for many years argued that complex problems find their best solutions locally and that power needs to be devolved from Whitehall to our regions, councils and communities. Localism is both a democratic good and a better way of getting things done. On that basis, we welcome the white paper’s intent and direction of travel, though we believe it should also include a real commitment to fiscal devolution. From Akash Paun, programme director for devolution at the Institute for Government thinktank Empowering metro mayors to lead on strategic planning for their regions is sensible and could be crucial for the government’s ability to meet its growth and home-building targets – the Institute for Government has long argued that mayors are well-placed to develop and deliver regional plans for housing, transport and other infrastructure. It is also important that the government extends devolution to the 50% of England that has so far been left out. We welcome the publication of the white paper. But devolution is no magic bullet. To make this work, the government also needs to invest properly in institutional capacity and new accountability systems at the devolved level. From Cllr John Merry, chair of Key Cities, a network of smallish cities, mostly Labour run Devolution is a powerful tool for driving the local growth this country desperately needs, but its success hinges on recognising the diversity of UK cities and regions. That’s why Key Cities supports large parts of the devolution bill, which will empower many of our local leaders. However, our members are concerned that a “one-size-fits-all” model could have a counter-intuitive effect. Our 2024 survey of our network (covering approximately 10% of the UK population), found that a quarter of city members would like to better understand how such a model would be applied in very different and unique geographic areas, and for a third it would be undesirable to go down the route of a combined authority (20% are already in a combined authority). Jim McMahon, the local government minister, has been make a Commons statement about the English devolution white paper. In response to a question from Harriett Baldwin (Con) about whether council elections might be cancelled next year, McMahon said that if councils came to government with a credible plan for reorganisation, then elections the year after might be postponed to allow for alternative elections to take place for the shadow authority that would replace the county and district councils (in a two-tier area). But he said there would be no “mass cancellations of elections for the sake of it”. Election Maps UK, a social media account that provides excellent local elections coverage, points out that, if anyone thinks Labour is cancelling elections to keep Labour in power at county council level, they are wrong. Before there’s a tinfoil hat shortage, a reminder of who currently controls County Councils in England: Conservative: 19 Lib Dem: 2 Labour: 0 If this were a Government plot to ‘cancel democracy’, they wouldn’t even be benefitting anywhere... FWIW there is precedent for this. Council elections in North Yorkshire, Somerset, Cumberland, and Westmorland &amp; Furness were postponed in February 2021 - 3 months before scheduled elections - for the same reason (transition from CC to UA). The Conservative party has criticised the English devolution white paper on the grounds that reorganisation will be imposed on local communities if they cannot agree. (See 2.04pm.) A Conservative party spokesperson said: The Conservatives believe in local democracy. Under the last Government devolution was extended across England, and councils which wanted to unitarise were supported to do so. Angela Rayner’s announcement is part of a plan by Labour to strip councils of their powers to make choices and to impose reorganisation from Westminster without local consent. The Green party has also claimed the plans are undemocratic. This is from Adrian Ramsay, the Green party’s co-leader, echoing some of the points made by the District Councils’ Network. (See 4.58pm.) Local democracy is in urgent need of reform but this White Paper does not deliver the real change our local councils need. It steals power away from local people and risks making the real changes required harder to achieve, including building the homes we need, cleaning our rivers, reforming social care and greening our local economies. We should trust local communities to make the right decisions on homes, food, energy, nature and adapting to the climate crisis. Instead, these plans risk moving power away from local councils to huge remote super councils and regional mayors. And the Liberal Democrats have criticised the plans for neglecting social care (a priority issue for the party). Vikki Slade, the party’s local government spokesperson, said: Council budgets are on the brink. The previous Conservative government pushed so many local authorities to the edge of bankruptcy. Without properly investing in social care more of the vital services that councils provide will disappear to those who desperately need them. Organisations representing councils in England are divided over the plans in the English devolution white paper to get rid of the remaining two-tier council areas. In areas with county councils and district councils operating alongside each other, the government wants new unitary councils, which in most cases, it says, will mean “creating councils with a population of 500,000 or more”. This councils may therefore look more like county councils than district councils and that explains why the County Councils Network is more enthusiastic. Tim Oliver, its chair, said in a statement: We welcome the white paper outlining that new unitary councils should have a population of 500,000 or more. We look forward to further details on the criteria and process for reorganisation, but with council finances under severe strain it is imperative that reform ensures that new unitary councils have the size and scale necessary to deliver substantial long-term savings, minimise disruption to care services and maintain strong tax bases well into the future. Any decisions on local government reorganisation by ministers must be evidence-based and ensure that county councils are not split into multiple small unitary councils that cannot fulfil the ambitions of this white paper. But the District Councils’ Network is much more critical. Its chair, Sam Chapman-Allen, said: District councils are close to communities, which makes us responsive, approachable, trusted and understanding of local needs. The danger is that all of this is lost in the top-down imposition of mega councils – regional, rather than local government covering many hundreds of thousands or even millions of people. Bigger isn’t intrinsically better. While we welcome the government’s commitment to extend devolution England-wide, the imposition of mega councils with a minimum population of 500,000 is the opposite of devolution, taking powers away from local communities. Chapman-Allen also claimed the reorganisation could put local services at risk. Services including parks, leisure centres, street cleaning and waste collection are hugely valued by our local communities and bring about local pride and prosperity – but the danger is that new unitary councils have no option but to cut them to withstand growing social care costs. Social care’s funding crisis must be resolved urgently but not at the expense of services such as housing and planning, which are integral to the government’s house-building goals, and work to build local economies, which contributes to the government’s aim to grow the national economy. The danger is that local work to prevent ill-health and homelessness, which saves the rest of the public sector millions of pounds, also has to be scaled back. Oliver and Chapman-Allen are both Conservative councillors, although the CCN and the DCN are both cross-party organisations. Tom Tugendhat, the former security minister, told MPs that when he was in office in the last government, he was told by officials that FIRS would be ready to launch at the end of this year. He said the only thing that changed was the party in power. He also said that, if China was not in the enhanced tier, “it’s not worth having”. Jarvis said that he had known Tugendhat a long time, and was asking him to trust him when he said officials told them the scheme was not “ready to go” when Labour took office. Paul Waugh (Lab) said that Chris Philp should be criticising his own party for sycophancy towards China. (See 4.04pm.) He said, when he was working as a journalist before he became an MP, he was with Theresa May when she visited China. And May was praised by Chinese state media because she sidelined human rights issues, he said. Christine Jardine from the Liberal Democrats asked Jarvis for an assurance that the government would not weaken its stance on human rights in dealings with China. Jarvis said the government had to “weigh a number of considerations” when dealing with China, but that national security would always come first. Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said he was grateful to the government for arranging a security briefing for him on this story earlier today. He urged the government to implement FIRS quickly. And he called for a rethink in its China policy. Given what we’ve learned and what we know, these very close relations that the prime minister is apparently attempting may not be wise, and the rather sycophantic tone the prime minister took with President Xi at the G20 a few weeks ago may not be very wise in light of what we now. Jarvis said he did not agree with this assessment. Referring to what happened when David Cameron was prime minister, and he hosted President Xi during his visit to the UK, Jarvis said: At least [Keir Starmer] least he did not take him to the pub for a pint. Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader who tabled the UQ, said that there are 40,000 people working for the Chinese United Front Work Department. They have penetrated every sector of the economy, he says. He urged the government to put China in the enhanced sphere for FIRS (ie, to subject to to extra checks, because of the higher risk it poses). He said Tom Tugendhat, the former security minister, has said the last government was about to put China on the list in this category. And he said the UK was buying solar panels from China made with slave labour. “Far from challenging China on human rights, it now appears we are turning a blind eye to them,” he said. In response, Dan Jarvis, the Home Office minister, said FIRS was not ready to go live when Labour took office. He said the plans were “not sufficiently robust”. As for whether China would be included in the enhanced sphere, he said the Home Office would be setting out its approach to using this sphere in due course. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, tells Jarvis that the government should have agreed to give a statement on this. It should not just be responding to an urgent question, he says. And he tells Iain Duncan Smith that he should not have told the media in advance about his plan to table this UQ. Dan Jarvis, the security minister, is responding. He says the government is glad that the Home Office’s decision to exclude Yang Tengbo in this case was upheld by the courts. He says the head of MI5 has said the UK is facing the most complex threat environment he has ever seen. The National Security Act is essential, he says. He says six people have already been charged under the Act. And, on China, he says the government’s position is to challenge where it must, compete where it has to, and cooperate where it can. He says the details of the foreign influence registration scheme (FIRS) will be set out in the new year, and the scheme will come operational in the summer, he says. Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, says the Commons starts court sub judice rules. It is important that MPs do not subvert what courts have to decide, he says. He says a court has decided to lift the anonymity ruling in the case of the alleged Chinese spy. He also says MPs are only allowed to criticise the conduct of members of the royal family when they are debating a substantive motion covering that. That is not the case this afternoon, he says. The Commons urgent question on China will start imminently. Kemi Badenoch has said that she finds the idea of introducing a flat tax “very attractive” in principle – but unaffordable at present. She made the comment in response to a question at the event this afternoon organised for groups campaigning about the extension of inhertance tax to farms. Asked by a business owner if she would consider getting rid of most taxes and replacing them with a flat tax, a single rate of income tax for everyone, she replied: This is an idea that I’ve heard many times. It’s very attractive, but if we’re going to get to that sort of scenario, there’s a lot of work we need to do first hand. At the moment, we are a welfare state with a little bit of a productivity attached to it. We’ve got to turn that around. We cannot afford flat taxes where we are now. We need to make sure we rewire our economy so that we can lighten the burden of tax and the regulation on individuals and on those businesses that are just starting out, in particular. People see the businesses that close. They don’t see the businesses that never started in the first place. Tory rightwingers have long been attracted by the idea of a flat tax. When Liz Truss was preparing to take over as prime minister, Jacob Rees Mogg urged her to get rid of all direct taxes and replace them with a flat rate of income tax, set at 20p in the pound. He was inspired by the version in Estonia and he claimed it would cost £41bn. Truss reportedly described this as a “great idea”, but even she drew the line at implementing it. As well as cost, another disadvantage with flat taxes is that they do not allow scope for exemptions – like the one farmers have enjoyed from inheritance tax. In her speech this afternoon Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, said that, as well as extending the number of mayoral authorities, she would be given them “unprecedented new powers”. Here is the passage from the speech where she explained what those powers would be. Too often, mayors hands are tied by Whitehall … So we will create a clear and transparent route for all mayoral combined authorities to receive an integrated settlement. This means moving resources between projects that matches what the people need. We will give mayors new powers over strategic planning and new call-in powers so that they can build the homes we need and plan for growth on a larger scale. And we will get mayors working more closely with Homes England to unlock new homes. The most mature areas will be able to set the strategic direction of any future affordable homes programme. We will devolve future funding to support regeneration and housing delivery, and we will consolidate adult skills funding, introducing joint ownership of the local skills improvement plan and new routes to influence 16 to 19 provision. And we will devote funding to support economically inactive people into work, and funding for retrofit will be included in the integrated settlements by the end of the parliament. We will also create a statutory role for mayors in governing the rail network, with a right to request on rail devolution. This all means easier commutes, across more joined-up transport links, new homes properly connected to local infrastructure and skills provision that matches local job opportunities. And this is how she summed up the plans. We have an economy that hoards potential and a politics that hoards power. So our devolution revolution will deliver the greatest transfer of power from Whitehall to our communities in a generation, empowering those communities to realise their potential. No other government has been this ambitious about devolution, a mission that binds all departments across government, a long-term mission over generations rather than a short-term fix. Yang Tengbo has released a statement saying that to call him a spy is “entirely untrue”. He says he loves Britain and “would never do anything to harm the interests of the UK”. Here is the statement in full. Due to the high level of speculation and misreporting in the media and elsewhere, I have asked my legal team to disclose my identity. I have done nothing wrong or unlawful and the concerns raised by the Home Office against me are ill-founded. The widespread description of me as a ‘spy’ is entirely untrue. This is why I applied for a review of the Home Office decision in the first place, and why I am seeking permission to appeal the SIAC [special immigration appeals commission] decision. It is also why an order extending my anonymity up to the point of determination of the appeal process was granted. I have been excluded from seeing most of the evidence that was used against me under a process which is widely acknowledged by SIAC practitioners as inherently unfair: decisions are made based on secret evidence and closed proceedings, which has been described as “taking blind shots at a hidden target”. On their own fact finding, even the three judges in this case concluded that there was ‘not an abundance of evidence’ against me, their decision was ‘finely balanced’, and there could be an ‘innocent explanation’ for my activities. This has not been reported in the media. The political climate has changed, and unfortunately, I have fallen victim to this. When relations are good, and Chinese investment is sought, I am welcome in the UK. When relations sour, an anti-China stance is taken, and I am excluded. I am an independent self-made entrepreneur and I have always aimed to foster partnerships and build bridges between East and West. I have dedicated my professional life in the UK to building links between British and Chinese businesses. My activities have played a part in bringing hundreds of millions of pounds of investment into the UK. I built my private life in the UK over two decades and love the country as my second home. I would never do anything to harm the interests of the UK. Opposition parties and farmers have taken over the London Palladium today to run a conference opposing Labour’s changes to inheritance tax which they says risks putting family farms out of business. Andrew Lloyd Webber has lent the palatial theatre to farmers, as his land will also be subject to inheritance tax. Speaking under the sparkly Robin Hood pantomime set - the panto is taking place shortly after the conference - shadow environment secretary Victoria Atkins vowed the Conservatives will reverse the tax changes if they get back into government. She said: You are the families that work day in day out. Your children are on the farm as soon as they can squeeze a pair of wellies onto their feet. You are the families that this Christmas Day will be having your fun and enjoying Christmas Day, but you’ll also be out on the farm, feeding livestock, making sure that everything is ticking over whilst everybody else is enjoying the Christmas lunches that you and our farmers have produced. You are the families that continue working well beyond retirement age, because that’s what farming is. It’s not a job. It is a way of life. It is a vocation. Liberal Democrat environment spokesperson Tim Farron also spoke. He said: The narrative that is put out there is that these are wealthy, wealthy people who should be paying inheritance tax like everybody else. And that’s a complete nonsense when you understand the reality of life … the typical farmer in my community is sitting on a farm that may be worth millions of pounds, and typically they will be earning significantly, significantly less than the minimum wage. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has now published the English devolution white paper. Q: What evidence is there that mayors make a difference? Rayner says she thinks that the evidence is there. She cites growth as one factor. And transport connectivity is another factor, she says. But she says mayors are frustrated because they think, with more powers, they could deliver more. She says there is potential growth worth billions that can be unlocked. Q: What role will transport play in your growth mission? Rayner says transport in the north-west, around Manchester, is a nightmare. She wants Manchester to have a transport system as the one in place in London. Q: Will all elections next May go ahead? If they don’t, people will feel a right has been taken away? Rayner says the government is not looking at delaying local elections. It wants reform. If they get to reform quickly, that is an issue they might come to. Q: How long will it take to bring in these strategic planning powers? Rayner says some of this will be in the devolution bill. But some collaboration is happening already, she says. The alleged Chinese spy who got close to Prince Andrew as a way to gain access to the UK establishment has been named as Yang Tengbo, a businessman also known as Chris Yang, Jessica Elgot and Peter Walker report. Rayner is now taking questions. Q: Mayors want powers over post-16 education. What will happen if mayors want powers you are not willing to give them? Q: How can I explain to people what this will mean to voters? Q: Some mayors want fiscal devolution – things like a tourism tax. You are not offering that. Could that change? Rayner is answering all three questions together. She says Whitehall will have to give a good reason if it is refusing requests for new powers from mayors. On taxation, she says mayors will have more flexibility over who they use council tax receipts. She says she has never seen a more “scary’” group than what she calls “the pride” of Labour mayors. She says they are sharing information. She says she expects them to demand more. UPDATE: Rayner said: There is kind of a theme here of ‘wow, that is great, but we want more’, which is even better. It is evolution as well as revolution and you have seen that some areas where we have got combined authorities have gone much further because they have been able to do that, and we want to push that. This white paper and the bill that we will be putting forward will be a default for devolution, so Whitehall would have to give a good excuse as to why they wouldn’t give those areas the devolution. We want to make sure we do that whether it is the post-16 skills or any other element. Rayner says, as well as extending the number of mayoral authorities, she wants to give them more powers. Rayner says having the right powers in the right place (the goal of the devolution plans) can revive faith in democracy. She praises initiatives already taken by Labour metro mayors, including Oxford Street regeneration in London, the train service in Liverpool, buses under local control in Manchester, and clean energy jobs in the East Midlands. She says the last Labour government introduced devolution for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But in England devolution has been a patchwork, she says. She goes on: Under the Conservatives, devolution has often meant creating a patchwork of individual deals benefiting some parts of the country while other parts have missed out. Well, no more. With our Plan for Change … it’s time for a completely new way of governing, one that unites public and private sectors, at all levels of government, business, and unions and the whole of civil society. Rayner says in future devolution “no longer be agreed by the whim of a minister in Whitehall. It will now be default in our constitution.” Ultimately, our aim is mayoral devolution over areas of genuine strategic scale, and to create strategic authorities as a new tier of local government to give our cities and regions a bigger voice. And, if local leaders cannot agree on a mayoral model, Whitehall will impose one, she says. So I will legislate for a new power of ministerial directive which will allow central government to knock heads together and create strategic authorities where local leaders cannot agree. Angela Rayner starts by saying this is a moment that people have been waiting for for a long time – “the turning point when people and places across England finally begin to take back control over the things that matter to them”. Tracy Brabin says, “if growth is the question, devolution is the answer”. Angela Rayner, the deputy PM, is about to give her speech in Leeds on the devolution white paper for England. There is a live feed here. Tracy Brabin, the West Yorkshire mayor, is introducing her. Chris Wormald has started work today as the new cabinet secretary. Announcing his appointment two weeks ago, Keir Starmer said that changing Britain would require “nothing less than the complete rewiring of the British state to deliver bold and ambitious long-term reform”. Today, in an email to civil servants, Wormald, former permanent secretary at the Department for Health and Social Care, says they will all have to “do things differently” to deliver on this. He says this can happen, because he has seen the civil service adapt before. He says: As cabinet secretary, it is my role to support the prime minister and government to deliver for the country. The prime minister has been clear that he wants a rewiring of the way the government works to deliver his recently announced Plan for Change. This will require all of us to do things differently - from working much more effectively across departments to taking advantage of the major opportunities technology provides. Throughout my career, I have seen the civil service adapt and change to achieve incredible things for the people of the United Kingdom. I know that together we will relish the opportunities the coming years will bring. The polling company Ipsos has published its latest monthly Political Monitor report and the figures are not encouraging for Keir Starmer. They show no prime minister has had such low net satisfaction ratings after five months in office since the firm started collecting data on this in the late 1970s. There is one prime minister who was more unpopular – but Liz Truss did not last five months, and so she is not included in this chart. Net satisfaction with the government as a whole is also much lower than for most of its predecessors after five months in office – although Boris Johnson’s was just as unpopular at this point, and Rishi Sunak’s even more so. The polling also shows that no new opposition leader in the past 50 years has recorded a lower first net approval rating than Kemi Badenoch. Only one person started off this low (on net -15). But that was Margaret Thatcher, and so Badenoch may be happy with the comparision. Commenting on the figures, Keiran Pedley, director of UK politics at Ipsos, said: These findings reflect the difficult start Labour has had in office. Keir Starmer’s personal satisfaction ratings after 5 months are the weakest of all prime ministers measured by Ipsos going back to the late 1970s and nearly two-thirds expect the economy to worsen in the next year. However, with a large majority in parliament and the next election potentially as late as 2029, Labour still has time to turn things around. Lindsay Hoyle, the Commons Speaker, has said he will allow an urgent question on China. A Home Office minister will respond to Sir Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader, who has asked for a statement “on the extent of United Front Work Department operations within the UK”. The UQ will take place at 3.30pm. The UFWD is the Chinese intelligence gathering unit. Isabel Hilton had a good explainer in the Observer yesterday. Earlier, at 2pm, there will be a court hearing relating to the court order saying “H6”, the alleged Chinese spy who befriended Prince Andrew, cannot be named. UK businesses are cutting staff numbers at the fastest rate since the global financial crisis, according to a closely watched business survey blaming the government’s tax-raising budget. Richard Partington has the story. There will be two government statements in the Commons this afternoon. Jim McMahon, the local government minister will give one on the devolution white paper, and Justin Madders, the business minister, will give one on the Royal Mail takeover. One of the proposals in the white paper is to change the structure of local government in England in the 21 counties where there is two-tier local government (a county council and district councils). The government wants to replace those with unitary authorities, which is the system that has been in place in Scotland and Wales since the 1990s. Some parts of England are also served by unitary authorities. In an interview on ITV’s Good Morning Britain earlier, McMahon claimed this reorganisation could save £2bn. He explained: Where we are looking at reorganisation is to reflect the reality, which is that there are efficiencies that can be made by bringing councils together that could amount to over £2bn. And if it’s a choice between £2bn in the running cost of an organisation or £2 billion on frontline neighbourhood services, I would say that most of the public want that investment in the frontline. McMahon also claimed getting rid of the two-tier system would make it easier of people to understand who did what. He said: I hear a lot from local people who live in two-tier areas where they don’t know which council to go to. You go to one council for some services, you go to another council for others. And actually in many cases there are councillors that are dual-hatted, that will sit on both councils. So this is about simplifying the system so that the accountability is strong, but it’s not to diminish the work that district councils and county councils have done in the past. Under Labour the UK government has adopted a more conciliatory approach to China than under the Conservatives. Keir Starmer set this out last month when he met the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at the G20 summit in Brazil. This is not because the Whitehall assessment of the security threat posed by China, or its human rights record, has changed; it is more to do with Labour prioritising economic growth, and wanting to minimise impediments to that. Starmer’s comments during the press conference this morning (see 11.01am and 11.06am) imply he has not revised his view in the light of the recent “H6” alleged spy revelations. Q: Did you talk about what a Trump presidency might mean for Ukraine? Starmer says he and Støre have both spoken to Donald Trump. Starmer says he met Trump for dinner in New York before the US presidential election. He says allies have stood together behind Ukraine. There is a consensus that they must call out Russian aggression for what it is, and put Ukraine in the strongest possible position, Starmer says. Støre, who has spoken to Trump by phone, says: My perception was that the president was in a listening mode. He’s been calling many colleagues in Europe, trying to find out the thinking here, and appreciating that this is complex. I think that that’s the right point of departure. And our message is that the sooner the Americans can define their strategy and their approach, the better, because that will bring some clarity to the approach on how this [will work out]. And that was the end of the press conference. Q: [From PA Media] When will the the foreign influence registration scheme (FIRS) come into effect? Has the delay enabled this spy incident to happen? And does this mean the UK is the weakest link in the five eyes security alliance (as Iain Duncan Smith alleged this morning – see 9.46am)? Starmer says the government has been working on the FIRS “from day one in government”. He says there will be “an update coming shortly”. Asked again about China, Starmer says: Our approach is the approach I’ve just set out. It’s important to engage. Of course, we have to challenge where we must, but it’s better to engage, to challenge, than to stay aside, as it were, important to cooperate where we can on issues like climate change, which need that cooperation. So I’m very pleased with the engagement and the progress that we’ve made. Q: [From a Norwegian broadcaster] We have seen the story about Prince Andrew. What conversations have you had with Buckingham Palace about this? And do you think the UK is too soft on China? Starmer says there is a long-standing convention that the PM does not discuss conversations with Buckingham Palace. He goes on: Of course, we are concerned about the challenge that China poses. As you know, I had a meeting with the [Chinese] president just a few weeks ago. Our approach is one of engagement, of cooperating where we need to cooperate, particularly for example on issues like climate change, to challenge where we must and where we should, particularly on issues like human rights, and to compete when it comes to trade. Starmer and Støre are now taking questions. Q: Can you update us on what safeguards might be offered to Ukraine if there is a ceasefire agreement? Støre says they both think the war should end. It could end if Russia pulls out. There should be no negotiations without Ukraine, he says. He says Norway and other countries have already agreed security guarantees for Ukraine. But he says he cannot comment on how those might change in response to peace negotiations. Starmer agrees. He says they do not know if there will be negotiations. But it important to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position. Both countries are providing training to Ukraine’s military. He says he does not know what negotiations might lead to, or what security guarantees might have to be put in place. But it would be a “big mistake to take our eye off the ball”, he says. It would be a big mistake, in my view, to take our eye off the ball and not ensure that Ukraine is in the strongest possible position, which is why we’ve been doubling down on this at many of the international meetings we’ve had with our allies. Keir Starmer and his Norwegian counterpart Jonas Gahr Støre are now speaking to journalists in Bergen about the green industrial deal they have agreed. (See 10.44am.) Støre says some years ago carbon capture and storage would have sounded like science fiction. But it is now part of dealing with the climate crisis. Starmer says the deal will take the relationship with Norway to a new chapter. For many decades, the UK and Norway have worked together on energy policy. And he says the defence relationship between the two countries is strong. Keir Starmer has said that a green industrial partnership with Norway announced today will help the UK become a world leader in carbon capture usage and storage (CCUS). In a statement ahead of his visit to Bergen, he said: This green industrial partnership will allow us to seize the opportunities from a new era of clean energy, driving investment into the UK and boosting jobs both now and in the future. It will harness the UK’s unique potential to become a world-leader in carbon capture – from the North Sea to the coastal south – reigniting industrial heartlands and delivering on our Plan for Change. Our partnership with Norway will make the UK more energy secure, ensuring we are never again exposed to international energy price spikes and the whims of dictators like Putin. In a briefing on the partnership deal, which is due to be signed next spring, No 10 said: Norway is currently leading the world on CCUS, and the UK wants to join it at the forefront, having announced a £21.7bn funding commitment in October to cement Britain as one of the most advanced CCUS markets globally and pave the way for further innovation. The UK has enough capacity to store 200 years’ worth of emissions. This makes CCUS a revolutionary method in tackling the climate crisis and helping industry to decarbonise. The UK and Norway also hold the majority of the carbon storage potential in the North Sea, so are strategically placed to support Europe to meet its net zero ambitions and provide greater energy security. The sale of Royal Mail’s parent company to the Czech billionaire Daniel Křetínský has been approved by the UK government after a review under national security laws, Jasper Jolly reports. Jim McMahon, the local government minister, was doing an interview round this morning, talking about the devolution white paper. Asked if he thought H6, the alleged Chinese spy, should be named, he said it was a matter for the courts. Asked on the Today programe what the government’s view was, McMahon replied: “The government believes it’s for the courts to decide.” Iain Duncan Smith was not the only Conservative MP who described the alleged Chinese spy “H6” as the “tip of the iceberg” on the media this morning. In an interview on BBC Breakfast Tom Tugendhat, the former security minister, said: I’m absolutely certain that there are members of the United Front Work Department [a Chinese intelligence gathering unit] who are active right now in attempting to influence journalism, academics, politics, and the whole lot. This is really the tip of the iceberg. And so the story I can understand why it’s been about Prince Andrew, but it’s not really about Prince Andrew. It’s about the way the Chinese Communist Party is seeking to exert influence here in the United Kingdom. Keir Starmer has held a meeting with his Norwegian counterpart Jonas Gahr Støre. Before they met, Støre said: This is possibly the strongest of friendship for Norway, across the North Sea. A lot of history and common experience but now we are really strengthened by common issues right ahead of us – security, a more unstable Europe that is going to require defence co-operation and also energy and climate. And Starmer said: It’s really fantastic to be here today. As you rightly say between our two countries huge shared history, forged sometimes in difficult circumstances but a very, very strong history, shared thinking, shared values. And strategically we’re very, very closely bound together of course on issues of defence and security but also on questions of energy. Good morning. MPs are pushing for a government statement, or an urgent question (UQ), in the Commons this afternoon that would cover the activities of “H6”, the alleged Chinese spy who befriended Prince Andrew. As Peter Walker reports, Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and prominent China hawk who has said he is tabling a UQ, told the Today programme this morning that H6 might just be “the tip of the iceberg” in terms of Beijing’s efforts to infiltrate the UK. Here is Peter’s story. And here is Archie Bland’s First Edition briefing on the story, including further information about who H6 is. The media cannot name H6 because of a court order. In parliament MPs have absolute privilege, which means they can ignore a court order like this without having to worry about being prosecuted for contempt of court, and there has been speculation that an MP might use privilege to identify H6 this afternoon. But there is no free-for-all in the House of Commons, the Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, generally tries to stop MPs ignoring court orders of this kind and he has a lot of leeway to constrain debate. He also gets to decide whether a UQ is granted, and normally he works on the basis that if an MP is telling the media first that they are applying for a UQ, that is a reason for not allowing it. It is quite possible we might get to the end of the day without this coming up in the chamber at all. But Keir Starmer won’t be able to avoid questions on this. He is in Norway, where he is due to speak to reporters later this morning, and he is bound to be asked about H6. Starmer may also be asked about why the government is delaying implementing the foreign influence registration scheme (FIRS). This measure was part of the National Security Act 2023 but has still not been enacted. It requires people working on behalf of foreign governments in the UK to register. But it also includes an “enhanced tier”, posing tougher requirements on people working on behalf of states seen as posing more of a risk. The government cannot set the scheme up without deciding whether or not to include China in the “enhanced tier” and this decision is problematic. Security experts say China should obviously be in this category, as the H6 story illustrates. But China would view this as an insult, and categorising it alongside Russia, Iran etc might kibosh Starmer’s efforts to improve economic relations with Beijing. The Home Office has been saying it has had to delay implementation of FIRS because the legislation was not left in a fit state. But this morning Duncan Smith told the Today programme that he did not believe that, and that the government was just making up an excuse to avoid offending China. He also told the programme that the UK was seen by allies as the “soft underbelly” because of its reluctance to confront China. There is nothing wrong with the foreign influence registration scheme. ‘It’s not fit for purpose’, I don’t believe a word of that, nobody with half a brain will believe a word of that. The reality is, it’s an excuse not to upset China. We are now seen, I think, by our five eyes security partners, as the soft underbelly of that alliance and that’s a real worry. The last Conservative government was also criticised for delaying the implementation of FIRS. Here is the agenda for the day. 10.30am: Keir Starmer is due to hold a press conference in Norway with his Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Gahr Støre. He is in the country to launch a green industrial partnership. Later he will be travelling to Estonia. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 1.50pm: Angela Rayner, the deputy prime minister, gives a speech in Leeds giving details of her devolution white paper for England. 2.30pm: Liz Kendall, the work and pensions secretary, takes questions in the Commons. 2.40pm: Kemi Badenoch gives a speech on Labour’s economic policies at an event organised by opponents of the government’s plans to extend inheritance tax to farms. 4.30pm: David Lammy, the foreign secretary, and John Healey, the defence secretary, speak at a press conference after an Aukus summit held with their Australian counterparts.

          "bodyText": "Lauren Bell took four wickets as England fought back on day two of their one-off Test match against South Africa and extended their lead to 145 runs in Bloemfontein. Despite their solid start, a batting collapse saw the Proteas dismissed for 281 in response to the visitors’ opening-day 395 for nine declared. Captain Laura Wolvaardt put on a 92-run partnership with Annerie Dercksen, making 65 before being dismissed by Sophie Ecclestone. Sune Luus and Marizanne Kapp proved a difficult duo to break as the pair added 99 in the afternoon, but debutant Ryana MacDonald-Gay found the breakthrough by bowling Kapp for her first Test wicket, then dismissed Nadine de Klerk for a duck after lightning caused a break in play. Bell completed South Africa’s demise with three quick wickets, including two in two balls. The hosts claimed a valuable wicket by dismissing Maia Bouchier for a duck, but Tammy Beaumont and Heather Knight steered England to 31 for one at stumps. PA Media Lauren Bell, who took four wickets, has had a chat with TMS. “It’s been a great day, we’d have taken that at the start, they had patches of good partnerships, we’re really happy. My job is to swing it and take new-ball wickets and Filer’s is to bowl fast. The pitch is giving us movement and the ball is wobbling. England will be heading Down Under in January for the Women’s Ashes. “We’re playing in a country with similar conditions to Australia, so it’s really important,” Bell adds. “We’ve said at the start of the game how amazing a result is in Test cricket. Things can change very quickly but we’ll take it an hour at a time.” Why not sign up for The Spin, our weekly cricket newsletter sent bouncing into your inbox every week? The South Africa captain, Laura Wolvaardt, has a quick word with the umpires – perhaps about that rain-free weather delay earlier, which threw off the hosts’ batting rhythm. Still, there was lightning. So ends a day where England began on top, saw South Africa work their way towards parity, and then regained the momentum as the hosts’ tail failed entirely to wag. They lead by 145 runs, with plenty of time to build a lead and then get the wickets required to win. 14th over: England 31-1 (Knight 19, Beaumont 8) Knight takes a single to rotate the strike, leaving Beaumont to see out the rest of Sekhukhune’s over – the last of the day. There’s a nervy moment as the ball gets lost under her feet, before the final ball is crunched away, but well-fielded for a single. And that’s stumps. 13th over: England 29-1 (Knight 18, Beaumont 7) Beaumont is bamboozled by Mlaba, trying to sweep, missing and getting a lucky break as the ball squirms through the wicketkeeper’s legs. Four leg byes, followed up with a much cleaner sweep shot off her 30th ball faced that more than doubles her run tally. 12th over: England 21-1 (Knight 18, Beaumont 3) Sekhukune will get a chance before stumps – the fifth bowler to feature in the first 12 overs. She has Knight on the defensive with a series of accurate, testing deliveries in a maiden. 11th over: England 21-1 (Knight 18, Beaumont 3) Knight now faces the tricky Mlaba and gets beaten by a near-unplayable ball that just misses the edge. The next ball sits up, and Knight drives for a single. England’s lead creeps up to 135. 10th over: England 19-1 (Knight 17, Beaumont 3) Heather Knight is settling any English nerves here, striking another two well-timed boundaries off Dercksen, who is yet to find her rhythm. 9th over: England 11-1 (Knight 8, Beaumont 3) South Africa change it up with Mlaba’s spin as the shadows start to lengthen. She is egged on heartily by her teammates, and watched carefully by Beaumont. Another maiden. 8th over: England 11-1 (Knight 8, Beaumont 3) Annerie Dercksen comes in to the attack, but a poor first ball is flicked away by Heather Knight for four. Another short, wide effort is crashed through the covers by the England captain, who gets the scoreboard moving. 7th over: England 3-1 (Beamount 3, Knight 0) Beaumont goes on the hunt for a boundary, slicing at Kapp’s first ball but its fielded smartly by Dercksen at backward point. 6th over: England 3-1 (Beamount 3, Knight 0) Heather Knight comes in, England opting against night watch for now. Test debutant Bouchier scored 126 in the first innings, and zero in the second. Hlubi continues to look dangerous, a low grubber that Knight does well to leave alone. Maia Bouchier has faced 18 balls without scoring … and now she’s out for a 19-ball duck! It’s a brilliant ball from Hlubi that jags in towards the off-stump and finds the outside edge. What a boost for the hosts! 5th over: England 3-0 (Beamount 3, Bouchier 0) We can play until 6.15pm local time (4.15pm GMT), as long as the light holds. Beaumount runs for two after flicking Kapp into the on-side. A chance to drive through covers off the final ball, but she can’t find the gap. 4th over: England 1-0 (Beamount 1, Bouchier 0) After 18 straight dot-balls, Beaumont nudges one into the covers. Hlubi appeals for lbw as a delivery skids into the pads, but it looked a touch wide. Then, a bouncer digs into the turf and whistles over Bouchier’s head, bouncing again before it reaches Jafta behind the stumps. 3rd over: England 0-0 (Beamount 0, Bouchier 0) Kapp to Maia Bouchier for a second maiden, and third in a row. There are 12 allotted overs left in the day, and presumably at some point, England will score a run. 2nd over: England 0-0 (Beamount 0, Bouchier 0) Ayanda Hlubi to Tammy Beaumont for an uneventful maiden over. TV coverage is saying play will end in 15 minutes, but it’s possible an extra half-hour could be taken if the allotted overs aren’t played out. 1st over: England 0-0 (Beamount 0, Bouchier 0) Marizanne Kapp, who had a long afternoon at the crease, will bowl the first over. She finds movement straight away to test Bouchier in a maiden. Not quite sure at this stage how much time England have to see out here – play is being extended due to the storm delay, but bad light may be a factor. From 237-3, the hosts fell away either side of the storm delay, adding just 44 more runs. England will return to bat out the day with a ton-plus first-innings lead. Lauren Bell ends with figures of 4-49, while MacDonald-Gay took two key wickets on her Test debut. Sciver-Brunt is hooked away by Sekhukhune for a single, which puts Hlubi on strike. The next ball swings away and as Hlubi shuffles to her left, she’s caught lbw to end South Africa’s innings. 88th over: South Africa 280-9 (Sekhukhune 6, Hlubi 1) No hatty for Bell as an attempted yorker goes wide of leg. The last woman in, Ayanda Hlubi, is beaten by a swinging final ball, but South Africa cling on. Nonkululeko Mlaba is out at No 9; 90 minutes ago, the chances of her having to bat today looked remote. It’s a very brief cameo, though: a swing and a miss, Bell uproots her middle stump, and the bowler is on a hat-trick … Lauren Bell gets her third wicket, the ball cutting back in and finding a big old gap, clacking into the off-stump as Jafta fails to sort her feet out. The variety dished up by England’s bowlers got her in a muddle, and South Africa’s collapse continues. Time for drinks. 88th over: South Africa 278-7 (Jafta 8, Sekhukhune 5) From 113-1 and 237-3, falling short of 300 would be a big disappointment for the hosts. Jafta is surviving, not thriving, having hardly settled … 87th over: South Africa 278-7 (Jafta 8, Sekhukhune 5) Filer steps back after another three-over burst, replaced by Nat Sciver-Brunt. We have another delay to cover up a glitching LED screen. Jafta is beaten on the outside by a floating ball that misses the edge. 86th over: South Africa 275-7 (Jafta 7, Sekhukhune 4) Tumi Sekhukhune walks out to face Lauren Bell, her side teetering on the brink … and the lefty smashes her first ball through the covers for four! Shot. They’ll need a few more of those from the tail-enders. Chloe Tryon shakes her head after a sorry looking shot, badly mistimed and wafted to Tammy Beaumont at mid-on. A promising start snuffed out, and England are well on top now. 86th over: South Africa 271-6 (Tryon 20, Jafta 7) The inky black clouds are receding, and it’s looking sunny and serene in Bloemfontein. Tryon attempts to drive Lauren Bell back down the ground, but sends the ball crashing into the stumps at the non-striker’s end … 85th over: South Africa 271-6 (Tryon 20, Jafta 7) Sinalo Jafta gets in on the act, dispatching a full Filer delivery through square leg for four. There’s another pause as Jafta asks for the white curtain to be pulled back over an LED screen. Another bouncing ball smacks Tryon on her right glove; she’s suffering for her craft out there. 84th over: South Africa 265-6 (Tryon 19, Jafta 2) Because of the break in play earlier, they’ll take an extra half-hour and play on until 5.30pm local (3.30pm GMT). A tough spell for South Africa, trying to hold steady but keep adding runs when they can. After a Bell delivery just misses her outside edge, Tryon picks her moment with a fierce cover drive. 83rd over: South Africa 261-6 (Tryon 15, Jafta 2) Sinalo Jafta comes to the crease, and tries to duck beneath a bouncer that clips her on the helmet. She is checked over by the medics before carrying on. A big appeal as Filer gets more movement and strikes Jafta’s thigh pad, but the umpire declines. Filer strikes with the new ball, which moves away and catches the very bottom corner of Luus’ bat, sailing through to Jones. Another big wicket, the batter’s gritty 56 off 148 finally brought to an end. 82nd over: South Africa 259-5 (Luus 56, Tryon 15) Lauren Bell replaces RMG as England seek to bully their way into South Africa’s tail. The hosts will be aiming to reach 300 – and get within 100 runs of England’s total – without taking on too much damage. Just one that over, taken by Luus off the final ball. 81st over: South Africa 258-5 (Luus 55, Tryon 15) Filer is handed the new ball, and her first delivery rears up onto Tryon’s wrists. The batter responds by lifting a wider ball square through the off-side. 80th over: South Africa 252-5 (Luus 54, Tryon 10) MacDonald-Gay continues as sunlight falls on the pitch again – but with the skies over the city a troubling slate-grey colour. A couple of quick singles are the only change South Africa get out of that over, and the new ball is now available to their opponents. 79th over: South Africa 250-5 (Luus 53, Tryon 9) Ecclestone’s economy is a skinny 1.65 runs per over – she’s giving very little away, and delivers another maiden here, her ninth of the match. 78th over: South Africa 250-5 (Luus 53, Tryon 9) England were past 350 by this point before a flurry of late wickets; South Africa may need to start moving the scoreboard. Chloe Tryon understands the assignment, showing off her white-ball skills with two straight drives to the rope, and another salvaged at midwicket. 77th over: South Africa 238-5 (Luus 50, Tryon 0) Ecclestone – who has now bowled 10 more overs than any of her teammates – tests Tryon’s nerves with a tricky maiden over. The new ball is available in three overs’ time, and it feels like the pendulum has edged back in England’s favour. 76th over: South Africa 238-5 (Luus 50, Tryon 0) Chloe Tryon comes to the crease and after a leg-bye, Luus holds firm for the rest of the over. Lightning didn’t strike twice, but Ryana MacDonald-Gay has. Ryana MacDonald-Gay took a big wicket just before the break … and she gets another with her second ball. It’s a belting delivery that catches De Klerk’s edge and is snaffled by Amy Jones behind the stumps. 75th over: South Africa 237-4 (Luus 50, De Klerk 0) So, we’re back – and Luus sees off the final ball of Ecclestone’s over, halted earlier by a crack of thunder. Things looking brighter out there now, for what could be a pivotal spell in this four-day Test. The covers went on but the rain never actually arrived – and with half an hour having passed with no more lightning, we’re going to restart play at 4.05pm local, 2.05pm GMT. While we wait, here’s Simon Burnton with his guide to the year’s most outrageous sporting behaviour … Both teams have headed back to the pavilion, Luus having taken her pads off. The covers are on now with rain arriving; with around 90 minutes left before close of play, it’s touch and go whether we’ll get any more action. 75th over: South Africa 237-4 (Luus 50, De Klerk 0) Nadine de Klerk is next to the crease, with the Luus-Kapp partnership ending agonisingly on 99. Ecclestone has the ball … but a thunder clap stops her in her tracks! “That was scary,” she mutters, and the umpires agree, calling the players off with one ball left in the over. Just as frustration was beginning to build for England, Ryana MacDonald-Gay pounces with her first Test wicket, changing the angle with her final ball to get through Kapp’s defences when she least expected it. 74th over: South Africa 237-3 (Kapp 57, Luus 50) Half-century for Sune Luus! Luus gets past the 50 mark, at a much gentler pace of 124 balls. It’s a third Test 50 in a row for her. Kapp follows it up as she cuts away a wider MacDonald-Gay delivery through that big gap in the off-side … 73rd over: South Africa 231-3 (Kapp 52, Luus 49) Kapp can’t find her way through the covers, a single setting up Sune Luus to try and claim her half-century. Ecclestone doesn’t give her a chance, though. 72nd over: South Africa 230-3 (Kapp 51, Luus 49) There’s a big gap in England’s field beyond the off-stump which will tempt both batters. Luus finds the gap, a fielder scrambling over from backward point as they run for a couple. This partnership is now at 92, level with Wolvaardt and Dercksen’s total from earlier in the innings. 71st over: South Africa 227-3 (Kapp 50, Luus 47) Kapp gets her fifty! Ecclestone is finding turn and bounce but Kapp times her moment to clip one away past short leg, and bring up her half-century, briskly put together off 64 balls. 70th over: South Africa 226-3 (Kapp 49, Luus 47) Test debutant Ryana MacDonald-Gay is handed the cherry, as lightning flashes in the distance. The last of the over gets beyond Luus’ defences, inside-edged into her midriff. The umpires again look up to the skies. We’re back out for the evening session, with the floodlights on and the rain staying away, for now. Time for tea, which might dovetail nicely with this impending rain shower. That is South Africa’s session, with 112 runs scored for the loss of just one wicket – admittedly a costly one, Laura Woolvardt removed by Sophie Ecclestone. 69th over: South Africa 225-3 (Kapp 48, Luus 47) Sophie Ecclestone makes a quick return and asks for a check of the old ball, which still has 10 overs or so to run. This is the last over before tea and it’s a welcome maiden for England, with both batters poised just short of half-centuries. 68th over: South Africa 225-3 (Kapp 48, Luus 47) The first few drops of rain in the air as Charlie Dean seeks a breakthrough before tea. Luus chops a wider ball from outside off stump which trundles all the way to the rope. 67th over: South Africa 220-3 (Kapp 48, Luus 42) The floodlights flicker into life with tea approaching. Filer’s first ball gets the tiniest edge from Kapp and runs beyond the diving Jones and on to the boundary. A shorter ball is punished, sent crashing through a big gap at mid-on. 66th over: South Africa 212-3 (Luus 42, Kapp 40) The umpires – who are both officiating their first Test match – call for the light meter, and decide it’s fine to continue. Dean takes on her eighth over, and Kapp nudges the accelerator with back-to-back boundaries. 65th over: South Africa 203-3 (Luus 42, Kapp 31) Time for something different, thinks Heather Knight, and brings in Lauren Filer for Ecclestone. Filer took out Annerie Dercksen earlier in the innings but can’t trouble the batters, who look more perturbed by the dark clouds and brisker breeze. 64th over: South Africa 202-3 (Luus 42, Kapp 30) At short leg, a helmeted Tammy Beaumont tries to gee up her teammates. A single each is taken from an eclectic Charlie Dean over. 63rd over: South Africa 200-3 (Luus 41, Kapp 29) Two slips pay close attention as Ecclestone seeks Kapp’s outside edge. The hosts sail on, a couple of runs off the last ball bringing up 200. If these two can get to tea together, South Africa might feel they’re gaining an edge. 62nd over: South Africa 198-3 (Luus 41, Kapp 27) Foreboding clouds in the distance, but still no hint of rain over the Mangaung Oval. Dean continues, and her first ball is smacked away by Luus to bring the deficit below 200 runs. 61st over: South Africa 194-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 27) A costly misfield leaks four runs to take the shine off another probing over from Ecclestone, the last ball turning with intent. 60th over: South Africa 190-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 23) A maiden from Charlie Dean, who causes Luus some problems with a couple of squirming deliveries, one of which pops up off the batter’s leg and through the slips. 59th over: South Africa 190-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 23) We’re in a bit of a holding pattern here, with neither England’s pair of spinners nor South Africa’s batters quite ready to move up a gear. Marizanne Kapp picks her moment against Ecclestone, a clinical cover drive taking this partnership past 50. There’s a break in play while Sune Luus gets treatment from the physio. She seems to have a problem with her left hamstring, hopefully nothing too serious. 58th over: South Africa 186-3 (Luus 37, Kapp 19) England continue with spin from both ends, although Dean can’t quite match Ecclestone’s efficiency (then again, few can). Luus pounces on a short one, then a wider delivery skids past Jones’ fingers for four byes. 57th over: South Africa 178-3 (Luus 33, Kapp 19) Ecclestone tries a floatier ball and offers a wry smile as Luus leaves it well alone. Luus nurdles a single off the final ball to deny the England bowler a maiden. 56th over: South Africa 177-3 (Luus 32, Kapp 19) Oof, a lovely shot from Luus, waiting patiently before sending a fuller Dean delivery whistling through the off side. Some darker clouds on the horizon now; the forecast suggests a shower may be on the way. 55th over: South Africa 172-3 (Luus 27, Kapp 19) Another tight over from Ecclestone, yielding just one run as both batters fail to pick out the gaps quite as efficiently. 54th over: South Africa 171-3 (Luus 26, Kapp 19) Hitting the middle of the day’s play and it’s finely poised. South Africa have kept up a steady run rate around 3.2 an over, which is bettered here as Kapp drills one through midwicket. Off Dean’s last of the over, she gets underneath it slightly but it drops short of the fielder at mid-on. 53rd over: South Africa 167-3 (Luus 26, Kapp 15) Knight has brought fielders in, with Kapp and Luus trying to pick the gaps carefully. Just one run off the over, via a Dean misfield. Time for drinks with the clouds drifting in, but temperatures still above 30 degrees in Bloemfontein. 52nd over: South Africa 166-3 (Luus 26, Kapp 14) Thanks, Tanya. Heather Knight wants to disrupt this promising partnership and turns to Charlie Dean. Sune Luus picks off one that strays off line and flicks it nonchalantly to the boundary. 51st over: South Africa 162-3 (Luus 22, Kapp 14) An unexpectedly expensive over from Ecclestone. Luus picks up four with an edge over the slips and Kapp adds to the bounty, flicking past Jones. And with that I will hand over to Niall, who will take you through to stumps. Thanks for the messages – bye! 50th over: South Africa 153-3 (Luus 17, Kapp 10) Kapp making merry, takes two fours off Bell’s first three balls. On on point through the covers, and another cut, with fire, over point. 49th over: South Africa 145-3 (Luus 17, Kapp 2) One from more immaculate Ecclestone. 48th over: South Africa 144-3 (Luus 17, Kapp 1) Bell lopes in, if you can lope with speed. Long long legs, big strides: Luus plays out another – no she doesn’t – whipping four off her ankles from the last ball. 47th over: South Africa 140-3 (Luus 13, Kapp 1) The camera pans back to show the field, mottled green and yellow. A couple of singles from Ecclestone’s over. 46th over: South Africa 138-3 (Luus 12, Kapp 0) Knight tightens the screw, bringing on Bell to replace RMG. Luus nearly falls as the ball jumps just short of gully. A maiden. 45th over: South Africa 138-3 (Luus 12, Kapp 0) England are cock-a-hoop! The South African coach states into his laptop. The big one! Ecclestone strikes, the pressure telling. Wolvaardt thinks she’s got an inside edge onto the pad and is not happy, not one bit. There is, of course, no DRS for this Test, despite the fact there is for the other white ball games of this series. Cost-cutting. 44th over: South Africa 137-2 (Wolvaardt 65, Luus 11) Brief relief from RMG, they pick up three. Clouds now visible to one side of the ground, presumably brought in with the wind. 43rd over: South Africa 134-2 (Wolvaardt 65, Luus 8) Filer is sent to pasture for a well-earned rest, but no rest for South Africa’s batters who now get Ecclestone from the same end. In huge sunglasses she wheels in. Absolutely cracking over, a maiden. 42nd over: South Africa 134-2 (Wolvaardt 65, Luus 8) A super ball from RMG draws Wolvaardt in, she edges awkwardly for a couple. The cameras spot a hairline crack outside the off stump. Wolvaardt thinks she’s picked up another boundary but a super bit of fielding by Bell at mid-on disappoints. 41st over: South Africa 131-2 (Wolvaardt 62, Luus 8) Filer, elbows akimbo in musical-hall style. Luus pounces on her last ball, slightly outside off stump, and cuts it for four. Filer shakes her head and mouthes a short sharp curse. 40th over: South Africa 127-2 (Wolvaardt 62, Luus 3) The wind, I’m told, is enhancing the in-swing from the end MacDonald-Gay is bowling from. Wolvaardt picks up her first runs since lunch, pulling four from a short one. Four byes fly past Amy Jones and down the leg side. 39th over: South Africa 118-2 (Wolvaardt 58, Luus 3) The umpires flatten down the pitch where Filer has been running in with something akin to Mrs Tiggy-Winkle’s iron on a stick. Filer continues, high energy, full throttle. Filer hits Wolvaardt somewhere – arm- guts, I can’t tell – as it rips in. 38th over: South Africa 117-2 (Wolvaardt 58, Luus 2) Ryana MacDonald-Gay takes the ball after lunch after that little pre-lunch spell from Dean. She is running into the wind which is now loud enough to crackle the microphone and ruffle the shirts and ponytails. A couple of leg byes off the over. 37th over: South Africa 115-2 (Wolvaardt 58, Luus 2) Luus is greeted fairly early with a short snifter but is off the mark with a couple after a misfield. The players are out, we’re expecting more short stuff from Filer as she prepares to complete her over that brought about a (fractionally) early lunch with the wicket of Dercksen. A really excellent morning of hard cricket. Aggressive bowling from Filer in particular but utter concentration from South Africa, Wolvaardt brilliant and Dercksen working so hard despite being targeted. England got their reward in the last over before lunch, leaving it honours pretty much even. Time for me to grab some breakfast, back shortly. What a shame for Dercksen! She’d done so well and was four balls away from her sandwiches. But Filer well deserved the wicket – another kicking bouncer which Dercksen shuffled away from and sent high towards the cordon. Knight can only parry it with her leap but Ecclestone collects. 36.2 overs: South Africa 113-2 (Wolvaardt 58) 35th over: South Africa 113-1 (Wolvaardt 58, Dercksen 41) I take it back, this is the penultimate over, Dean drops onto the legs and Dercksen says thanks very much and shifts it away for four. 34th over: South Africa 107-1 (Wolvaardt 57, Dercksen 36) Filer, with the penultimate over before for lunch. She’s such a tricky customer, a searing yorker, which Wolvaardt keeps out. It loops over Beaumont at short leg who leaps and lands awkwardly on the hard soil. She’ll learn, say the commentators. Dercksen runs one short in a race to come back for a second and Filer finishes an eventful over with an aggressive bouncer that tempts Dercksen – but she just pulls her bat away in time. 33rd over: South Africa 105-1 (Wolvaardt 56, Dercksen 35) Charlie Dean gets a go with ten minutes until lunch, one keeps low but with a dart of the bat Wolvaardt has it covered. 32nd over: South Africa 103-1 (Wolvaardt 55, Dercksen 34) Firey Filer is back and so nearly has a wicket. After serving up a snorter which Dercksen ducks, Dercksen then plays a nothing sort of tennis shot to the next ball and gets a top edge which flies invitingly to Bell running in from the rope. But Bell, like Bambi on a newly mopped floor, is all over the place, over runs, dives and appears to miss the ball completely. Filer turns on her heel; Knight looks unimpressed. 31st over: South Africa 102-1 (Wolvaardt 55, Dercksen 33) Ooof! Wolvaardt lucky to escape as she gets an inside edge onto a ball from NSB which zips merrily between her pads but evades the stumps. Ever zen, she then calmly takes advantage and shovels her last ball through the gap for four. Illustrative stats on how South Africa’s scoring rate has been stifled: their first 50 took 14 overs, the second 50 18 overs. 31st over: South Africa 98-1 (Wolvaardt 51, Dercksen 33) A single from Ecclestone’s over. 30th over: South Africa 97-1 (Wolvaardt 50, Dercksen 33) A rogue run off NSB’s first ball disappoints the England fielders but she continues the wicket to wicket ploy to Wolvaardt. Gimlet eyed, Wolvaardt stares from beneath her green helmet, stranded for 13 balls on 49 - but here is the run! Turned off her hip for her second Test fifty. She unobtrusively raises her bat and gives her teammates a thumbs up. 29th over: South Africa 95-1 (Wolvaardt 49, Dercksen 32) Pressure building a little on South Africa as England tighten the screw – though I think Wolvaardt is able to exist in a little calm bubble of her own. Ecclestone whistles through another maiden. 28th over: South Africa 95-1 (Wolvaardt 49, Dercksen 32) A maiden from NSB. 27th over: South Africa 89-1 (Wolvaardt 49, Dercksen 32) Wolvaardt presses at an Ecclestone ripper and the ball sheets off the bat and just beats the chasing MacDonald Gay to the rope. Wolvaardt in touching distance of fifty. 26th over: South Africa 89-1 (Wolvaardt 43, Dercksen 32) NSB replaces RMG, coming in now from the Willows end. The television cameras obligingly show pockets of supporters watching from under the shade of some trees. Looks pretty blissful actually, though the flags are bristling in the wind which seems as if it has picked up a little. A handful of singles from the over. 25th over: South Africa 86-1 (Wolvaardt 41, Dercksen 31) A single from Ecclestone’s over. 24th over: South Africa 85-1 (Wolvaardt 40, Dercksen 31) Four off McDonald-Gay, but not entirely convincing, as Dercksen is hurried and gets an outside edge down to the rope. There aren’t huge numbers of people watching at Bloemfontein, unless they’re hiding somewhere I can’t see. 23rd over: South Africa 81-1 (Wolvaardt 40, Dercksen 27) After three successive maidens, Ecclestone finally concedes a run – Wolvaardt licking her lips as a short one bounces invitingly in front of her, she obligingly flies it through midwicket for four. 22nd over: South Africa 77-1 (Wolvaardt 36, Dercksen 27) A maiden from McDonald-Gay makes it two in a row for England. 21st over: South Africa 77-1 (Wolvaardt 36, Dercksen 27) Ecclestone, such an imposing figure, whistles down another maiden. The players take drinks and I’m running to put the kettle on. 20th over: South Africa 77-1 (Wolvaardt 36, Dercksen 27) A Wolvaardt pull behind square, easy does it with a flick of the wrists, brings up the fifty partnership. And a second four from Dercksen, through midwicket keeps up the momentum. 19th over: South Africa 67-1 (Wolvaardt 31, Dercksen 22) Ecclestone time! The hair that was loose in a pony tail has been tied up into a bun – this is where it gets serious. Wolvaardt and she are old foes. Wolvaardt meticulously watches and bats out the over. A maiden. 18th over: South Africa 67-1 (Wolvaardt 31, Dercksen 22) McDonald-Gay again, as the dog curls up next to me on the sofa after a brief forray for squirrel sniffing in the garden. Another impressive over of right-arm medium pace, she’s stemmed the run-rate where no-one else has. 17th over: South Africa 66-1 (Wolvaardt 30, Dercksen 22) Dercksen picks up four from Sciver-Brunt, but unconvincingly with an edge through the slips. And a first message drops into the inbox. Good morning Peter Dudley! ”I’m trying hard to imagine an inswinger zigzagging and my mind well and truly boggles! Now there’s a delivery we’d all love to perfect!” Hmmm, now you’ve put me on the spot maybe it was more of a zig…but it was definitely fabulous! 16th over: South Africa 62-1 (Wolvaardt 30, Dercksen 18) Knight rolls up her short sleeves, as here in Manchester the day slips into a gray dawn. A double change as 20 year old Ryana McDonald-Gay replaces Bell. She’s only 20 and this is just her fourth England game and her first Test. A neat and tidy maiden. 15th over: South Africa 62-1 (Woolvaardt 30, Dercksen 18) Heather Knight thinks it is time for a change, and switches Nat Sciver-Brunt into the attack to replace Filer. Into the grove immediately, as you’d expect from some sort of superwoman. And as I type that, she over-pitches and Dercksen thanks her with a off-drive for four – and another two balls later. She’s got impressive sang-froid this young woman. 14th over: South Africa 52-1 (Wolvaardt 29, Dercksen 10) Advantage Woolvaardt, who with text-book technique, twice drives Bell for four through the covers. And South Africa have notched up fifty in quick time. 13th over: South Africa 41-1 (Wolvaardt 19, Dercksen 10) Filer’s fourth over of the morning – I wish I could give you a mph calculation of how fast she’s bowling but I can’t see one on screen. Visibly intimidating though, rapid enough to make Dercksen back away, though she ripostes next ball by picking up four with a peachy cover drive. 12th over: South Africa 37-1 (Woolvaardt 18, Dercksen 6) Dercksen may not be used to the pace that Filer is delivering the other end but she has impressive poise. She drives Bell through the covers for four with aplomb. 11th over: South Africa 33-1 (Wolvaardt 18, Dercksen 2) Filer is finding her mojo – and delivers some spicy stuff to Dercksen. A searing bouncer to start – Derkcksen snaps back her neck to avoid being hit, her long blond hair following behind. She smiles. Another fierce bouncer follows, which Dercksen doesn’t play as well, loses sight of it, and is hit on the helmet as it flies down to the rope for four byes. Intriguing! 10th over: South Africa 28-1 (Wolvaardt 16, Dercksen 0) Bell springs in, a hop at the start of her run-up. Another smart, neat over. 9th over: South Africa 25-1 (Wolvaardt 16, Dercksen 0) Filer starts the over with a full toss which Woolvaardt drives for four, finishes with a snorting bouncer which heads for Woolvaardt’s throat and leaves her flat on her back. 8th over: South Africa 21-1 (Wolvaardt 12, Dercksen 0 ) Bosch looked all at sea for the three balls she faced, wildly wafting at the first, and nibbling obligingly to the third. An absolute beauty from Bell to finish the over, a HUGE inswinger which Dercksen left but which zig-zagged in and missed her off stump by a Christmas tree’s needle. Bosch pushes at a ball that she could have left a hundred times out of a hundred and nibbles behind. 7th over: South Africa 21-0 (Wolvaardt 12, Bosch 6) Three slips and a gully stand and wait as Lauren Filer runs in with the first ball of the day, an inswinger on the money. From there Filer is a little wayward, drifting legside. Woolvaardt nudges one of them down to the rope. The South Africans have a last gulp of water, and Heather Knight leads out her troops. They’re prodding the pitch in Bloem – yesterday there was a strong wind down the ground, today it has dropped to just a little breeze. The surface still looks wonderful for bat and ball, but yesterday’s wind took most of the moisture out of the surface and there are now a few cracks. While we wait for this Test to begin, you might (or might not) want to catch up on England’s exploits in Hamilton – a hundred for Williamson, a hamstring blow for Stokes, and another Matt-Henry snaffling for Crawley. The pictures are now beaming in from Blomfontein where the light is bright and the sun is hot. Kaya Zondo and Nono Pongolo are singing Bouchier’s praises – her 126 was the third highest score on Test debut behind Australia’s Mel Jones and Michelle Goszko. A lovely picture of Maia Bouchier and her dad Anthony, who was an investor in Wisden.com in the early days of the internet back in the early noughties. This is worth a listen from Raf and Syd on both England women’s contracts and the ECB’s new salary announcement on the Hundred where there are huge increases in pay for the top tier men, not so much for anyone else. This was Raf’s take on day one: Good morning! As schoolchildren porridge-up on the last Monday before Christmas, the Manchester sky still a long way from dawn, England and South Africa prepare for day two of the one-off Test in sunny Bloemfontein. England’s women had the best of yesterday, racking up 395 at quite the lick, with a debut Test hundred for the impressive Maia Bouchier and the quickest Test century in women’s history for Nat Sciver Brunt. South Africa fought back in the late afternoon, snipping this way and that through the late middle order and tail, and England were unable to make a breakthrough in the six overs after Heather Knight’s declaration. Action starts at 8am, in this first women’s Test in South Africa since 2002. Do join me, coffee in hand."

          "headline": "Judge finds UK unlawfully detained Tamils stranded on Diego Garcia",
          "bodyText": "Dozens of asylum seekers stranded on one of the most remote islands in the world in conditions described as “hell on Earth” were unlawfully detained there by the UK for three years, a judge has found. The government could now face a bill of millions in damages for unlawfully detaining more than 60 people for such a long period. More than 60 Tamil asylum seekers became stranded on the tropical island of Diego Garcia – halfway between Tanzania and Indonesia in the Indian Ocean – in October 2021 after their boat sprung a leak. En route to Canada where they hoped to claim asylum, they were rescued by the British navy, which is part of a military presence on the UK territory. The US leases land from the UK on the island for a strategically sensitive military base. The asylum seekers hoped to get their boat repaired and continue on their journey after a few days on the island, which has white sands surrounded by turquoise seas and dense forests of coconut palms. Instead they remained in rat-infested tents, largely deprived of their liberty. At the beginning of December this year, UK ministers finally agreed to airlift all but three of them who have criminal cases to the UK. The ruling, hailed by lawyers for the stranded asylum seekers as “a victory for justice”, was made by Margaret Obi, the acting judge of the supreme court of the British Indian Ocean Territory. The judge accepted evidence from the asylum seekers that those in the camp were collectively punished, and that they were told that if they left the camp they would be shot by US military personnel. In her ruling Obi found: “It is unsurprising that the claimants feel as if they are in a prison; that is exactly what it is, in all but name.” One asylum seeker gave evidence to the judge describing life in the camp as “slow death every day” and “hell on Earth”. Another said that although he and his family felt that they were living in a prison, unlike prisoners they did not know how long their sentence was for. They said: “We have no control over our lives here. If we are commanded to stand we stand, if we are commanded to sit we sit. I feel like a bird being kept in a cage.” The judge found that the UK Home Office impeded the progress of the claims for international protection because of the political impact on the government’s then flagship Rwanda policy. This prevented asylum claims from being determined and either being granted or refused. Although the judge had granted the asylum seekers bail to leave their 140-metre by 100-metre compound for limited walks, the commissioner on the island initially prevented them from leaving their camp. When they were allowed out they were not allowed to sit down, to use toilets or to refill their water bottles despite the tropical conditions. In a diplomatic cable from the US authorities to the UK government sent on 12 June this year, the US said that if the asylum seekers left their camp it “presents an unacceptable and significant security risk to US base operations”. Simon Robinson, a solicitor at Duncan Lewis, representing the claimants, said: “Our clients – and the UK public – deserve answers about how the commissioner came to operate an illegal overseas prison for asylum seekers at huge expense to the UK taxpayer. This judgment is a victory for justice, human rights and the rule of law.” Tom Short, solicitor at law firm Leigh Day, representing some of the asylum seekers, said: “The judgment is a deeply damning indictment of the handling of this situation. It is not only a vindication of our clients’ rights but a triumph for the rule of law in the British overseas territories.” A UK government spokesperson said: “Diego Garcia has never been a suitable long-term location for migrants, which is why we have now relocated almost all of those housed on the island to the UK as a one-off measure to ensure their continued welfare and safety. We are carefully considering this judgment.”"

          "bodyText": "What we learned today, Monday 16 December With that, we will wrap up the blog for today. Have a great evening, and stay cool out there if you’re reading this from somewhere hot. Here were today’s major developments: Former New South Wales police officer Kristian White has sought to appeal against his sacking from the force after he was convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting a 95-year-old woman in a nursing home with a Taser. Parts of Australia sweltered through the day, especially in Victoria, which recorded its highest temperature – 47.1C – in five years, its hottest since the start of the catastrophic black summer bushfire season in 2019 Austrac is taking gambling giant Entain to court, alleging “serious risk of criminal exploitation” by the company, which runs Ladbrokes and Neds. Two of four Australians who were hospitalised after a suspected mass alcohol poisoning event in Fiji have returned home. Fijian deputy prime minister, Viliame Gavoka, held a press conference earlier today, where he said the incident occurred at one bar, where “many” pina colada cocktails were served. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, has said he is not aware of any deals with Indonesia regarding the return of the remaining Bali Nine members to Australia. Chalmers said he believes their release was an “act of cooperation and compassion” by the Indonesian president, Prabowo Subianto. And the body of an international tourist, aged in his 20s, has been recovered from the water after he went missing near a popular swimming hole south of Cairns yesterday. Sydney to face a scorcher on Tuesday as Melbourne cools down Before we wrap up for the evening, here’s a look at what the Bureau of Meteorology is forecasting for capital cities tomorrow. After a scorching day in Melbourne, relief is on the way for people in the Victorian capital later tonight when an expected cool change comes through. Melbourne is set for a top of 24C tomorrow, with high chances of showers and a possible thunderstorm early in the morning. It’s looking like it will be a sweltering day in parts of Sydney. A top temperature of 33C is expected in the CBD, but, as usual, it’s a different story for the city’s west. The temperature is expected to reach 42C in Penrith and Richmond, 40C in Campbelltown and Liverpool and 38C in Parramatta. A maximum temperature of 35C is forecast for Perth and a top of 34C is expected in Canberra. Adelaide, Brisbane and Hobart can expect maximum temperatures of 26C, 29C and 21C, respectively. It’s going to be hot in Darwin, where the temperature is set to reach 36C. You can read more of our coverage of today’s heatwave here: NSW government hits another hurdle in attempts to stop train strikes The New South Wales government’s attempt to block industrial action across Sydney’s train network through legal means appears set for another hurdle, after rail unions negotiating for better pay voted to take fresh action in the lead-up to New Year’s Eve. Late on Monday, the Rail, Tram and Bus Union (RTBU) released the results of a fresh protected industrial action ballot it launched after the Minns government made an 11th-hour decision to seek a court injunction to block industrial action last week. While the legal case related to the injunction was still playing out before the federal court on Monday, RTBU members have since voted in favour of taking fresh industrial action which would not be subject to the injunction. Members overwhelmingly voted in favour of the action, with between 78% to just under 80% in favour between the Sydney Trains and NSW Trains workforces, according to results seen by Guardian Australia. The vote means that RTBU members will be able to take industrial action as early as 28 December, covering a range of actions from 24-hour work stoppages, to declining distances of work for drivers, as well as decisions to deactivate Opal card readers. You can read more about the pay dispute here: Former New South Wales police officer Kristian White has sought to appeal his sacking from the force after he was convicted of manslaughter for fatally shooting a 95-year-old woman in a nursing home with a Taser. White was sacked in early December just days after a jury found him guilty of the manslaughter of Clare Nowland. A spokesperson for the NSW police confirmed a case had been filed in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales to appeal against the sacking: NSW Police have been advised a former officer who was attached to Monaro PD, has filed in the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales an application for review under s 181E of the Police Act 1990. Given the matter is before the IRC no further comment can be made. White used a Taser to shoot the great-grandmother, who was armed with a serrated knife and threatening police and staff, at her Cooma nursing home in May 2023. She died a week later from head injuries sustained when she fell backwards from the force of the Taser shot. The financial intelligence agency has begun federal court action against gambling giant Entain, which runs the Ladbrokes and Neds brands, accusing it of “serious and systemic non-compliance with Australia’s anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws”. In a statement, Austrac’s chief executive, Brendan Thomas, alleged Entain “did not develop and maintain a compliant anti-money laundering program and failed to identify and assess the risks it faced”: We are alleging this left the company at serious risk of criminal exploitation. Money laundering is often a symptom of serious criminal activity, including fraud, scams and corruption, all of which have equally serious effects on our communities. Austrac has also alleged “third parties, including businesses and individuals, accepted cash and other deposits on behalf of Entain to be credited into betting accounts in ways that could obscure the proceeds of crime”. It has accused the company of not conducting ‘appropriate checks on 17 higher risk customers, including examples where Entain did not appropriately deal with the risk that its online betting sites were being exploited by criminals to spend the proceeds of serious crime’. This includes allegations that Entain deliberately obscured the identity of some high risk customers, on its own systems, through the use of pseudonyms to ‘protect their privacy’ Thomas said the Australian arm of Entain was “part of one of the world’s largest sports betting and gaming groups”: The online betting sector, and all other businesses regulated by Austrac, must take their AML/CTF obligations seriously. This includes ensuring they have appropriate procedures to know who their customer is, even when they rely on third parties to process transactions. Entain has been contacted for comment. Man’s body found in Queensland swimming hole near ‘treacherous’ terrain, police say A man’s body has been recovered from the water after he went missing near a popular swimming hole south of Cairns yesterday. Queensland police Snr Sgt Rob Campbell has said the Babinda Boulders swimming hole is not on an authorised national park track and can be dangerous at this time of year. At a press conference today, Campbell said: This is quite treacherous terrain at this time of year because of the rainfall and the water coming through. It’s not an authorised trail where it is so it’s not really a place that’s well maintained and kept, and it is rainforest as well. Police said the man, an international tourist in his 20s, was reported missing about 2.20pm yesterday after he fell into the water and didn’t resurface. Police, the State Emergency service, and Queensland Fire Department Swift Water Rescue crews immediately began searching for the man. They suspended the search overnight. After resuming this morning, police said they found the man’s body in the water about 11am. Police have said the man is yet to be identified and they will prepare a report for the coroner. Northern Territory releases Atar results Atar results are out for students in the Northern Territory, with 1,447 Year 12 graduates obtaining their certificate. It’s an increase of 78 compared with 2023, but below the record 1,610 students that graduated in 2020. Some 257 of the graduates are Aboriginal students. The NT’s minister for education and training, Jo Hersey, said the results were a testament to the commitment of senior secondary students across the Territory. She said: These results are also a reflection of students’ families, teachers and schools, who have supported our students throughout their studies to achieve such fantastic results. Darwin high school topped the list, educating 13 of the top 20 students in the Territory. A total of 47 A+ merits – representing exceptional achievement in a subject – were handed out across seven schools. Temperatures of 44C or higher hit Victoria’s west Here are some more details from Weatherzone about today’s heatwave in Victoria. As we mentioned before, the peak temperature so far of 47.1C was recorded just after 2pm in Walpeup, a small town in the Mallee region in the state’s northwest. Temperatures have reached 44C or higher at several other locations in the Mallee and Wimmera districts including Mildura, where the temperature has peaked at 45.1C. In Horsham, in the Wimmera region in the state’s west, the temperature has reached 44C. At Hopetoun airport, north of Horsham, the temperature has peaked at 45.4C. This is also the site of the hottest temperature on record in Victoria, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, with 48.8C recorded on 7 February 2009. Victoria’s southern coastline hasn’t escaped the heat today either, according to Weatherzone. The temperature in the coastal city of Warrnambool, in the state’s west, reached 41.2C just after 1pm. But that quickly changed, with the temperature dropping more than 10C in 30 minutes as a cooler west-southwesterly change pushed through. It’s 36.9C in Melbourne now, according to the weather bureau. Wherever you are, I hope you’re staying cool. The temperature in Victoria has hit 47°C for the first time since December 2019, according to Weatherzone meteorologist Ben Domensino. In a post on X, Domensino said the last time it was this hot in the state was at the start of the Black Summer bushfire season. The hottest place in the state so far today is 47.1°C at Walpeup, a town in the Mallee region south of Mildura, although Domensino said this could change in the coming hours. Thank you to my colleague, Emily Wind, for taking care of the blog this morning. I’ll be with you until the end of the day. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, Catie McLeod will be here to take you through the rest of today’s news. Take care. More than 50 Victorian schools and early childhood centres affected by extreme heat As we flagged earlier, Victoria’s Department of Education has listed more than 50 schools and early childhood centres that have closed, relocated or switched to remote learning, as the state responds to the extreme heat and fire danger. The schools and early childhood centres span numerous districts in the state, including the south-eastern, north-eastern, north-western and south-western regions. Bushfire threat downgraded in West Wimmera Earlier we reported a Watch and Act alert had been issued due to a bushfire at Casterton-Edenhope Road in the West Wimmera region of Victoria. The Country Fire Authority says the threat has been reduced, lowering the bushfire to advice level – meaning there is no immediate danger, and to stay up to date in case the situation changes. Gavoka says four of the six will be released from hospital today Viliame Gavoka said the resort where this occurred is “very highly rated” with high standards. We don’t think anything untoward happened, and that the industry itself is a very caring one. We have no fear that anyone would be doing anything untoward. Asked if this was methanol poisoning, the deputy PM said “we would like to wait for the results of the tests”. That would be really in the extreme … We don’t believe it’s possible in Fiji. He said that of the six people who are ill, four will be released from hospital today – but due to privacy concerns he wouldn’t disclose the nationalities. Viliame Gavoka described pina colada cocktails as a “pretty harmless drink” and said “many” were served that evening across five bars at the resort – but those who have fallen ill were all at the one bar. In the same bar, there were many pina coladas served that evening. And with this resort, there are five bars altogether … so in the other four bars, pina colada was also served. No ill effects. So we really want to get down to the toxicology and really get to understand what really happened. Gavoka says ‘Everyone is in a state of disbelief’ Taking questions, Viliame Gavoka was asked whether there is any possibility this was a deliberate action. He said the bar was full that evening, and the bartender has 16 years’ experience and is “someone who is known for their caring attitude”. Pina colada is the drink here. A lot of people drank pina colada but it only affected these six or seven people. I don’t think that is the case. I think there’s something else we need to identify. He said those affected were from different travelling parties. Toxicology results could take three or four days, he said. We’re really keen to see the result of that. Everyone is in a state of, you know, disbelief this has happened. The deputy prime minister of Fiji, Viliame Gavoka, is speaking to reporters in Suva amid news Australians were in hospital amid suspected alcohol poisoning. He said this was a “very isolated incident” and authorities are waiting on the results of ongoing investigations and lab tests. The resort management has assured us that they have not engaged in practices such as substituting ingredients or altering the quality of drinks served to guests. The incident occurred at only one bar and six tourists, ranging in the age from young to older, fell ill. Management is concerned, as we are, and are fully cooperating with the minister of health and other authorities to identify what happened and to ensure the safety of all guests. He said Fiji has close to a million visitors annually and “this is the only reported case of its kind that we have experienced in memory.” Updated hottest temperatures so far today, in each state and territory Earlier we brought you the hottest temperatures recorded so far in each state and territory today. Some even higher temperatures have now been recorded, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, including: Queensland: Urandangi – 45.3C at 1.06pm NSW and ACT: Smithville – 45.1C at 1.12pm South Australia: Renmark Airport – 45.1C at 12.47pm Northern Territory: Jervois – 45C at 12.36pm Western Australia: Mardie – 41.3C at 11.07am Tasmania: Low Rocky Point – 36C at 2.10pm Victoria still has the hottest temperature recorded so far today – 45.4C at Walpeup, at 1pm. Firefighters battle a grassfire at Westgate Park in Melbourne Firefighters in Victoria have been responding to a grassfire at Westgate Park, directly under the West Gate bridge. The fire is not yet under control, and is burning at advice level – meaning there is no immediate danger, and to stay up to date in case the situation changes. Here is a photo from the scene, from AAP just earlier: Total fire ban for Mallee and Wimmera districts tomorrow Amid the extreme heat, a total fire ban has been declared for the Mallee and Wimmera districts in Victoria tomorrow. No fires can be lit, or be allowed to remain alight, in the open air from 12.01am to 11.59pm, the Country Fire Authority said. This follows a total fire ban for two-thirds of the state today. Walpeup, in the Mallee region, has recorded the hottest temperature in Victoria so far today, reaching 45.4C at 1pm. Simon Holmes à Court, director of The Superpower Institute and convener of Climate 200, has penned an opinion article looking at the Coalition’s nuclear energy plan – you can have a read of this below: Australian shares on track for fifth day of losses The local share market is on track for a fifth day of losses in its longest stretch since mid-April, AAP reports, with the mining sector the biggest drag. At lunchtime, the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was down 21.8 points, or 0.26%, to 8,274.2, while the broader All Ordinaries was down 28.3 points, or 0.33%, to 8,522.0. Barring an afternoon turnaround, the ASX’s losing stretch will equal a similar five-day streak from April 11-17. Five of the ASX’s 11 sectors were lower at midday and four were higher, with the bourse’s two consumer sectors both basically flat. Materials/mining was the biggest mover, dropping 1.2% as the price of iron ore fell. BHP and Rio Tinto were both down 1.4%, while Fortescue had fallen 2.3%. Goldminers were also down as the precious metal traded around US$2,652 an ounce, with Newmont falling 3.3% and Evolution down 1.6%. The big four banks were mostly higher, with ANZ and NAB both up 0.2% and Westpac advancing 0.4%. CBA was the outlier, basically flat at $158.15. Insurance companies were faring better, with IAG and Suncorp both up 1.3%. The Australian dollar was up to 63.71 US cents, from 63.58 US cents at Friday’s ASX close. A watch and act alert has been issued for a bushfire in the West Wimmera region of Victoria. The bushfire is at Casterton-Edenhope Road and is not yet under control, the Country Fire Authority said, travelling in a south-east direction with spot fires and embers starting fires up to 500m ahead of the main blaze. A wind change was expected around 1pm, causing the fire to change directions towards Connewirricoo. Conditions can become very dangerous and unpredictable. Communities in Chetwynd, Kadnook and Powers Creek are told that leaving now is the safest option: Don’t wait, leaving now is the safest option – conditions may change and get worse very quickly. Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay. Hottest places so far today in each state and territory As we’ve already flagged, much of the country is experiencing heatwave conditions today, with some places expected to reach their hottest December days on record. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, these are the hottest temperatures recorded so far today in each state and territory: Victoria: Walpeup – 45.4C at 12.31pm Queensland: Birdsville – 44.6C at 11.45am South Australia: Renmark Airport – 44.3C at 12pm NSW and ACT: Smithville – 44.2C at 12.50pm Northern Territory: Jervois – 44.1C at 11.02am Western Australia: Roebourne Airport – 40C at 9.46am Tasmania: Low Rocky Point – 35C at 12.45pm Pleasant weather for carolling in Sydney on Saturday The Christmas Day forecast is still a couple of days away, but carollers in Sydney and Melbourne are getting their first look at predicted conditions for the annual outdoor singalong. Jonathan How, senior meteorologist at the Bureau of Meteorology, said the forecast for Sydney’s Carols in the Domain on Saturday is mostly sunny, with a maximum of 27C. It will be quite a pleasant evening. We’ll have some cooler winds coming through in the evening. Definitely a warm day, but bring a jacket if you are going to the Domain. Melbourne’s Christmas Eve carols are still just outside the Bureau’s weekly forecast range, How said, but the latest guidance indicated it could be dry and mild. As Melburnians know, the forecast could change quite dramatically, he said, so “watch this space”. It’s too early to know the Christmas Day forecast until at least 18 December, even though some media outlets began offering forecasts three weeks out. You can read more on this below: NSW police investigating fire in Sydney’s south-west New South Wales police say they are investigating the cause of the fire that engulfed a pallet yard in south-western Sydney early this morning. In a statement police have said: Officers attached to Campbelltown City Police Area Command and firefighters were called to the factory in Huntsmore Road about 12.30am … after fire was seen in pallets stacked inside a factory. Fire and Rescue NSW extinguished the blaze, with damage contained to pallets and a truck. No buildings were damaged. Police say they have set up a crime scene which they will examine later today. They have asked anyone with information about the fire to contact Crime Stoppers. A dozen firetrucks responded to a large fire at a pallet yard in Sydney’s south-west, which caused some of the trucks to partially melt due to the extreme heat. Fire and Rescue NSW said more than 50 firefighters responded to the blaze at Minto just after 12.30 this morning. The yard, about 20 metres by 50 metres in size, contained stacked pallets that were engulfed by fire with two adjacent factories under threat. The intense radiant heat posed “significant challenges”, FRNSW said, with the sides of trucks – parked 20 metres away – partially melted and spot fires ignited in nearby stacks of wood. It took about two hours to get the fire under control. The site has been handed over to NSW police for further investigation into the cause of the fire. NT weather station records 43.2C heat A host of inland regions are competing to be the hottest place in Australia – and probably the planet – today. Presently, Jervois in the Northern Territory is the hottest station, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, at 43.2C. Schools closed or relocated in Victoria due to heat: premier Also at her press conference earlier, the state premier, Jacinta Allan, warned Victorians about the extreme heat conditions today. She urged everyone to download the VicEmergency app and pay attention to local conditions. We already have a number of schools in different parts of the state that have closed or relocated because of the weather conditions. These conditions are widespread, and also too with the change coming through its predicted that there will be dry thunderstorms and lightning. That is a particularly dangerous time when you couple that with high winds. So I’m asking people to please pay attention to your surroundings. If you don’t have to go out in the periods of extreme weather and heat, please don’t. If you know that there are vulnerable members of our community, check in on your family and friends. Stay cool and particularly pay attention to the localised information that will be coming through in the course of the day. Victorian cabinet reshuffle to occur before Christmas: Jacinta Allan Victoria’s premier, Jacinta Allan, confirmed a cabinet reshuffle will occur before Christmas. An MP from Labor caucus will also be elevated to cabinet, she said. With Tim’s announcement today, there will be a vacancy in the cabinet. There will be a caucus process. I’ll let that caucus process run its course, because that is the responsibility of my caucus colleagues, and once that’s concluded, we’ll be able to provide further details of who will be stepping into some remarkably large sized shoes to continue that journey for the decade ahead. As for the Werribee candidate, she said preselection was a matter for the party. As someone who has lived and worked in my community for the past 25 years, having good strong local connections is a good place to start. More from Tim Pallas’ earlier press conference Just circling back to Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas’ press conference, where he announced he would resign from politics. True to form, he was full of great lines, quoting Sinatra when asked about regrets: I have a few, but then again too few to mention. He went on to say that “my life in public office is now at an end, and it is your right to eulogise whether my passing is a good or a bad thing, it is entirely up to you.” Pallas also said he takes full responsibility for “all the bad things that have come out of our budget position”. The good things, of course, the premier has the vision and the leadership … so please feel free to vent any frustrations you have, and blame me for them. But be assured of this at no stage ever did I lose sight of my responsibilities to look after the welfare of the Victorian people and never to employ austerity – that is making my problems reflected in the balance sheets of families or businesses. On his retirement plans, Pallas said he spoke with Steve Bracks and joked “we’re going to buy two rocking chairs”. We’re going to put them on the porch. We’re going to rock back and forth, and at any passerby that goes past, we will harass them with stories about how good we were. Chalmers on future of coal demand from trading partners, especially China A reporter asked Jim Chalmers about the demand for coal into the future, particularly from trading partners such as China as they move to renewables. The treasurer said he was “an optimist about the future of Australian resources”, but said “preferences from our major trading partners will evolve over time.” On China, he said: Particularly when you think about the stunning transformation in the Chinese economy, not just in the decades to here, but in the decades from here as well. Their population is ageing, they’re making a huge play when it comes to AI and technology and automation and robotics, huge play. We’re already seeing the middle-classing of their economy as their emphasis in the economy shifts from industries like construction to more consumer-focused industries. So we’re seeing a stunning transformation of the Chinese economy. We have been a big beneficiary of that and I think we’ll be a big beneficiary of it into the future as well. If you think about the big transformations that we are dealing with and trying to maximise and manage, all of them, in one way or another, involve a very productive and prosperous relationship with China. After one more question, Chalmers’ press conference in Canberra wrapped up. New RBA board in the works since July, Chalmers says Chalmers notes in his press conference that the board members were in the works since July (when the opposition was not very cooperative). Stressed borrowers will be wondering what the new board means for interest rates. In the near-term, not so much. The next RBA board meeting is 17-18 February – which is prior to when the new boards get going. (The next board meeting is due 31 March - 1 April.) As of Friday, there was about a one-in-four chance of 25 basis-point cut in the cash rate for the next RBA meeting, and almost a certainty for the 1 April date. A lot, of course, might change between now and a couple of months into 2025 (eg 20 January, when Donald Trump retakes the White House). Guardian Australia, as it happens, got to ask Andrew Hauser – the RBA deputy governor who was hired from the Bank of England at the start of 2024 – whether our central bank would have acted differently this past year if there’d been a specialist monetary policy board in place. “My guess is much the same, actually,” Hauser said, adding that “all committees have strengths and weaknesses”. On the one hand, having a lot of expertise – eg on monetary policy – can provide “a lot of technical debate [but] sometimes we slightly miss the big picture”. The present board has a varied background in business, academia and the law. That diversity of views can help when you have to deal with “only about one variable” (that is, borrowing costs), Hauser said. In any case, borrowers will hope 2025 is not a repeat of this year when the RBA left the key interest rate unchanged (now for nine meetings in a row, starting last December). A few early cuts would help them – and likely boost the odds of the Albanese government getting a second term. The Australian government is saying there was no “deal” to get the Bali five prisoners home, but an Indonesian minister has appeared to indicate there was a “reciprocal” arrangement. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said this morning that it was simply an act of compassion from Indonesia. Asked if there was any deal or “payback arrangements expected” from Indonesia, Albanese replied: “no”. Yesterday he said there was “an arrangement agreed between our two countries.” But AAP reports that Indonesia’s senior minister for legal affairs, Yusril Ihza Mahendra, said the transfer was “reciprocal in nature”. If one day our government requests the transfer of Indonesian prisoners in Australia, the Australian government is also obliged to consider it. The five are banned for life from entering Indonesia, Yusril said in a statement. Indonesia has said it would respect any decision by Australia when the prisoners returned home, including whether to grant pardons. Chalmers labels Liberal nuclear policy a ‘meltdown’ Moving to the opposition’s nuclear energy policy, Jim Chalmers labelled their announcement last week as “a joke.” It wasn’t modelling, it was a meltdown. It was a proper nuclear meltdown, what we saw from [Peter] Dutton and [Angus] Taylor last week. He said that “no self-respecting alternative government could possibly sign up to the rubbish that was released last Friday.” We have seen this pattern of behaviour from Peter Dutton. He announced he was going to have these stage-three tax cuts and then had to walk away from them in a very humiliating fashion, and then he announced he was going to have a net overseas migration target. He walked away from that. You can see this going the same way. He continued to lash the policy, labelling it a “shambles” and saying “It’s one of the maddest things I have ever seen, what they tried to inflict on us last week.” Chalmers says he is not aware of any deals with Indonesia regarding release of remaining Bali Nine Jim Chalmers was also asked about the returning Bali Nine members – will Indonesia be expecting any favours into the future because of the deal? The treasurer responded “not that I’m aware of.” I think this was an act of cooperation and compassion from President Prabowo, and I’m very grateful and the government is very grateful to President Prabowo for his cooperation and his commitment to working with Australia in this instance. A reporter notes that compassion for drug smugglers isn’t something that Indonesia has shown much of in the past – what’s different here? Chalmers said this was a question for Indonesia. At our end, you know, we respect Indonesian laws, we respect the Indonesian system, we’re grateful to President Prabowo for this act of cooperation and compassion. We don’t deny that these Australians did the wrong thing, but it was time for them to come home and I’m very pleased they have come home. And asked if there should be fast-tracked visas granted for any family members of the five men, Chalmers said he wasn’t aware of those sorts of considerations. Chalmers says he is ‘optimistic’ about future of WA’s resources sector The treasurer has been asked about the forecast downgrading of mining exports by $100bn in the mid year budget update, amid slower growth in China – how will this impact Western Australia? Jim Chalmers said he was not “pessimistic about the future of the resources sector”. This just reflects the reality of less demand out of China, largely, and a couple of other less substantial factors … I’m very optimistic about the future of our resources sector. I see it playing an absolutely central role in our economy. The people, and industries of WA do so much of the heavy lifting in our national economy … Chalmers said he was monitoring developments in China very closely. Reserve Bank should be ‘beyond party politics’: Chalmers Jim Chalmers has been asked about efforts to ensure the RBA appointments were as bipartisan as possible. He began by responding: My preference all along, as you know, was to include the other big governing party. When that became impossible, when Angus Taylor’s party room had a different view to him, I had to play the cards I was dealt with in the Senate, but I still intend to ensure that the future of the Reserve Bank is beyond politics. Chalmers said he has “done my best to be as consultative as I can, you know, going all the way back to July”. I won’t go into the conversation but I can say that we provided those names to him, and three of the four names in the governance board. And so people should expect that type of consultation to continue because the future of the Reserve Bank should be beyond party politics. Chalmers praises Tim Pallas and says state treasurer has ‘earned the right to go and do something else’ Back to Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas’ resignation, Jim Chalmers was asked whether Victorians would be as “effusive” towards him, given that he leaves the state with a downgraded credit rating and upgraded debt. The federal treasurer said he wasn’t going to “have a shot of him on the way out the door”. I’m focused on my budget and the budget update that Katy [Gallagher] and I will update on Wednesday. I won’t give the Victorians free advice. All of us have got pressures on our budget. The pressures on the Victorian budget are well known. My experience of Tim has been a very dedicated person, very intelligent person, somebody who I have enjoyed working with, and so I see no point in trying to run him down as he exits after 10 years and 10 budgets. I think he’s earned the right to go and do something else. Chalmers forecasts new opportunites for RBA board to ‘explain to Australians how they’re thinking’ Jim Chalmers has now been taking questions. He highlighted one outcome of the RBA review being that there would be more opportunities for the governor, deputy governor and others to “explain to Australians how they’re thinking is evolving when it comes to monetary policy, but also to the economy more broadly”: I think that’s a really good development and I think most of you, if not all of you, would agree that the press conferences on board decision days are especially informative and useful to people. We want to build on that. Michele Bullock has said … when the board meets in March [she would like] to begin a conversation with the new boards about the best way to go about that – whether it’s the public commentary and speeches from new and existing members … That’s now a conversation which is most appropriately had by the new boards when they meet in March. Chalmers says travel advice for Fiji has been updated after suspected alcohol poisoning incident Jim Chalmers also said be was very concerned about the news out of Fiji that four Australians have been hospitalised over the weekend with suspected alcohol poisoning. He said this was no doubt a distressing time for the families and Dfat officials are providing consular assistance. Fiji police are investigating to determine the cause of the illnesses and we’ll try to keep people updated as that investigation continues. Dfat has updated its travel advice for Fiji with some extra information, and Australians who are travelling this summer should always check Smart Traveller to make sure they have got the most up-to-date information. Beyond that, people who are affected by this are entitled to their privacy, so we won’t say more about their particular situation until or unless it’s OK with them. Chalmers on Pallas’ resignation from politics Commenting on Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas’ resignation, as we just reported, Jim Chalmers said he has known Pallas for some time and considers him a friend and a “person of great intellect.” He’s made an enormous contribution to the state that he loves. He’s wonderful company and I’ll be sad to see him go. From time to time, we butt heads about issues – that’s fine, that’s to be expected – but nobody could doubt his commitment over 10 years and 10 budgets and all of his experience before then, he has been a huge contributor to the state of Victoria … I’ll be sad to see him go, but I can understand that after 10 years and 10 budgets, he’s earned the right to put his feet up. So, Tim, I wish you well, mate, and all the best for the future. Chalmers says mid-year budget update will show ‘biggest-ever positive nominal turnaround’ Jim Chalmers has also spoken about the mid-year budget update, to be released by him and the finance minister, Katy Gallagher, on Wednesday. He said it would show that over the first two and a half years of this government, “we have seen the biggest-ever positive nominal turnaround in a budget on record.” We have delivered the first back-to-back surpluses in the best part of two decades. [There has been] very substantial investment and that’s saving the Australian people tens of billions of dollars when it comes to debt interest. Chalmers said there were pressures that need to be accommodated in the update, with the estimated variations to be “very substantial.” Slower growth in China will also have a substantial impact on the budget. What you’ll see in Wednesday’s figures is that we are downgrading mining exports by more than $100bn as a part of that, or as a consequence of that. Company taxes will be down $8.5bn in the budget update. That’s actually the first downgrade in company taxes since 2020. Global economy is uncertain and that’s weighing on our own economy and weighing on our budget. Some of these pressures on our budget are intensifying. Global volatility is a big part of the story and you’ll see that in the mid-year update. Chalmers speaks on ‘robust and consultative’ aspect of RBA board appointments Jim Chalmers has also spoken about the “robust and very consultative process” of the appointments, which ran over a number of months. He said the RBA’s review process included a panel of three people; he consulted his cabinet, and the shadow treasurer in July (five months ago) and again last week. I wanted to make it clear that the two new members of the monetary policy board were the same names that I proposed to the shadow treasurer in July and almost all of the governance board nominees as well … You would know just how much effort and work we tried to make this as bipartisan as it could be and that extended to the way that we consulted in a genuine way. Chalmers says RBA board appointees adds continuity Jim Chalmers has been outlining the new board appointments at a press conference in Canberra, and said: These are first-class, first-rate people with the right skills and with decades of relevant experience. What we’re announcing today means that we get some continuity on both boards, and not just on one of the boards. Chalmers said he was proud that women would make up the majority on both boards, with six of nine on the governance board and five of nine on the monetary policy board. The Albanese government has revealed its two appointments to the Reserve Bank’s new specialist monetary policy board – Renée Fry-McKibbin, who was one of the three panelists on the RBA review, and Marnie Baker, an ex-commercial bank chief executive. Fry-McKibbin, a professor at the Australian National University, helped lead the RBA review that was launched soon after the government took office in May 2022. The review made 51 recommendations, including creating “an expert monetary policy board with diverse perspectives and knowledge”, separate from a governance board. Fry-McKibbin will be joined by fellow newcomer Baker, also on a five-year term. Baker brings 35 years of experience in the financial services sector, including recently stints as CEO of Bendigo and Adelaide Bank and deputy chair of the Australian Banking Association. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, had offered existing board members the opportunity to switch to the new unit specialising in monetary policy along with automatic appointees the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, the deputy governor, Andrew Hauser, and the treasury secretary, Steven Kennedy. Four of the remaining six board members took up the offer to serve on the monetary policy board: Carolyn Hewson, Ian Harper, Iain Ross and Alison Watkins. The other two – Carol Schwartz and Elana Rubin – agreed to serve on the governance board as deputy chair and member, respectively. Also named to the new governance board are Jennifer Westacott, David Thodey, Danny Gilbert, and Swati Dave. The new boards are scheduled to commence from 1 March next year. Allan on Pallas’ resignation from politics Victorian premier Jacinta Allan said she’s been friends and colleagues with Tim Pallas for 25 years and thanked him for his service: One of the foundations of our relationship, whether it’s been as MP to a premier’s chief of staff, ministerial colleagues, as treasurer and premier, one of those foundations has been our shared firm belief in strong Labor values. That we are here to serve our communities. Victorian families rely on Labor governments to support them to have good, secure jobs. Pallas to leave midterm, outlines decision to resign Tim Pallas is explaining why he’s resigning: The answer is, I think, simple. In fact, after 10 years [and] after being the longest serving standalone treasurer the state has ever had, having recently worked with the premier and landed the economic growth statement, and recently the mid year budget update – I think we can look back on the body of work and say the economy is solid, the fiscal position is improving and sound, and ultimately there’s no great time to leave the the great honour that is high office. He said he doesn’t have “exclusive tenure” of the role of treasurer and it’s time for “renewal”: We do need to present the opportunity for renewal, a new treasurer, new perspective, new insights, all of those things I think are important. Good governments know that they have to renew themselves. Pallas just confirmed he will be living midterm, which will trigger a by-election in his seat of Werribee. Pallas says he is ‘humble staffer who got a little ahead of himself’ Announcing he will quit politics, Tim Pallas said: I’ve never let a second go by without trying to take the opportunity that this great office has provided … and turn it into something on very substantial value for the wellbeing of the people of Victoria, particularly those who need government support and assistance, a government intent and committed to looking after their wellbeing. He described himself as a “humble staffer who got a little ahead of himself”. Victorian treasurer Tim Pallas has confirmed he will quit politics. Speaking to reporters outside his office at 1 Treasury Place, he has just said: Can I say that after 25 years in senior positions, either as chief of staff to the premier Steve Bracks … 14 years as treasurer and 18 years serving the people of Werribee, this has been the great honour and privilege of my life. His departure will trigger a byelection in his seat of Werribee, which he currently holds by a 9.2% margin, though the Liberals are planning to target it. Pallas joins a long list of senior government ministers who have quit politics in recent years, including former deputy premier James Merlino, former health minister Martin Foley and former police minister Lisa Neville, who all quit ahead of the 2022 state election, as well as Martin Pakula, Jill Hennessy, Jaala Pulford, Richard Wynne and Luke Donnellan. The Victorian government has called a snap press conference with the premier, Jacinta Allan, and treasurer, Tim Pallas. For months now there has been speculation Pallas – the member for Werribee, who has been treasurer since Labor won the 2014 election – will resign. Last month he told reporters he had no plans to do so. But Daniel Andrews said the same just weeks before he resigned in September 2023. Guardian Australia has spoken to several Labor MPs within Pallas’ socialist left faction who expect he will step down as treasurer today. But it remains unclear whether he will immediately vacate his seat of Werribbe, which would trigger a by-election. He holds the seat by a 9.2% margin. We’ll have more soon. Multiple South Australian towns surpass 40C before 10am It has already surpassed 40C in some parts of South Australia this morning, amid widespread heatwave conditions. Pallamana reached 41.1C at 9.43am this morning. Edinburgh, in the outer north of Adelaide, hit 41C at 9.55am. Parafield reached 40.8C at 9.48am, while Renmark airport hit 40.1C at 10am Roseworthy reached 40.9C at 10am, Port Augusta hit 40.3C at 9.55am, and Marree airport recorded 40.3C at 9.54am. ‘That’s something only the PM can comment on’: Dutton on potential Bali Nine deal Continuing from our last post: the shadow attorney general, Michaelia Cash, had previously raised major reservations over the possible release of the five men, strongly questioning the exact circumstances of the arrangement, what Australia would be “giving up” and how much it would cost taxpayers. Government sources at the time said it was a delicate situation and were wary of jeopardising the potential release. Peter Dutton today didn’t repeat those questions that Cash had raised when asked about his thoughts on whatever deal may have been made: That’s something only the prime minister can comment on. I’ve had a call from the prime minister in relation to the matter and I’ve had one other conversation with him as well. So obviously they’ve been working behind the scenes in relation to this matter. President Prabowo is a good friend of Australia, and a very good man, so he’s obviously seen fit to provide this act of clemency or this act of generosity. We have a great deal of respect for him and for his government. Indonesia is an incredibly important partner for us and more and more so into this century. Dutton declines to weigh into Bali Nine release debate Peter Dutton has declined to weigh into the debate over the details of the release of the remaining members of the Bali Nine from Indonesian prison, saying he had conversations with Anthony Albanese on the issue before their return to Australia. Speaking on 4BC radio earlier, the opposition leader said their release would bring “relief for the families involved – 20 years is a long time”: I think the most important message is for young Australians who are travelling to Bali or Asia or indeed anywhere in the world, that you can make a decision which can result in 20 years of your life being taken away from you – and the most important 20 years. I think there are some valuable lessons here. These people don’t come back as heroes of our country, they haven’t been in political captivity. They have been sentenced under the rules of law that operate in that country for trying to import heroin. As a police officer, I can tell you, I went to countless scenes of domestic violence delivering death messages and other [scenes] of people who had been afflicted with a drug addiction, and heroin is one of the most evil of substances. So, I think we need to put it into perspective. But as I say, at a personal level, and for their families, particularly coming into Christmas, you can understand the excitement and the relief that they’ll have. Chalmers to reveal makeup of RBA’s specialist board shortly After the Albanese government managed to get its amendments to the RBA act through parliament in the final legislative rush a couple of weeks ago, we’ve been waiting to see whom the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, would pick for a new monetary policy board at the central bank. We’ll find out shortly when Chalmers holds a media conference in Canberra at 11am Aedt, in about half an hour. The creation of a specialist board was one of the recommendations of the first review into the Reserve Bank in decades, launched by the Albanese government after it took office. The review, conducted by a three-person panel, reckoned the RBA’s single board of nine members should be modified to create a specialist monetary policy unit and one dealing with the governance of the central bank itself. The thinking behind creating a more expert board to deal with interest rates was that the nous to deal with setting borrowing costs demanded a mastery of sometimes arcane economic theories and practice. Without it, board members often drawn from the business community (and once upon a time, the unions) might not be able to push back against the governor (and the RBA’s inhouse team of boffins). Critics, though, wondered if the Bank of England and other central banks that have such specialists setting interest rates had fared better than Australia’s. The Coalition opposed the measure, worrying that Chalmers might “sack and stack” the board with pro-Labor mates, undermining the RBA’s independence. We’ll know soon enough if those qualms are justified when the list of new members is released. Stay tuned here. The University of New South Wales (UNSW) Sydney has become the first tertiary institution in the Asia Pacific to team up with the company behind ChatGPT. The education agreement, sealed with the US-based OpenAI, is part of the university’s wide ranging strategy to embed artificial intelligence into “all aspects” of the institution. Universities are increasingly pivoting to embrace artificial intelligence despite ongoing concerns over widespread cheating and the environmental costs of large language models. In November, La Trobe announced a new “AI first” strategy in a partnership with Microsoft and CyberCX. UNSW’s vice-chancellor, Prof Attila Brungs, said AI was “revolutionising research and education by making learning more personalised, accessible, and impactful”: We are excited to be the first university in the Asia-Pacific to sign an agreement with OpenAI, expanding our reputation as the place where leading entrepreneurial and innovative thinkers choose to work and study. The partnership will give researchers and students access to OpenAI’s secure platform ChatGPT Edu, joining global universities including Oxford, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania. PM says no deal made with Indonesia to secure Bali Nine members release Anthony Albanese also spoke on the release of the five remaining members of the Bali Nine, who arrived back into Australia yesterday. Asked if there were “any payback arrangements expected” or any deal with Indonesia to secure their release, the PM said: “no”. This is an act of compassion by President Prabowo and we thank him for it. After 19 years in Indonesian prison, it was time for them to come home. And I had the opportunity to speak to a number of the parents last night of these people. They are grateful that their sons have been able to return home. They did a serious crime and they have rightly paid a serious price for it. But it was time for them to come home. PM speaks at memorial to Lindt cafe siege victims The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has spoken at a memorial for the victims of the Sydney Lindt cafe siege, 10 years on from the hostage situation. Speaking in Sydney a little earlier, he said: Today, 10 years on from this terrible event which traumatised this city, we pause to remember those who lost their lives, Katrina and Tori. We’re here as well with Katrina Dawson’s parents today paying respect to them. But for those who were injured and all those who are traumatised by this catastrophic event, it is a time to remember them and to pay our respects. It’s also a time to pay our respects to the first responders who responded so quickly and so bravely and who remain, as we know, deeply, deeply affected by the events during something that we didn’t expect to see here in this great city of Sydney. It is a time for us to remember them and to thank them for what they did during that period. Politicians place wreaths in Martin Place to mark 10-year anniversary of Lindt Cafe siege A number of politicians have placed wreaths in Martin Place to mark the ten year anniversary of the Lindt cafe siege – including the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, the NSW premier, Chris Minns, Sydney’s lord mayor, Clover Moore, the governor general, Sam Mostyn, and the NSW governor, Margaret Beasley. Victorian Liberals select Prahran by-election candidate The Victorian Liberal party has chosen Rachel Westaway as its candidate for the upcoming Prahran by-election. Westaway, who lives in South Yarra, was chosen by the local branch at a meeting yesterday. The mother of two is a businesswoman and serves as the president of the Thai Australian Chamber and volunteers for the Prahran Junior football club and Toorak Prahran cricket club. In a statement she said she was thrilled to have been chosen as the party’s candidate: The people of Prahran, South Yarra, Windsor and St Kilda East are sick of the rising cost-of-living issues facing them, and the violent crime that impacts our entire community. We all want Chapel Street to be safe and vibrant, and to celebrate the diversity of this wonderful electorate. I have lived in the seat of Prahran for 20 years raising my children and intend to work extremely hard to give our community a stronger voice at the by-election on 8 February. She will be running against the Greens’ Angelica Di Camillo, an environmental engineer, and independent candidate and former Labor MP, Tony Lupton, in the by-election which was triggered by the Green’s Sam Hibbins’ resignation after he admitted to a “consensual relationship” with a staffer. The Greens currently hold the seat with a 12% against the Liberals. Labor has chosen to sit the byelection out. Australians will spend less on Christmas in 2024 A survey of 1,000 respondents found that Australians are spending $1,357 on average this Christmas, down almost 10% from $1,479 in 2023, according to comparison site Finder. Spending on presents and travel this holiday season is projected to decrease in 2024, according to research. But Australians will be spending a third more on eating out than they did in 2023, with $3.6bn projected to be spent on eating and drinking out. Sarah Megginson, personal finance expert at Finder said: The festive season can be financially stressful, particularly after a challenging couple of years marked by inflation and high interest rates. Two-thirds of Victoria are under an extreme fire danger rating today in the hottest day of the year so far. In case you missed the fire weather briefing yesterday, CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said the risk would be highest in a number of small communities west and southwest of Ballarat, including Lake Bolac, Westmere, Strentham, Cressy and Winchelsea, where the fire danger rating will be “at the very top of extreme” and may tip into catastrophic fire danger. We go into the day with no fires in the landscape… I would like to keep it that way. Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria, named Wombat state forest, the Lower Glenelg National Park, Grampians National Park, Wyperfeld National Park, and Great Otway National Park as “in the highest fire risk part of Victoria”. Hardman said there were 54 aircraft positioned in key areas around the state to respond to fires, along with repel crews who would be sent into fire areas. We’re going to be doing hard, aggressive first attack to make sure that we keep fires small. If you’re in a rural or semi-rural part of Victoria today, keep across the bushfire information on the VicEmergency app and through ABC local radio. Physician suggests Australians need to rethink heat in nation’s phsyche Dr Arnagretta Hunter, a physician and public policy researcher at the Australian National University, suggests its time for Australians to rethink how it views heat amid increasingly hot summers. Speaking to ABC News Breakfast about the heatwave conditions lashing the country, with some places expected to surpass 45C, she said: I think heat is a big part of the Australian psyche. We always had hot summers, it’s part of what we celebrate about this nation, but heat can be a significant source of morbidity and mortality. It can kill people and detract from our health and wellbeing. I think that’s the conversation we need to have, with increasing urgency, particularly going into a summer like this year. She said heat becomes “heat stress” when people cannot cool their bodies, with the combination of heat and humidity particularly lethal. We start to see stress. We would see a heart rate go up, we start to feel hot and feel uncomfortable. It might change how our imagination and our how brain is functioning, how we’re processing information around us. That’s one of the early signs of heat stress. You may be making decisions that are not the normal sort of quality decisions one would make. Spender says Islamophobic graffiti ‘must not be tolerated’ Independent MP Allegra Spender says the Islamophobic graffiti in Sydney’s west at the weekend “must not be tolerated”. In a post to X earlier this morning, she said: This Islamophobic graffiti is intended to incite hatred and must not be tolerated. These are acts of the few and not the spirit of our country. The perpetrators must be held to account. No group – whatever their religion, ethnicity or sexuality – should be targeted in this way. Liberal senator scathing of release of Bali Nine members Liberal senator Hollie Hughes has been scathing of the release of the five remaining Bali Nine members back into Australia. As AAP reports, she spoke with Sky News earlier and said: I’m sure those Australians doing it really tough at the moment will be just thrilled to know that their taxpayer dollars are going to pay for this. I feel very badly for families who had children or loved ones lost to heroin addiction, which was what these drug smugglers were trying to bring back to our country. They would have wreaked death and destruction for a whole lot of families and I think that’s been overlooked here. Some Melbourne businesses told to reduce dust amid heatwave conditions The Victorian EPA says it has alerted a number of businesses in the Melbourne suburb of Brooklyn to reduce dust today, amid the heatwave conditions and extreme fire dangers. It wrote on X: [W]e have alerted 38 industrial businesses of windy, dry conditions, and advised them to reduce dust by using water carts, sprinklers, street sweepers and limiting dust producing activities. The corporate regulator is suing HSBC Australia over allegations it failed to adequately protect customers from being scammed out of millions of dollars. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Asic) alleges in a new federal court action that the bank “let its customers down when they needed their help the most” after taking an average of 145 days to investigate customers’ reports that they had been scammed. Between January 2020 and August 2024, HSBC customers lost about $23m, with the majority of scam losses incurred during a six-month period amid an escalation in activity, according to the court claim. The escalation occurred after scammers obtained access to accounts by impersonating HSBC Australia staff. Some customers lost more than $90,000, while HSBC Australia “compounded the problem” by failing to comply with its various obligations, according to the regulator. Asic’s deputy chair, Sarah Court, said: We allege HSBC Australia’s failings were widespread and systemic, and the bank failed to protect its customers. An HSBC Australia spokesperson said the bank acknowledged the Asic claim. We are considering the matters raised and will continue to cooperate and work constructively with ASIC. Protecting our customers from scammers remains a top priority. We continue to make significant investments in our fraud and scam prevention, detection, and response. 74 women killed so far this year due to gender-based violence So far this year, 74 women have been killed due to gender-based violence – the highest on record since 2015. This is according to data from Domestic Violence NSW, who said the true tally of people murdered due to domestic and family violence is much higher “given there is no data collected on the number of children, men and gender diverse identities killed.” Domestic Violence NSW CEO Delia Donovan said: These devastating figures highlight an ongoing crisis that demands urgent action – and comprehensive funding across the specialist domestic and family violence sector. Each life lost represents a failure of our systems to protect and support those at risk. We need extensive, intersectional strategies that address not only gender-based violence, but the broader systemic inequalities that create it. Data from the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research shows DV-related assaults are increasing on average by 3% per year. NSW is recording the highest rate of murders, but still has the lowest per-capita spend on domestic and family violence in the country – spending just $39 per person in 2022-23, compared to the national average of $53. Circling back to the education minister Jason Clare’s interview on ABC News Breakfast: Asked about Islamophobic graffiti in Sydney’s west at the weekend, Clare said that antisemitism and Islamophobia was “just as bad as one another”. He told the program that children “aren’t born racist” and this is a “parasite that eats away at people and our community”: As community leaders and in the media we’ve got to call this out when it happens, and we’re the best country in the world because we’re made up of people from all backgrounds living in harmony and this is the opposite of that. A Jewish friend of mine contacted me and he wanted me to know his little boy’s best friend, before 7 October, was a Muslim boy called Mohammad. He still wanted me to know he’s still his best friend … Next year is his little boy’s bar mitzvah and Mohammad will be there. That’s what is happening in our communities. It’s brain-dead morons writing things on walls on the streets of Sydney like this that undermine all of that. That’s why we need to call it out and … why we need to do everything we can at the moment to keep our country together. Asked if there should be a national approach to stopping protests outside of places of worship, Clare said they should be “sacrosanct”. They’re not the places you want to see protesting let alone people burning them down. Police appeal to locate woman missing in Blue Mountains NSW police are appealing to the public to help locate a missing woman in the Blue Mountains. Marissa Gee, aged 33, was last seen at Katoomba on Friday evening. On Saturday, her vehicle was located abandoned on Galwey Lane, Mt Wilson. Police and family hold serious concerns for her welfare. She is described as being of Caucasian appearance, 167cm tall, medium build, tanned complexion, brown eyes and curly blonde/red hair, and is possibliy wearing hiking pants and hiking boots. Marissa is known to frequent the Katoomba, Mt Wilson and Bilpin areas. Police and emergency agencies are conducting a land search of bushland at Mt Wilson. Families of the children killed and injured in Tasmania’s 2021 jumping castle tragedy have launched a class action against the state and equipment operator, AAP reports. Law firm Maurice Blackburn announced the move this morning on behalf of lead plaintiffs Georgina Burt and Andrew Dodt, whose sons Zane and Peter died in the incident at Hillcrest primary school in Devonport. It comes exactly three years after a jumping castle and zorb balls were lifted into the air by a wind gust during end-of-year celebrations at the school, killing six children and injuring three others. In a writ lodged with the supreme court, the case alleges the state, as operators of the school, and the company that set up the equipment involved in the tragedy, Taz-Zorb, owed a duty of care for the students. The case also alleges the defendants failed to take reasonable precautions to ensure the safety of the children taking part in the activities. The principal lawyer at Maurice Blackburn Dimi Ioannou said the aim of the class action was “some accountability for what happened on that day”. The families affected by the tragedy of what happened at Hillcrest feel the pain and the trauma of their loss every day. Nothing will erase the suffering or bring back their lost children. This class action is the first step in the path to securing a measure of justice for the families affected by the Hillcrest tragedy. Those eligible to join the class action include children who suffered a physical or psychological injury, witnesses and close family members of those killed or injured. A decision in that case is expected in February. Clare says it will ‘take some time’ for Bali Nine members to reintegrate back into society Jason Clare also weighed in on the release of the remaining Bali Nine members back to Australia, and told the program the deal was locked in over the last few weeks. These men committed a very serious crime, drug trafficking, and they have done serious time, 19 years in an Indonesian prison. They lost a big chunk of their lives for the crimes committed … I think most Australians agree it [was] time for these men to come home. He said the rehabilitation process was underway in Darwin, as well as reintegration back into society. When you have been in prison for the best part of two decades it’s going to take some time for these men to rehabilitate and reintegrate into Australian society. Question from the presenter: At least one of the men is married with a child – what happens to their partners now, since the men can’t go back to Indonesia? Clare said if their partners wish to come to Australia “that would be the subject of the normal visa processing requirements.” Clare said it was ‘terrifying news’ four Australians in hospital in Fiji Earlier, the education minister, Jason Clare, said it was “terrifying news” that four Australians were in hospital in Fiji, with what local authorities suspect is alcohol poisoning. He told ABC News Breakfast that consular officials were on the ground helping families, and Fijian officers were conducting an investigation. I guess my message for Australians travelling overseas is just be really, really careful with whatever you consume. Whatever you’re drinking when you’re overseas … There’s a real terrifying sense of de ja vu, it’s only a month ago two young Australian women died in Laos from methanol poisoning. And then when we wake up to hear this horrific news in Fiji, I’m sure all Australians … are hoping for the best. The five members of the Bali Nine and their families have released a statement, after they were released back in to Australia yesterday. Matthew Norman, Si Yi Chen, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens and Michael Czugaj were first arrested on 17 April, 2005. The men said in a statement they were “immensely grateful to President Prabowo and the Indonesian government for allowing them to return to Australia, and sincerely thank them.” Over the years of their imprisonment, successive Australian Foreign Ministers and governments have advocated for the men. The men and their families sincerely thank them. The men made special mention of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, saying: In both Australia and Indonesia, at both a senior level and in prison visits and personal assistance, over many years, Dfat have offered professional and enduring support. The men and their families will always be grateful. They also thanked their Indonesian lawyers, friends in Indonesia, academics and others in Australia, and numerous friends in Australia: This support has been essential and invaluable. The five men are relieved and happy to be back in Australia. They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society. The welfare of the men is a priority, they will need time and support, and we hope and trust our media and community will make allowance for this. Chalmers comments on ‘disgraceful’ Islamophobic graffiti in Sydney’s west Wrapping up the interview, Jim Chalmers was asked about Islamophobic graffiti in Sydney’s west at the weekend, with the National Imams Council saying there has been a surge in these kinds of incidents and a failure to address them effectively. Is the government doing enough on this issue? The treasurer said the responsibility of leaders is to “try and calm these divisions where they exist, and not try and inflame them or make them worse”: We’ve shown a willingness, whether it’s antisemitism or Islamophobia, to provide the necessary resources to try and keep people safe. But what we saw with this graffiti in Western Sydney was completely disgraceful, completely unacceptable. It was cowardly, and there’s no place for it. We don’t want to see the problems of the world tearing our communities apart. There’s too much of this, and we all need to come together at this time, because people are genuinely worried about their own communities and their own safety. Chalmers says opposition’s nuclear policy announcement raised more questions than answers Moving to energy, Jim Chalmers was asked about the Coalition’s nuclear policy and whether the government was open to having nuclear in its energy mix. The treasurer lashed the opposition’s “modelling meltdown” which raised more questions than answers: It’s just a shambolic attempt to paper over the fact that the Coalition’s [policy] is a recipe for less growth, less energy and higher prices. And you know, some of the most basic questions, what does it mean for bills? How big will the off-budget funds be? Why don’t they think they need any transmission? All of these questions have been unanswered, and that’s why the energy experts and the economists have been so scathing about this shambolic economic insanity that is Peter Dutton’s nuclear fantasy. Mid-year budget update ‘not opportunity for big new policies’ Jim Chalmers also took some questions on the mid-year budget update, due to be released on Wednesday, and said it would show the “really quite remarkable progress we’ve made in the budget since we came to office”: That’s a big part of what we’ll be doing on Wednesday, accommodating the pressures on the budget, accounting for them. And one of the big ones is the weakness in the Chinese economy – and that does have implications for us, for our economy and for our budget … We’ll be downgrading mining exports by about $100bn, we’ll be downgrading company taxes by about $8.5bn dollars over the next four years, and what that shows is that the global economy is uncertain, and that’s weighing pretty heavily on our budget and on our economy more broadly. Will the government still roll out cost of living relief? Chalmers said the government’s priority was “rolling out the relief that we’ve already announced and already budgeted for.” Obviously there’ll be new measures in the budget [next year], but the nature of those we haven’t taken decisions on that. He said the government had already indicated people shouldn’t expect surpluses in the mid year budget update: We’ve been upfront about some of the reasons why, in some of the years, there’s a little bit of slippage in the budget – but not every year – and that’s the inevitable consequence of some of these pressures. Chalmers ‘grateful’ to see five Bali Nine members released back to Australia The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, spoke with ABC RN just earlier and also welcomed the arrival of five Bali Nine members back into Australia. Asked if there were conditions placed on their release, Chalmers said not as he understands it: I think this was an act of cooperation and commitment and compassion from President Prabowo, and we’re very grateful to him for that. These guys committed some serious offences, but they’ve been in Indonesian jails for the best part of two decades. Now it was time for them to come home, and I’m pleased that they’re home. And asked to describe the Australia-Indonesia relationship, Chalmers said this shows “the capacity to work closely together and on a range of fronts”: Not just this one, certainly on the economic front. I work very closely with the finance minister, Sri Mulyani, and my colleagues work closely with their counterparts. And I think this is an indication, really, that President Prabowo has done a good thing, the right thing, and we’re very grateful to him for that. A second person has died following a fatal crash in Armidale at the weekend. A car and several cyclists collided about 3.30pm on Saturday afternoon, before the car continued and hit a tree, NSW police said. One of the cyclists, a man in his 60s, died at the scene and is yet to be formally identified. Three other cyclists – aged 57, 39 and a teenage boy – were treated by paramedics before being taken to John Hunter hospital and Armidale hospital in a stable condition. The driver of the vehicle, a 30-year-old woman, was trapped and released shortly after emergency services arrived. She was treated by paramedics and airlifted to John Hunter in a critical condition and died in hospital yesterday. Officers established a crime scene, which was examined by the crash investigation unit, and a report will be prepared for the coroner. EV sales represent one in 10 new light vehicle sales in 2024 Electric Vehicles represent nearly one in ten new light vehicle sales, a 150% increase on 2022, according to the Electric Vehicles Council. Its state of EVs report, released today. forecasts new EV sales will reach at least 15% to 19% in 2026, based on current policies in Australia. NSW claims the top spot based on EV policies, followed by the federal government and ACT, WA, QLD and Victoria, SA and Tasmania and the NT. The report also highlights that in Australia this year: About 110,000 new EVs are expected to be sold this year, a major milestone for the Australian market; There are now 122 EV models, and more than 220 variants – a 50% increase in variants compared to 2023. The number of fast and ultra-fast charging locations across Australia has nearly doubled within a year, surpassing 1,059 sites nationwide. At these locations there are more than 1,849 high power public chargers. The council’s chief scientist, Dr Jake Whitehead, said: It’s clear that a growing number of Australians are seeking cleaner, more efficient cars. This year’s gradual growth in EV sales and market share builds on the momentum of a blockbuster 2023, further driving the upward trend in BEV and PHEV adoption. By any measure, there are more EVs on our roads today than ever before and that is set to grow. The pace of this growth, however, will depend on the level of support from governments and industry. NSW premier glad five Bali Nine members back in Australia Chris Minns also weighed in on five of the Bali Nine members being returned to Australia over the weekend. He told the program he was glad they are back in Australia: I’d say that the drug trade is horrible and insidious and it does take lives, but these people have been in jail in a third-world country for 20 years. That’s a big price to pay. I have to say, I’m glad they’re back in Australia. I also think it serves as a warning, particularly to young people, of how strict and applied the prison sentences are in south-east Asian countries for drug importation and indeed for many of them, if not all of them. The sentence is death. So as morbid as that is, I hope it’s a reminder to particularly young people to never get involved in this horrific trade, because it could take your own life in the process. The NSW premier, Chris Minns, will today lay a wreath in Martin Place to mark the 10-year anniversary of the Lindt cafe siege. He spoke with the Today Show earlier and said the siege occurred before he was in politics and he remembers watching it on television live everyone else and “being gripped by what was [happening and] staying up through the night.” It was a horrifying evil act, and it’s terrible that it took two people’s lives. But I think if there’s a glimmer of hope, if you squint and you see a glimmer of hope, it’s that there was an absolute outpouring of love and community solidarity in the days afterwards. And I think we remember that as much as the evil acts on those two days. Bureau of Meteorology says highest temperatures since black summer fires forecast across certain areas Dean Narramore, a Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier to provide an update on the heatwave conditions across the country. He explained that for some areas, this is the hottest summer conditions since the black summer fires, five years ago: It’s the first big burst of heat of summer and for some, it’s probably the hottest temperatures we have seen since the terrible black summer of 2020. Five years in some areas. As we flagged earlier, large parts of South Australia and Victoria today, including Melbourne, are facing dire temperatures: So hot, dry windy conditions, and some dry thunderstorms this afternoon with some gusty winds definitely [are] a fire concern. Ben Shepherd, an inspector with the NSW Rural Fire Service, said NSW would fare a bit better when it comes to fire danger because grass cutting rates are higher: The grass is still greener than we would typically see, but it’s not going to take much until we start to see dangerous fire conditions … It now looks like we’re banking up heatwaves or high fire danger for a number of days. That’s going to prove problematic, especially as we approach Christmas as well, and we start to see people travelling around the state and potentially entering high risk areas. New funding to fast-track pre-election social housing projects The Albanese government says it is unlocking up to $3b more from the Housing Australia Future Fund (Haff) and has partnered with state and territory counterparts to fast-track social housing projects and build up to 5,000 new homes for low-income Australians. The new partnership, which will be announced formally by the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, today, involves state and territory governments releasing land and joining with community housing providers to devise and oversee projects that will boost social housing stock. The approval process is being fast-tracked, with applications closing at the end of January and decisions to be made soon after. This timing would enable the Albanese government to announce the locations of the housing development projects before the federal election, due by mid May. Yesterday, O’Neil said: The way out of this housing crisis is to build, build, build. This partnership is about building thousands of homes quickly and it’s one part of Labor’s ambitious plan to build more houses right across Australia, making housing more abundant and affordable. The first round of Haff funding, announced in September, aims to build up to 13,700 social and affordable homes. More from the funding for local news and community broadcasting Continuing from our last post: The funding for AAP over three years is designed to recognise its key role in supporting media diversity and local news. The subscriber news service provides news from around Australia and is a mainstay for local news organisations in particular. It was saved from closure in 2020 by a consortium of philanthropic investors. Another $3.8m is being directed towards a national media literacy strategy to help Australians apply a critical eye to the news and information they consume. The federal government has also vowed to devote at least $3m a year of its overall advertising budget to advertising in regional newspapers for the next two years. It is establishing an expert advisory panel to advise on how the media sector can best be supported, including through philanthropy. It also has a review under way into the sustainability of the community broadcasting sector. The funding announcement comes after the government confirmed last week that it would impose a levy on major tech platforms which did not strike ongoing financial deals with media organisations for the use of their news content. The federal government is committing $180.5m to support local news outlets and community broadcasting through a newly established news media assistance program which includes $33m for the national news wire service, Australian Associated Press. The funding package includes $116.7m over four years to support media organisations’ capacity to deliver public interest journalism and local news, though details were not available ahead of the formal announcement due on Monday. A further $15m will be spent on community broadcasting, $3m of that on community television, and another $12m will support First Nations media through the Indigenous Broadcasting and Media Program. In a joint statement, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, and Indigenous Australians minister, Malarndirri McCarthy, said local media and community broadcasting are “critical to the health of our democracy, social cohesion and informing communities”: Local news and community broadcasting is at the heart of local communities, and makes a vital contribution to national identity and media diversity in Australia. AAP has more details on the extreme heat warnings in place, as a sweltering heatwave brings one of the hottest December days in years. Temperatures in the high 40s are expected in parts of Victoria and NSW, while the Northern Territory faces severe to extreme heatwave conditions for much of the next three days. While Adelaide sweated through a 40C day yesterday, Victoria and NSW endured a night of minimum temperatures between 12 and 16 degrees above average. Extreme fire danger has been declared in Victoria’s central and western districts while Melbourne, with an expected forecast of 41C, will face its hottest day since January 2023 and its hottest December day since 2019. The mercury is expected to hit 46C in Mildura in the state’s north-west, 45C in Swan Hill and 44C in Horsham. Total fire bans have been declared across most of Victoria with incident management teams and firefighting aircraft on standby in critical regional areas. While Sydney can expect a mild start to the week with a 28C maximum forecast for Monday, parts of inland NSW could face even more extreme heat than Victoria. A maximum temperature of 47C is expected in Wilcannia, in central north-western NSW, and 46.5C in Ivanhoe, about 180km further south. Happy Monday, and welcome back to the Australia news live blog. My name is Emily Wind, and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage throughout most of today. The federal government is committing $180.5m to support local news outlets and community broadcasting through a newly established news media assistance program. This will includes $33m for the national news wire service, Australian Associated Press. The funding comes after the government confirmed last week it would impose a levy on major tech platforms which did not strike ongoing financial deals with media organisations for the use of their news content. Karen Middleton will have all the details shortly. Meanwhile, much of Australia will bake under intense heatwave conditions over the coming days, with multiple regions set to record temperatures above 40C. The Bureau of Meteorology has issued heatwave warnings for large parts of northern, eastern and central Australia, covering every state and territory except Western Australia and Tasmania.

Heatwave conditions have pushed temperatures beyond 45C in four states and territories, with the mercury passing 40C in some Adelaide suburbs by 10am. More than 50 schools and early childhood centres in Victoria were forced to either close, relocate or switch to remote learning. The remote New South Wales towns of Wilcannia and Ivanhoe were forecast to break December heat records, with some areas not expected to record their maximum temperatures until about 5pm.

The report predicts the popularity of EVs to double over the next two years. Before bed read Just over a week ago no one knew who Luigi Mangione was. After he was revealed as the alleged assassin of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, on 4 December, he quickly became one of the most polarising figures in American pop culture. Ben Makuch unpacks the forces – rage, race and good looks – behind the lionisation of this murder suspect. Daily word game Today’s starter word is: MAC.

          "bodyText": "It had been hard to judge the wind’s strength. On the Isle of Skye there aren’t many trees to bend, and despite the low temperatures the chimneys of the few white-washed crofting cottages we had driven past on the way to the western tip of the island were not smoking. But as soon as we parked at Neist Point, it was obvious it was blowing a hoolie. Water is meant to fall downwards, yet all along the step of the cliff that bends away to the east, the run-off from rain and snowmelt was being flung into the air in spindrift fountains. As soon as we got out of the car the wind was there with us. It shouted jet engine-loud in the shells of our ears. It pushed against our chests and plugged our breath with its own. We gasped with the shock of it, and then, just as suddenly, we laughed. We planted our feet and leant into the wind and tried shouting at each other. Look, we motioned to each other, we are being supported, we are being carried. At primary school I remember how we were banned from practising “black magic”: a game where a group of us would try to lift a friend up with just our little fingers while chanting, “light as a feather, stiff as a board”. On this cliff-top, the wind contained the same dizzying magic. We were suspended in the air. Leaning. Our weight held at an impossible angle. Held up by nothing. Not far from the road was a path, marked by bollards, that led down to the headland and – somewhere beyond the gigantic, upstanding crag of An t-Aigeach – the lighthouse that we had come to visit. The low glow of a December sun cast a light that seemed to have been frothed by the wind over the muscular ridge of rock, while a sea the colour of old ice smashed itself to pieces on the black of the basalt rocks. The spray smoked up from below, as if Skye had suddenly been made volcanic again. There were six of us (plus a slightly resistant jack russell) on the walk that Christmas Eve. My wife, Jen, my children Seth and Eliza and our close friends James and Anna. We had come north for the holidays, staying in a cottage that faced east towards the black sands of Varkasaig beach (known locally as Orbost). Not far from Dunvegan, with its 13th-century castle, deli and restaurant, but isolated by two miles of teeth-rattling track, it was a location that was comfortably remote. A place where we could relax, talk, walk and take bracing swims in the tidal waters of Loch Barcasaid before warming our bones in front of a crackling wood fire and watching the weather blow in off the sea. Because, after all, it was the weather that had led me to this spot on the Isle of Skye. It was here that, honed by the sea and the business end of winter, I hoped to find what would usually be described as the very worst kind of British weather. It was during the heatwave of 2022, a time I started longing for rain, that I realised my relationship with weather had become lopsided. I had, however unconsciously, started to view sunny weather as good and everything else as, well, bad. In some ways, it’s an understandable narrative. The sun boosts feelgood hormones, serotonin levels and gives us vitamins. From an early age, as soon as a fist can hold a yellow crayon, we see the sun as a symbol of beaming happiness. We worship it. We bathe in it. And then, when winter comes and our world tilts away from it, some of us even chase it across hemispheres, travelling thousands of miles at great expense to feel its goodness, to warm our hard-working bones. But what if we could find equal joy in other weather? If we could learn to also appreciate the beauty of the rain; the wild freedom of the wind; the dazzling play of light sparking off haw frost or the otherworldly enchantment of fog. Could weather we disregard and shun (by which I mean weather we might think of as “miserable” rather than life-threatening or home-swamping) actually turn out to be luminous and nourishing if only we open up to it? Walks, just like this one at Neist Point, were an attempt to redress the balance and helped me realise that all types of weather – our most talked about natural phenomena – can be sublime, beautiful and yes, fun. Certainly, my experience of walking, running and swimming in a heatwave-breaking storm, a shower, the frontal downpour over Cumbrian crags, or a day of drizzle, has shown me that there is little sadness in rain. In fact, it feels like the opposite. There’s a lightness, a joy in experiencing something utterly fundamental about the world. It is a feeling backed up by science. Because when the clouds burst, there is something other than water in the air; negative ions are atmospheric molecules charged with electricity. They are most abundant around places like rivers, beaches and mountains, where air molecules are broken up by moving water. They are found near breaking waves, by waterfalls and they are there, too, when it rains. But as a teacher, wind is more feared than any wet break. It does something to the children; fills them with energy and leaves their brains clinking away like ships’ masts. Physiologically, there is evidence that the wind changes us. Adrenalin production increases, the blood vessels of the heart dilate, increasing blood flow and oxygen supply. Pupils widen, the skin contracts, forcing hairs to stand on end. The body prepares for fight or flight. No one is really sure why we’re so sensitive to the wind. Some suggest it is an evolutionary throwback – a state of high alert to conditions that could mask the approach of predators or threaten shelters, life and limb. Staying in the wind maintains that state of emergency. Yet, to us, it doesn’t feel like stress at all. It feels almost euphoric. On Skye, we felt something similar. We clambered up on rocks to take photos of each other gooning around, leaning into the wind, standing on the rocks with our arms wide, as if we were on the prow of a ship rather than this prow of rock. We took videos of the crash and thunder of the sea, recordings filled with light and movement and a roar that sounds like rocks being ground by teeth. It reminded us of the podcasts we had listened to on our drive to Scotland: dramatisations of famous hauntings, modern accounts of things that are ghostly and strange. Seth and Eliza, hair whipping across their faces, were standing facing the sea, their eyes closed, their mouths open as if they were being filled up from toe to tip. There was a magic to that day, to that moment. I felt it too when we swam in the Fairy Pools near Glenbrittle: a system of glacier-carved waterfalls where the pools are deep, clear and burning with cold. As we got dressed, shivering and shaking off the snowflakes that had started falling while we were in the water, we saw we had the place to ourselves. A landscape that can fill with people in summer (the problem of excessive tourism is a regular discussion point in the local press) had been emptied by the weather. The same was true when we drove north-east across the island. At one point we stopped the car to have a snowball fight on an empty road fringed with sparkling, scalloped drifts. On the beach at An Corran, we were the only souls searching for dinosaur footprints under the watery arch of a sleetbow. Even at the Old Man of Storr on the Trotternish Ridge (one of the island’s busiest attractions) the number of visitors could be counted on one hand – something that added to the location’s wild, craggy, beauty. Perhaps the relative solitude of Skye helped me notice more: to tune in and soak up every second with my friends and family. The quiet, along with the weather, helped me be present in a way that was truly restorative. What I do know is that standing with my loved ones watching the crepuscular light turn the snow of the Cuillin mountains gold, certainly felt more warming to the soul than lazing on any sun lounger.

          "headline": "Five ways to help fix the criminal justice system in England and Wales",
          "bodyText": "Few would argue that the criminal justice system is not in crisis, with huge backlogs in the courts. Here are some ideas on how to fix it. Invest in legal aid and the courts Cash may seem like the simplistic option, but when the cuts to criminal legal aid have been so huge – 43% in real terms since 2004-05, according to a 2021 report – and led to a shortage of practitioners, it is no surprise that lawyers’ bodies have been united in demanding an immediate and substantial increase in fees. More than 1,400 duty solicitors (a quarter of the total), who provide free independent legal advice to people at police stations or courts, have left practice since 2017. A recent government-commissioned report said there were insufficient criminal barristers for the number of cases. Last year, 1,436 trials (one in 20) were cancelled in the crown courts on the day planned because of a lack of counsel, compared with 71 in 2019, according to the National Audit Office. If fees remain low compared with other areas of practice, lawyers will continue to choose them instead of crime. Sam Townend, head of the Bar Council, has said the government’s objectives to reduce violent crime and halve violence against women and girls “can only be achieved if we have appropriately remunerated barristers and solicitors working in a properly funded legal system”. The courts are also in desperate need of investment, with crumbing buildings and not enough judges and staff. Reverse sentence inflation In September, the four surviving former lords chief justice of England and Wales (the most senior role in the judiciary) plus an ex-head of criminal justice put their names to a paper by the Howard League for Penal Reform, calling for a fundamental shift in sentencing policy. The report said sentencing inflation had been driven by governments legislating to impose minimum sentences where crimes, typically murder, are committed in aggravating circumstances and the result was to raise the level of sentences imposed across the board. The former judges said sentencing inflation was the primary cause of prison overcrowding, which was hampering rehabilitation, and urged “a return to more modest proportionate sentences across the board”. At the lower end of the offending spectrum, sentencing inflation can push cases that would otherwise be heard by magistrates into the crown courts, increasing the burden on judges. Magistrates can only hand out maximum sentences of a year (increased from six months to help tackle the crown courts’ backlog). The government has launched a sentencing review, chaired by the former Conservative justice minister David Gauke, who has indicated that sentences for some serious crimes may be reduced. Bring back a courts inspectorate The closure of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Court Administration was announced in 2009 and it ceased operations two years later. In 2022, the Commons justice committee recommended it be re-established. While the government told the committee that the oversight provided by the existing criminal justice inspectorates – including HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate and HM Inspectorate of Probation – were sufficient, the committee heard evidence from others including the Criminal Bar Association, who disagreed. The then chief of the CPS inspectorate said it could not delve into important issues, such as court listings, because they were outside its scope. The committee concluded: “A courts’ inspectorate, which is independent from government, could make a substantial difference to the accountability and transparency of the justice system. “It could use inspections and the promised improvements to the quality of the data to make recommendations that can inform policy and guidance in both criminal and civil justice.” Adopt a holistic defence model Holistic defence is a less discussed remedy than others on this list, but it has been backed by Helena Kennedy KC, one of the UK’s most renowned criminal lawyers and a Labour peer, and has had impressive results in the US, where it has been pioneered by the Bronx Defenders Service in New York. Under such a model, defendants not only engage with their legal aid solicitor but also get access to essential support services such as mental health intervention, substance abuse counselling, housing and benefits advice, and assistance with disabilities, parenting, caregiving, immigration or employment. Evaluations from the US have found that it results in fewer incarceration days for defendants without compromising public safety, leading to direct cost savings in terms of prison maintenance, administration, food and medical expenses. Commons Law, a community interest company, has called for a publicly funded pilot project in London to trial a holistic defence regional hub. The 2021 government-commissioned independent review of criminal legal aid gave prominence to the concept promoted by Commons Law, stating: “There are many cases where the individual concerned has many problems, which result in criminal behaviour, but simply dealing with the defence to the crime does not tackle the underlying issues.” Fund data and technology Like cash, better data is another classic boilerplate solution for an ailing public service. But it is widely accepted that there is a lack of data about the justice system, which makes tackling problems such as the backlog much more difficult. Dr Natalie Byrom, who helped to develop a digital strategy for HM Courts and Tribunal Service in 2018, has said the justice system is lagging behind areas such as education and health in collecting and using data to understand performance and impact. Areas of the justice system where there are data gaps include the length of time people are spending in custody pending trial or sentence and the reasons they are not bailed. Byrom has said the justice system has failed to collect basic data about those involved in it, the outcomes of the decisions it makes and their long-term impact. The 2017 Lammy review said data on racial and religious disparities in the justice system was not always collected and, when it was, it was not always shared, preventing outside scrutiny and analysis. The Law Society has said: “Better data is needed on the effect of remote hearings and the experience of claimants who represent themselves. “Without this data, policy is being made in the dark. Better data will help show where investment is needed and what changes are working.” • The headline of this article was amended on 16 December 2024 to refer to England and Wales, rather than the UK."

          "bodyText": "Good morning. A small Victorian tourist town has scores of houses for sale but almost none for rent – forcing local workers to live out of vans. What is going on in Bright? A 14-year-old Queensland boy with a severe intellectual disability was sentenced to nine months’ detention – despite not verbalising a plea in court. And: we probably all remember the first holiday – and the worst holiday – we ever took. Today we’re introducing our new Away with series, highlighting the travel tales of prominent Australians. Australia North Queensland | A 14-year-old boy with a severe intellectual disability was wrongly convicted by a magistrate who recorded guilty pleas to charges, despite the child being incapable of instructing his lawyers and not verbalising a plea. Housing crisis | The small tourist of Bright in Victoria has 100 properties for sale but just two for rent – it has been described as an “extreme version” of Australia’s housing crisis. Revealed | Mining exports are forecast to plunge more than $100bn over the next four years and deliver an $8.5bn hit to company tax receipts – a $36bn reversal in expected federal revenue compared with a year ago. Fiji tourists | A group of Australian tourists are seriously ill in hospital in Fiji with what local authorities suspect is alcohol poisoning, after drinking cocktails at a five-star Coral Coast hotel resort. Bali Nine return home | The five remaining members of the Bali Nine who were jailed over a drug-smuggling plot have returned to Australia under a deal negotiated with the Indonesian government. World Middle East crisis | Israel will close its Dublin embassy after Ireland backed a petition at the ICJ alleging Israel has committed “genocide”; Israel has launched dozens of airstrikes on Syria despite the rebel leader’s peace pledge; Syrian Alawites are fearing for their future under rebel rule. Cyclone Chido | Several hundred people are feared dead after a powerful cyclone ripped through the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte, leaving “apocalyptic” scenes. Yoon Suk Yeol | South Korea’s conservative president has reportedly failed to obey a summons from prosecutors over charges including insurrection as he faces impeachment after declaring martial law. US politics | A senior Republican, Lindsey Graham, has contradicted Donald Trump by saying that January 6 investigators should not go to jail; anxious scientists are bracing for Trump’s climate denialism: “We have a target on our backs.” Black Sea pollution | Two Russian tankers carrying more than 4,000 tonnes of oil products have sunk amid stormy conditions, threatening an ecological disaster. Full Story Sara Haddad on why Australia’s MPs should do the reading on Palestine This summer Australian politicians are being encouraged to read more widely on the history of Palestine. Five books were sent to all 227 federal MPs and senators as part of a campaign backed and funded by dozens of Australia’s most prominent authors. Nour Haydar speaks to author Sara Haddad – whose novella The Sunbird is in the bundle – about the summer reading for MPs initiative, Palestine, and writing as activism. In-depth After Luigi Mangione was revealed as the alleged assassin of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, Brian Thompson, on 4 December, the former quickly became one of the most polarising figures in US discourse. To some, he’s an anticapitalist arch villain. To others, he was allegedly exacting revenge against the unchecked avarice of medical insurance companies. To yet more, he’s a young man struggling with a variety of intense health issues. Not the news In our new Away with series, we’re asking prominent Australians about their life in travel. We’ll hear about the trips that shaped our favourite personalities, their holiday rituals and, yes, the times it went awry. The Sydney cook and comedian Nat’s What I Reckon shares a hard-learned lesson about booze on long-haul flights – and reveals why switching on overhead hotel lights should always be avoided. Sport Football | Amad Diallo inspired Manchester United’s comeback 1-2 win to stun Manchester City in an ill-tempered local derby; Ange Postecoglou’s Tottenham side may return to winning ways against Southampton. Cricket | Steve Smith steadied Australia and Travis Head put India to sword on day two at the Gabba, writes Geoff Lemon; a skittish England side collapsed in the face of a NZ fightback in their third Test.

          "bodyText": "Reading “made in China” on his toys for the first time, my young Chinese nephew asked me innocently whether Santa was Chinese. Oddly, like Santa’s elves, toy assembly workers in China remain remote and faceless to most of us in the west. In Britain, most Asian migrants work backstage, too, kept in kitchens or workshops, taking the first and last train, earning low wages and hidden from our eyes. In many countries this Christmas, instead of being acknowledged for alleviating our cost of living crisis, those foreign workers will be vilified for stealing our jobs and threatened with tariffs whose consequences economists are still not certain about. It is always easier to blame people who remain invisible and voiceless. Although our world has never been so interconnected, and hence our nations so reliant on each other’s labour, Chinese society remains poorly understood. In the west, Chinese people remain enigmatic, the ever-silent and under-represented minority. When scrutinised, it is often with a political lens as well, maybe showing some cognitive bias. The question today should be how much value the free movement of products and people has brought to our nations and how to ensure that it keeps doing so in the future. As evidenced by world history, curiosity and interest towards foreign societies has often been an engine of progress. Christmas is a time to reach out and be thankful to one another: it is hoped that this spirit will continue to animate our politicians and societies in this coming year.

          "bodyText": "Thank you for joining us today. Just a reminder that play will start 30 minutes earlier than usual tomorrow (9:50 local time / 10:50 AEDT) weather permitting. Expect some early declaration speculation and plenty of nervous glances towards the rain radar. Just a word on over-rates. Today’s play started 30 minutes earlier than usual, ended 30 minutes later than scheduled, featured Ravindra Jadeja bowling 16 of the quickest overs you could imagine, and the fall of just seven wickets – and yet still only 88 overs were eked out. This is two fewer than expected on a normal day, never mind one expected to feature 98 overs to make up play lost yesterday to rain. An engrossing opening session gave way to an Australian avalanche as Travis Head and Steve Smith batted the home side into a dominant position at the end of day two of the Third Test. Jasprit Bumrah (5/72) played an increasingly familiar lone hand, stemming the flow with the second new ball, but India looked tired in the field and Rohit Sharma bereft of inspiration as captain. All eyes turn now to the skies with rain forecast on each of the three remaining days. Will Australia have enough time to force victory or can India escape with a draw? 101st over: Australia 405-7 (Carey 45, Starc 7) Akash replaces Jadeja in the attack, one suspects in a bid by Rohit to ensure this is the final over of the day. Australia nurdle a couple of singles then Carey goes walkabout again, failing to connect on this occasion. Another couple of singles, then time-wasting from both sides to see the clock tick beyond 5:50pm and closing time. 100th over: Australia 401-7 (Carey 44, Starc 5) A two then a one from Starc, dead batting into the off side brings up Australia’s 400. With just three days remaining and rain forecast, it’s impossible to see them losing from this position, but will they have the time to force through a victory? 99th over: Australia 397-7 (Carey 43, Starc 2) Jadeja does his best to race through his work and keep Australia quiet but after three dots Carey lap sweeps for four with beautiful touch, then batters a slog sweep over cow corner for a barbarous six! 98th over: Australia 387-7 (Carey 33, Starc 2) Starc off the mark with a couple down to third. Siraj finally has his first wicket of the Test, a regulation nick behind from a back of a length delivery. It arrives the ball after conceding five wides for a tennis ball bouncer. He barely celebrates. India are cooked. 97th over: Australia 378-6 (Carey 33, Cummins 18) This partnership is now into the 50s, and it has been very handy indeed, coming at a run-a-ball, advancing Australia just when India threatened to be clawing their way back into the contest. Rohit turns to Jadeja to wrestle back some control, and he does the job, going for just a single, despite Carey attempting a Pant-like reverse slog. 96th over: Australia 377-6 (Carey 33, Cummins 17) Carey calls Cummins through for a quick single but he would have run out his skipper had Siraj hit the stumps with a creative flick in his follow through. Another questionable Carey call next ball invites confusion in the middle, and this time Siraj hurls at the stumps, misses the lot, and concedes an overthrow. Very end of day areas at the Gabba. Carey changes the mood with another dance down the track. Siraj spots it, digs it in, but the keeper was committed and swats a pull-drive over long-on for four! That was a remarkable passage of play. A high quality late-cut makes it two boundaries in the over as Carey gallops into the 30s. 95th over: Australia 365-6 (Carey 23, Cummins 16) Gorgeous cover drive for four – all-run! – from Cummins, latching onto some length from Nitish with Carey running smartly, recognising the likely boundary was going to hold up on the soft outfield. 94th over: Australia 360-6 (Carey 22, Cummins 12) Siraj coms into the attack and lands four deliveries in the right areas. Carey then ventures on one of his periodic journeys down the pitch and slashes three into the offside. This day’s play is really petering out. Neither side is making much of an effort to keep the pace of the game up, the crowd is making that restless hum, and with the cloud cover coming over it all feels like everyone would be better shaking hands and coming back tomorrow. 93rd over: Australia 355-6 (Carey 19, Cummins 11) Following another drinks break there are just 43 minutes left in the day, and none of Australia’s top order are in their whites up on the balcony, so I think we can rule out a declaration this evening. Nitish takes over from Bumrah and Australia work five runs with little fuss. The final of those was courtesy of a misfield from Akash, demonstrating how tired and weary India are starting to look in the field. It’s been a long day for them, but they’ve only bowled 80 overs. I long for the over-rate revolution. 92nd over: Australia 351-6 (Carey 16, Cummins 9) Cummins again almost drives to gully, this time off Akash, who also gets one to seam and swing back into Carey and cause the Australian keeper some discomfort. As he did two overs ago, Carey responds by sashaying down he pitch and long-handling a length ball, but he doesn’t middle it and has to settle for two. 91st over: Australia 348-6 (Carey 14, Cummins 8) Bumrah comes wide on the crease to angle in a couple of bumpers at Cummins, then lands one on a perfect length to draw an edge that doesn’t carry to the diving KL Rahul in the gully. 90th over: Australia 347-6 (Carey 14, Cummins 7) Australia continue to accumulate, but Akash shows the potential of the new ball on this deck by ripping a jaffa that is too good for Carey. Carey responds by coming down the pitch, eliminating any sideways movement, and belting a drive through long-off for four. There are 22 overs still scheduled to be bowled today with just 25 minutes remaining, so we’ll have to take that extra half-hour, taking us through to 5:50pm local time (6:50pm AEDT). With cloud cover starting to form again, and the floodlights taking effect, there’s a chance Australia might look to declare before the close and invite India to bat in these gloomy conditions. 89th over: Australia 340-6 (Carey 8, Cummins 6) Carey’s demeanour since striding out to the middle suggests Australia’s strategic approach is to keep this game moving quickly. He flays a boundary through the covers off a perfectly serviceable Bumrah delivery, then Cummins adds four more from a rare leg-stump half-volley. Given the prospect of inclement weather during the remainder of the Test, and the strength of the home attack, a first-innings total of 340+ may already be considered a match-winning one. 88th over: Australia 330-6 (Carey 3, Cummins 1) Australia’s No 7 &amp; 8 exchange singles before Carey is beaten on his outside edge by Akash from around the wicket. The strike rotates and Cummins plays and misses an attempted cut. Suddenly the pressure is back on Australia with no set batter at the crease and India with a ball just eight overs old. 87th over: Australia 327-6 (Carey 1, Cummins 0) Bumrah rips the final delivery from a double-wicket over past Cummins’ outside edge. Three wickets in the past 20 minutes and Bumrah has single-handedly turned this procession back into a contest. Carey’s beaten first up before realising the safe space is the non-striker’s end. His dab into the off side is fielded by Siraj who pulls up with cramp in the act of gathering the stroke. Then Bumrah gets his fifth! Again it’s a length delivery angled in (this time from around the wicket) that holds its line and draws the edge. Superb bowling from India’s one-man attack. It brings to an end a Test-defining knock from Travis Head. 152 quickfire runs that have put his side in the box seat. Brilliant batting. Bumrah with the new ball is threatening to bowl India back into this contest! Textbook delivery, angling in from over the wicket, holding its line, drawing the edge, and carrying comfortably to second slip. Marsh looked skittish during his 16 ball stay and his demise is little surprise. 86th over: Australia 325-4 (Head 151, Marsh 5) Akash cramps Head from around the wicket but he still scampers through for a single to bring up another milestone. The South Australian is dominating this series. Then Marsh is almost caught and bowled! A length delivery sticks in the wicket but Marsh follows through with the stroke anyway and bunts at catchable height towards the bowler in his follow through. Akash sticks out a right hand instinctively but it misses its target by a few inches and Australia’s No 6 gets off the mark. Marsh soon gets another life! Top-edging a pull down to backward square leg but it lands just in front of Gill coming in off the rope. After cruising for most of the day Australia are going through a little wayward patch. 85th over: Australia 318-4 (Head 149, Marsh 0) Marsh remains on none, and again misses out on an attempted pull as Bumrah sends down a rare maiden. 84th over: Australia 318-4 (Head 149, Marsh 0) Towards the end of a day dominated by Smith’s footwork, that was a tired, leaden-footed swipe at a full delivery, more reminiscent of recent struggles than the free-flowing batting of the previous couple of hours. Head gets Marsh on strike with a single, then the allrounder fails to get off the mark, missing a loose Akash delivery down the leg side. A single off the last is then adjudged a leg-bye. Big final hour coming up for India. Following the final drinks break of the day Australia work three singles off a Bumrah over that looks pedestrian, until he comes from widen on the crease and draws Smith into a drive that flies to the right of the tumbling Rohit at first slip who holds on this time to take an excellent catch. Smith walks off with 101 to his name and the satisfaction of playing himself back into form. That was an innings full of resilience and it’s put Australia in the box seat in this Test. 82nd over: Australia 313-3 (Smith 100, Head 146) Akash shares new ball duties but after a sighter Smith on-drives with technical precision to move to 99. Then he nudges off his pads for his 33rd Test century, and first in 26 innings. He had to really battle through his first 50 or so runs, but since then he’s been towed along in Travis Head’s slipstream, looking increasingly fluent and back to something like his old self. Meanwhile, Head continues on his merry way, getting a thick outside edge that beats gully and races away for four. 81st over: Australia 302-3 (Smith 95, Head 140) The new ball is taken immediately and gifted straight to Jasprit Bumrah. Can the Indian talisman drag his team back into the contest? He has two slips and a gully to Head.. who whips a half-volley off his toes over midwicket for an undemanding boundary. The second ball keeps low after pitching, not the first to that in the past hour or so, which will delight Australia’s pacemen with 300 runs already to defend. Ball three is full and wide and Head appears to dig out a bump-ball drive that is claimed spectacularly by a diving Jaiswal in the gully, who hurls the ball into the air thinking (perhaps) there’s a catch. The third umpire takes little time confirming the ball was hit into the deck off the bat. Bumrah sees the over out neatly, but there was little to excite him about the new Kookaburra. 80th over: Australia 297-3 (Smith 95, Head 135) Siraj draws an edge from Smith… but the old ball kept low off the pitch, then off the bat, and doesn’t threaten to carry to first slip. Decent over from Siraj, no boundaries from it, and out comes the second new ball. 79th over: Australia 295-3 (Smith 94, Head 134) Six balls, five singles. Rohit is just hanging Jadeja out to dry. One over of punishment before India can take the new ball. 78th over: Australia 291-3 (Smith 92, Head 132) Siraj bowls ok, Australia accumulate for five balls, then on the last Head just stands and delivers on the rise from off stump back down the ground for an intimidating boundary. That was brutish. 77th over: Australia 282-3 (Smith 90, Head 125) Rohit could also have hooked Jaedja from the attack but he’s out of options with the new ball so close. Smith takes advantage, freeing his arms through the off side and flaying a boundary through square cover. Can Smith reach triple figures before the new ball? 76th over: Australia 277-3 (Smith 86, Head 124) Rohit is forced to remove Nitish from the attack and call on Siraj, who immediately beats Head for pace as he tries to cut a delivery that lacked width. Just one run from a much tidier over. Meanwhile in Hamilton, play has ended on day two of the third Test with New Zealand well on course for a consolation victory over England. 75th over: Australia 276-3 (Smith 86, Head 123) Now Smith drills Jadeja through extra cover, and with the kind of insouciance we haven’t seen for a while, barely acknowledging the stroke as it races to the fence. It’s a shot that brings up the 200 partnership between this pair, one that began as a rebuilding job, became a platform, and is now a Test-defining combination that India have no answer to. 74th over: Australia 269-3 (Smith 81, Head 121) Nitish’s pace is dropping and Smith is starting to go through the gears, latching onto a wide delivery he’s been accustomed to leaving, then flowing his hands through an extra-cover drive that’s all timing. I think we can safely say he’s played himself back into form. Whether it’s consistent run-scoring form remains to be seen, but it’s a knock that removes any doubts over his place in this XI for the remainder of the summer. 73rd over: Australia 261-3 (Smith 74, Head 120) This pair are making life difficult for India. Rohit wants to sit on Jadeja from one end until the new ball but Head carves him through the covers for four, then Smith lofts him one bounce into the sightscreen for four more. Never mind the new ball, Australia may have already taken the Test away from India before it arrives. 72nd over: Australia 251-3 (Smith 69, Head 115) Nitish shares duties after tea but his first ball is overpitched and Head punches it with the full face of the bat straight back where it came from for a boundary of effortless simplicity. Then he’s dropped! Head tries to work Nitish off the stumps to leg and gets a leading edge that carries to a diving Rohit at second-ish slip, but tumbling away to his left the skipper can’t hold onto the chance despite getting two hands to the ball. Smith completes the over with a free swish of the blade, scything through the shot like a swashbuckler in an Errol Flynn movie for another confidence-boosting boundary. 71st over: Australia 237-3 (Smith 65, Head 106) Jadjea begins after Tea, and he almost jags the big wicket of Head with the centurion going too hard at a cut that wasn’t on after the ball spun into him off a length. He’s lucky to see his inside-edge run down to fine-leg instead of crashing into his pegs. There’s still the slight possibly of a shower before the day is out, but that chance is becoming more remote every passing minute. We should be in for ten or so overs of Australia making hay before what is likely to prove a Test-defining 90 minutes with the second new ball. 70th over: Australia 234-3 (Smith 65, Head 103) Australia complete the session without losing a wicket. They have motored from 75-3 to 234-3, turning this Test on its head. Travis Head has been the catalyst, but Steve Smith is grinding his way back into form at the other end. India’s bowlers haven’t done too much wrong, but they lack anything resembling a plan to Head, and Rohit has been slow to respond to this partnership following a nip-and-tuck opening couple of hours. 69th over: Australia 231-3 (Smith 64, Head 101) Smith nurdles Bumrah away for a single to bring Head on strike. The crowd gets involved, clapping Bumrah through his approach and “ooohing” as Head’s mistimed cover drive fails to beat the field. The claps return the following ball, and this time they are capped by raucous cheers as Australia’s star man clips three runs off his toes to bring up an effortless and rapid century. Another game-changing knock from the South Australian. He is in the form of his life, and the timing couldn’t be better as colleagues struggle around him. 68th over: Australia 227-3 (Smith 63, Head 98) Short and wide from Nitish and Smith unfurls that heavy-handed cut that comes down like an executioner’s axe, pounding the ball to the cover fence. Nice comeback from the allrounder though who almost pierces Smith’s defence with a yorker, then follows that up with some extra bounce off a length. A single off the last comes much to the frustration of the Gabba crowd who are ready to salute Head’s inevitable ton. 67th over: Australia 222-3 (Smith 58, Head 98) Rohit breaks the glass in case of emergency and calls on Jasprit Bumrah to bowl his 18th over of the innings. Head couldn’t care less, bullying his second delivery off a length for four through mid-on. Then Smith plays one of those extra-cover drives where his feet are in position seemingly before the ball has been bowled and his bat looks about three blades wide. It only earns three on the slow outfield but it’s an ominous sign nonetheless. Prepare to stand and applaud another Head century sooner rather than later. 66th over: Australia 214-3 (Smith 55, Head 93) Nitish replaces Siraj and Head welcomes him to the attack by crunching a long hop in front of point for yet another boundary. Now Smith gets in on the act, pulling with vintage timing well in front of square. Is he back? 65th over: Australia 205-3 (Smith 51, Head 88) More runs for Travis Head, rocking back and carving Jadeja through the covers for four, then watching the ball onto the bat for a late cut worth two. Australia are putting their foot on the gas and India seem unable to respond. 64th over: Australia 196-3 (Smith 50, Head 80) Whenever Siraj drops short to Head the Australian goes on the attack. The latest example is an uppercut for four down to third from a delivery on off stump that would have cramped a batter in poorer form. India need Rohit to get a hold of this situation and start setting the narrative, whether it’s a short-ball approach to Head, bowling dry to Smith, or rotating his attack. At the moment Australia are taking control of this Test reasonably unopposed. 63rd over: Australia 191-3 (Smith 50, Head 75) Head slaps Jadeja through the covers for a long three after a smidgen of extra bounce forces a rare false stroke. Smith then nudges a single to mid-on to bring up a 42nd half-century, and surely one of his most hardworking and determined. Australia are now scoring at five rpo through the past dozen or so overs, taking the initiative away from India. 62nd over: Australia 184-3 (Smith 49, Head 71) Head continues to play a different game to the rest of his countrymen, swatting a pull from just in front of the badge on his helmet behind square for four. That was a decent bouncer from Siraj and his frenemy treated it with disdain. Another boundary follows soon afterwards, but far less convincingly, with a mighty slash outside off stump flying through the undermanned cordon. That’s the hundred partnership, and Head is bringing Smith along in his slipstream. 61st over: Australia 173-3 (Smith 48, Head 61) Three singles from another rapid Jadeja over. This partnership is now 98, and with Head in full control of his game. India have a big 19 overs coming up before the second new ball is due. 60th over: Australia 170-3 (Smith 47, Head 59) Head effortlessly ramps Siraj for a one-bounce four, much to the annoyance of Simon Katich who is furious the man who has been fielding at a fly-slip/third is no longer in position. Of course Rohit then returns a fielder to that posting immediately afterwards. On the subject of recently retired TV commentators… This tweet is an astute observation and a pattern we’ve seen repeated throughout the past 20-30 years. Right now we have David Warner in his early commentary career sweet spot on FOX, along with Aaron Finch doing his best to add value on the mic on Seven. The challenge for broadcasters is extending these windows for as long as possible (see Ricky Ponting) to avoid the expert analysis either losing currency as the game changes around them, or the cricketer segues into a broadcaster and stops making the effort as they become too comfortable with the sound of their own voice (see most of the rest). At least with two options here in Australia I can flick between call teams when, say, Brett Lee thinks his job is to be funny, or James Brayshaw calls Steve Smith “Smudge” like he’s a footy player kicking a goal on FM radio. 59th over: Australia 163-3 (Smith 46, Head 53) Jadeja again does his best to improve the over-rate, conceding just a single for his troubles. The partnership is now up to 88. I’m going to steal a nugget from cricket writer Daniel Cherny who has just tweeted “ Steve Smith batting average in Test cricket in 2024: At the Gabba: 143 / Everywhere else: 15.” 58th over: Australia 162-3 (Smith 46, Head 52) Smith continues to sidestep a long way across his stumps and earns a couple of leg-byes down to fine leg. Then he doesn’t move as far and is fortunate to squirt a leading edge through the vacant point region for a couple more. He is really grinding out there, but he keeps Siraj wicketless and moves closer to a half-century. 57th over: Australia 158-3 (Smith 44, Head 52) Jadeja hurries through a maiden, keeping Head watchful on the crease. Thank you Angus, and hello to everybody else out there. After two quickfire Tests that moved at breakneck speed, we’re now halfway through an engrossing day of more traditional high-quality fare. India’s four seamers have given little away, and only Travis Head has looked to take the game on with the bat. Steve Smith’s innings has been fascinating, watching him return to that bold trigger movement to the off side and survive a number of near misses on both edges and marginal LBWs. It’s been dry for most of the day despite heavy showers drifting inland across south east Queensland from the Pacific. There remains a chance one or more of those may clip the Gabba before the close of play. And that close is scheduled to be 5.20pm local time (6.20pm AEDT) with an unlikely 56 overs scheduled to be bowled in the next three or so hours. Please send me your emails and keep me company. The address is jonathan.howcroft.casual@guardian.co.uk. 56th over: Australia 158-3 (Smith 44, Head 52) Five from the over as Head takes another a pair of runs and a single and Smith takes an aerial route to another two from the bowling of Siraj. That brings this partnership to 83 – much-needed by Australia. That’s me done for the day! Thanks for your company and emails. I pass the baton to Jonathan Howcroft who’ll take you home to stumps. Siraj is back but Head is merciless. He takes the bowler’s short ball at 135kph and pulls hard in front of square for two to bring up his third 50-plus score in a row. Great batting by Head. He is hauling this Test match back into Australia’s favour. 55th over: Australia 153-3 (Smith 42, Head 49) Was that a snick?! Jadeja wangled his field, bringing in a silly mid-on with great fanfare. Head went to drive and missed. Big appeal from thw bowler but Rohit Sharma, with just one referral left, demurs. Good call – that noise was bat hitting pad. The next noise is Head whacking Jadeja over the top for FOUR down the ground. Wide again goes Jadeja? Down the ground again goes Head! Suddenly, with conbsecutive boundaries, Head is within sight of a half-century. 54th over: Australia 143-3 (Smith 42, Head 40) Akash Kumar Reddy is into his 18th over – the most for India in this innings. He has 0-39 with five maidens to show for it but has straightened his lines since the first session to make the batters play more often. And play Smith does! Akash put that one wider and Smith got onto his toes to cut for FOUR! 53rd over: Australia 139-3 (Smith 38, Head 39) Ravindra Jadeja bustles through another lightning-fast over, with just a single to Travis Head and a no-ball to show for it. The allrounder is in his 78th Test and averages over 35 with the bat and 23 with the ball with 3235 Test runs and 319 wickets. Yet he’s been left out of the side for this series until now! 52nd over: Australia 137-3 (Smith 38, Head 37) After Head’s single, Akash zeroes in on Smith’s leg stump. But Smudge is onto it and whips it quickly through midwicket for three runs. Head hammers square but can’t breach the field. It’s just a single and brings him level with Smith on 38. Akash beats Smith with the fifth and the batter bows his head to show he’s been bested. 51st over: Australia 132-3 (Smith 35, Head 36) Jadeja is a spin bowler who bowls quickly, hustling in and cranking out his deliveries like a dervish. Six balls disappear in a flash with just a leg bye leaked. 50th over: Australia 131-3 (Smith 35, Head 36) Smith drives down the ground for FOUR. It was a ripe half volley from Akash, who looks to be tiring in his 16th over, and Smith took full advantage, uncoiling a magnificent shot to send the ball to the rope. Great response from the bowler as he whips one, then a second, past the outside edge. We have an appeal… no raised finger… and no referral. Rightly so, as replays show that noise was ball hitting hip en route to the ‘keeper. Akash rips the next one past Smith’s batr and into his left pad and appeals afresh for LBW. Rohit refers it… and rues it. Replays show it flying over the top of leg stump. 49th over: Australia 127-3 (Smith 31, Head 36) Interesting change for India. Coming into bowl the 49th over is Ravi Jadeja, the world’s best allrounder in his first game of the series. And straight away he finds turn from this Gabba green top, getting one to fizz and stay low on Head. He’s up to the oddity though. And now he punishes extra bounce by pulling Jadeja around the corner for a muscular FOUR. Six from the over and the Smith-Head partnership has hit FIFTY. Of those, Steve Smith has contributed just 13. 48th over: Australia 121-3 (Smith 31, Head 30) Head ramps Bumrah for FOUR! What a shot. The Indian master dug the ball in short at 138kph and the Australian No 5 calmly leaned back, took it off his moustache and lifted it over the slip cordon for the craftiest of boundaries. Shot! Over in Hamilton, England have collapsed to be all out 143! Rather than enforce the follow-on New Zealand are batting again with the buffer of a 204-run lead. 47th over: Australia 116-3 (Smith 31, Head 25) As Akash toils into his 15th over and the mercury nudges 30C in Brisbane, the Smith-Head partnership hits 40 runs, the best of the Australian innings so far. There is a beach ball doing the rounds of the outer and Smith is momentarily distracted, too much to score anything off the bat. 46th over: Australia 115-3 (Smith 31, Head 25) Bumrah’s 16th over is sharp and nasty and Australia take two singles, with neither batter eager to retain strike. Fascinating sessions ahead – will Head rip the Test from India’s grasp as he did in Adelaide? Or will Bumrah blast out the home side as he did so potently in Perth? 45th over: Australia 113-3 (Smith 30, Head 24) Akash is into his 13th over and has 0-25 so far. His first ball is a fast yorker and Head whips it off his toes for two. He looks in good touch does the Australian vice-captain. Indian enforcer Mohammed Siraj is back on the field after his dicky hamstring came good. He chases it down and gets his customary jeer from the outer. Heads cuts the second ball for a single. Smith shuffles into a straight ball and draws an appeal from Akash. But there’s no support from his teammates let alone the umpire. 44th over: Australia 110-3 (Smith 30, Head 21) Swish and a miss! Smith left the first one, chased the second. Bumrah drew him forward and Smith stepped out late and missed. Now an inside edge narrowly misses the timberwork and runs away to fine leg for FOUR. Rueful smiles from both batter and bowler but danger signs for Australia. Bumrah has a full belly and an appetite for destruction. A single to Smith gets him to 30 and brings Head on strike. Bumrah switches to around the wicket and angles it in on a leg stump line. Head steps out and meets it, driving for an easy single to keep strike. Players are back on the field and action is about to get under way. It will be Jasprit Bumrah to Steve Smith… What a terrific session that was – rain-free and action-packed! Under blue Brisbane skies, India won the early battle thanks again to their fast-bowling maestro Jasprit Bumrah (2-26 from 14 overs). He dismissed both Australia’s opening pair of Usman Khawaja (21 from 54) and Nathan McSweeney (nine from 49) in a brilliant spell of controlled yet aggressive bowling in the morning session. Australia rallied for a time with a 37-run partnership between the twitch twins of Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne. Then, in the 33rd over, Nitish Kumar Reddy wrestled back the momentum for the visitors, drawing Marnus forward and catching the edge for Virat Kohly to pouch his second catch of the day. It put Australia on the brink at 75-3. Smith lived dangerously with his hot-stepping from leg stump to off and was lucky to survive several close appeals. But he endured, and has battled his way to lunch unbeaten on 25 with just a solitary boundary from his 68 balls faced. Travis Head has typically added rocket fuel to the innings, charging to 20 from 35 balls with two boundaries. His battle against Bumrah in this next session may yet define the Test – and the series. Time to wet the whistle and bolster the belly. Back soon! 43rd over: Australia 104-3 (Smith 25, Head 20) Travis Head doesn’t believe in blocking his way to a break. First ball from Akash he attacks and drives for two runs to deep cover. Then a single to take his total to 20 from 32 and this partnership to 26 at a strike-rate of 50. Smith taps another one onto his tally. Head again has a heave at Akash but misses. His drives at the fifth but Bumrah cuts it off with a dive. In good news for India, Mohammed Siraj is back on the field seemingly recovered from his hamstring twinge. That will be lunch. 42nd over: Australia 100-3 (Smith 24, Head 17) After Smith pushes Bumrah through square leg for a single, Australia’s hundred comes up from a Head push backward of square. One more over before we break for a feed I reckon. 41st over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 23, Head 16) Travis Head isn’t playing for lunch – he’s ever-hungry for runs. Two balls in succession he’s tried to slash Akash over gully and failed. Now he flashes again and Pant has to really jump to haul it down. A very eventful maiden! 40th over: Australia 98-3 (Smith 23, Head 16) Smith v Bumrah isn’t quite Godzilla v Kong although “Smudge” isn’t a bad moniker for a metropolis-marauding behemoth. Not in this over though. After Head’s sharp single from Bumrah’s front-foot no-ball, Smith plays out three dots. 39th over: Australia 95-3 (Smith 23, Head 15) Just a single for Head as he cuts backward of square. Nitish keeps it tight for the remainder of the over as Smith looks to lunch. 38th over: Australia 94-3 (Smith 23, Head 14) Finally, we have the monster match this crowd has been waiting for: Head v Bumrah. Head takes a single from the first, Smith does likewise. And now… WHACK! Head gets onto the front foot and drives with pinpoint accuracy between mid off and cover for FOUR. Lovely shot. He tries to replicate it on the next but doesn’t middle it. Instead it’s a sand iron chipped over the infield for three. Suddenly, Travis Head has 14 from 16 balls and is officially away! 37th over: Australia 85-3 (Smith 22, Head 6) As Siraj continues and Bumrah remains ominously on ice, Australia take two backward of point. Tully Haines has been in touch by email after a fielding mishap resulted in what Tully believes is a fatal twist of fate for Marnus: Hi Angus, I was very worried Labuschagne would get out that ball, Smith’s shot for three clearly touched Bumrah’s trousers while his arm was on the ground over the rope. Should have been a four and Smith should have stayed on strike. Meanwhile, Ross McGillivray joins the chorus of critics who loathe Labuschagne’s slow-motion walk off after being dismissed… Marnus strolls off as slow as can be practising the shot he thinks he played that hit him out. He’s a bit of a worry. Agree, Ross. Not a good look by Marnus. But it’s been going on for some time now hasn’t it? Would you consider it dissent? And whose job is it to call him on it? India have another worry. Mohammed Siraj has gone off with an injury. 36th over: Australia 83-3 (Smith 20, Head 6) Head… SHOT! Nitish gave him width and Travis whacked him to the boundary with a square cut that disappeared in a flash. Head tries it again but this time it’s stopped by the infielder. He gets a single from the next instead but this Test has started to accelerate now Australia’s wrecking ball No 5 is at the crease. There’s a mild appeal as Head’s pull shot misses by a millimetre. Nothing doing. 35th over: Australia 77-3 (Smith 19, Head 1) Mohammed Siraj is back for a tenth over but surely Jasprit Bumrah will return next over to take on Head before he gets going. But not yet. First we have a huge shout for LBW against Smith – no appeal mind you, as Siraj continues his annoying habit of charging to his slip cordon rather than asking the question of the umpire. Umpire says NO but it’s a no-shot by Smith and an ugly one. He stepped across and got hit hard and high on the right pad. Siraj was certain he had the wicket but the umpire shook his head. Sharma referred it… but no dice. Although it’s clipping the off bail, we will stay with the infield decision. Now we have more controversy as Siraj loses the towel tucked into his waistband in his delivery stride. Smith plays a shot while pointing out the anomaly and somehow manages a run. Head finds a single off the last to finish a weird over. 34th over: Australia 75-3 (Smith 15, Head 0) After that wicket, Travis Head walks to the wicket on a run of three golden ducks in a row at the Gabba! He survives the first ball from Nitish, thankfully one of those legside deliveries that undid him in the past. Head’s hands are flashing as always, hungry for bat on ball. But he can’t get off the mark just yet. Good over by Nitish. Farewell, Marnus Labuschagne! Nitish has really bent his back and bowled beautifully this morning and now he has his reward. That was a faster ball angled across the batter and Labuschagne went to drive with hard hands and misjudged the pace to send a thick edge straight into the sticky fingers of Virat Kohli at second slip. Australia three down and India on top! 33rd over: Australia 72-2 (Labuschagne 12, Smith 15) A middlin’ shout by Siraj against Smith is dismissed by both umpire and India captain Rohit Sharma. They run a legbye instead. A strange moment now as Siraj walks down the pitch and switches the bails, a piece of gamesmanship straight out of the Stuart Broad Playbook! Labuschagne’s riposte is to wait until the bowler turns his back before switching the bails back. Now Siraj, steam issuing from the ears, puts one around Marnus’s ears and follows it with some fruity lip service. Marnus gets one off the hip through midwicket and runs two. Cricket is a game full of strange superstitions… 32nd over: Australia 70-2 (Labuschagne 10, Smith 15) Nitish returns for a fourth over. Labuschangne is bogged down with just eight runs from 43 balls. Finally, runs! He moves his total on with a well-timed flick off the pads for two. Siraj fields on the boundary and the pantomime villain gets a chorus of jeers from the Gabba crowd. Labuschagne drives the next one, an over-pitched ball on middle, but Bumrah moves quickly to his left to stop what looked a certain boundary. Good fielding India. 31st over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 15) Another lovely shot by Smith from Siraj’s first ball. He adds two more with a controlled swipe through midwicket for two. The big beligerent quick retaliates by banging the next one in faster on leg stump and it’s very nearly LBW. Luckily, Smith gets a bit of blade on it. Good bowling! Smith was beaten by the pace there. and Siraj is starting to get the ball to skid on 30th over: Australia 67-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 15) Bang! Smith drives Nitish handsomely for three runs. He has 15 and is starting to look good. 29th over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 10) A curious over as Siraj and Labuschagne throw a flurry of blows at each other for no runs or reward on either side. Some handsome shots by the batter but can’t pierce the field. Some scorching deliveries by the bowler but no edge. Ultimately, it’s a very entertaining maiden. Siraj comments on this curious turn of events with a flash of his forked tongue at the end of the over. Labuschagne blows a bubble and smirks. Don’t poke the bear Marnus! 28th over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 10) Australia are slowly rebuilding after the loss of their opening pair. This partnership is now worth 24 from 56 deliveries. Jasprit Bumrah is out of the attack and they have the second and third-change bowlers Siraj and Nitish coming at them. Can they cash in? Not in this over. Nitish, firing them down at 127kph, bowls a maiden. 27th over: Australia 62-2 (Labuschagne 8, Smith 10) Labuschagne finds a single from the first ball of Siraj’s sixth over. The big quick makes Smith play at the next two. Fourth ball is short – VERY short. It flies over the batter and wicketkeeper Pant and runs away for five wides. Smith salts the wound with a glanced single from the fifth. 26th over: Australia 55-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 9) Double change by India as Nitish Kumar Reddy enters the attack for his first over of the Test. He delivers a mixed bag in his first foray, probing outside off stump and that leg stump line Smith seemns vulbnerable to. Five dots until Smith works one out of his ribcage for a fast-run deuce. 25th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Jasprit Bumrah is grabbing a breather and captain Rohit Sharma has brought his firebrand fastbowler Mohammed Siraj into the attack. Right from the jump he gets Labuschagne hopping. Now he catches Marnus i9n front and not offering a shot. Huge shout! Umpires says NO. The India skipper says YeahbutNoReview. And it’s a good call – straight but flying over middle stump. Good bowling by Siraj, risky batting by Labuschagne. Drinks are on the field here at the Gabba and it’s 53-2. Over in Hamilton it’s 54-2. New Zealand may have lost the series against England but they are going down with a fight in this third and final Test. A flurry by the tailenders got them to a first innings total of 347 and they now have both openers out and England in trouble. 24th over: Australia 53-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Akash needs a spell. He’s releasing the pressure Bumrah builds with over after over of wider balls that are too easy for the batters to leave. Finally after four air balls, Smith drops and runs… and gets two leg byes. Awkward to watch as Smith thrust leg and bat at it, but it’s two more on the total. 23rd over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Another edge! This time it’s Labuschagne caught on the crease by Bumrah, squared up and snicking just short of second slip. Next delivery is a peach, sliding down the channel a whisker from the bat. Even Marnus claps his bat in appreciation of that one. Rightly so. Bumrah is on song. Somehow, after a couple more swishes, Labuschagne survives the over. 22nd over: Australia 51-2 (Labuschagne 7, Smith 7) Beaten! Labuschgnage chased Akash there and it very nearly resulted in his demise. Better bowling by the six-Test tyro from Delhi. But that’s wide and fiull again and Labuschagne punishes it, sending it just short of the midwicket boundary for three. And now more luck for Smith! He flinches and edges, sending it skidding through the slips cordon for a very tinny boundary. Fifty is up for Australia. 21st over: Australia 44-2 (Labuschagne 4, Smith 3) Bumrah to Smith. This will be quite the duel. Smith is caught on the hip by a ball angling in at 138kph. He pushes into the offside for tight run. Good strike rotation by these two so far. Smith started this 112th Test of his career needing 296 runs to reach the coveted 10,000 Test runs mark. He is four runs closer to that dream. As is Labuschagne, who scampers a single from the last. 20th over: Australia 42-2 (Labuschagne 3, Smith 2) Straight away Smith, who is batting way outside leg stump, is taking a big step back and across to negate the swing. His first ball from Akash is a straight-out play and miss as he’s beaten on the inside edge. Akash is aghast. Smith takes a run through midwicket from Akash’s third ball to get off his duck. Labuschagne takes a single and Smith does likewise to close out the over. 19th over: Australia 39-2 (Labuschagne 2, Smith 0) Steve Smith is at the crease and Jasprit Bumrah is on a tear with two wickets already this morning. His first ball is a trap – a legside lure that Smith chases. Risky! That’s what cooked his bacon in the last Test but he still goes for it. A leg bye ensues. Bumrah strikes again! McSweeney snicks off to Kohli at second slip and the visitors are suddenly on fire at the Gabba. Nine runs off 49 balls for the rookie opener in his third Test. Poor footwork and Bumrah angled it in and the edge was healthy and lethal. That won’t quiet the calls for NSW young gun Sam Konstas to get a shot as Australia’s opener. 18th over: Australia 38-1 (McSweeney 9, Labuschagne 2) Finally Akash makes McSweeney play… and he edges! But it’s low and wide of slip and scuds to the boundary rope. In one streaky stroke McSweeney just doubled the total it took him 44 balls to compile. Shackles sprung, he runs a single to celebrate. Labuschagne gets off the mark with a dodgy clip to fine leg, inside edging a straight one onto his pad and taking two. Akash had 0-3 from five overs but now has 0-10 from six. 17th over: Australia 31-1 (McSweeney 4, Labuschagne 0) Here comes Marnus. Can he pick up where he left off in the second Test? That strong knock led Australia to victory and saved a career which hung by a thread after two very ugly dismissals in the opening match. He gets behind the first few as Bumrah straight away attacks his pads. Khawaja goes! Beautiful bowling by Bumrah who banged it in at 137kph on a fourth-stump line and drew a feathered edge. India have first blood on day two and again the visitors have exposed Khawaja who has got himself into a fatal habit of jumping to meet the rising delivery. That one was full and angled and it caught Australia’s veteran opener indecisive with minimal footwork. He played… and lost. 16th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 21, McSweeney 4) It’s Akash’s birthday but Nathan McSweeney is getting all the gifts. Six dots in this over but not one of them made the batter play. India need wickets and McSweeney, already a formidable astonewaller, isn’t going to chance his hand if he doesn’t have to. 15th over: Australia 31-0 (Khawaja 21, McSweeney 4) First runs! And it’s a handsome back foot swish through covers by Khawaja. Two runs. Bumrah was a tad short yesterday and he starts day two in the same vein. No sign of seam movement or swing so far. Bumrah squares up Khawaja on the next – good comeback by the master quick who starts his seventh over with 0-10. Big shout on the third as Khawaja misses a straight one but the edge was audible for mine. Maybe Jasprit was just warming up the tonsils. He finishes with a flourish, beating the batter with two zingers to close. Game on! 14th over: Australia 29-0 (Khawaja 19, McSweeney 4) It’s Akash Deep’s birthday today and he gets a four-ball over first-up to celebrate. His first ball is… wide. So is his second. Two sighters for McSweeney – what a gift for a batter who’s starting the day with four runs from 33 deliveries and a strike-rate of 11. Fifth ball is a no ball. Last one is a leave. So ends an over that took 22 hours to complete. Here we go, folks…. buckle ‘em up and batten ‘em down! As players prepare to take the field under increasingly blue skies here at the Gabba, it’s nice to hear Melbourne’s own Hunters &amp; Collectors (street name: “Hunners”) providing the soundtrack for this summer’s thali feast of cricket… Brisbane isn’t the only city complicating Test cricket with the unpredictability of its weather patterns. England and New Zealand are fighting out the final Test of their series in scorching heat and high wind. Here’s how Ali Martin saw day one in Hamilton. With the series square at one-all and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy now down to a – weather permitting – three-Test shootout, both teams are eyeing the bonus prize of a spot in the World Test Championship, most likely against ladder-leaders South Africa. Yesterday’s rain gave us plenty of time to ponder the permutations if weather intervenes in this contest.As Martin Pegan sees it: India are the most at risk of paying a price if rain ruins this contest with the two-time WTC runner-up needing to win all three remaining Tests against Australia to guarantee qualification to another final. If Australia regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy for the first time since 2014-15, they would almost certainly return to the final after beating India in the 2023 decider. Australia could still qualify for the final if the series against India is drawn 2-2, with two Tests in Sri Lanka to play early next year. Our own Geoff Lemon had plenty of time on day one to mull over where both teams’ fortunes lie based on the flip of a coin… Good morning cricket fans and welcome to day two of the Guardian’s live coverage of this third Test between Australian and India for the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Angus Fontaine here for the first chunk of play (touch wood) before Jonathan Howcroft takes you through to stumps. First things first: it’s ISN’T raining at the Gabba. It’s cloudy and it’s windy. It’s hot and it’s humid. Hell, there are even some skinny streak of blue overhead. But there’s NO RAIN. So all things going well, play will resume an hour early today with action to get under way at 9.50am local time (10.50am AEST). The forecast for today is the best for the week ahead. Things aren’t looking so bright for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. “Showers and thunderstorms are possible during the next few days, however no significant rainfall is expected,” the Bureau has told us. But let’s live for today and get ready for what umpires have deigned to be a minimum 98-overs of cricket. Rain condemned us to a measly 13.2 overs bowled by India on day one, all in the first session, as 81 millimetres was dumped on Brisbane in what meteorologists are dubbing a “rain bomb”. That torrent triggered flash-flooding across Queensland and sparked fears the city could be in for floods as catastrophic as the record-breaking deluges of 2022. But it didn’t dampen Australia’s spirits as they sought to cash in on India captain Rohit Sharma’s curious decision to win the toss and bowl on a Gabba ‘green top’. Despite the persistent showers, opening pair of Usman Khawaja (19 not out) and Nathan McSweeney (4 not out) kept their powder dry, compiling their highest opening partnership of the series and going to an early lunch safe and snug with the scoreboard at 28-0. From the little we saw, India’s bowlers were a touch short, allowing three-Test rookie McSweeney to hang tough again after his excellent 39 in the second Test, as he left Jasprit Bumrah judiciously and eked singles where he could. Meanwhile, his normally dour senior partner Khawaja showed impressive intent, leaning back and unfurling a couple of the lovely boundary strokes we’ve come to expect from him. Australia fans will be hoping for more of this on day two."

          "bodyText": "Born in Kuala Lumpur in 1960, Jenny Eclair is a comedian, actor and author. The daughter of a major in the British army, she spent her childhood in Singapore, Malaysia and Germany, until the family settled in Lancashire. After studying drama at Manchester Polytechnic, Eclair began standup in the 1980s, and in 1995 became the first female solo comic to win the Perrier award, now the Edinburgh comedy award. Her career since has been prolific: comedy tours, writing and hosting for TV, radio and podcasts, as well as publishing six novels. She lives in London with her husband Geof Powell; her daughter is the playwright Phoebe Eclair-Powell. Her book Jokes Jokes Jokes: My Very Funny Memoir is out now, and she is touring until June 2025. It was the mid-90s and I was at my peak when this photo was taken. I looked exceptional, glorious, fabulous – the most beautiful girl in the world. I had discovered a brand of fake tan that worked well on my skin, and my body was toned from all the yoga. There was a lot of money sloshing around in comedy, so I could afford to do lots of different setups for my Edinburgh festival poster. I went into the studio with several ideas, one of which involved this bunny outfit from the 1970s. It was really quite decrepit. The rabbit I’m holding is Flopsy, my daughter’s pet. Flopsy was lovely, but disappeared one day. Her hutch door was open, but there wasn’t a smear of blood. It must have been a fox, but I got the blame. In the end we didn’t use this shot – we went for one with me in electric curlers in a dressing gown, and I don’t think much else underneath. The show itself was called Prozac and Tantrums, which didn’t make sense alongside a photo of me and a bunny. I suppose we made the right call, as I got the Perrier. I was 35 and only had a few more years of feeling that good before I went rapidly downhill. There was a lot of power in being beautiful, and I do wonder now if it was more than a coincidence that my sudden success in comedy happened in conjunction with that period of looking good. Regardless, that success didn’t make me feel fulfilled. In fact, I unravelled as soon as I won. The aftermath was like a dream – my photo even made it on to the front page of the Guardian! But the euphoria was short-lived, almost nonexistent. I was hit with a barrage of bad feelings after the fringe: horror, homesickness, a massive hangover. I felt as if I had to live up to this bravado, and that made me quite panic-stricken in my private moments. Every single pore in my body was screaming: “This is great, enjoy it!” But it was also damaging. Limiting. My management really struggled to know what to do with me. It wasn’t an expected win, so there was nothing lined up. They wanted me to get a safe footing in the industry and did manage to wrangle me a series on Channel 5. A late-night chatshow with booze. It was a bit mad, really. Plus I knew I was playing a character. I was not being myself. I spent all my 20s and 30s trying to make people think I was great; it was exhausting. It wasn’t until I was in my 40s, when I became a novelist as well, that I was able to get to the point where I had a following who understood who I truly was. I started out in punk poetry. Back then, I wore little black cocktail dresses with diamantes and slingblack stilettos. A curated look. But when it came to comedy, I never, ever wore a skirt or a dress on stage. Women were in the minority. Hattie Hayridge [who played Holly in Red Dwarf], once got her skirt lifted up by someone in the audience mid-set. It’s only in the last couple of years that I genuinely wear what I want. Anorexia is a disorder you skid into, and it’s very, very difficult to get out of. My disordered relationship with food began when I was at drama school, and accelerated during the summer holidays when my mother was in hospital. She was having an ovary or kidney out. I was so self-obsessed, I didn’t think to ask which functioning organ was being removed. But either way, she was gone for several weeks, and my father couldn’t cook anything beyond eggs, because he was a 1970s man, and my brother was much younger than me, so it was my job to hold the fort. I realised quickly that it was very easy to cook for other people and not for myself. My big trick was spaghetti bolognese on chopped white cabbage instead of pasta. In some respects, I wish people had been firmer with me. Actually, a friend of my older sister’s did say something effective at the height of my disorder that proved therapeutic. She said: “I never, ever thought you would become this boring.” I wouldn’t get out of bed. I was weak. Socially, I was closing down. But I really enjoyed the attention as well. It was a very vicious circle. I loved people looking at me. Anorexia is something I can joke about now, because I’m overweight. A doctor would probably say I could lose three stone. But the condition has had a very far-reaching effect. I still have rules. I will not have lunch before one o’clock, and I prefer to delay eating. I have a lot of delayed gratification. I used to more or less exist on Diet Coke, but it just gives me cystitis now. I still don’t eat cake, but I genuinely don’t have a sweet tooth. It has been erased from years of discipline. The sugar almost gives me a migraine. Occasionally, I catch a glimpse of myself on a Zoom call and think: “Oh, you’re still quite cute.” But I know that my neckline has gone. If I was serious about what I looked like, I would definitely have a neck lift because, like my dad, like a pelican, I’ve become very jowly. I have good skin, but I can’t wear eye makeup for any length of time because I have dry eye disease. The days of a good smoky eye have long gone. I’m fortunate that my glasses suit me and I’m really looking forward to the silver of my hair coming completely through. I finally won’t have to bother with the bleach. I first had it streaked when I was 15, so going grey is going to be a big moment of change. When it comes to my career, being very hard-working for many decades is now petering out. I am 64 and letting that go. Geof is 76 and I want to spend some time with him. I also want to spend time with my grandson, especially now my daughter is so busy. I realised all of this in lockdown – it was a great rehearsal for retirement. I get a lot of pleasure from being at home, doing hobbies. I love painting. As soon as I became menopausal, the hobbies took over and replaced my libido. I have no sexual urges, but put me in a craft shop and I get very excited. I have accepted that I have been as successful as I will ever be. The chances of getting a fabulous TV deal are remote, but I’ve paid off my mortgage, so there’s a sense of freedom from that. My job now is to entertain the people that like me. I cannot be fucked to persuade anyone new that I am great. If you don’t like me now, you’re never going to, so let’s leave it at that."

          "headline": "Dune at 40: David Lynch’s oddball adaptation remains a fascination",
          "bodyText": "In another universe, Star Wars ended with David Lynch. Intrigued by the monochromatic surrealism of Eraserhead and The Elephant Man, George Lucas approached the oddball auteur to take the reins on the third installment of the breakout space opera, only for Lynch to decline. If he hadn’t, however, he would have pushed the grotty practical effects and the Jedi’s quasi-mystical soup of east-west philosophizing to new extremes strafing the inscrutable. The resulting film would have been so aggressively strange, so unconcerned with commercial appeal or even basic legibility, so deeply ensconced in its creator’s circle-obsessed psyche that the hoped-for franchise would be regarded as radioactive for decades, its intellectual property arable again only after nearly half a century. The film Lynch did make, 1984’s Dune, allows us to visit this universe. As the rights to Frank Herbert’s doorstopper novel bounced around producers and directors through the 70s before landing on the docket of the risk-taker Dino de Laurentiis, chances are good that the elevator pitch eventually came to include mention of Star Wars, maybe with a “meets Jaws!” appended to tease the sand-worm spectacle sequences. Ambitious showbiz types wanted to believe that a hit was embedded somewhere in Herbert’s intricate jumble of metaphysical lore and interplanetary geopolitics, requiring only an artist of sufficient vision to get it out. The image may seem laughably remote today, but on the heels of The Elephant Man’s eight Oscar nominations, Lynch cut the figure of a thirtysomething awards darling capable of marrying grown-up entertainment with boundary-pushing formal daring. (David Lynch: at one time, the Damien Chazelle of his day!) Once the attached Ridley Scott dropped out to make Blade Runner and Lynch fell in love with the source text, it seemed like all the stars had aligned. The fact of Dune’s spectacular failure has come to eclipse awareness of the film itself, its reputation not helped by Lynch disavowing the compromised, expurgated version of his intended three-hour cut. (An extended TV edit around that runtime only displeased him further, compelling Lynch to remove his name from the credits.) The image of a lithe, shock-haired, baby-oiled Sting clad only in a chevron-shaped leather codpiece inspired giggles aplenty, though that’s nothing compared to the Guild Navigator, a hyper-intelligent mutant jellyfish that floats in a tank full of gas and speaks through a flapping pudenda. Our hero Paul Atreides (a miraculous Kyle MacLachlan in his first screen role) turns into a bunch of rotoscoped polygons when he fights, his family won’t go anywhere without their adorable pet pugs, and they wield sonic weapons called “Weirding Modules” invented for the film. Lynch first scripted his adaptation in two parts, and compressing them into a single feature runtime resulted in a barrage of baroque mythology, character introductions and made-up terminology altogether incomprehensible to the average viewer. Lynch’s disinterest in broad appeal or ticket sales did not serve him at a time before being bizarre and difficult to understand became key features of his appeal, but to portray his efforts as failed would do a disservice to such a vibrantly, audaciously peculiar take on the material. However singular Herbert’s prose, Lynch marshaled his writing back toward the director’s own pet interests; for starters, the deformed newborn haunting Eraserhead gets a successor in the unborn Alia Atreides, her bloody fetal form drifting through the many blasts of future-sight visited upon Paul as the Chosen One. The abundance of opportunities for avant garde-adjacent dream sequences undoubtedly piqued Lynch’s interest in the project, the whims toward abstraction left over from art school finally allowed to run wild on a studio budget. Even the climactic battle on the dunes of Arrakis, the closest the Lynch oeuvre comes to outright blockbuster filmmaking, makes space for the unsettling non-real textures that would remain his stock-in-trade. What was meant to be Lynch’s big crossover to the mainstream stands today as a deep cut for devotees only, most fascinating in its early signs of ideas and themes he would develop more fully later in his career. There’s one view of Dune as a warm-up of sorts for Twin Peaks, another vast spiritual odyssey in which the forces of good and evil wage war in the subconscious of Kyle MacLachlan between indecipherable prophecies. The same enigmatic orbs carrying unknowable messages to Agent Dale Cooper in Peaks’ complex melange of Jungian psychology tease Paul Atreides with wisps of enlightenment in his hallucinations, and there’s even a link be to traced from the constant whispered voiceover to Agent Cooper’s stream-of-consciousness tape recorder memos. Lynch’s outré sensibility polluted the legacy of Herbert’s novel so deeply that every creative choice in Denis Villeneuve’s recent duology seems to have been made in an effort to distance itself. Where Lynch cranked the colors up to a fantastic saturation, Villeneuve opted for a palette of graphites, granites and grays; Lynch’s exuberant, occasionally comic register befitting a story about magic dust and megalomaniacal psychic nuns gave way to Villeneuve’s blaring self-seriousness. If the latter Dune plays like a dirge, the former plays like prog rock, packed with indulgent noodling and extravagant shows of technical virtuosity. And in the most telling sign that these films were produced in different Americas, Lynch’s version dares to include Herbert’s reference to “jihad” while Villeneuve refrained from invoking the touchier associations since placed on the word. Posterity has granted Villeneuve the last laugh in the form of box-office receipts and Oscar nominations, a lamentable confirmation that all a studio needed to do in order to adapt the supposedly unadaptable was drain all of the whimsy out of it. But that tone has now turned Lynch’s film into a respite for viewers turned off by the near-monochrome po-faced ponderousness, genre fans drawn to sci-fi specifically for the weirding (no modules required). Even the long-windedness unavoidable when shoehorning two gigantic novels into two hours and change has its own inept charm, its rhythms so disorientingly unlike those in any other Hollywood product of the time. While he proved an awkward fit for the A-list industry hopes projected on to him, Lynch’s approach to the galactic is the rare sci-fi specimen that feels as alien as its subjects."

          "bodyText": "More than 1,000 days since the inquiry into the Post Office Horizon IT scandal first opened on Valentine’s Day 2022, it is set to hear its closing arguments next week. The chair, Sir Wyn Williams, and his team will then go away to distil the millions of pages of testimony from more than 5,000 witnesses. The final report and its recommendations are expected to be published in 2025, with the hope it will help prevent a repeat of the mistakes that led to hundreds of wrongful convictions. In one of the greatest miscarriages of justice in British history, more than 900 sub-postmasters were convicted of theft, fraud and false accounting between 1999 and 2015, after faulty Horizon software built by Fujitsu made it appear as if money was missing from branches. This week, police said they had identified dozens of persons of interest in their investigation and had recruited an extra 100 officers to look into the actions of executives, legal teams and civil servants. Here’s a quick reminder of what we have learned so far from evidence given to the inquiry. Paula Vennells The most dramatic evidence came from the former Post Office chief executive Paula Vennells, who repeatedly broke down in tears as she claimed she had been misled by her staff over the safety of the prosecutions of branch operators. Vennells said she had been “too trusting”. “I have been disappointed, particularly more recently, listening to evidence of the inquiry, where I think I have learned that people knew more than perhaps either they remembered at the time or I knew at the time,” she told the inquiry. But evidence showed that Vennells had been told of faults in the Horizon system as early as 2011 in an IT audit report. She told the inquiry that she had not understood what she had been reading. Nick Read Read joined the Post Office as chief executive in 2019 to replace Paula Vennells, and with a pledge to “right the wrongs of the past”. He will step down in 2025. In his evidence, he was asked about the claim that he used the phrase “untouchable” to describe a group of Post Office investigators who would never face disciplinary action over the Horizon IT scandal. He was shown a whistleblowing document claiming there were “at least 120 employees” at the Post Office who “to a greater or lesser degree were involved in the wrongful prosecution of SPMs [sub-postmasters]” “My recollection of this [call] is being very, very clear that no one in the business is untouchable. No one is above the law. I don’t know if I used the word untouchable,” he said. The inquiry heard that there was still a view within the Post Office that some of the hundreds of post office operators who had been exonerated were probably guilty. Read was pressed on this and said: “I don’t think I could say specifically that is the case but there will be a view that not every quashed conviction will be innocent.” He was questioned about the whereabouts of the money that sub-postmasters had been forced to pay back to cover supposed shortfalls, but said he was frustrated that it had been hard to find out. The estimated figure for the missing money is £36m. Tim Parker Parker, who was chair of the Post Office between 2015 and 2022, was questioned about the robust way in which the company defended itself against a high court case brought by Alan Bates and 554 other former post office workers in 2017. He said it “may have relied too heavily on the advice of lawyers in the way the case was conducted”. Parker commissioned a report from a barrister into the Post Office’s handling of complaints, which was completed in January 2016, but never shared with the company’s board. Parker said it was because he had received legal advice not to do so, but accepted that, had it been discussed at board level, it could have led to a “different approach” being taken in the lawsuit. Angela van den Bogerd Angela van den Bogerd, who was the Post Office’s business improvement director, told the inquiry she “did not knowingly do anything wrong”. She was asked about testimony she gave to the high court in 2018, in which she insisted she had been aware that the Horizon system could be accessed remotely – suggesting convictions of sub-postmasters were not safe – only “a year or so” beforehand. The inquiry was shown emails sent to Van den Bogerd in 2010, 2011 and 2014 that referred to the fact that Horizon could be accessed remotely and branch accounts tampered with. Van den Bogerd said that she didn’t think she was making a false statement at the time. “The message on remote access kept changing,” she said. Paul Patterson The European boss of Fujitsu told the inquiry that it was “shameful and appalling” that courts hearing cases against post office operators were not told of 29 bugs identified as early as 1999 in the system. The inquiry heard that witness statements from Fujitsu staff due to be heard in court were edited by the Post Office to support the argument that the system was working well. Paul Patterson agreed that both organisations had failed those accused. Ed Davey The Liberal Democrat leader, Ed Davey, who served as postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012, told the inquiry that the Post Office had lied to him about the facts of the scandal, naming Vennells and the former managing director David Smith as some of the “people passing information which was untrue”. He apologised to Alan Bates for his “terse” response to his request for a meeting when he was first appointed to the role – “I do not believe that a meeting would serve any useful purpose,” he said at the time. Davey said he relied on officials to decide whom it was important to meet. They eventually met in October 2010. Kemi Badenoch When the Conservative leader, Kemi Badenoch – who served as business secretary from February 2023 until the general election – gave evidence, she blamed government bureaucracy for getting in the way of delivering swift compensation to sub-postmasters. “[Officials] are worried about – if things go wrong, they’ll be on the hook for that. So they carry out lots of checks and balances well beyond what I think is required in order to deliver the right outcome,” she said. She admitted that the ITV drama into the scandal, which aired in January, “changed the priority of the [Horizon] issue”. She said the issue had gone from being “behind the NHS and security and so on, to something we needed to solve now. It raised the prioritisation.” She described this fact as “extremely disappointing”. Alan Bates In his evidence to the inquiry, Alan Bates, who founded the Justice for Sub-postmasters Alliance (JFSA) in 2009 – and who was made famous by the ITV drama – was scathing. He accused ministers of being vindictive over his own compensation claim. “I have no doubt that there’s a bit of vindictiveness coming in from the [business] department and the Post Office,” he said. “The reason I say that is quite simple. They don’t think there is any worth to any of the work I have done over the years.” “I didn’t set out to spend 20 years doing this,” Bates said. “Once I’d started my individual little campaign, we found others along the way, and eventually we all joined up. It has required dedication, but secondly, it is a cause. “I mean, as you got to meet people, and realise it wasn’t just yourself. And you saw the harm, the injustice that had been descended upon them, it was something that you felt you had to deal with.”"

          "headline": "Fainting, fighting and folk-horror: Florence Pugh’s best films – ranked!",
          "bodyText": "10. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022) The only reason this fabulous DreamWorks animation is not nearer the top of this list is that Pugh is not the star - that’s Antonio Banderas as Puss. But her Goldilocks, head of the Three Bears crime family, is surely channelling none other than the great Billie Whitelaw in The Krays. 9. Oppenheimer (2023) Pugh is sparkiness personified as Jean Tatlock, Oppenheimer’s communist girlfriend in Christopher Nolan’s mighty biopic. Nolan, perhaps sensitive to charges that his films lack sex appeal, shoehorns some clumsily filmed copulation into her scenes with Cillian Murphy. Alas, she succumbs to the director’s recurring “fridged woman” punishment motif. 8. The Falling (2014) Seventeen-year-old Pugh is so compelling in her screen debut that her disappearance midway through Carol Morley’s film, in which 1960s schoolgirls are stricken with mysterious fainting fits, is felt as keenly by the audience as by her classmates. The role of the most popular, precocious, rebellious girl fits the actor like a glove, and she has been knocking it out of the park ever since. 7. Fighting with My Family (2019) In the first of 2019’s three madly contrasting roles, Pugh plays a scruffy English wrestler who finds herself a fish out of water when she tries to make it in the US WWE. Stephen Merchant’s feelgood biopic is stronger on her travails in Florida than her brother’s problems back in Norwich, but the rising star’s gutsy physical performance really does make you believe she could piledrive you into the canvas. 6. We Live in Time (2024) The meet-cute, kids-vs-career conflict and tear-jerking denouement in John Crowley’s romantic weepie benefit from non-linear storytelling (Pugh’s fringe is a foolproof flashback signifier), making the story less formulaic than a chronological synopsis might suggest. But what elevates it are powerhouse performances from Andrew Garfield and, especially, Pugh as a Michelin-starred chef who cracks eggs and gets her head shaved on camera. 5. Black Widow (2021) Scarlett Johansson is the star, but Pugh, speaking with a Russian accent as Natasha’s “sister” Yelena, is the MVP in Cate Shortland’s action pic, more grounded than the usual Marvel CGI-fest (at least until the final act). Sisterly shenanigans include a full-on kitchen fight and poking fun at superhero posing. And hurrah! Yelena will be back in next year’s Thunderbolts*. 4. The Wonder (2022) A pity Netflix’s folk-mystery thriller from the excellent Chilean director Sebastián Lelio had only a limited theatrical release, as it’s one of Pugh’s most satisfying performances. She plays a tenacious English nurse who in 1862 is assigned to a deeply religious community in rural Ireland to report on a young girl who has been surviving without food. But all is not as it seems ... 3. Little Women (2019) Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Louisa May Alcott’s classic is another film where potential overfamiliarity is usefully blunted by non-linear storytelling. It also benefits from Amy’s promotion from bratty little sister to virtual co-lead alongside Saoirse Ronan’s Jo. Pugh matures effortlessly (again with the passing years denoted by a changing hairdo) and earned an Oscar nomination for almost stealing the film. 2. Lady Macbeth (2016) Screenwriter Alice Birch transposes Nikolai Leskov’s novella, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, to 19th century rural Northumberland. Pugh confirms her promise as one of film’s most exciting new talents with an un-ingratiating performance as a young woman, trapped in an unendurable marriage, who resorts to adultery and poisonous mushrooms. But not before Pugh has turned the “resting bitch face” into high art. 1. Midsommar (2019) The slow-burn impact of Ari Aster’s folk-horror, in which a bunch of young Americans are invited to partake of pagan rituals in a remote part of Sweden, entirely rests on the shoulders of Pugh, playing a bereaved student whose raw grief is barely tolerated by her boyfriend and his buddies. Incredibly, her sustained bouts of hysterical weeping and disorientation feel so authentically heartbroken it’s hard not to empathise with her trauma. A remarkable performance."

          "bodyText": "Welcome, readers, to Afternoon Update. John Pesutto has confirmed he will continue his role as Victoria’s opposition leader after a federal court found he defamed MP Moira Deeming in comments made after neo-Nazis gatecrashed a rally she helped organise. At a press conference, Deeming criticised what she called a “relentless and remorseless campaign” against her following the rally, which resulted in her exit from the Victorian Liberal party. Speaking to media outside Victorian parliament, Pesutto described the outcome as “very disappointing”. Asked about former prime minister Tony Abbott’s statement on X that Deeming “should now swiftly be readmitted to the party room”, Pesutto responded: “They’re matters for Mr Abbott, and I don’t wish to comment on this.” Guardian Australia understands several Liberal MPs earlier urged Pesutto to resign, with his deputy leader, David Southwick, and leader in the upper house, Georgie Crozier, also told to “seriously consider their future”.

          "bodyText": "Meta has said it is “99% of the way there” in solving a social media blackout with its apps, which caused issues with Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp. At about 10pm GMT on Wednesday, monitoring website Downdetector said there had been 23,445 reports of Facebook outages, 11,466 for Instagram and 18,646 for WhatsApp across Britain, while in the US all three sites seemed largely unaffected. In an update issued at 10.26pm on X, Meta said the problem was now nearly resolved. A spokesperson said: “Thanks for bearing with us! We’re 99% of the way there – just doing some last checks. We apologise to those who’ve been affected by the outage.” Earlier in the evening, Downdetector was showing large spikes of problems for people using Facebook and other Meta apps. Facebook outages were first reported at about 6pm on Wednesday, with more than 100,000 complaints registered in both the UK and US. Instagram and WhatsApp were also facing similar complaints, with users around the world unable to send or receive messages. The outages were nowhere near as severe as Facebook’s 2021 outage, when a configuration error in a little-known protocol called BGP led to the company accidentally deleting its own address from the systems that allow servers to talk to each other on the internet. Although that error was spotted immediately, it took several hours for the fix to be enacted and take effect – in part because the company’s engineers could no longer gain remote access to their own servers to fix the problem; nor could they use their corporate passes to get through the electronic locks to gain physical access. However, it is not the first time this year that Meta services have been hit by worldwide outages. In March, Facebook and Instagram experienced severe issues around the world, with the services refusing login attempts and feeds stalling. Meta said in a statement on its social network, Threads, at the time: “Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services. We resolved the issue as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience.”"

          "bodyText": "The Pentagon on Wednesday dismissed claims by a US politician that Iran might be launching drones over New Jersey from a “mothership” off the East Coast, Reuters reports. Republican congressman Jeff Van Drew claimed he had uncovered what appeared to be an Iranian plot, telling Fox News and posting on social media that “drones flying in from the direction of the ocean, possibly linked to a missing Iranian mothership'”. “There is no truth to that,” said Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh. “There is no Iranian ship off the coast of the United States and there’s no so-called ‘mothership’ launching drones towards the United States.” The US Federal Aviation Administration said it began receiving reports of drone activity near Morris County, New Jersey, on Monday. The FAA has barred drone flights over Picatinny Arsenal Military Base and Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster. Last week, the FBI and New Jersey state police asked the public to report any information related to the recent sightings of possible drones flying in several areas along the Raritan River. “Witnesses have spotted the cluster of what look to be drones and a possible fixed-wing aircraft. We have reports from the public and law enforcement dating back several weeks,” the FBI said. The Pentagon said an initial assessment had shown the drones were not from another country and that the U.S. military had not shot them down because they did not pose a threat to any military installations. “We have no evidence that these activities are coming from a foreign entity or the work of an adversary,” Singh said. “We’re going to continue to monitor what is happening. But, you know, at no point were our installations threatened when this activity was occurring.” Still, the latest drone sightings are a reminder of the growing concern about a proliferation of drone technology and the potential security considerations, given that drones can carry surveillance technology or even explosives. At a press conference, House of Representatives Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries was asked about the lack of information about the drones. “We need a greater degree of transparency from law enforcement authorities and we will make sure that happens in the days and weeks to come,” Jeffries said. On Wednesday night, the leader of the Syrian Kurdish military, Mazlum Abdi, said that they were halting “joint operations against Isis” because the US-led anti Isis coalition was preoccupied after the fall of Assad. “Isis is now stronger in the Syrian desert,” he warned and said that plans for breaking out from the camps and prisons are “always on their agenda”. Syria’s Baath party has suspended its work indefinitely following the ousting of Bashaar al-Assad, a prominent Baathist. On Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported that the Baath party’s central leadership has decided to “o “suspend party work and activity in all its forms... until further notice,” according to a statement from the website of the party’s newspaper. The statement added that the party’s properties and funds will be handed over to Syria’s interior and finance ministries. As an artist and audio investigator, Lawrence Abu Hamdan has mapped out Syria’s notorious Sednaya prison with testimonies from its survivors. Abu Hamdan reports for the Guardian: In 2016, I worked with Forensic Architecture and Amnesty International to lead the acoustic part of the investigation into Sednaya, the Assad regime’s most notorious prison. Since the uprising against the regime began in 2011 until the early hours of Sunday, the prison had been inaccessible to journalists and independent observers. The memories of the few people who have been released were the only resources available to learn about and then document the mass-murder, torture and violation that took place there. In Sednaya, prisoners’ capacity to see anything was highly restricted. From the time detainees were taken from their homes or pulled out of protests and thrown into cells, they were blindfolded. In the cells they were kept in darkness, made to cover their eyes and face the wall in the presence of the guards. Over time, they developed an acute sensitivity to sound. My task, as an artist and audio investigator, was to develop “earwitness” interviews with six survivors of Sednaya, using their sonic memories to help reveal the crimes that took place inside. For the full story, click here: It is approaching 9pm in Beirut, Tel Aviv and Gaza City, 10pm in Damascus, and 10.30pm in Tehran. Here are some of the headlines so far today: The tomb of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s father Hafez was torched in his home town of Qardaha, accoding to AFP footage taken on Wednesday. AFP said it showed rebel fighters in fatigues and young men watching it burn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor told AFP the rebels had set fire to the mausoleum, located in the Latakia heartland of Assad’s Alawite community. AFP footage showed parts of the mausoleum ablaze and damaged. Syria’s new prime minister said the alliance that ousted president Bashar al-Assad will “guarantee” the rights of all religious groups and called on the millions who fled the war to return home. Leader of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, also pledged justice for the victims of Assad’s iron-fisted rule, vowing on Wednesday that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned. Syria’s transitional authorities must strive for a more inclusive process, bringing in different parties and communities to avoid new civil strife, the UN envoy for Syria said on Wednesday. “My biggest concern is that the transition will create new contradictions in the manner that could lead to new civil strife and potentially a new civil war,” Geir Pedersen told AFP in a brief interview in Geneva. Lebanon’s health ministry said Israeli strikes killed five people in the south on Wednesday. “An Israeli enemy drone strike on the town of Ainata killed one person and wounded another,” the health ministry said. It added that an Israeli strike on the town of Bint Jbeil killed three people, while a third on Beit Lif killed one person. Israeli strikes in the northern and central Gaza Strip on Wednesday killed at least 31 Palestinians, most of them in Beit Lahia in the north, reported local medics. Health officials said an Israeli airstrike on a house in Beit Lahiya killed at least 22 people, including women and children. Earlier on Wednesday, at least seven Palestinians were killed and several others injured in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Nuseirat camp. Palestinian news agency Wafa reported on Wednesday that at least 22 people were killed overnight in the Gaza Strip by Israeli strikes. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will head to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the Department of State said. Blinken, who will visit Aqaba, Jordan and Ankara, Turkey through Friday, will also discuss regional developments including in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon, the department said in a statement. National security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is also traveling to Israel on Wednesday, the White House said. The UN general assembly will vote on Wednesday on a draft resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza, a symbolic gesture after the US vetoed a similar action in the UN security council. The draft resolution, which would be non-binding if approved, calls for both “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire,” and “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages”. The resolution also demands “immediate access” to widespread humanitarian aid for the citizens of Gaza, especially in the north. Israel must withdraw forces from the buffer zone separating the annexed Golan Heights from Syrian territory, France’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday. “Any military deployment in the separation zone between Israel and Syria is a violation of the disengagement agreement of 1974,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said. Humanitarian aid to northern Gaza has largely been blocked for the past 66 days, the UN has said. That has left between 65,000 and 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care, according to the world body. Damascus airport, closed since rebel forces overran the Syrian capital at the weekend, is to reopen “in the next few days”, its director Anis Fallouh told AFP on Wednesday. “God willing, the airport will reopen as quickly as possible because we are going to work flat out,” Fallouh said. Pushed to give a timeframe for the reopening, he said it ought to happen “in the next few days”. There is a chance now for a deal to release all the hostages held in Gaza, including US citizens, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday, Katz’s office said in a statement. Katz, rebuffed on Wednesday Iranian accusation of a US-Israeli “plot” to oust Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, saying Tehran has itself to blame for the fall of its ally. Katz, on a tour of the Jordanian border with military commanders, accused Iran of trying to establish an “eastern front” against Israel in the neighbouring kingdom, and vowed to prevent it. Earlier on Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Assad’s ousting this week by Islamist-led rebels “is the product of a joint US-Israeli plot”, also blaming another unnamed “neighbouring state of Syria”. Germany’s foreign minister on Wednesday urged Israel and Turkey not to jeopardise a peaceful transition in Syria. “We must not allow the internal Syrian dialogue process to be torpedoed from the outside,” Annalena Baerbock told a Berlin press conference. “We must now seek to promote positive developments in Syria and prevent negative influences,” she said. The Kremlin on Wednesday played down the damage to Russian influence in the Middle East from the fall of Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad, saying that its focus was on Ukraine and that Moscow was in contact with Syria’s new rulers. “You know, of course, that we are in contact with those who are currently in control of the situation in Syria,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. UN secretary-general António Guterres said on Wednesday during a visit to South Africa that there were some signs of hope from the end of the Syrian dictatorship. He was quoted as saying: “I fully trust Syrian people to be able to choose their own destiny.” Qatar will soon reopen its embassy in Damascus, Syria. Foreign ministry spokesperson, Majed al-Ansari, said in a statement: “[Qatar] will soon reopen its embassy in the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic after completing the necessary arrangements.” Russia told its citizens in Syria to take maximum precautions and avoid crowded places. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova issued the warning, and said her country’s embassy was operating in Syria “under conditions of extremely high security threats”. Greece on Wednesday suspended all decisions on asylum applications by Syrians after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the government announced. “We are temporarily freezing … all procedures (for Syrians) until we have evaluated the new data,” migration minister, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, told Real FM radio. The announcement came as Save the Children and the Greek Council for Refugees urged the government to take immediate steps to improve living conditions in remote migrant reception camps. Pope Francis on Wednesday called on Syria’s new leadership to stabilise the country, and govern in a way that promotes national unity. In his first public remarks about Syria since the ending of Assad’s rule, the pope called on the country’s diverse religious groups to “walk together in friendship and mutual respect for the good of the nation”. In her House of Commons statement on immigration today, Yvette Cooper, the UK home secretary, said the government would be monitoring the situation in Syria before deciding whether or not to lift the pause on asylum applications from Syrians. She said the government needed to “monitor the evolving situation”, later adding: “There’s a lot we simply do not know about how events are going to play out in Syria.” Ireland has added itself to the list of European countries to suspend the processing of asylum applications by refugees from Syria. The Irish minister for justice told Reuters on Wednesday that the international protection office would temporarily pause the issuing of final determinations while the situation in Syria was kept under review. Paraguay’s president Santiago Peña visited Jerusalem on Wednesday where he met his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog. Peña was inaugurating a new embassy situated in Jerusalem. Syria’s transitional authorities must strive for a more inclusive process, bringing in different parties and communities to avoid new civil strife, the UN envoy for Syria said on Wednesday. “My biggest concern is that the transition will create new contradictions in the manner that could lead to new civil strife and potentially a new civil war,” Geir Pedersen told AFP in a brief interview in Geneva. Longtime Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fled Syria on Sunday after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel group and its allies. Mohammad al-Bashir, whom the rebels appointed as the transitional head of government, has sought to allay fears over how Syria would be ruled and how minorities would be treated. “Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all sects in Syria,” he told Italian daily Corriere della Sera. Pedersen told AFP that Bashir’s appointment had “created some negative reactions among Syrians, because they were afraid that this was a way for one group to monopolise power”. “I think it’s extremely important that the new authorities in Damascus make clear what they want to achieve during these three months,” he said. The initial signals, Pedersen said, indicated the transitional authorities “understood that they need to prepare for a more inclusive process”, bringing onboard different parties, sectors of society and armed factions, as well as women. He said he hoped the need for inclusiveness was understood. “If not, it will not only create nervousness inside of Syria, with the potential for new civil strife, even civil war, but it will also create negative reactions from neighbouring countries,” Pedersen warned. He told AFP: There is so much at stake that it is extremely important that messages coming out from the armed group in Damascus … (are) reassuring to all communities in Syria and also to the international community.” Pedersen also stressed that it was “important that no international actor is doing anything that could derail the very complicated transitional process”. Since Assad’s ouster, Israel, which borders Syria, has sent troops into a buffer zone on the east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights, in a move the UN has said violates the 1974 armistice. “This is obviously a violation of the agreement from the 1974 and it’s also a violation, it goes without saying, of Syria sovereignty and territorial integrity and unity,” Pedersen said. The Israeli military has also said it has conducted hundreds of strikes against Syrian military assets in the past two days, targeting everything from chemical weapons stores to air defences to keep them out of rebel hands. Pedersen said he had spoken with Syrian ambassadors, whom the transitional authorities asked to remain in their posts, about Israel’s chemical weapons fears. “They are emphasising very strongly that they are respecting the agreements that were put in place and they are not going to play with this,” he said. Lebanon’s health ministry said Israeli strikes killed five people in the south on Wednesday, amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah after two months of all-out war, reports AFP. The Lebanese army said it deployed troops around Khiam, a key town just 5km (three miles) from the border that saw heavy fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. “An Israeli enemy drone strike on the town of Ainata killed one person and wounded another,” the health ministry said. An “Israeli strike on the town of Bint Jbeil killed three people,” while a third “on Beit Lif killed one person”, reports AFP. A ceasefire came into effect on 27 November. Both sides have accused the other of repeated violations. Under the terms of the agreement, the Lebanese army is to deploy in the south alongside UN peacekeepers as the Israeli army withdraws over a period of 60 days. Hezbollah is required to withdraw its forces north of the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) from the border, and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. The Lebanese army said “units deployed in five positions around the town of Khiam” in coordination with UN peacekeepers and “within the framework of the first phase of deployment in the area, at the same time as the Israeli enemy withdrawal”. “The deployment will be completed in the next phase, while specialised units” will survey the town to “remove unexploded ordnance”, it added. The UN general assembly will vote on Wednesday on a draft resolution calling for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire in Gaza, a symbolic gesture after the US vetoed a similar action in the UN security council, reports AFP. Late last month, Washington used its veto power on the council – as it has before – to protect its ally Israel, which has been at war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian militant group’s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel. The US blocked the council’s attempt to call for a ceasefire, saying a link between a ceasefire and a release of all hostages had to be maintained. This time in the assembly, the draft resolution, which would be non-binding if approved, calls for both “an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire,” and “the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages”, reports AFP. The resolution also demands “immediate access” to widespread humanitarian aid for the citizens of Gaza, especially in the besieged north of the territory. During the debate before the vote, which is due to take place at about 3pm (8pm GMT), those who spoke largely backed the draft. “Gaza doesn’t exist any more. It is destroyed,” Slovenia’s UN envoy, Samuel Žbogar, told the assembly. “History is the harshest critic of inaction.” That criticism was echoed by Algeria’s deputy UN ambassador, Nacim Gaouaoui, who said: The price of silence and failure in the face of the Palestinian tragedy is a very heavy price, and it will be heavier tomorrow.” Damascus airport, closed since rebel forces overran the Syrian capital at the weekend, is to reopen “in the next few days”, its director Anis Fallouh told AFP on Wednesday. “God willing, the airport will reopen as quickly as possible because we are going to work flat out,” Fallouh said. Pushed to give a timeframe for the reopening, he said it ought to happen “in the next few days”. “We can quickly let aircraft resume flights through Syrian airspace, which has been closed,” he added. An AFP correspondent saw armed rebel fighters deployed around the airport. Aircraft maintenance official, Samer Radi, said there were currently 12 aircraft on the ground, one of which had been stripped of its equipment by unknown looters during the rebel takeover. There is a chance now for a deal to release all the hostages held in Gaza, including US citizens, Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, told his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in a phone call on Wednesday, Katz’s office said in a statement. “Minister Katz updated secretary of defence Austin on the negotiations for the release of the hostages, and said that there is now a chance for a new deal that will allow the return of all the hostages, including those with American citizenship,” Katz’s office said in a statement, reports Reuters. This combination of pictures created today shows (on the right) rebel fighters standing next to the burning gravesite of Syria’s late president Hafez al-Assad at his mausoleum in the family’s ancestral village of Qardaha in the western Latakia province, after it was stormed by opposition factions. The picture on the left, released by the official Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA) on 10 June 2001, shows a Palestinian delegation visiting the same tomb during a ceremony marking the first anniversary of Hafez al-Assad’s death. Greece on Wednesday suspended all decisions on asylum applications by Syrians after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the government announced, as NGOs criticised conditions in reception camps for migrants, reports AFP. “We are temporarily freezing … all procedures (for Syrians) until we have evaluated the new data,” migration minister, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, told Real FM radio. Greece, the entry point for many of the hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees in Europe, is the latest to suspend asylum decisions after Assad’s ouster. The announcement came as Save the Children and the Greek Council for Refugees urged the government to take immediate steps to improve living conditions in remote migrant reception camps, according to AFP. Migrant and refugee arrivals to Greece rose to a five-year high in 2024, with more than 57,300 people entering the country in the first 11 months of the year, the charities said, quoting UN refugee agency (UNHCR) data. Of those, more than 13,000 were children who arrived by sea – up about 50% on 2023, they added. The NGOs said children and their families should be moved to reception centres in towns and cities from the moment they arrive and seek asylum because of conditions in the camps. Children in the camps have reported “alarming” conditions, including poor-quality and out-of-date food. There has also been a lack of child-protection measures and access to schooling or mental health support, as well as violence, reports AFP. One 13-year-old boy from the Democratic Republic of Congo said he found life in one camp about 70km (45 miles) from Athens “dangerous and isolating”. He also claimed frequent discrimination, according to AFP. Save the Children Europe’s director and EU representative, Willy Bergogne, said: The EU and Greek authorities have a moral and legal obligation to act urgently to improve the conditions in the camps and protect these children and ensure they have access to safety, adequate services, and dignity.” The director of the Greek Council for Refugees, Lefteris Papagiannakis, said the situation at the reception camps was longstanding. He added: But what is surprising is that, after almost 10 years of enhanced experience in managing the reception of asylum seekers in Greece, we’re witnessing an ongoing downgrading in essential service provision, including services for children.” Syria’s new prime minister said the alliance that ousted president Bashar al-Assad will “guarantee” the rights of all religious groups and called on the millions who fled the war to return home, reports AFP. Assad fled Syria after a lightning offensive spearheaded by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group and its allies. With Assad’s overthrow plunging Syria into the unknown, its new rulers have sought to assure members of the country’s religious minorities that they will not repress them, reports AFP. They have also pledged justice for the victims of Assad’s iron-fisted rule, with HTS leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, vowing on Wednesday that officials involved in torturing detainees will not be pardoned. In her House of Commons statement on immigration today, Yvette Cooper, the UK home secretary, said the government would be monitoring the situation in Syria before deciding whether or not to lift the pause on asylum applications from Syrians. She told MPs: Let’s be clear, most of the claims, many of the claims that have been made, have been made against the Assad regime for asylum, which is clearly not in place. It would therefore not be appropriate to be granting asylum decisions on those cases in the current circumstances. We do need to monitor the evolving situation so that we can get new country guidance in place and so that we can take those decisions, but we will do that in a sensible and serious way, which is about getting the asylum and the immigration systems back in control.” And in a later answer she said: There’s a lot we simply do not know about how events are going to play out in Syria. Those who have taken over and who are involved in the initial overthrow of the Assad regime have said, initially, that they would pursue an approach which supported minorities, for example, within Syria, but of course we have seen further developments in recent days that raise questions about that and we’ve also just seen the huge instability with different organisations and groups operating across the country. That is why we need to monitor this closely, I think everybody wants to see greater stability. We’ve also seen the initial signs of people wanting to return from Turkey to Syria, for example, in the first few days. But this is very unstable at the moment and that is why we need to approach this with care and monitoring the detail of what is happening.” Israel’s defence minister, Israel Katz, rebuffed on Wednesday Iranian accusation of a US-Israeli “plot” to oust Syria’s Bashar al-Assad, saying Tehran has itself to blame for the fall of its ally. Katz, on a tour of the Jordanian border with military commanders, accused Iran of trying to establish an “eastern front” against Israel in the neighbouring kingdom, and vowed to prevent it, reports AFP. Earlier on Wednesday, Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Assad’s ousting this week by Islamist-led rebels “is the product of a joint US-Israeli plot”, also blaming another unnamed “neighbouring state of Syria”. Katz, according to a statement from his office, said that Khamenei “should blame himself” and stop financing armed groups “in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza to build the octopus arms he leads in an attempt to defeat the State of Israel”. “I came here today to ensure that Iran will not succeed in building the octopus arm that it is planning and working to establish here, in order to create an eastern front against the State of Israel”, he said. According to AFP, Katz suggested Iran was behind “attempts to smuggle weapons” into the Israeli-occupied West Bank, which borders Jordan, as well as to “fund terrorism and promote” it. The defence minister said he had instructed the army “to increase offensive operations against any terrorist activity” in the West Bank, and to “accelerate the construction of the fence on the Israel-Jordan border”. Israel must withdraw forces from the buffer zone separating the annexed Golan Heights from Syrian territory, France’s foreign ministry said on Wednesday, according to AFP. “Any military deployment in the separation zone between Israel and Syria is a violation of the disengagement agreement of 1974,” a foreign ministry spokesperson said. Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, announced on Sunday he had ordered the army to “seize” the demilitarised zone in the Syrian-controlled part of the Golan Heights after rebels swept Syrian president Bashar al-Assad from power. “France calls on Israel to withdraw from the zone and to respect Syria’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the foreign ministry spokesperson said, reports AFP. The area is patrolled by a UN peacekeeping force known as UNDOF, with the global body warning Israel on Monday that it is in breach of the 50-year-old deal that ended a 1973 war with Syria. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a UN official in New York told AFP that Israeli forces had occupied seven positions in the buffer zone. France’s intervention follows condemnations from Saudi Arabia, Iran, Russia and Turkey, as well as a US call for the Israeli incursion to be “temporary”. Reuters is now carrying fuller quotes from UN secretary-general António Guterres, who commented on the situation in Syria while on a visit to South Africe. He said: As we speak, we are witnessing the reshaping of the Middle East. We also see some signs of hope, and signs of hope namely coming from the end of the Syrian dictatorship. It’s our duty to do everything to support different Syrian leaders in order to make sure that they come together, they are able to guarantee a smooth transition, an inclusive transition in which all Syrians can feel that they belong. The alternative doesn’t make any sense. Here are some of the latest images sent to us from the region. The National News Agency in Lebanon reports that one person has been killed by a “raid carried out by an Israeli enemy drone targeting a van with a guided missile on the road between the towns of Beit Lif and Sarbin” in the Bint Jbeil district of southern Lebanon. Ireland has added itself to the list of European countries to suspend the processing of asylum applications by refugees from Syria. The Irish minister for justice told Reuters on Wednesday that the international protection office would temporarily pause the issuing of final determinations while the situation in Syria was kept under review. Austria, Belgium, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK have all announced similar moves. UN secretary-general António Guterres said on Wednesday during a visit to South Africa that there were some signs of hope from the end of the Syrian dictatorship, Reuters reports. It quotes him saying “I fully trust Syrian people to be able to choose their own destiny.” Germany’s foreign minister on Wednesday urged Israel and Turkey not to jeopardise a peaceful transition in Syria after the ousting of president Bashar al-Assad. “We must not allow the internal Syrian dialogue process to be torpedoed from the outside,” Annalena Baerbock told a Berlin press conference, reports AFP. Baerbock said: Neighbours such as the Turkish and Israeli governments, which are asserting their security interests, must not jeopardise the process.” Since Assad’s downfall, Israel has launched strikes on military sites in Syria ranging from weapons depots to naval vessels, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor. Israel has also sent troops into a UN-patrolled buffer zone east of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Turkey meanwhile is worried Kurdish separatists could take advantage of Assad’s ouster to extend their influence in Syria, where they have dominated a large north-eastern area since 2012. Ankara sees the Kurdish forces, notably the militant group YPG, as an extension of the banned Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), which has fought a bloody insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s. Since Assad fled, Turkish-backed groups have launched offensives in northern Syria. According to AFP, the Kurdish-led force in the north-east of the country said on Wednesday it had reached a US-brokered ceasefire with the Turkish-backed fighters in Manbij, an Arab-majority city that has seen fierce clashes. Baerbock said Syria’s “new chapter” was still being written, adding that “the outcome of the revolution is not certain, nor have the people won the transition to a free and peaceful Syria”. “We must now seek to promote positive developments in Syria and prevent negative influences,” she said. “In very specific terms, this means that a Syrian-led dialogue process is needed, which we as Europeans and as Germans will support.” “Syria must not be allowed to become a pawn in the hands of foreign powers or forces again,” she added. Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, better known Abu Mohammed al-Golani, said on Wednesday that all who were involved in torturing and killing detainees in Syrian prisons would not be pardoned, reports Reuters. “We will pursue them in Syria, and we ask countries to hand over those who fled so we can achieve justice,” Golani said in a statement published on the Syrian state TV’s Telegram channel. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, will head to Jordan and Turkey on Wednesday for talks on Syria, the Department of State said, reports Reuters. Blinken, who will visit Aqaba, Jordan and Ankara, Turkey through Friday, will also discuss regional developments including in Israel, Gaza and Lebanon, the department said in a statement. National security adviser, Jake Sullivan, is also traveling to Israel on Wednesday, the White House said. AFP have a little more detail on the story of the tomb of Bashar al-Assad’s father being set on fire in Syria (see 12.45pm GMT). AFP reports that its footage showed the tomb of Hafez torched and destroyed. The vast elevated structure atop a hill has an intricate architectural design with several arches, its exterior embellished with ornamentation etched in stone. It also houses the tombs of other Assad family members, including Bashar’s brother Bassel, who was killed in a road accident in 1994. European foreign ministers will discuss developments in Syria when they meet in Berlin on Thursday, as well as support for Ukraine, according to a spokesperson for the German foreign ministry, reports Reuters. “Given the dramatic events in Syria over the last few days, it will come as no surprise to you that there is also a second important topic, namely the current developments in Syria and their impact on the region and Europe,” the spokesperson told reporters on Wednesday. German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, will host her counterparts from France, Poland, Spain, Italy, the UK and Ukraine for talks at a villa in the German capital on Thursday. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has blamed Israel and the US for the fall of the Assad regime in Syria, after rebels overran the capital, Damascus, and the ousted leader fled into exile. Khamenei added that the pressure being placed on the Iran-led “Axis of Resistance” would make it stronger and would eventually “encompass the entire region more than ever before”. Here is a video of Khamenei’s comments: Developments in Syria demonstrate that countries with a strategic partnership with Russia can rely on Moscow only as long as they are of use to president Vladimir Putin, German defence minister, Boris Pistorius, said on Wednesday. During a short visit to Jordan, Pistorius made a stop-over at the al-Azraq airbase on his way to Baghdad where he will discuss ways to help stabilise the region in the light of the fall of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. The minister did not specify what the developments will mean for Germany’s involvement in the region but said that its military missions in the Middle East, which include 600 troops, would rather be ramped up than reduced, reports Reuters. As part of a US-led coalition of 70 countries, Germany has had troops in Iraq since 2015 to assist local forces trying to prevent a resurgence of Islamic State which in 2014 seized large swaths of Iraq and Syria but was later pushed back. The Jordanian base al-Azraq is used as logistics hub for the mission, and the German air force is launching air-to-air refueling missions from there. The tomb of ousted Syrian president Bashar al-Assad’s father Hafez was torched in his home town of Qardaha, accoding to AFP footage taken on Wednesday. AFP said it showed rebel fighters in fatigues and young men watching it burn. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor told AFP the rebels had set fire to the mausoleum, located in the Latakia heartland of Assad’s Alawite community. AFP footage showed parts of the mausoleum ablaze and damaged. Greece on Wednesday suspended all decisions on asylum applications by Syrians after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, the migration minister announced. Greece, the entry point for many of the hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Europe, is the latest European country to take the action, reports AFP. “We are temporarily freezing … all procedures (for Syrians) until we have evaluated the new data,” migration minister, Nikos Panagiotopoulos, told Real FM radio. The tomb of Bashar al-Assad’s father has been set on fire in Syria, according to a breaking news line from AFP. More details soon … The Kremlin on Wednesday played down the damage to Russian influence in the Middle East from the fall of Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad, saying that its focus was on Ukraine and that Moscow was in contact with Syria’s new rulers, reports AFP. “You know, of course, that we are in contact with those who are currently in control of the situation in Syria,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Asked how much the fall of Assad had weakened Russia’s influence in the Middle East, Peskov said that Moscow maintained contacts with all countries in the region and would continue to do so. Moscow’s priority, Peskov said, was the war in Ukraine. On the topic of Syria, the Kremlin said its focus now was to ensure the security of its military bases in the country and of its diplomatic missions. Russia, the Kremlin said, had helped Assad during the civil war but the situation had then deteriorated. “Russia helped the Syrian Arab Republic at one time to cope with the terrorists and to stabilise the situation after this situation threatened the entire region, and spent a lot of effort for this,” Peskov said. He added: Russia fulfilled its mission, and then the Assad leadership worked in their country, engaged in the development of their country. But unfortunately, the development has led to the situation that is now. And now we need to proceed from the realities that exist on the ground.” Agence France-Presse (AFP) have some more detail on the news that Qatar will soon reopen its embassy in Damascus, Syria. Qatar “will soon reopen its embassy in the sisterly Syrian Arab Republic after completing the necessary arrangements”, foreign ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said in a statement, reports AFP. The move aimed to “strengthen the close historical fraternal ties between the two countries”, said the statement. It also sought to “enhance coordination with relevant authorities to facilitate the flow of humanitarian aid currently provided by Qatar to the Syrian people” via an air bridge, it added. Doha closed its diplomatic mission in Damascus and recalled its ambassador in July 2011 after an uprising against the Assad government turned into a civil war. Italy’s Corriere della Sera is carrying an interview with Mohammed al-Bashir, Syria’s transitional prime minister. In it he says the top three priorities of the government are “to restore security and stability in all Syrian cities”, “to bring back the millions of Syrian refugees who are scattered around the world” and “strategic planning” to end the “precariousness of essential services like electricity, food, and water.” He tells reporter Andrea Nicastro that “People are exhausted by injustice and tyranny. The authority of the state must be reestablished to allow people to return to work and resume their normal lives.” He also warns that the financial situation of the state is dire, saying “In the vaults, there are only Syrian pounds, which are worth next to nothing. Financially, we are in a very bad state.” Asked about his militant group’s jihadist past, Bashir told the newspaper: The wrongful actions of certain Islamist groups have led many people, especially in the west, to associate Muslims with terrorism and Islam with extremism. There were mistakes and misunderstandings that distorted the true meaning of Islam, which is ‘the religion of justice.’ Precisely because we are Islamic, we will guarantee the rights of all people and all communities in Syria. He said the transitional government was open to dialogue with any foreign state “that has distanced itself from Assad’s bloodthirsty regime.” There is a full English translation of the interview on the Corriere Della Sera website here. Russia has told its citizens in Syria to take maximum precautions and avoid crowded places. In a press briefing, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova issued the warning, and said her country’s embassy was operating in Syria “under conditions of extremely high security threats.” Tass reports she called on the international community to refrain from what she described as provocative rhetoric that can negatively affect the situation in Syria, and said “We call on all parties involved to take a responsible approach and contribute to the speedy restoration of security and stability in the country.” Reuters reports, citing the RIA news agency, that deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov warned on Wednesday that there was a risk that Islamic State could become resurgent in Syria. Earlier today the Kremlin criticised Israeli actions in the region, with spokesperson Dmitry Peskov saying Israel’s actions in the occupied Golan Heights and the buffer zone are unlikely to contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in Syria. During his regular press briefing he told journalists that Russia had achieved its aims when it intervened in the Syrian civil war on behalf of the deposed Assad regime. Russia helped the Syrian Arab Republic to deal with terrorists at one time and helped to stabilise the situation after this situation threatened the entire region. And it spent a lot of effort for this. Then Russia fulfilled its mission. And then the leadership of Assad worked in their country, was engaged in development in their country, but, unfortunately, [it] led to the situation that exists now. Now we need to proceed from the realities that currently exist on the ground. Paraguay’s president Santiago Peña is visiting Jerusalem today. He met with his Israeli counterpart Isaac Herzog, who said: It means a lot to the people of Israel, the fact that you’re coming here after a year when the Israeli public, the Israeli people, the Israeli nation has gone through a most challenging time, painful, agonising. While he is in Israel, Peña is inaugurating a new embassy, situated in Jerusalem. Herzog said: We are very excited that you will inaugurate the Paraguayan embassy in Jerusalem, our holy city, united city, the eternal capital of the state of Israel and the Jewish people. Here are some of the latest images sent to us over the news wires from the region. Qatar’s foreign ministry has said it will shortly reopen its embassy in Syria. Russia has said the security of its bases in Syria is of paramount importance, and criticised Israeli actions in the region. Tass reports Dmitry Peskov, during his regular daily media briefing, said “We, of course, are closely monitoring everything that is happening in Syria, and we maintain contacts with those who are currently controlling the situation. This is necessary because our bases are there, our diplomatic missions are there.” Peskov declined to say how many Russian troops were in Syria, insisting that was a matter for Russia’s ministry of defence. He also declined to say how relations with the rebel leadership in Syria were developing, telling journalists “too little time has passed so far … therefore, I cannot say anything in more detail.” Russia has a major air base in Latakia province and a naval facility at Tartous, which Reuters reports is Russia’s only Mediterranean repair and replenishment hub. The Kremlin spokesperson said Israel’s actions in the occupied Golan Heights and the buffer zone are unlikely to contribute to the stabilisation of the situation in Syria. Israel has launched a ground invasion into the UN-patrolled buffer zone that separates Syria from the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, territory that Israel seized from Syria in 1967 and unilaterally annexed in 1981. Pope Francis on Wednesday called on Syria’s new leadership to stabilise the country, and govern in a way that promotes national unity. In his first public remarks about Syria since the ending of Bashar al-Assad’s rule, Reuters reports the pope called on the country’s diverse religious groups to “walk together in friendship and mutual respect for the good of the nation”. He said: I hope they find political solutions that, without other conflicts or divisions, responsibly promote the stability and unity of the country “Relentless” Israeli airstrikes on Syria are hampering attempts to carry out a smooth transition of power from the collapsed Bashar al-Assad regime, Al Jazeera reports. Writing from Damascus, Resul Serdar Atas says: Israel is destroying strategic military infrastructure of Syria. By doing so, they are making sure Syria’s new administration does not have the capability of defending itself. Israel is reducing Syria into Lebanon, into Gaza. That is a huge challenge to the new administration which is trying to preserve the state apparatus … making sure that there is a smooth political transition. The relentless Israeli air strikes across the country and, in particular, in the capital, Damascus, are definitely disrupting this process. Israeli strikes in the northern and central Gaza Strip on Wednesday killed at least 31 Palestinians, most of them in Beit Lahia in the north, Reuters reports, citing local medics. Health officials said an Israeli airstrike on a house in Beit Lahiya killed at least 22 people, including women and children. Palestinian news agency WAFA said at least 30 people were living in the multi-storey building before it was struck, adding that several members of the family remained missing as rescue operations continued. Earlier on Wednesday, at least seven Palestinians were killed and several others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a house in the Nuseirat camp Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that Israeli security forces have detained three men in Qalqilya in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Israel’s military has reported that four rockets were fired towards Israel from inside the Gaza Strip in the early hours of the morning. In a statement on its official Telegram channel, the IDF said the rockets were intercepted and there were no reports of casualties. The IRNA news agency is carrying further quotes from Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei talking about Syria and conflict in the region. It quotes him saying: You must understand that the more pressure you put on the resistance front [to Israel], the stronger it becomes. The more crimes you commit, the more motivated it becomes. The more you fight it, the more it will expand. By the grace of God, the resistance will expand more than before to cover the entire region. Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said that the US and Israel were behind the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, and also appeared to point a finger of blame in the direction of Turkey. In comments reported by Iran’s Tasnim news agency, Khamenei is quoted as saying: There should be no doubt that what happened in Syria is the product of a joint American and Zionist plan. Yes, a neighboring government of Syria plays, has played, and is playing an obvious role in this regard - everyone sees this - but the main conspirator, mastermind, and command centre are in America and the Zionist regime. We have evidence. This evidence leaves no room for doubt. Outgoing US secretary of state Antony Blinken is set to visit Ankara to meet Turkish foreign minister Hakan Fidan on Friday, a Turkish official said on Wednesday. Reuters reports the two are expected to discuss the situation in Syria. Florida’s Sen Marco Rubio is expected to take up the role of US secretary of state when the second Donald Trump administration takes power in the US in January. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is giving a speech this morning. It is the first time Iran’s supreme leader will have addressed in public the fall of Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, of which it was a staunch ally. He has started by claiming that what happened in Syria was a result of US and Israeli plans, and that a neighbouring country was involved in the fall of Assad. We will bring you any key lines that emerge. The UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has laid out some of the healthcare challenges in the Gaza Strip due to Israeli military action in its latest update. It wrote: Ongoing hostilities and attacks in North Gaza, particularly those that have directly affected Kamal Adwan hospital, have seriously jeopardidsed the access of trauma patients to health services. A lack of non-communicable disease (NCD) medications and laboratory reagents threatens to further disrupt healthcare provision for patients with NCDs. There is a critical shortage of spare parts and generator oil needed for the maintenance of generators at all health facilities across the Gaza Strip. The limited number of functional crossing points and access impediments to collect supplies from them continue to cause shortages in medicines and medical supplies across the Gaza Strip. Palestinian news agency Wafa reports that at least 22 people have been killed overnight in the Gaza Strip by Israeli strikes. The Associated Press has filed a report on Suheil Hamwi, who spent 32 years in a Syrian prison, and how, after the lightning offensive by insurgents that toppled the government of Bashar al-Assad, he has finally returned to his home in Lebanon. In 1992, Hamwi worked as a merchant, selling various goods in the town of Chekka in northern Lebanon. On the night of Eid il-Burbara, or Saint Barbara’s Day – a holiday similar to Halloween – a man came to his door to buy some whiskey. Hamwi said he handed his 10-month-old son, George, to his wife and went to his car to fetch the whiskey and make the sale. As Hamwi approached his vehicle, a car filled with men pulled up, he said, forcing him inside and taking him away. It would be years before his family heard from him again. Hamwi was one of hundreds of Lebanese citizens detained during Syria’s occupation of Lebanon from 1976 to 2005 and believed to be held in Syrian prisons for decades. On Sunday, freedom came to him and others unexpectedly – prisoners who’d heard rumors about Syria’s opposition forces and their sweeping campaign found that guards had abandoned their posts. Hamwi and other prisoners left, he said, and he would soon be among the first from Lebanon to reenter the country. “I’m still scared this might not be real,” he told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday from his home – the same one he left more than three decades ago. This new reality feels fragile, but, he said, “I found my freedom.” Kate Connolly reports from Berlin Reem Alali is still reeling from the news that the brutal regime she fled eight years ago has collapsed, leaving her and her family with feelings bordering excitement and trepidation. Moreover, there is a sense that important decisions have to be made – but perhaps not just yet, and only with great caution. “We didn’t sleep for two nights,” she said on Monday, a day after Bashar al-Assad, the former dictator, fled Syria following rebels’ lightning-speed advance into the capital, Damascus. “We have been glued to our phones, speaking to Syrian friends and relatives, crying and drinking glühwein with our German friends.” Alali and her husband, Amin, have been “constantly talking to each other about the one big question: do we go back or not?”, she said. The 38-year-old from Suwayda, south-western Syria, lost her father, uncle and two cousins in the war and then sought refuge in Germany in 2016. After the astonishing events of the past few days, she has come to a conclusion: “I will not take my children to Syria until I really know the situation is a lot better.” That caution was echoed by the UN special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, who told reporters on Tuesday that while many Syrians were eager to return, prudence was essential: “There are livelihood challenges still. The humanitarian situation is disastrous. The economy has collapsed.” Amin, 40, a journalist in Syria who now works as a company technician, arrived in Germany in 2015, one of the large number of Syrians who were given sanctuary under Angela Merkel’s decision to keep the country’s borders open to them. His perilous journey was by car via Turkey, boat to Greece, and a month-long trek by foot from Greece to Germany. He and Alali are among the estimated 975,000 Syrian nationals living in Germany, according to the country’s central register of foreigners. In the first 11 months of this year, more than 72,000 people from Syria applied for asylum. Many of the refugees who came in 2015 now have German citizenship, while hundreds of thousands have a temporary residence permit. Humanitarian aid to northern Gaza, where Israel launched a ground offensive on 6 October, has largely been blocked for the past 66 days, the UN has said. That has left between 65,000 and 75,000 Palestinians without access to food, water, electricity or health care, according to the world body. In the north, Israel has continued its siege on Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabaliya with Palestinians living there largely denied aid, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, known as Ocha, said. Recently, it said, about 5,500 people were forcibly displaced from three schools in Beit Lahiya to Gaza City, the Associated Press reports. Adding to the food crisis, only four UN-supported bakeries are now operating throughout the Gaza Strip, all of them in Gaza City, Ocha said. Sigrid Kaag, the senior UN humanitarian and reconstruction coordinator for Gaza, told reporters after briefing the UN security council behind closed doors Tuesday afternoon that civilians trying to survive in Gaza face an “utterly devastating situation.” Kaag said she and other UN officials keep repeatedly asking Israel for access for convoys to north Gaza and elsewhere, to allow in commercial goods, to reopen the Rafah crossing from Egypt in the south, and to approve dual-use items. Israel’s UN mission said it had no comment on Kaag’s remarks. Jason Burke reports from Deir Istiya The olive trees cover the dry, rocky slopes around Deir Istiya, spreading deep into the valley to its west, lining the main roads, filling the gardens, and shading its graveyards. But many farmers in the historical Palestinian town, deep in the occupied West Bank, say that this year they have been unable to harvest much of the vital olive crop, blaming an intensifying campaign of intimidation and violence by people from the half-dozen Israeli settlements and outposts nearby. Ibrahim Abu Hijleh, 30, a farmer whose small olive grove is 200 metres from Revava, a settlement built in the 1990s, said he was able to reach his olive grove only for a few hours in November when accompanied by Israeli activists and a Palestinian Israeli member of parliament. “I got about 10% of the harvest and now we need to trim and tend the trees,” he said. “I keep trying to go back but people come from the settlement and tell us to leave and threaten us.” Last month the UN said Israeli settler attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank that resulted in casualties or property damage had at least tripled during the 2024 olive harvest season compared with each of the preceding three years. Between 1 October and 25 November, the UN documented 250 settler-related incidents across 88 West Bank communities, with 57 Palestinians injured by settlers and 11 by Israeli forces. More than 2,800 trees –mostly slow-growing olive trees – were burned, sawed-off, or vandalised, and there was significant theft of crops and harvesting tools, it said. In October, in the most high-profile attack, a 59-year-old woman was killed while harvesting olives in Faqqua, near Jenin, by a soldier who fired about 10 shots at her. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have said they are investigating. Olives are the largest single agricultural product in the West Bank, and up to a third of the Palestinian population of the West Bank is estimated to work with the trees or their produce, such as oil and soap. Syria’s new interim leader said it was time for “stability and calm” in the country as he announced he was taking charge of the country as caretaker prime minister with the backing of the former rebels who toppled President Bashar al-Assad three days ago. In a brief address on state television on Tuesday, Mohammed al-Bashir, a figure little-known across most of Syria who previously ran an administration in a pocket of the north-west controlled by rebels before the lightning offensive that swept into Damascus, said he would lead the interim authority until 1 March. “Today we held a cabinet meeting that included a team from the salvation government that was working in Idlib and its vicinity, and the government of the ousted regime,” he said. Behind him were two flags – the green, black and white flag flown by opponents of Assad throughout the civil war, and a white flag with the Islamic oath of faith in black writing, typically flown in Syria by Sunni Islamist fighters. In the Syrian capital, banks reopened for the first time since Assad’s overthrow, Reuters reported. Shops also opened again, traffic returned to the roads, cleaners were out sweeping the streets and there were fewer armed men about. “Now it is time for this people to enjoy stability and calm,” Bashir told Al Jazeera. In other developments: Israel says it has carried out more than 480 airstrikes targeting weapons stockpiles and strategic infrastructure in Syria over the past 48 hours. The IDF said the air force conducted the crewed aircraft missile strikes on Syrian military targets including weapons production sites in the cities of Damascus, Homs, Tartus, Latakia and Palmyra. It said 130 strikes were “during ground operations” and aimed at weapons depots, military structures, launchers and firing positions. The world “has nothing to fear” from the new Syrian regime, the leader of rebel group Hayat Tahrir al Sham (HTS) has told Sky News in what the network says are his first comments to a western media outlet since his organization toppled Bashar al-Assad on Sunday. Ahmed al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, attempted to reassure foreign nations in his remarks and promised Syria “will be rebuilt”. Russian deputy foreign minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow is “providing sanctuary” for deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, having transported him to Moscow on Sunday “in the most secure way possible”. “He is secured, and it shows that Russia acts as required in such an extraordinary situation,” he told NBC News. The insurgent group that overthrew Bashar al-Assad’s government in Syria claims to have wrested control of the eastern city of Deir el-Zour after intense battles with the Kurdish-led, US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), AP reported. A member of the Islamic group Hayat al-Tahrir Sham (HTS) said in a recorded video that the group would sweep neighbourhoods to secure the city. The nearby city of Boukamal had also fallen to HTS, the person said, adding that Raqqa and Hasakah were subsequent targets. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 218 people were killed in three days of fighting between Turkish-backed forces and the SDF in Manbij, north-east of Damascus. Early on Wednesday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said the SDF and the Turkey-backed rebels had reached a ceasefire agreement in Manbij through US mediation. Outgoing US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has called for an “inclusive” political process in Syria, saying the US would eventually recognise a new government if it renounces terrorism, destroys chemical weapons stocks and protects the rights of minorities and women. “The Syrian people will decide the future of Syria. All nations should pledge to support an inclusive and transparent process and refrain from external interference,” Blinken said in a statement. The UN would consider taking the Syrian rebel group that toppled the regime of Bashar al-Assad off its designated terrorist list if it passes the key test of forming a truly inclusive transitional government, according to a senior official at the world body. Geir Pedersen, UN special envoy for Syria, held out the prospect of removing Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from the organisation’s list of proscribed terrorist groups. But he said the group could not seek to govern Syria in the way that it had governed Idlib, the northern province where it was based and from where it led the military breakout that resulted in the sudden collapse of the Assad regime."

          "bodyText": "A hiker who was missing for two days has been rescued by the US Coast Guard from Shore Acres state park in Oregon after rescue crews heard her shouting for help. The 64-year-old, who was found on Sunday, had been missing since Friday evening after being separated from her hiking group, the coastguard said. Oregon state police called in the coastguard to monitor radio calls to help locate the woman after nightfall, saying the dark, the rugged terrain and her lack of survival gear were making the search difficult. A helicopter rescue crew using thermal imaging was also dispatched on Friday evening, but eventually returned to base due to poor weather conditions. On Saturday, ground teams, including K-9 crews, from the Coos county sheriff’s office, Oregon state police and Oregon’s department of emergency management were dispatched, and two coastguard flights searched later in the evening once the weather had improved, still in vain. On Sunday the search was joined by a team from California Oregon Regional Search and Rescue Task Force, and shortly after noon several members of the ground team heard shouting in a remote area of the park. They eventually located the missing woman, who was showing signs of hypothermia and dehydration. Rescue crew moved her to a safe extraction point and built a fire to warm her up, as they waited for a coastguard helicopter, which arrived at 1.45pm and flew her to Bay Area hospital in North Bend. The rescue team later learned it had been unable to locate her using the thermal imaging equipment because she was sheltering underneath a log. Only upon hearing the helicopters did she begin shouting for help. “The Coast Guard and our partner agencies here on the Oregon Coast routinely train together to ensure we can execute coordinated search and rescue missions whenever we’re called upon,” Commander Jay Kircher, an operations officer and one of the helicopter pilots at Coast Guard air station North Bend, said. “It’s fantastic to see this teamwork in action and produce a successful outcome,” he added."

          "bodyText": "Here is a Mexican crime drama without the crime – or without much of it, taking place chiefly on the margins of serious violence. It is the coming-of-age story of a teenage boy whose dad was a sicario, or cartel killer, in the Tierra Caliente of Michoacán in southern Mexico. Young Sujo (Kevin Aguilar) is at primary school when his father is brutally killed and the killers come looking for the little boy, fearing he will grow up to avenge his dad’s death. Sujo takes refuge at the remote shack belonging to his watchful aunt Nemesia (Yadira Pérez); she becomes his protective family, along with his other aunt Rosalia (Karla Garrido) and his cousins Jai (Alexis Varela) and Jeremy (Jairo Hernandez). Sujo grows to be a teenager (played by Juan Jesús Varela), and flirts with the idea of being a drug runner along with Jai and Jeremy, using his dad’s old car; or alternatively going straight for a new life in Mexico City, working, enrolling in school to study literature and striking out for a radically alternative existence. Film-makers Astrid Rondero and Fernanda Valadez first made their name with the engrossing docu-realist drama Identifying Features with Valadez directing and co-writing with Rondero; it was a heartbreaking story of a mother’s desolate yearning for her absent son. This, with the pair now credited together as directors, has many of the same ideas and images, although it is not as angry and fiercely coiled as Identifying Features, and Sujo’s possible life as a student is not plausibly imagined as the grimly banal world of violence whose gravitational force pulls at him constantly. As for his name, its meaning is elusive throughout the film (Nemesia points out her own means “vengeance”) until the end which returns us to the moment of his father’s own ironically innocent childhood that began the film. A strongly intended and conceived film, but without the passion of the earlier work. • Sujo is in UK cinemas from 13 December."

          "headline": "Asylum seekers to be housed in disused care homes and student digs",
          "bodyText": "Asylum seekers will be housed in disused care homes and student digs under a Home Office plan to find 800 new accommodation sites and cut a bill that has risen to £5.5m a day. Home Office sources have confirmed to the Guardian that the fundamental changes to asylum accommodation are under way in a bid to save millions spent every day on hotel accommodation. About 35,000 asylum seekers are accommodated in hotels – a reduction from a high last year of more than 50,000 people. In 2023–24, the Home Office spent approximately £4.7bn on asylum support, of which about £3.1bn was spent on hotels. The previous government hoped mass accommodation sites such as former military bases and the Bibby Stockholm barge moored in Portland, Dorset, would save taxpayers money and remove the optics of asylum seekers leading a life of luxury in hotels. But at a meeting of the cross-party public accounts committee (PAC) on Monday, Home Office bosses admitted that mass accommodation sites on former military bases have not worked as well as the government had hoped. Reports by the financial watchdog National Audit Office (NAO) found that sites such as the Bibby Stockholm barge, which has now been decanted, do not represent good value for money. The Home Office is still using hundreds of hotels to accommodate asylum seekers, which can cost about £150 a night. The new plan is to roll out 800 new accommodation sites that are neither former military bases nor hotels and include care homes and vacant student accommodation. According to freedom of information data obtained by Liberal Democrats last year, 94 care homes across 46 different local authorities in England are lying empty, some awaiting repairs or refurbishment. The Home Office is advertising a £76,000-a-year top job with the title of New Sites Operational Post to manage the hundreds of new accommodation sites it hopes to roll out. The post will initially cover the existing sites of Napier barracks in Folkestone and Wethersfield in Essex but the job spec says the remit “is likely to extend to other sites in the near future”. According to the job description, the new postholder will spend most of their time working on the large sites and “will work collaboratively with a range of stakeholders to transition to new large sites and alternative accommodation”. It adds that there will be “scope to increase as more sites become operational”. When numbers of asylum seekers were smaller and their claims were processed more quickly, most lived in shared housing. But the pandemic and an increase in numbers led first to thousands of asylum seekers being accommodated in hotels and then the introduction of mass accommodation sites such as the Bibby Stockholm and Wethersfield, a former military base in a remote part of Essex referred to as a “stalag” by local residents. NAO has condemned the purchase of another planned mass accommodation site – the asbestos-riddled former prison site Northeye, in Bexhill-on-Sea which the Home Office bought for £15.4m just a year after an investment company acquired the site for less than half that sum. No asylum seekers were ever moved in there. The site will either be sold off or offloaded to another government department if any want the contaminated and dilapidated site. At the PAC, Home Office permanent secretary Sir Matthew Rycroft admitted that “one thousand lessons had been learned in totality” from failures of mass accommodation sites such as Northeye. Lou Calvey, director of the charity Asylum Matters, said: “News that government intends to open asylum accommodation in disused care homes and student blocks is deeply concerning. People should be accommodated in our communities with a clear, developed, support offer. Government need to be working with communities, investing in them, to ensure places of welcome. We would urge government to carefully consider its approach to accommodated hugely traumatised people who’ve been waiting on their asylum claims for years.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We have inherited enormous pressures in the asylum system and remain absolutely committed to ending the use of hotels to ensure value for money. We have identified a range of sites that we are narrowing down to a handful of suitable properties that will enable us to exit hotels sooner.” • This article was amended on 11 December 2024 to add a comment from the Home Office that was received after publication. Also, the current daily hotel bill for temporary asylum-seeker housing is £5.5m, not £8m as stated in a previous version due to an editing error."

          "headline": "Where is Kemi Badenoch’s Tory tent? In a political no man’s land",
          "bodyText": "Election defeats are to some degree self-inflicted, so the first place that opposition parties should look for someone to blame for their predicament is a mirror. The Conservatives have flinched from that task. The leadership race over the summer and autumn featured only a performance of reflection on mistakes made by the last government. The looking-glass was positioned askew so no one had to see themselves as part of the problem. Kemi Badenoch prevailed in that contest as the embodiment of a theory that Britain had not rejected Conservative ideas when it evicted a Tory government. True Conservatism was what voters craved, and they punished Rishi Sunak’s party for failing to provide it. “We talked right but governed left,” Badenoch said. It is a peculiar analysis that designates Sunak, Liz Truss, Boris Johnson, Theresa May and David Cameron as politicians of the left. It also doesn’t explain why so many former Tory voters switched to Labour and the Liberal Democrats. A defence of Badenoch’s position might be that she had to secure support from her own party before reaching out to the country. Goading demoralised members out of their comfort zone too soon is a way to lose internal party elections. But nothing about the Tory leader hints at a gift for dissembling craft. Blunt candour was her pitch for the job. She says what she thinks and she really does think that Britain’s problems arise from an excess of leftism that somehow flourished during 14 years of Tory rule. To make sense of that view, you have to picture the beast that Badenoch intends to vanquish. Helpfully, she sketched the outline last week in a speech in Washington. Her argument was that the malevolent essence of communism has reinvented itself since defeat in the cold war and has “hacked” liberal democracy. The old left reflex of repressive intolerance comes camouflaged as virtue – compassion for refugees; antiracism. It captures hearts and minds in a generation that has grown up complacent about freedom, ignorant of the danger. The infiltration is double-pronged. On the economic front comes a new kind of socialism, no longer defined by state control of the means of production but operating stealthily, as a more remote manipulation of citizens’ lives. Badenoch quoted a “fantastic” speech by Argentina’s radical libertarian president, Javier Milei, in which the new socialism is said to nest in such nefarious activities as “controlling interest rates” and “regulations to correct market failures”. The second front is cultural – the suffocation of free speech by censorious “woke” ideology. Although this doctrine has yet to achieve anything resembling electoral success, its dissemination through the halls of academe is evidence of its potential to undo western civilisation. Woke fanatics don’t need to win power on the strength of their own arguments because they piggyback on more popular, deviously moderate leftwing promises of a state that provides decent social services. Voters’ susceptibility to the siren lure of a well-resourced public sector is something Badenoch lamented in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry last month. It is hard to make the case for a smaller state, she said, because people “want the government to solve everything, and if you ever sound hesitant, you are made out to be a cruel, unfeeling person”. None of this is original thinking, and historically, at this early stage in the electoral cycle, it wouldn’t matter what a new opposition leader was saying. There would be time to get the message right. But failure to have an honest reckoning with the scale of July’s defeat is already feeding impatience for a speedier recovery among Tory MPs. And two-thirds of them voted for a different leader in the last ballot of the parliamentary party. Badenoch’s position is unusually vulnerable because she doesn’t have a secure claim to be the standard bearer of the right. Nigel Farage’s Reform UK may have only five MPs, but it is nudging at parity with Labour and the Conservatives in opinion polls. At this stage that isn’t a meaningful indicator of what might happen in a general election that is years away. But it indicates an underlying volatility and promiscuity of voter allegiance that makes it hard to exclude any outcome. The first past the post electoral system generates stable, predictable results if there are two big parties with vote shares that stifle smaller challengers. If several parties all poll around 20-25%, the allocation of seats could go haywire. A rational evaluation of the Tories’ electoral challenge would focus as much on seats lost to the Lib Dems as votes surrendered to Reform. Sensible Conservatives are worried that next year’s local council elections will see Ed Davey’s troops quietly dig themselves deeper into former Tory heartlands, while right-leaning newspapers and GB News perform their usual routine of Farage amplification. Badenoch’s dilemma will become more acute and her capacity for manoeuvre even tighter. But instead of addressing structural threats to her party’s position in the real world of British electoral politics, the Conservative leader is casting herself as a visionary warrior against phantom hordes of neo-communists mustering in Whitehall and on university campuses. Perhaps this is a gamble based on Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House. Maybe Badenoch thinks the future of Conservatism is prefigured in the Republican party’s capture by a combination of tech-bro libertarianism, anti-woke hysteria and xenophobic nationalism. (The tariff-wielding protectionist part of Trump’s agenda tends to be downplayed by his British cheerleaders since it sits awkwardly with their professed devotion to free trade.) Maybe the Tory leader just feels the need to rival Farage as the incoming president’s unofficial British satrap. Either way, any dalliance by Badenoch with Trump fandom will chase liberal ex-Tories deeper into the Lib Dem embrace without wooing anyone back from Reform. The same problem arises with her compulsion to shrink the state. Plenty of voters think taxes are too high and that public money gets wasted. That doesn’t mean they will rally to an idiosyncratic Badenoch-led crusade against freedom-hating bureaucrats. She argues that government should do less, but never says which of its current functions should be scrapped. Filling in that blank is unlikely to make her more popular. The Conservatives under Sunak spent their final years in office torn between conflicting demands of practical government and ideological mania; between the belief that taxes should always come down and voter appetite for services that work; between a liberal labour market that relies on immigration and populist pledges to repel foreigners. Sunak positioned the Tories with exquisite precision in a political no man’s land, where voters left, right and centre all had reasons to feel aggrieved. Badenoch’s plan looks like a more intellectually contrived edifice on the same underpopulated patch of electoral real estate. Maybe this time it will work. Maybe if she builds her shrine to the true Conservatism, masses of voters will come to worship. But it isn’t clear who or where they are, and it is later than she thinks.

The company also failed to offer any compensation or interest on the money it had wrongly taken from them and held for years, something one of AGL’s most senior executive has admitted was a mistake. The federal court is currently considering what fine should be imposed on AGL for more than 16,000 breaches of the law relating to its use of Centrepay, a government payments system allowing welfare recipients to make automatic deductions for essential services, like electricity. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email AGL used the system to continue taking money from the welfare payments of 483 customers long after they had ceased being AGL customers, allowing it to receive and retain an average of about $1,000 from each individual between early 2016 and late 2020. A Guardian Australia investigation has revealed how three other energy retailers, including Origin and Ergon, also stand accused of using Centrepay to wrongly take money from the welfare payments of departed customers. The Guardian also revealed how failures in the system – which the government has now pledged to reform – allowed it to bankroll a Christian rehabilitation centre practising gay conversion therapy and exorcisms, and exposed remote Indigenous communities to predatory rent-to-buy appliance companies. The federal court heard on Wednesday that AGL had been formally warned about similar conduct in 2013, prompting Centrelink to issue it with a remedy notice. AGL implemented a manual fix to stop it from taking Centrepay payments from departed customers, and promised the federal government there would not be a repeat. But the court heard that in 2016, without any explanation, AGL abandoned the fix it had implemented. That allowed it to continue diverting money from the pockets of welfare recipients. “It’s very difficult to understand why that happened,” Josephine Egan, the company’s chief customer officer, told the federal court on Wednesday. The practice continued undetected – either by the company’s audit and risk management committee, its compliance team, or other audit areas – for more than four years. When it was eventually detected, AGL promised to return the money to welfare recipients. But the court heard that, in its letter to affected customers, it offered no apology, no explanation of the company’s failings, and no compensation or interest on the funds which it had held for years. Instead, the letter, appeared to blame the welfare recipients for the issue. “We noticed, after you left us, you failed to update your Centrepay arrangement,” the letter began. Under cross-examination, Egan was asked whether she believed it was wrong of the company not to offer compensation or interest to the affected welfare recipients. “Yes, I do,” she responded. Egan described the culture of compliance at AGL as “strong”. “[The Centrepay failure] is completely inconsistent with my experience at AGL,” she said. “But in this situation we absolutely got it wrong, we absolutely got it wrong.” The court heard – theoretically, at least – the 16,000 breaches could attract a $1.6bn fine. A fine of that scale is unlikely, but lawyers for the Australian Energy Regulator are pushing for a substantial penalty, one that cannot be considered by AGL as an acceptable cost of doing business. The court heard that nothing had been put in writing to Egan’s 1,600-strong AGL team to notify them of the Centrepay failings. Egan said she had been relying on oral conversations with her team, an approach to compliance the AER described as “fanciful”. Lawyers for the AER said that approach risked a repeat of 2016, when lessons were forgotten and the problem allowed to recur. “What we say AGL management will remember is a very substantial penalty,” James Arnott SC, counsel for the regulator, said. The hearing continues on Wednesday before justice Kylie Downes."

          "headline": "Lucrative tax breaks will be ‘vital’ in PNG team’s bid to attract top NRL players ",
          "bodyText": "Tax concessions and safe accommodation loom as non-negotiables for players as an NRL team in Papua New Guinea plans its entry the competition 2028, but the opportunity to have a social impact has emerged as a potential secret weapon for recruitment. The licence for the expansion franchise will be confirmed on Thursday, triggering a frenzy of activity among players and agents excited by the prospect of more than 50 new NRL and NRLW contracts. Former Kangaroo David Shillington, who played several times in Port Moresby, said the club must target those who care about the PNG community. “Those players that want to be a part of something really special, and know that their giftedness playing football, the hard work they put into building their career, is actually going to provide a massive social impact at the same time.” The club is the central part of a $600m, 10-year investment by the Australian government into development and diplomacy centred on sport in the Pacific, but its success hinges on the new franchise’s ability to attract high-end talent. Rugby League Players Association chief executive Clint Newton said players need to be consulted both in the start-up phase and regularly in subsequent years given the “unique” nature of the proposed team, and discussions must include both the Australian and PNG government. “There’s no doubt there are some obstacles that we’ve got to go over, but I certainly don’t think it’s as complex as landing on the moon,” he said, citing high-performance standards at the club, player accommodation and the availability of schools and medical services as crucial. “I think we can get there and it is going to produce long-lasting and generational impact.” Tax concessions are expected to be offered to players as a sweetener funded by the PNG government, which is also spending around $40m each year in the lead-up to 2028 on facilities and pathways. A secure complex similar to those used by Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs to house workers and their families in Port Moresby is set to be built. Shillington, who now works as a player mentor, said tax breaks will be “vital”, as even the best recruiters can find it hard to convince players to join expansion teams. “We saw when the Dolphins came in [in 2023] they had super coach Wayne Bennett there recruiting people,” he said. “But even he really struggled with recruitment in that first year or two, and that held them back a lot.” Former NRL player and now accredited agent Scott Sattler said the lifestyle will be decisive in whether players move, and for some it might not be dissimilar to working in a remote mine. “The best way I would look at selling it would be, it’s just like a Fifo [fly in, fly out] job,” he said. “You go and spend two to three years earning more money than you’ve ever earned in rugby league, possible tax breaks, and you do it for a period of time, and you save as much of that money as possible for your young family’s future.” Although there are over 10,000 Australians in Papua New Guinea at any one time, recent violence and instability has heightened concerns among expats. Sattler said the club had to demonstrate safety and security to potential recruits. “First and foremost, it’s going to be where are the players going to be located and can you assure their safety,” he said. Melbourne five-eighth Cam Munster – who comes off contract at the end of 2027 – said last week he wasn’t aware of how the PNG bid was coming together, but players will be reluctant to commit until they had seen the living and working conditions. “They’ll go over there and have a look at the facilities as a group, as players, and then make the decision,” he said. He said the team will be “massive” for fans in PNG, and their passion is another drawcard. “I’m sure there’ll be some players that want to play for PNG.”"

          "bodyText": "Ten patients suffering from a mystery disease that has broken out in the Democratic Republic of the Congo have tested positive for malaria, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said. However, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the patients could have more than one disease simultaneously. “Of the 12 initial samples collected, 10 tested positive for malaria, although it’s possible that more than one disease is involved. Further samples will be collected and tested to determine the exact cause or causes,” a WHO spokesperson said on Tuesday. Cases of unidentified illness in a remote part of the DRC have caused alarm, with specialist teams from the WHO and Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention sent to investigate. Those investigations are continuing. The DRC’s health minister said last week that the disease had killed 79 people in the Panzi health zone since 24 October, with 376 cases identified. Most were children under five. The main symptoms are similar to flu, with patients experiencing headaches, coughing, difficulty breathing and anaemia. At a briefing on 5 December, Dieudonne Mwamba, the head of the DRC’s National Institute for Public Health, said the symptoms pointed to a respiratory illness, but without a clear diagnosis it was hard to know the cause, and whether it was a virus or bacteria. He said the affected area was “fragile”, with 40% of people there experiencing malnutrition. The DRC is also dealing with an mpox outbreak and seasonal flu. There is little testing capacity, and samples from patients have been transported to a regional laboratory in Kikwit, 300 miles away, as well as the national reference laboratory in Kinshasa, more than 400 miles away, a journey of two days by road. Amid speculation that the outbreak could represent “Disease X” – a term used to describe a previously unknown pathogen with the potential to cause a pandemic – the WHO emphasised it was “an undiagnosed disease rather than an unknown” one. Officials said a respiratory pathogen such as flu or Covid-19 was being investigated as a possible cause, as well as malaria, measles and others. In an update on Sunday, the WHO said the affected area “experienced deterioration in food insecurity in recent months, has low vaccination coverage and very limited access to diagnostics and quality case management”. It said there was also a shortage of health staff, supplies and transportation, with “very limited” malaria control measures."

One ad was for a British fortified wine, widely and cheaply sold in supermarkets. Four British mountaineers had scaled a remote peak and planted the Union flag. Time to toast ourselves with the wine, and we produced tin mugs from our back packs. A colleague was having trouble. “Tom,” he said, “it’s really difficult holding the flag with one hand and pouring into the mug with the other. Is it all right if I take a swig straight from the bottle?” “No,” came the emphatic reply from Tom at the back of the studio, “that is the image of the product we are trying to dispel by making this commercial.”"

We’re gonna do it anyway.” As a meme for our times, the crescendo of Barry from EastEnders’ version of Labi Siffre’s (Something Inside) So Strong at the 2014 World Indoor Bowls Championships remains unsurpassed. People of influence and power will carry on with their power and influence regardless of the dissent of the commoner and the reasoning of so-called experts and Fifa is no different in this regard, with Don Gianni Infantino set to award the 2034 World Cup to Saudi Arabia on Wednesday. That the expected winning bid for 2030 takes in three continents, six nations and yet more air miles means that Saudi Arabia, as sole bidder, is nailed on for 2034. Unlike that day in 2010 when Russia and Qatar were handed the Ethics and Human Rights World Cups in a glitzy Swiss ballroom, this ceremony will be online only. Infantino will hide away from scrutiny behind a screen with the winning bids accompanied by “applause”, rather than votes, boos or anything less palatable. Perhaps Infantino, the big showman, will use a clap-o-meter in the style of Hughie Green on Opportunity Knocks. Does anyone fancy stopping this? Well, the Norwegian FA has at least broken ranks to declare it will vote against the awarding of hosting rights for the 2030 and 2034 World Cups by acclamation, adding that it has written a letter to Fifa criticising the process. English FA officials, meanwhile, are ‘mindful of concerns’ over Saudi Arabia’s human rights record. However, some are also wary of suggestions of hypocrisy if the FA declines to endorse the tournament, but then participates in it. Heaven forbid anyone in football ends up looking like a hypocrite. Sir Keir Starmer was pressing the flesh of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) just last weekend, hoping for a return visit where “the leaders would be able to watch a game of football in between meetings if he took up the offer”. The chances of MBS and Starmer heading down to watch Leyton Orient together are about as remote as this email can imagine. Though perhaps still not as unlikely as football suits and governing bodies truly embracing the human rights concerns attached to a Saudi World Cup. A Big Website investigation earlier this year found “evidence of high numbers of unexplained deaths in Saudi Arabia of migrant workers from Bangladesh, with at least 13,685 dying in the country between 2008 and 2022. More than 1,500 Bangladeshis died in 2022 alone – a rate of more than four a day.” Lessons learned from the first Human Rights World Cup? Not many. More from Big Website: “A long-awaited Fifa report on whether it should compensate migrant workers who suffered severe labour abuses on projects linked to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. Despite a recommendation from its own subcommittee on human rights and social responsibility that it do so, Fifa’s answer was, in effect, a resounding no.” LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join John Brewin at 5.45pm (GMT) for updates from Girona 0-2 Liverpool, while Luke McLaughlin will be on hand with a Bigger Cup clockwatch at 8pm.

FOOTBALL DAILY LETTERS A propos your comments about the extortionately high ticket prices at MUFC (yesterday’s Football Daily), this may be the exact moment to refresh the fact that nearly 20 years ago, in May 2005, 6,000 Manchester United supporters walked away from top-flight football and formed FC United of Manchester. Our new club serves as the biggest consistent weekly protest against the Glazers, the debt burden unfairly placed on United, and the extraordinary amount of money that has ruined the top-flight game. It’s been a rollercoaster ride since then, but our ethos of low matchday ticket prices still persists, with tickets at £13 for adults and juniors are £3. Season tickets are priced on a ‘pay what you can afford’ basis. Here’s a wonderful video (there are loads similar out there on YouTube) summarising the club’s reason for existing.

Then there’s Bournemouthy (no relation to ‘born mouthy’), ideal for those who somehow thrive just when you’ve written them off entirely.

          "bodyText": "If you are in any doubt that this adaptation of the 1952 Mary Norton novel has lost its way long before the interval, just check out the first big song of the second half. By this stage, the stakes should be high. The tiny creatures who live under the skirting boards, surviving off human scraps – borrowed not stolen – are under assault. The boorish Mrs Driver (Claire Storey), a “human bean” with a fetish for cleanliness, is sensing their presence and has inadvertently hoovered them up. This is life-and-death stuff and demands an impassioned response. But what do we get? Only a song about paper planes. This duet between Young Eddie (Matthew Heywood), a 10-year-old boy, and Arrietty (Amy Tara), the 13-year-old Borrower he has befriended, comes complete with instructions about where to make the folds. In a show with few songs, it is weirdly tangential and does little to expand our understanding of Arrietty’s journey from claustrophobia to freedom. The malaise sets in much earlier. Gitika Buttoo’s production starts off promisingly as Howard Chadwick’s Eddie joins us in the audience to check under our feet for signs of miniature life. He is a genial Scouser and a welcoming narrator who remembers spending a lonely summer in the leafy Haverbreaks district of Lancaster when his mum was ill. Quite when this was is uncertain: it looks to be a postwar world of tank tops, superhero comics and handwritten train tickets, but there are also barcodes and TV remote controls. The scrappy set by Richard Foxton looks as though it has been put together on a Borrowers’ budget, the more so under the washed-out lighting design of Brent Lees. It is a production without atmosphere. Chadwick, like the other five actors, puts his all into it and charms the young audience as he goes, but the script by Bea Roberts favours monologue over interaction and wordiness over action. It is hard to blame the actors for garbling such cumbersome lines or for trying to shout the script into dramatic life. We get little sense of the Borrowers’ resourcefulness, still less of their perilous quest to find safety. The little creatures go a very short way. At the Dukes, Lancaster, until 31 December"

          "bodyText": "When Micaela Sawyer saw the photo of a weak, emaciated dog shuddering in the snow, she hoped desperately it was her Murphy. The golden retriever with a dulled red coat and legs riddled with injuries, was unmistakably the dog she and her partner, Jim Barnes, had raised as a puppy, she said. For more than 50 days, Barnes and Murphy had been the focus of an extensive search in the wilderness of western Canada after they vanished in mid-October. But incredibly, after weeks of hope and despair, Murphy was home at last. “He is badly injured, with major swelling, puncture wounds (possibly from a dog or coyote), a broken front paw, and scabs all over,” Sawyer wrote on Facebook, sharing an image of a dog, his right paw in a bright red cast. “His behavior has changed too, from a quiet, independent dog to one who barks at every sound and howls when I leave the room.” The dog’s unlikely reunion with Sawyer is both joyous and heart-rending. Barnes remains missing, a disappearance in British Columbia that has baffled search crews who have found little trace of the veteran outdoorsman. “Finding Murphy alive gives us hope that we might finally get answers about what happened to Jim,” Sawyer wrote. On 18 October, Barnes, 28, and Murphy departed on a short trip to collect firewood and hunt grouse, headed for a remote corner of British Columbia where Barnes had often hunted, fished and foraged. Barnes was due for a shift as a paramedic the next day in Fort St John, but the two never returned and Sawyer reported her partner missing. Early the next day, 19 October, Barnes’s phone pinged on a forest service road south of the town, giving search teams their first major clue. Sawyer and two others immediately started searching the area, where Barnes had once worked with the crews laying a pipeline. By noon, his grey pickup truck was found on the side of the road. Most of his belongings, including his phone, keys, bag and firearms were inside. The door was left ajar. The lands and waters of Peace River country can be fickle in October. Temperatures can plunge with little notice. Within an hour of the truck being spotted, heavy snow started falling. Animals also present a risk. It was the tail end of hunting season, and “gutpiles” of slain deer were scattered throughout the area. The teams saw fresh evidence of grizzly bears and wolves nearby, but no clear evidence of a predatory attack. Initially, the terrain was deemed by police too treacherous for a volunteer search and so for two days, professional teams pushed hard and covered immense ground. When the weather cleared, a helicopter flew over the river. “It’s a busy area where he went missing. There’s lots of hunting, community cattle pastures and foragers for chaga [mushrooms]. It’s just strange,” said Shona Murray, a paramedic who organized a volunteer search after formal efforts were paused. Murray, a friend of Sawyer, drew on the talents the community had on offer: firefighters, foresters and avid outdoors people all keen to help bring Barnes home safely. “He would have been better oriented to the area than most and then he just vanished,” Murray said. “Search teams commented many times on how odd it was that he vanished without a trace.” It was a hostile environment for the search: the forest floor was littered with blown-down spruce trees and thick brush. Search dogs found no sign of Murphy or Barnes. Eventually, volunteers discovered a valuable clue: a frozen boot print and dogs prints along the river, 3km (1.8 miles) from the truck. What felt like a major break in the search soon fizzled out. Murray says police never visited the scene, nor did they put any of their own boats in the water, seemingly relying on the resources of volunteers. “They were very disorganized,” said Murray, who asked why more effort wasn’t made to search the rivers. “All the jurisdictions of the RCMP [Canada’s federal police force] played hot potato with this file … There isn’t much trace, but what was found wasn’t followed up on” In a statement, police in the region say the search remained a “top priority” for local units. But a dearth of answers, clues or explanations has left those who scoured the forest with only speculation. “Obviously your brain runs rampant with theories, but that leaves you wondering where to even start,” said Murray, who said possible explanations for Barnes’s disappearance were injury from a fall, an animal attack or getting swept away by the river. “He wouldn’t have just gotten lost. We’re just left with more questions than answers.” Against the odds, the search has persisted into December – bolstered by two pieces of good news. In late November, Sam Benastick, 20, who went missing the same day as Barnes in a nearby wilderness park, emerged from the wilds alive after surviving 50 days alone. He later told friends a wolf had chased him, causing him to lose bearings. In the final weeks, he subsisted on a single jar of peanut butter. Then at the end of November, a photo of an injured dog was posted to a local Facebook group for lost and found pets more than 120km from the initial search area. He wasn’t tattooed or microchipped, but Sawyer has taken the dog to the local groomers, where it appeared comfortable. She’s also taken him on familiar paths they walked, and is convinced the dog is Murphy. But police aren’t sure. “At this time we cannot with 100% certainty say this is in fact Murphy. While the family feels it might be Murphy, the RCMP are looking into a DNA test to determine positively that it is Murphy,” Sgt Madonna Saunderson, a Northern district RCMP spokesperson, said in a statement. But a DNA test would take months – time which friends say Barnes doesn’t have as the grip of winter tightens over the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Earlier this week, at the request of local RCMP, North Peace Search and Rescue posted a photo of volunteers searching the Halfway River area earlier this week, nearby to where the dog was found. Heavy snow blanketed the area. Still, the miraculous return of a young dog has given the searchers a rare sliver of good news – a helpful respite when facing down larger and probably more devastating realities. “It’s been a heartbreaking journey, and while we wish Murphy could share his story, we fear we couldn’t bear to hear it,” wrote Sawyer. “He’s such a sweet boy, and he didn’t deserve any of this, nor did Jim.”"

          "bodyText": "The bones lie scattered across the desert floor, close to the beach. Along with some tattered clothes, a single banknote and a sun-bleached identity card, they are the only remains of a young Ethiopian man who risked everything for the chance of a better life in Saudi Arabia. Wearing a surgical mask, Dr Youssouf Moussa, from the UN’s International Organization for Migration (IOM), gathers them into a bundle that he buries in a makeshift grave. The site’s coordinates will be shared with the authorities in Obock, a small port town in Djibouti. But since the local graveyard is almost full, they will probably remain here in this lonely patch of desert a few miles to the north. A few hundred metres away are more burial sites, marked by piles of black stones, testifying to the dangers of the journey. “These two graves both hold five people,” says Youssouf, gesturing at the mounds. “That one holds 43, another 50. Behind that hill are more holding two, three, five and seven.” Some of the dead succumbed to thirst or disease in the desert. Others drowned in disasters at sea. They are the victims of one of the world’s least understood and fastest-growing migration routes, known by aid groups as the “eastern corridor”. The route is used mostly by Ethiopian migrants fleeing conflict, the climate crisis and destitution in their homeland, who travel in small boats from Somaliland and Djibouti, across the Gulf of Aden, to war-struck Yemen. From there they cross into Saudi Arabia on foot, hoping to find work. Last year, 96,670 irregular migrants arrived on Yemen’s shores, an increase of 32% on 2022, according to the IOM. Moussa believes more migrants are taking the route partly because of the war in Sudan, which has made it harder for Ethiopians to get to Libya to cross the Mediterranean to Europe. Yet the route receives scant attention in the wider world, in part because the migrants are not bound for Europe or North America. “People don’t know much about this route,” he says. “Everyone talks about the Mediterranean, but you hardly hear about the eastern corridor.” It is a perilous journey through some of the most punishing terrain anywhere. To reach Djibouti, the migrants must traverse vast expanses of desert and fields of sharp volcanic rock, with scant water and temperatures that can reach 50C (122F) in the summer. After the sea crossing, they must negotiate the war zone of Yemen. Along the way, they are preyed upon by smugglers, bandits and militiamen. Migrants who cannot pay their traffickers are routinely detained and tortured until their families stump up money for their release. Sexual violence against women, who make up 21% of the migrants, is common. If they make it to the Saudi border, the migrants face attacks from Saudi border guards. Last year a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report found hundreds, possibly thousands, of migrants had been killed at the border “in a pattern that is widespread and systematic”. Border guards shoot at smaller groups and fire mortars at bigger ones to deter them from crossing, according to Nadia Hardman, the report’s author. “Everything points at a shoot-to-kill policy of anyone who crosses the border irregularly,” says Hardman. “I don’t know of any border force that kills and pushes back migrants so brutally.” The midpoint for most migrants’ journeys is Obock, close to the Gulf of Aden’s narrowest point, the strait known as Bab al-Mandab, or Gate of Tears, because of the perilous navigation. At 20 miles (32km) wide, it is roughly as wide as the Dover strait. Small boats can cross this busy shipping lane, linking the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, in about an hour. IOM has recorded about 1,400 drownings since 2014. This is likely to be only a fraction of the total. Many deaths go unrecorded when bodies are washed out to sea; still more people die in remote stretches of desert or at the Saudi border. One large-scale tragedy happened in October when captains forcibly returning migrants from Yemen to Djibouti ordered people off their vessels and told them to swim ashore. At least 45 people drowned and more than 100 are still missing. Two months later, the beach is strewn with discarded bottles and flip-flops, left by migrants going in the opposite direction. Two boats lie abandoned on the shore, destroyed by the Djiboutian coastguard. A short distance away, a group of migrants sit by a smuggler’s pickup. They will cross once night falls. On the edge of Obock, Abebe also waits to make the voyage. He once worked as a charcoal dealer in Ethiopia’s Amhara region, but civil conflict destroyed his business. “It’s dangerous and there is no work,” says Abebe. “Almost all the youth are leaving to find a job and get distance from the war.” Abebe had promised to pay the smugglers 160,000 Ethiopian birr (about £1,000) once he reached Yemen. He does not have the money but hopes his family will find it once he arrives by selling land or borrowing from neighbours. “If not, we know we may imprisoned and tortured,” says Abebe. “It’s a huge risk, but I have no option.” At a nearby water point, Tewelde prepares to make the crossing for the second time. When he first made the journey, in 2021, he passed rotting corpses and human skeletons at the Yemeni-Saudi border. During his current attempt, his group were attacked by armed men in the desert. They took everything he had: his money, mobile phone, even his clothes. “They gathered us all together, held out a grenade and said, ‘If you don’t give us all you have, we will let this off,’” says Tewelde. At one point they opened fire, sending Tewelde running into the desert. “There are so many risks – in the sea, in the desert,” he says. “I expect more challenges, even worse things, but I cannot live in Tigray. There is no work.” The men passing through Obock hope to find work labouring on construction sites, digging irrigation ditches or as goatherds for 1,000-1,500 Saudi riyals (£210-£315) a month. It is not much, but far more than they could hope to make at home in Ethiopia. The women plan to work as domestic servants. In the town, young Ethiopian migrants linger outside restaurants, hoping to snatch handfuls of leftover beans or rice before waiters chase them away. At dusk, they go to the port’s rubbish-strewn beach to sleep. Many made the gruelling journey here without the help of smugglers, asking nomads the way and surviving on half-drunk bottles of water thrown out of windows by passing lorry drivers. They had hoped to make money in Obock to pay for the sea crossing, but there is little work and now they are marooned. The IOM does its best to help. Its teams patrol the desert with boxes of dates, water and a medical kit to assist those in trouble. It also helps stranded migrants get home. But it struggles to cope with the thousands of migrants passing through Obock every day. “We can’t help everybody, that’s impossible,” says Moussa. “But we hope to help the most vulnerable.” They include Omar, a shy 18-year-old who left Ethiopia when heavy rain swept away his family farm. As he walked through the desert, he counted the bodies of 10 people who had died on the way. Three of his group were left behind, too weak to walk. After his boat arrived in Yemen, the captain ordered them to get out in neck-high water and wade ashore. Several did not make it to the beach. Shortly afterwards he was kidnapped by an armed gang. They held Omar in a forest with dozens of others, where they beat him with sticks and metal bars and demanded a ransom of 150,000 birr to release him. At one point, his captors held a gun to his head. “We were all bleeding and exhausted,” says Omar. “They said, ‘If you don’t have the money, we’ll kill you.’” At IOM’s centre in Obock, Omar shows the scars on his wrists from the chains used to bind him. He was eventually released after his family transferred the money. After the kidnappers dumped him by the road, he was arrested and sent back to Djibouti. Now all he wants is to go home. “The broker said the way was safe, that there would be no problems and I would get to Yemen easily,” says Omar. “It was all a lie.”"

          "headline": "Brisbane is deciding on a 2032 Olympics stadium: how do the options stack up?",
          "bodyText": "The 2032 Olympics have for a long time felt far away but it took Gout Gout to show they are just around the corner. The Brisbane teenager’s barely believable 200m national record on Saturday has upped the urgency for organisers to get Games planning right, as Queenslanders dream of an Olympic sprinting medal from a local hero. The venue options for athletics and the opening and closing ceremonies are well-known and the deadlines obvious. But more than three years after Brisbane won the right to host the 2032 Olympics, uneven ambition and political manoeuvring means organisers have not yet decided on the site. The Liberal National party state government came to power in October and late last month executed its election pledge to commence a snap review of Olympic venues, to be completed in just 100 days. While the seven-member panel led by the property veteran Stephen Conry may be beavering away behind the scenes, the latest blank canvas in Games planning has excited political, architectural and civic stakeholders. No public contribution has carried more weight than that of Andrew Liveris – the president of the Brisbane 2023 Organising Committee’s board – who said last week that a stadium in the contentious location of Victoria Park with private financing “makes the most sense”. With the city’s international reputation on the line, and concerns prominent when it comes to prudent expenditure, legacy infrastructure and resident opposition, the panel’s report – and the ultimate response by the government – will hinge on picking one or two winners from just a handful of key sites around central Brisbane. The Gabba Proposals: Rebuild, renovate, ignore or change land use Concerns: Ageing stadium, small footprint, importance for AFL/cricket Post-review: Up in the air The drama around Games venues began in 2021 when the former premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced that a rebuilt Gabba would be the showpiece of 2032. It was a break to the narrative that Brisbane won hosting rights because of its ability to reuse existing venues. That option was criticised by some for being a waste of money, and by others for being physically impossible. The Gabba’s tight inner city footprint is an architect’s nightmare and the impact on the adjoining East Brisbane state school lent weight to arguments that other locations should be considered. Much of the Gabba is more than 30 years old and members of the local sports community, including the Brisbane Lions and Queensland Cricket, have noted that to host the Olympics and not improve the city’s major oval offering – and then have to look at new options in subsequent years – would be a missed opportunity. A temporary solution to host matches during Gabba construction, such as upgrading the Brisbane Showgrounds to a 20,000-seat, AFL-ready stadium, further complicates a rebuild. New works to better connect the Gabba and the river past the new Cross River Rail station are also under way, and this precinct has long been viewed as central to the 2032 experience. But building a new stadium elsewhere would free this site up for alternative development. Lang Park Proposals: Retain or improve Concerns: Used extensively by sport and music already, no other high-end rectangular venues Post-review: Minimal works Known commercially as Suncorp Stadium, this is the biggest specialist rectangular venue in Australia and, even as new competitors including Allianz Stadium in Sydney have emerged, it remains one of the country’s best sporting arenas more than two decades after its redevelopment. Though its dimensions preclude athletics, the venue is well placed to host rugby sevens and football matches. And, given that its 52,000-person capacity dwarfs the 37,000 offered by today’s Gabba, it is now the most likely arena for the opening and closing ceremonies. Such a role would probably deliver improvements, as backed by the former premier Steven Miles after a review by the former lord mayor Graham Quirk in March, further extending the life of the new Lang Park. But the football community would prefer that kind of money is diverted into Perry Park, north-east of the central business district, to host some Olympic matches but also serve as a mid-size venue for A-League and state league matches. Victoria Park Proposals: Retain as green space, site for major stadium or other Games venues Concerns: Resident opposition, challenging site, political aversion to new builds Post-review: One to watch The most contentious decision to be made about 2032 venues appears to be the role of Victoria Park. Brisbane city council is upgrading one of the largest inner-city green spaces and a strong residents’ lobby as well as the former premier Campbell Newman are vehemently opposed to a stadium on the grassy hills also known as Barrambin. Despite calls from the likes of Liveris to make the most of the site in 2032 planning, politicians have so far resisted the option. Miles considered then rejected it as part of the Quirk review, believing it too costly and incompatible with the Olympics’ “new norms”, despite Quirk writing: “It provides an opportunity to deliver the best outcome.” The LNP government has also committed to no new stadium builds. Two weeks ago the deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, was asked directly where a stadium at Victoria Park can be considered under the review’s scope. “We have said we don’t support Victoria Park,” he replied. “And the board will know that everyone knows that we’ve said that, and that would not fit as part of the maximising use of existing venues.” The scope of the 100-day review includes “new, upgraded and temporary venues” as well as private financing, fuelling suspicions that creative options – including a private sector-backed stadium at Victoria Park or even hosting two or three venues here, as suggested by the architectural firm Archipelago – are on the table. The site already has a role under 2032 plans as the venue for BMX freestyle and equestrian cross-country. Northshore Hamilton Proposal: Major stadium and futuristic precinct Concerns: Outside central Brisbane, walkways on top of stadium Post-review: Nice renders Excitement surrounding the 100-day review has sparked a new wave of public submissions and blue sky ideas, including for a stadium at Northshore Hamilton adjacent to the planned athlete village. The suggestion, from a group of companies calling themselves Brisbane Design Alliance, demonstrates a high level of both ambition and walkways. Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre Proposal: Expensive upgrade for athletics Concerns: Remote location, limited legacy value Post-review: Consigned to history Sixteen-year-old Gout glided up the back straight of the Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre to set a new Australian record for the 200m on Saturday and establish himself as the likely face of the Brisbane Games. The venue was to host athletics in 2032 under a surprise plan by the former Labor state government but the backlash about spending $1.6bn on a temporary upgrade to a dated, outer suburban venue largely prompted the 100-day review. Gout may be the fastest person in Australia and the future of athletics – but the Olympic prospects for QSAC are going almost as quickly the other way. Roma Street Parklands Proposal: Brisbane Arena Concerns: Cost overruns, loss of green space Post-review: Likely backing The Brisbane Arena at Roma Street – due to host swimming in 2032 – has been one of the most stable pillars of the Games offering, largely thanks to a $2.5bn commitment from the federal government specific to this new 17,000-capacity construction. As of now, it is the most expensive single construction among Games venues and set to be a fitting focus for a Dolphins medal blitz. Just west of the CBD at a major transport hub, the arena and landscaping will transform the Roma Street Parklands, which are largely ringed by a rail line on one side and residential areas on the other. An option to build over the rail line was considered, although the Quirk review warned that it may cost more than $4bn, and the site has been shifted into adjacent parkland amid fears of budget overruns at this busy inner city site. The LNP government claimed last month that there has already been a $500m blowout to works on the adjoining Roma Street station."

          "headline": "Why Anthony Hopkins’ Netflix Herod is Hot Frosty 2 – sort of",
          "bodyText": "Something of a catastrophic category error seems to have happened at Netflix. For some reason it seems to be billing its new film Mary as a Christmas film, when it doesn’t appear to be anything of the sort. We all know what elements a film needs to have to be considered festive. A big-city career girl. A plaid-wearing apple farmer. A local school that needs to be saved. Maybe a naked snowman who comes to life to teach a hot widow how to love again. Almost certainly Lindsay Lohan. And yet Mary has none of these. It’s all deserts and angels and babies being born in mangers and king Herod. It really isn’t very Christmassy at all. Admittedly the archangel Gabriel does keep turning into a scarf and floating about in the film. Maybe it’s the same scarf that magically makes snowmen come to life in Hot Frosty, in which case Mary is clearly part of some fiendish Netflix Christmas cinematic universe and I take it all back. On the whole, though, you wish that Netflix had got a bit more involved and re-nosed Mary as something like Christmas Baby on Candyfloss Lane or Herod: Grouchy Santa. However, what Mary does have, slightly inexplicably, is Anthony Hopkins. One of the greatest actors of all time. A man who only recently won an Oscar for being so good at acting. And now he’s turning up in Mary, as a supporting character in a cheap-looking, straight to Netflix faith-based movie directed by the man best known for giving us xXx: Return of Xander Cage. It’s such a weird booking. At this point in his career, Hopkins presumably has the money and clout to only pick projects that truly speak to him. That really doesn’t seem to be the case here, though, because not only is it a film and role unsuited to Hopkins’s talent, but he doesn’t really look as if he wants to be there. Hopkin spends his scenes doing the sort of cod-Shakespearian spluttering he sometimes resorts to when he doesn’t have a strong director to keep him in check. What’s more, as another critic has pointed out, there are scenes in Mary where he delivers lines while looking at a piece of paper and moving his eyes back and forth, the same way you would if you were reading dialogue from a cue card. There’s every chance that this isn’t the case, of course, but that’s how it looks. We’ve seen great actors do this sort of thing before, of course. Nicolas Cage spent a decade and a half saying yes to everything, putting his name to work that was beneath him, because he was in dire financial straits. More troublingly, the last years of Bruce Willis’s career were littered with remote, checked-out cameos in several films too unscrupulous to care about his increasingly evident frontotemporal dementia. The upcoming projects listed on Hopkins’s IMDb page don’t suggest that Mary is a one-off either. Of the five films he has lined up, only one – a Handel biopic – seems to have much in the way of prestige. The others include a film about the Maserati family, an Island of Dr Moreau reimagining and an Antarctic thriller called Bruno Penguin and the Staten Island Princess. Again, this isn’t to say that Hopkins is broke or unwell. Maybe he simply saw Herod as a meaty, weighty role that only an actor of his calibre could play. Maybe he’s friends with someone involved in production. Maybe he just really likes Christmas and saw Mary as a strategic lateral move that would help him get cast in Hot Frosty 2. We may never know the answer. Whatever the reason, though, it’s unlikely that Hopkins will star in a Mary sequel, since – and this is a spoiler alert, since it deviates quite dramatically from the source material – the birth of Jesus Christ appears to make him die of a heart attack instantly. Which may not be the case, it might simply be a combination of over-egged acting and bad editing. But if he did die, it’s probably a good thing. It means we can all draw a line under Mary, forget it ever happened and keep thinking of Hopkins as someone who makes good films. • Mary is out now on Netflix"

          "bodyText": "‘You lack both beauty and talent. Your intellect is annoying. The only thing you have is your name.” That’s the skinny, delivered by her own mother, on future Polish ecologist hero Simona Kossak, who died in 2007. The pigtailed pioneer is an unlikely subject for a pithy and unexpectedly appealing biopic, carried by a charismatic performance from Sandra Drzymalska (previously seen in Jerzy Skolimowski’s donkey odyssey EO). It even manages to make studying the foraging habits of the European roe deer seem vaguely rock’n’roll. Having several generations of famous painters and writers behind her, the Kossak name is a heavy load for Simona to carry. But with the family living on the bohemian fringes of communist Poland, she rejects all that to conduct zoological studies in the Białowieża forest. Assigned to research roe deer while living in a remote lodge, she initially believes she has an ally in her supervisor Batura (Borys Szyc). But this primeval ecosystem is under threat from loggers, so she finds herself under pressure to falsify that the animals are eating the new pine saplings used during replantation – thus justifying a nationwide cull. Try pitching that to Netflix as your main dramatic conflict. But director Adrian Panek keeps this a pacy affair, each scene getting to the point as sharply as a protagonist who tells an all-male academic board that they’re displaying the same frivolous “cooing and chirping” as the horny goldfish in her experiment. Navigating institutional sexism, as well as the everyday chauvinism of Lech (Jakub Gierszał), the hunky forester she shacks up with, Drzymalska makes Kossak an admirably independent and cool geek; a able practitioner of the knowing smile and the Paddington hard stare. It’s bit of a shame that, as it slips into the grooves of the issue movie, the drama doesn’t entirely let Drzymalska off the leash to explore her character’s more feral aspects. “I’d like to penetrate him,” she says of Lech to the local witch, prior to a closeup of her gouging out a mossy tree stump with her hand. But Panek, shooting the woods with spectral beauty, ensures his manifesto is filled with pungent and heady substance. With loggers still circling east Europe’s virgin forests, hopefully this smart biopic will work as a reminder of what Kossak fought for. • Simona Kossak is in UK cinemas from 13 December."

          "bodyText": "This year is now almost certain to be the hottest year on record, data shows. It will also be the first to have an average temperature of more than 1.5C above preindustrial levels, marking a further escalation of the climate crisis. Data for November from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) found the average global surface temperature for the month was 1.62C above the level before the mass burning of fossil fuels drove up global heating. With data for 11 months of 2024 now available, scientists said the average for the year is expected to be 1.60C, exceeding the record set in 2023 of 1.48C. Samantha Burgess, the deputy director of C3S, said: “We can now confirm with virtual certainty that 2024 will be the warmest year on record and the first calendar year above 1.5C. This does not mean that the Paris agreement has been breached, but it does mean ambitious climate action is more urgent than ever.” The Paris climate agreement commits the 196 signatories to keeping global heating to below 1.5C in order to limit the impact of climate disasters. But this is measured over a decade or two, not a single year. Nonetheless, the likelihood of keeping below the 1.5C limit even over the longer term appears increasingly remote. The CO2 emissions heating the planet are expected to keep rising in 2024, despite a global pledge made in late 2023 to “transition away from fossil fuels”. Fossil fuel emissions must fall by 45% by 2030 to have a chance of limiting heating to 1.5C. The recent Cop29 climate summit failed to reach an agreement on how to push ahead on the transition away from coal, oil and gas. The C3S data showed that November 2024 was the 16th month in a 17-month period for which the average temperature exceeded 1.5C. The supercharging of extreme weather by the climate crisis is already clear, with heatwaves of previously impossible intensity and frequency now striking around the world, along with fiercer storms and worse floods. Particularly intense wildfires blazed in North and South America in 2024, the EU’s Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (Cams) reported last week. The fires, driven by severe droughts, affected the western US, Canada, the Amazon forest and particularly the Pantanal wetlands. Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at Cams, said: “The scale of some of the fires in 2024 were at historic levels, especially in Bolivia, the Pantanal and parts of the Amazon. Canadian wildfires were again extreme although not at the record scale of 2023.” The fires caused high levels of air pollution across continents for weeks, he said. The economic damage caused by extreme weather is rising, according to the research institute of insurance firm Swiss Re. Its data found that estimated economic losses in 2024 rose by 6% to $320bn, a figure 25% higher than the average over the previous 10 years. Hurricanes Helene and Milton and more severe thunderstorms in the US, as well as floods in Europe and the UAE, contributed to insured losses. But less than half the losses across the world were covered by insurance as poorer people were unable to afford the premiums. “Losses are likely to increase as climate change intensifies extreme weather events, while asset values increase in high-risk areas due to urban sprawl. Adaptation is therefore key, and protective measures, such as dykes, dams and flood gates, are up to 10 times more cost-effective than rebuilding,” Swiss Re said."

          "bodyText": "There is no better antidote to the problems of everyday life than a thriller: losing yourself in whodunnit, why they dunnit (and how you might have done it in their situation) is the perfect escape. Here are my favourite reads of the year, with something for everyone, whether you want to be terrified, amused or just wowed by fabulous writing. Guide Me Home by Attica Locke (Viper) This is the final instalment in the excellent Highway 59 series, starring Darren Mathews, one of the few black Texas Rangers. Or at least he was a Texas Ranger: having recently quit his job, he is drinking far too heavily until his mother asks him for help tracking down a missing girl. Locke’s writing is absolutely on fire, simmering with tension, and this series is not to be missed. Nightwatching by Tracy Sierra (Penguin) I rarely revisit books (apart from my old Stephen Kings and Mary Stewarts), so the fact I’ve read this utterly terrifying debut thriller twice this year says something for its brilliance. It starts with a simple premise. A woman, alone with her children in her remote house at night, wakes to realise someone is on the stairs. It’s hard to believe Sierra can spin a whole novel out of this, but she does, and it is nail-bitingly awesome. Has Anyone Seen Charlotte Salter? by Nicci French (Simon &amp; Schuster) Thirty years ago, Charlotte Salter, a wife and mother, disappeared just before her husband Alec’s 50th birthday party. The truth about what happened to her has never been uncovered, and now two old friends of her children are making a podcast about her disappearance. Nicci French is the pseudonym of a husband-and-wife writing duo who are at the top of their game here as they slowly reveal what might drive a perfectly ordinary person to murder. Bonehead by Mo Hayder (Hodder &amp; Stoughton) Talking about rereading, the late Mo Hayder is an author I go back to – when I’m feeling brave enough, because her thrillers are genuinely disturbing. Bonehead is a surprise final novel (Hayder died in 2021), and it brings with it the chills only Hayder can. It follows a police officer, Alex, as she tries to get to the truth behind a local legend about a skeletal woman, known as the Bonehead, who brings bad luck with her. We Solve Murders by Richard Osman (Penguin) You can’t beat snuggling up for some cosy comedy crime with Richard Osman, and this first novel in a new, non-Thursday Murder Club series is just the ticket. It follows the peripatetic travails of private security officer Amy, who is protecting bestselling novelist Rosie D’Antonio when she finds herself the target of a hitman. Cue all sorts of shenanigans, also involving her adorable widower father-in-law Steve. As delightful and light-hearted as ever. One for my stocking I love creepy stories set on islands, and I love The Girl on the Train author Paula Hawkins, so I’m surprised I haven’t got round to reading The Blue Hour yet . All the better for me though – if I drop enough hints I may end up with it under the Christmas tree and can spend the rest of the day reading. Published by Transworld, it is set on the tidal Scottish island of Eris, once the home of a famous artist whose husband disappeared – and whose work has now been found to contain a human bone… • To browse all of the books in the Observer and Guardian’s best crime and thrillers of 2024 visit guardianbookshop.com.

          "bodyText": "Valdemar Postanovicz was at home after a day tending to his tobacco crop when his limbs seized up. “All of the right side of my body was paralysed. I couldn’t feel my foot and my hand. My mouth twisted to the right,” he says. He feared it was a stroke. In fact, he was suffering symptoms of acute pesticide poisoning. Postanovicz, 45, had absorbed Reglone, a powerful herbicide based on the chemical diquat. “It was only one time in my life, but I felt so sick,” he says. Postanovicz lives in Paraná, southern Brazil – the country’s agricultural heartland. But his accidental poisoning can be traced more than 6,000 miles from South America to Britain, where there is a high chance the pesticide was made. Records obtained under freedom of information laws by Unearthed, Greenpeace’s investigative unit, and the NGO Public Eye reveal that despite a ban on their use in the UK, diquat and other toxic pesticides are being legally exported around the world – with large volumes going to developing countries. Last year, 8,489 tonnes of chemicals banned on British farms due to health and environmental concerns were sent abroad, according to export data shared with the Observer. Of those, 98% were made by the Chinese-owned, Swiss-headquartered chemical company Syngenta. The biggest export was diquat – of which Brazil is one of the world’s leading consumers. The weedkiller, made at only a few factories around the world, including Sygenta’s plant in Huddersfield, is a close chemical cousin of paraquat, which has been banned in Britain since 2008 and is the subject of class action lawsuits in the US and Canada, where farmers allege it left them suffering health problems including Parkinson’s. Syngenta, which reported £32.2bn of sales in 2023, disputes the claim and says its products are safe when used according to instructions. Diquat is generally considered less toxic than paraquat, but can still be extremely harmful: exposure can lead to blindness, vomiting, irritation, convulsions, organ damage and even death. It has been banned on EU farms since 2019 and British farms since 2020, after experts concluded it posed a high risk to workers, people living nearby and birds. Yet a legal loophole allows Syngenta to keep making the weedkiller in UK factories, for export to countries with weaker regulations. Diquat exports by Syngenta reached 5,123 tonnes in 2023, more than half of that to Brazil. In total, the UK exported pesticides containing 10 banned chemicals to 18 countries last year, including products considered highly toxic to bees and those with high potential for groundwater contamination. The figures have prompted calls for an end to exports of pesticides banned in Britain, which campaigners and health experts described as exploitative and unethical. Syngenta rejected the allegation, saying: “It is neither exploitative or unethical to provide products where the government and regulatory agencies of the importing country have provided express permission for the import and have directed and regulated use of those products within the specific agricultural context of that country.” A spokesperson said agricultural needs differed worldwide and that exports of all products were in line with all laws and global treaties. They said the company put “considerable effort” into ensuring safe use of its products, including tamper-proof bottles and closed transfer systems, and that every year it gave safety training to “hundreds of thousands of people”. They said herbicides like diquat were “essential tools”’ for farmers wanting to boost productivity and implement low or no-till practices, which help reduce carbon emissions – and that blocking access encouraged a counterfeit market. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the UK went “beyond the international standard” by requiring consent from importing countries, enabling them to make “informed decisions”. “This government is committed to protecting human health and the environment from the risks posed by chemicals,” a spokesperson said. But Dr Marcos Orellana, the UN special rapporteur on toxics and human rights, said exporting banned pesticides to the developing world was a form of “modern-day exploitation”. He accused the UK of allowing the production for export of “hazardous pesticides that subject countless people who are exposed to them, mainly poor workers in the fields of the global south” to “illness and grave suffering”. “It seems that for countries that produce and export banned pesticides, the life and health of people in recipient countries is not as important as their own citizens,” he said. Other countries, including France and Belgium, have already taken action to prohibit the export of banned pesticides. In October, six member states publicly backed an EU-wide prohibition on banned chemical exports. Asked whether the UK would follow suit, Defra did not respond. Siân Berry, Green Party MP for Brighton Pavillion, said: “It’s beyond belief that this is apparently happening lawfully.” Doug Parr, chief scientist at Greenpeace, described the exports as “double standards”. He disputed Syngenta’s claim that diquat was helping tackle climate change, saying the chemical – like paraquat – “hammers the land and biodiversity … to produce commodity crops for export”. Research by the Pesticide Action Network has found there are alternatives to toxic pesticides, including living mulches, controlled grazing, mechanical weeding and thermal weeding, as well as alternative synthetic products. “This is intensive, not sustainable, agriculture,” Parr said. Back in Brazil, some experts are warning of public health concerns. Last year was the first that diquat exports from Britain exceeded those of paraquat, after Brazil’s government banned paraquat in 2020 over health fears. Since then, the country’s use of diquat has surged – from 1,400 tonnes in 2019 to 24,000 tonnes in 2022. Data suggests that as diquat usage has increased, accidental poisonings have risen. Between 2018 and 2021, the state of Paraná – one of the biggest consumers of diquat – recorded one to three cases annually. This jumped to six in 2022 and to nine in 2023, according to data obtained by Unearthed. Marcelo de Souza Furtado from the Paraná health department, who tracks poisonings in the state, said the official numbers reflected a “small parcel of reality”, with many cases unreported due to lack of access to healthcare in remote areas or fear of reprisals from employers. But he said the pesticides problem was “big”. He first noticed last year that notifications of diquat poisoning were overtaking paraquat. Of the 36 diquat cases recorded nationally by Brazil’s health ministry between 2018 and 2022, Syngenta’s product Reglone was cited in 83% of cases. “We’re worried,” Furtado said. “If it’s already been banned in other countries, then that already shows that it has a very toxic effect.” Syngenta recommends that those using its products wear PPE, including coveralls, boots, gloves, a cap, an apron, goggles, and respiratory protection. But in reality, Furtado said many farmers were not aware of its importance – with heat and humidity making consistent use difficult. Even for those wearing PPE, usage still carries risks. In one modelled scenario using tractor-mounted equipment, a 2014 European Food Safety Authority review found that worker exposure for those wearing coveralls, gloves and boots could still exceed the maximum acceptable level by 350%. While Postanovicz recovered from his exposure in 2021, he believes others should know the dangers. “It is a really strong product. If it touches the tobacco plant, it kills it,” he said. When he used it he says he wore protective trousers, boots, and gloves, but omitted the visor. “When we breathe it blurs and we can’t see correctly,” he said. “It is dangerous: we can stumble and get hurt.” He says his symptoms began after he had finished work and showered. His vision blurred, his right leg and arm went numb, and tremors shook his right hand. Even now, the smell of Reglone triggers a visceral reaction. “I hate it,” he says. “I can feel if someone is using it far from here.” Additional reporting: Naira Hofmeister"

          "headline": "The most dangerous delivery truck? How a lorry-load of antimatter will help solve secrets of universe",
          "bodyText": "Researchers are preparing to make one of science’s most unusual journeys. They are planning to transport a container of antimatter in a lorry across Europe. Antimatter is the most expensive material on Earth – it’s estimated it would cost several trillion dollars to make a gram – and it can only be manufactured in particle physics laboratories such as the Cern research centre near Geneva. It is also extremely tricky to handle. If antimatter makes contact with normal matter, both are annihilated, releasing a powerful burst of electromagnetic radiation. Only by carefully combining sets of powerful electrical and magnetic fields in special devices can antimatter be stored safely. “That makes moving it around very difficult, though we are now close to making our first journey,” said Prof Stefan Ulmer, a scientist at Cern. “Antimatter has so much to tell us. That is why we are doing this.” Moving the antimatter will be a scientific first, though it has a fictional precursor. In Dan Brown’s thriller Angels &amp; Demons – made into a film starring Tom Hanks in 2009 – terrorists steal a canister of antimatter from Cern and try to obliterate the Vatican with it. The prospect of a similar blast happening in real life is remote, scientists insist – the quantities of antimatter carried will be insufficient to make an explosion of any recognisable nature. Scientists want to study the particles as they believe they may hold the solution to a fundamental mystery. “We believe the big bang produced the same amounts of matter and antimatter,” said Ulmer. “These should have annihilated each other, leaving a universe made of electromagnetic radiation and not much else.” That the cosmos seems to be filled with galaxies, stars, planets and living beings made of matter shows this notion must be wrong. There is a basic asymmetry that has favoured matter and stopped the universe from becoming a simmering, empty void. For this reason, physicists want to study the differences between the particles that make up matter and antimatter. These might provide clues about why the former has come to dominate the universe. As the Cern scientist Barbara Maria Latacz told Nature: “We are trying to understand why we exist.” Matter is made up of subatomic particles such as protons and electrons, while antimatter consists of particles that include antiprotons and positrons (as antielectrons are also known). A key source of the latter type of particle is based at Cern in a device known as the Antiproton Decelerator, where antiprotons are generated, collected and studied. The aim is to measure precisely the properties of antiprotons and compare them with protons. Known as the Base experiment, it could reveal tiny hidden differences that would explain why matter has thrived at the expense of antimatter. Background magnetic fields near the device are limiting this work, and scientists want to transport samples to other labs. “By moving them to a new location, we can make measurements that are 100 times more accurate and get a deeper understanding of antiprotons,” said Ulmer. To achieve this goal, Cern scientists have built transportable devices containing superconducting magnets, cryogenic cooling systems and vacuum chambers where antiprotons can be trapped, avoiding contact with normal matter, and carried on seven-tonne lorries. Initially, antiprotons will be transported within Cern. Over the next year, containers will be moved further afield to a dedicated precision lab at the Heinrich Heine University Düsseldorf. “In the long term, we want to transport it to any lab in Europe,” said Christian Smorra, leader of the transport project. In this way, scientists hope to find why antimatter all but vanished from the universe. “This could be a gamechanger,” said Ulmer."

          "headline": "‘Alarm bells’: why are Australian boys doing better than girls in maths and science?",
          "bodyText": "When Dr Joanna Sikora saw the gender disparity between boys and girls in maths and science subjects in a report this week, it wasn’t the gaps in year 8 that shocked her. Sure, the girls in that year had gone backwards on the 2019 results of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timss), while the skills of boys remained steady and improved. But it’s the gap at earlier stages of schooling – in year 4 – that really caused the sociology researcher from the Australian National University (ANU) the most concern. “I would ring alarm bells … because small differences that are growing have the capacity to become big differences,” Sikora says. The Timss report, published on behalf of the commonwealth by the Australian Council for Educational Research, analysed the skills of year 4 and 8 students. It found Australian primary school students recorded their best ever results. But for the first time there was a gender gap in favour of boys across both maths and science in both years 4 and 8, at the same time programs have been rolled out to bridge Australia’s Stem crisis. Internationally Australia recorded the equal-widest gender gap alongside France in year 4 maths achievement. About 76% of males were above the national proficient standard, compared with just 68% of girls, while there were also more very high performers (17% compared with 10%). The lead author of the report, Nicole Wernert, said the differences were primarily due to a significantly higher percentage of male students being very high performers. But she says the slide for girls in year 8 is concerning. “It’s a warning line that suggests we need to start paying attention,” she said. Challenge to rewrite the narrative According to Sikora, fewer than 2% of Australian mothers to teenage boys worked in engineering or similar occupations. Fewer than 2% of Australian teenage boys sought careers in teaching. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Sikora says the persistence of the gender gap in science and mathematics needed to be viewed in big picture terms – which were cultural rather than biological. “We all feel we’re unique individuals and tend to do what other people like us do,” she says. “There are things boys and girls feel they are good at, and they specialise in what they believe they enjoy – which reflect gender stereotypes, but are part of the ideology of supporting individual choices.” She points to data showing nearly one-third of girls in New South Wales are opting out of mathematics in year 11 and 12, but are more likely to dominate humanities and social science subjects. “The narrative of education [in the west] is about enjoyment, because we believe if they don’t enjoy it they can’t learn,” she says. “Kids will do what the culture is guiding them to do.” So Sikora points to a country like India, which has a high proportion of women excelling in Stem subjects such as nuclear physics, as an example of what a different education system may look like. The challenge, Sikora says, is to rewrite narratives of science and maths as a “boring and difficult” pursuit to something that benefits humankind. There’s also the need to change social discourse suggesting “girls don’t do science and maths”, according to Dr Steven Lewis at the Australian Catholic University’s Institute for Learning Sciences and Teacher Education. “There’s been attempts to redress that, but while teaching is still highly skewed towards women, science and maths is overrepresented by male teachers,” he says. “At the same time, Stem subjects in primary and high school require discipline-specific knowledge from the teacher, and we’re seeing an out-of-field teaching effect, particularly in hard to staff positions around rural and remote Australia. “That creates larger classes or teachers without discipline-specific knowledge, which has a compounding effect. The gendered approaches to subjects and degrees reflect the conditions students experience at school.” ‘The elephant in the room is disadvantage’ Lewis also says the more important disparities were among low socioeconomic students and affluent students – particularly in regional and rural areas. “A year 4 girl is much closer to year 4 boy, if you’re comparing a metropolitan school or an advantaged background to a rural community in the NT,” he says. “Our top performing students perform very well but we have a very long tail of underperformance. The elephant in the room is disadvantage.” The director of the Stem Teacher Enrichment Academy at the University of Sydney, Prof Manjula Sharma, agrees. She says Australia had come out “well placed” in the Timss results, but persistent inequities remained. There were some caveats – English as a Second Language speakers showed no statistical difference from their counterparts, suggesting efforts to boost outcomes were working well. “It reaches a point that it’s a self-fulfilling prophesy … have we reached the stage where there’s so much attention [on girls] it’s self-inhibiting?” she says. A study released last year found female scientists were almost entirely omitted from the Australian curriculum, with researchers warning the “alarming” lack of representation could be contributing to the gender gap in the field of Stem. “We have a big emphasis on measuring impact, and it is important, but if that boils down to counting numbers [of participants] we’re doing a disservice,” Sharma says. “We need to shift societal attitudes, ask the experiences are of students, and move towards a balanced approach. “What we want is boys numbers to go up as well as the girls – if we have programs, we should have physics for everyone and some specialised programs for girls, so we’re increasing total participation numbers.”"

          "bodyText": "Dr Huw Lewis-Jones is an expedition leader across the polar regions. The academic, who teaches at Falmouth University in Cornwall, has now travelled to the north pole 12 times, and this photo was taken in 2018, “high in the Arctic Ocean, north of the Franz Josef Land archipelago, in the frozen pack ice”. The polar bear Lewis-Jones captured with his iPhone 7 was searching for seals, which haul themselves out on to the floe or come up in the breathing holes. The bear was checking out their ship, too: “They’re often really curious. This beautiful animal stayed with us for over an hour.” Lewis-Jones uses his iPhone as a sketchbook on his expeditions, close to and far from home. “It’s ideal for recording memories and insights, which later fuel the writing of my books when I’ve left the ice behind,” he says. “And when I’m actually driving the boat, it’s a helpful camera for a quick shot.” Reflecting on his image several years later makes him pine to be back. “I feel like I thrive up there,” he says. “The Arctic has been a part of my life for decades. It’s a pleasure and a privilege to be out in these difficult environments. These days I spend much of my time teaching and writing, but I’m still lucky enough to lead voyages each year. Whether they’re to find seabirds, remote islands, polar bears or simply see the wilderness of ice, it’s all a kind of magic to me.”"

          "headline": "NSW’s new intercity trains look shiny and smell fresh – but speeds remain stuck in the 20th century",
          "bodyText": "The new Mariyung fleet that entered service in New South Wales this week is the first refresh of the state’s intercity trains in almost two decades. The rolling stock update cost more than $4bn and the trains arrived in the state in 2019. But their debut on routes such as Sydney-Newcastle, and soon on the Blue Mountains and South Coast lines, was delayed by five years due to a number of issues, including concerns they were too wide, technical disputes and modification works demanded by unions that cost $1bn. Now, the years-long wait is over. So how do the new trains stack up? Shiny and fresh Arriving at the country departures hall at Central station, the new Mariyung fleet looks shinier and fresher than its tired and blackened intercity predecessor on neighbouring platforms. Digital screens on the outside of each carriage display trip information – a sign of the technological leap forward. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Onboard, the carriages are a pleasant temperature. They are well air-conditioned despite the heat of the day. But not chilly. They feel clean and new (because, of course, they are). This is noteworthy because train rides on intercity routes in NSW have been starved of that fresh “new-train smell” for decades, with most commuters stuck on 1970s rolling stock. Seats on the new Mariyung are configured two by two with an aisle down the middle. There are upper and lower decks, as Sydney metropolitan passengers have become accustomed to in recent decades. While the seats don’t flip to face in either direction – an iconic feature of Sydney’s double-decker city trains – they have tray tables that fold down. More importantly, the seats are comfortable, have decent headrests and are spacious enough that my knees – as a 6ft 2in-ish man – don’t get crunched up. They’re also relatively lean and without too much bulk underneath, meaning it’s easy to stretch your legs out under the seat in front. It’s certainly more comfortable than the average economy seat on a domestic flight. Perhaps, the most impressive technological leap onboard is the charging facilities at each seat. While passengers must share an outlet with their neighbour, each double seat has a USB-A and conventional wall plug socket. The USB charging speed, while not fast, means you won’t deplete your phone’s battery on an hours-long trip. This charging capability, coupled with the tray tables, makes taking out a laptop and getting work done on intercity trips more feasible. However, some shortcomings make the Mariyung seats far from a comfortable remote office. The tray tables are at a slightly strange angle for typing and looking at your screen – especially if you’re on the taller side. And, more crucially, despite the modernity of these trains being hailed by successive governments, there’s no onboard wifi. Instead, you’ll need to hotspot off your phone. And while reception is generally better on this fleet – avoiding the metal cage Faraday effect that eliminated reception inside older intercity train carriages in NSW – there are still blackspots between Sydney and Newcastle. (The other routes, west over the Blue Mountains and south through Wollongong, are due to start running Mariyung trains in the coming months.) The wifi situation is far from ideal. However, there are plenty of other positives. The Mariyung trains are quieter – something you really notice in the designated “quiet” carriages. Special areas to stow suitcases, luggage and bikes are welcome, as are the relatively spacious bathrooms with sensor taps. The toilets were clean and comfortable when I travelled this week. However, there were fast food wrappings left inside one, and less than a day after the trains entered service, photos shared online showed graffitied toilet seats. Not revolutionary Ultimately, while the new Mariyung trains make for a much more pleasant trip, they don’t feel revolutionary like the Sydney Metro that opened in August does. That initiative has genuinely changed lives by allowing people to move more easily and swiftly across the city. The metro also offered a glimpse into the future of train travel, with its grand stations and speedier trips, whereas the Mariyung’s charging outlets and modern fit-outs are more about catching up to what has become standard on intercity trains elsewhere. The new intercity trains also don’t shave any time off the roughly 2.5-hour journey between Sydney and Newcastle – even on the express run. Speeds across much of regional NSW are firmly stuck in the 20th century. Indeed, a non-stop Sydney to Newcastle service about 100 years ago, the Newcastle Flyer, completed the trip in just over two hours. So, despite the modern trimmings, the Mariyung trains don’t feel like a huge leap forward. The billions could have been spent upgrading tracks to allow for more express services with fewer stops. That would deliver time savings. For those wanting a significantly faster trip, hopes lie in the federal government’s current high-speed rail project, but the wait for that could be decades, not years. • This story was amended on 7 December 2024. A previous version incorrectly stated that the Mariyung trains were engines."

          "bodyText": "It took more than 40 years before Alison Ruby felt able to tell police about the man who had peeled off her school tights and stolen her childhood. Ruby told detectives that, from the age of 12, an antique dealer named Richard Craig had regularly enticed her into his home during the school day to rape her in his bed. When she walked into Aylesbury police station in 2019, she never imagined that court delays would mean she was forced to wait a further five years for a trial – or that Craig would not live long enough to make it into the dock. Ruby had been introduced to Craig by his younger brother, Tony Craig, a sports car salesman who lived next door to a schoolfriend, Justine Clareboets, in the village of Stone, near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire. Tony Craig groomed the girls from the age of nine and 10, luring them over his fence with exotic pets and money for the local shop. As time went on, he took them to his brother’s house in Aylesbury, where the brothers abused them while watching pornography. “They made us feel like it was normal,” Ruby said, waiving her right to anonymity to speak out about the justice system. “Obviously we were groomed. The pair of them were very clever.” On 1 November this year, Tony Craig, by then 74, was jailed for 21 years for the rape and sexual abuse of Ruby and her schoolfriend when they were children in the late 1970s and early 80s. Richard Craig should have stood trial alongside his brother but he did not live long enough. Sentencing Tony Craig, Judge Sheridan said he also faced culpability for introducing his victims to his brother. Though the brother himself never stood trial, the judge’s remarks made clear that the women’s testimony about Richard Craig had been believed. Ruby said: “I used to skive off school, go around his [Richard Craig’s] house, and he’d lay me on his bed, take my tights and knickers off and have sex with me. And I’d just lay there.” At first, justice seemed to move relatively quickly. Richard Craig was charged jointly with his brother in 2020 for a catalogue of sexual crimes. But Ruby, 56, was unaware of the crisis unfolding in the courts as she waited for the brothers’ trial. The pandemic delayed the initial hearing and that was just the beginning. No courtroom was available for the first trial date in February 2022 and another set for November that year was cancelled because of the barristers’ strike. As time dragged on, key witnesses started to disappear. An ex-husband who Ruby had disclosed the abuse to died and other traumatised witnesses melted away, no longer willing to take part. In April last year, Ruby was in hospital helping a friend through cancer treatment when she got a call from a detective. Richard Craig had died of a heart attack. “I was angry that he’d got away with it because the process had taken so long,” she said. “If they’d have done it sooner, he would have at least been punished for a little while. He got away scot-free.” Richard Craig had denied the charges but the one consolation after he died was that his brother, who had first groomed and abused Ruby, and who was Justine Clareboets’s primary abuser, would still stand trial. Then in September last year, weeks before his trial was due to start, Tony Craig made an application to the court. He claimed he now had dementia and was unfit to stand. Days later, it emerged that no judge was available and the trial was delayed for another year. It looked like justice might never happen. Ruby said: “You think, ‘Oh, my God, when is this ever going to end?’ It’s bad enough having to sit in a room and talk to a stranger for five hours on a video and tell them a lot of personal things, without having to wait to actually go to court and be delayed by not just a week or so, but by a year. That happened twice.” In September this year, as the trial approached, she and Clareboets got a call to say it was being postponed for several more weeks. Clareboets, who has also waived her right to anonymity, said: “It made me feel like it wasn’t worthy of being dealt with, that it was so unimportant, it could just drag on for this amount of time. It made me feel like I was, in a way, making a fuss, because no one was prepared to deal with it really effectively. “Because they were on bail and they weren’t taking up prison space, it was deemed as less of a priority.” When Ruby heard about the final delay, she very nearly pulled out altogether. “I said if this happens again, I’m not doing it. I’ve had enough now, because you prepare yourself as much as you can, and then for them to say: ‘no, it’s not happening’ – you’ve got to start all over again.” Collette Parker, the investigating officer on the case at Thames Valley police, was horrified by the constant court setbacks and their impact on the women. “The delays were hideous,” she said. “I did feel it had huge repercussions for the victims who were trying to move on with their lives.” Parker was the one breaking the news of all the delays and, after eight years specialising in child abuse investigations, the stress of supporting victims through relentless court setbacks pushed her to leave the unit and work elsewhere. “It all got too much,” she said. Tony Craig’s attempt to claim in court that dementia made him unfit to stand trial was one of the hardest updates for Parker to convey. If he was found to be mentally unfit to plead then he would be unlikely to face a prison sentence, even if a jury found that he had committed the crimes. Clareboets said: “I was really worried that I would have gone through it all, waited all of this time and everything, that it was just going to be cut off, and there’d have been no justice at all, really.” While the court considered the medical evidence presented by Craig, he travelled to the Philippines. In a pre-trial hearing, he made detailed notes and passed them to his barrister. The judge saw it for what it was, saying in his summing up that Craig’s argument that he was mentally impaired showed he was prepared to con – and that the jury had seen through this. After a two-week trial in October, a jury at Aylesbury crown court returned a unanimous verdict, finding Craig guilty of 13 counts of rape and sexual abuse against Clareboets, Ruby and another victim. Signs of their attacker’s paedophilia had long been hiding in plain sight. In 1995, he and his wife had advertised in the Times that they wanted to start a paradise island community where “children could roam free”. A Channel 4 documentary was made about the scheme, following Craig and his wife and son as they went to Panama and tried to recruit families to put in £150,000 to buy a remote island with him. Over a recruitment tea in a British garden, one of the mothers could be heard saying: “In a safe, caring community, I mean you know your child is going to be well looked after.” The documentary ends with the discovery that Craig had recently stood trial, accused of sexually abusing a child. Though he was acquitted in that case, his paradise island plan collapsed. When the documentary came out in 1996, Ruby and Clareboets remember being horrified. But it was not until Clareboets’s father was terminally ill in 2019 that she felt able to go to the police. Soon Ruby was speaking to officers too. Clareboets, now 56, had been scared that her father would hear of it and get himself in trouble. “I think he would’ve probably murdered him or something like that,” she said. Her father’s mortality was also a reminder that her abuser would not live forever. “He was a similar age to Mr Craig and I just thought he could possibly die and go unpunished. I always intended to do it, it’s just the time was never right.” But once she reported him, she had no idea of the long wait that lay before her. “It’s just been such torture because it’s gone on so long and I’ve geared myself up for so many different trials, and we’ve almost got there and then to be deflated,” she said. Five years later, the women have one of their attackers in prison, but they are still bearing the scars of the process. Ruby said: “Five years is a long time to take out of your life. It’s the thinking about it for all that time. It’s bad enough I’ve had it for the last 40-odd years without that adding to it.” A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said the government inherited a system in crisis but is committed to delivering swifter justice. For Clareboets, the waiting has only added to the damage done by Tony Craig. “I’ve had weeks, really, of building myself up, psyching myself up, getting my head space right, and then, to be let down every time. That’s been really difficult. “And obviously talking about it time and time again, and the more I talk about it, the more things I would remember. And it’s just been everything: sleepless nights, anxiety, all sorts of things.” Clareboets cannot help wondering what the last four years might have been like if the trial had happened within a year. “I could have had maybe four more years of my life as happier years,” she said. “Instead I feel like I’ve had four torturous years full of anxiety and uncertainty.”"

          "headline": "Jimmy Kimmel on Pete Hegseth: ‘Not even remotely qualified to be secretary of defense’",
          "bodyText": "Late-night hosts talk the many scandals surrounding Pete Hegseth, Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” and Joe Biden’s potential preemptive pardons. Jimmy Kimmel It’s been a week of damaging stories about Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of defense, and Jimmy Kimmel dug into him more on Thursday evening after numerous reports of sexual misconduct and unprofessional drunken behavior. Hegseth was on Capitol Hill this week to defend his nomination and answer lawmakers’ and reporters’ questions. Asked by a reporter what Trump made of the allegations, Hegseth said, “He’s behind us all the way. I spoke to him this morning,” then awkwardly looked away from the camera. “Something tells me that might be the last time you speak to the president,” said Kimmel. “Something tells me we might be able to get Pete Hegseth Cameo videos for Christmas this year.” Hegseth, a military veteran turned former Fox &amp; Friends host, was “not even remotely qualified to be secretary of defense”, Kimmel noted. “We’ve already forgotten about” other allegations, he continued, such as that Hegseth raped a woman he met at a bar in 2017. Hegseth allegedly paid a settlement to the woman, who signed an NDA that Republican supporters now want enforced. “You wouldn’t hire someone to walk your dog if they paid a woman to be quiet about a rape,” Kimmel said. The host also touched on Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy’s so-called “department of government efficiency”, or Doge. Though appointed by Trump, the new department “has no power to make laws, cut budget or do anything”, Kimmel explained. “It’s like when you’re a kid and you visit the cockpit, you get a set of wings. It doesn’t mean you get to fly the plane.” Stephen Colbert On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped another report on Hegseth’s drunken behavior, this time at a 2016 Fox News Christmas party where complaints led to a human resources intervention. “The HR talking-to clearly didn’t work,” Colbert reported, because soon after, Hegseth attended the wedding of a Fox News colleague where he reportedly got so drunk that he struggled to stay upright in a bathroom. Friends asked a producer who was there to get him a ride home. “OK, finally, someone at Fox News who’s responsible … is what I would say if that sentence did not end with ‘so he could make it to the set by 6am’,” said Colbert. He imagined the logic: “This man is clearly too drunk to stand! Quick, get him to a couch and point a camera at him.” Hegseth has continued to pursue the nomination and dismiss the well-sourced reports as “the classic art of the smear”, as he said this week on Megyn Kelly’s radio show. He referred to the stories as “tiny, tiny kernels of truth” blown out of proportion. “Coincidentally, taking tiny kernels and blowing them up is exactly how I’ve been watching the drama around Pete Hegseth,” said Colbert, holding a bag of popcorn. The Daily Show And on The Daily Show, guest host Ronny Chieng noted that Joe Biden is reportedly weighing preemptive pardons for figures who have spoken out against Trump and who the president-elect has targeted, such as Adam Schiff and Anthony Fauci. But the White House is “carefully weighing the extraordinary step” of blanket pardons after outrage over his pardoning of son Hunter, both because preemptive pardons could suggest impropriety and because there is a chance those offered them will not accept. “Pardons are getting so confusing,” said Chieng. “I mean, it used to be that you had to commit a crime to be pardoned, but now Biden has to do this weird Minority Report pre-pardon thing where it’s like, ‘Hey, we know you didn’t do anything, but Trump thinks you did something so I’m going to pardon you for anything you did. Even though you didn’t do it. It’s what our founders would’ve wanted.’ “Also, who in their right mind would reject a presidential pardon?!” he exclaimed. “You want to go to jail? That’s where Diddy is!” Chieng joked that he would happily take any pardons others didn’t want. “Hand it over. I’ll probably need it if Donald Trump comes after me for political satire or speaking truth to power or opening a credit card in my roommate’s name.”"

          "headline": "Syrian insurgents close in on Homs as advance towards Damascus continues",
          "bodyText": "Syrian insurgents have entered towns north of the country’s third largest city, Homs, sweeping along a highway that eventually leads to the capital, Damascus, in a lightning-fast advance that has shaken the Middle East. Militants spearheaded by the group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) took control of the city of Hama on Thursday before moving south, swiftly capturing two key towns on the road south of the city before arriving in Al-Dar al-Kabera, a town five miles from the centre of Homs. The Syrian government also lost control of the symbolic southern city of Deraa and most of the eponymous province, which was the cradle of the country’s 2011 uprising, according to rebel sources and the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights Rebel fighters advanced into Deraa after reaching a deal to give army officials safe passage to the capital Damascus for the army’s orderly withdrawal. The Russian embassy in Damascus instructed Russian nationals to leave Syria, in a rare show of alarm. Moscow has remained a key ally of Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, including providing military support. Video from the opposition-aligned Aleppo Today channel showed airstrikes targeting Talbiseh on the road between Hama and Homs shortly after it was claimed by insurgents. The defence ministry in Damascus said Russian and Syrian military aircraft were responsible for airstrikes on the Hama countryside, while a strike attributed to forces from Moscow destroyed a bridge along the highway leading into Homs. Speaking to reporters outside a mosque in Istanbul, the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, offered a message of support to the insurgency. He had previously offered to “discuss shaping the future of Syria”, together with Assad, he said, “but we received no response”. “Idlib, Hama, Homs and after that most probably Damascus … we hope this march in Syria will continue without any issues,” he said. The foreign ministers of Turkey, Iran and Russia are expected to meet tomorrow on the sidelines of a forum in Doha for an urgent meeting on Syria. The city of Homs sits at a key juncture close to the Lebanese border, connecting the road to Damascus with a highway to the coastal communities, Assad’s heartland and a site of Russian naval bases. Homs witnessed some of the fiercest fighting during earlier phases of Syria’s civil war over a decade ago, with rebel forces engaged in years-long street battles the army and allied Syrian militia forces, as well as the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Insurgents have called for the people of Homs to rise up against the regime, telling them “your time has come” in a message circulated online, as thousands fled south to Damascus or west to the coastal province of Latakia. Lebanese officials said they had closed all but one of their border crossings into Syria, while Jordan also closed its one crossing for passengers and people into Syrian territory. Forces loyal to Damascus appeared to be in retreat across the country, with Assad increasingly losing his grip on major cities in Syria. In the eastern provincial capital of Deir ez-Zor, Reuters and the Turkish state news agency Anadolu reported that a US-backed coalition of Kurdish and local Arab forces had taken control of the city after Syrian government forces and Iran-backed militias withdrew. Video showed the coalition, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, driving military trucks through the centre of Deir ez-Zor. The Deir ez-Zor military council, an Arab-majority militia that fights with the SDF, said their fighters had deployed in the city and west of the Euphrates river “in order to protect our people” from Islamic state fighters and Turkish-backed rebel forces active in the area. Unrest also swept Suwayda province, which neighbours Deraa, with local media showing people climbing on top of tanks after Syrian army forces withdrew from a remote area north of the restive provincial capital. Video from the city of Suwayda, a place where protests against Assad’s rule have increased in recent years, showed people striking a poster with the president’s face and taking control of a local police station. Fighting to take Homs is expected to prove pivotal in the insurgents’ efforts to sweep south towards the capital. In little over a week their advance saw them rapidly take control of Aleppo, Syria’s second city, as well as full control of Hama after a rapid retreat by Syrian government forces. The unexpected advance marks the first time that both cities have been fully under opposition control since a popular uprising against Assad in 2011 then spilled over into a bloody civil war. In a rare late-night address, the Syrian defence minister, Ali Mahmoud Abbas, called his forces withdrawal from Hama a “temporary tactical measure”, and said his forces had “deployed to save lives”. The battle for Homs drew signs of further intervention from Damascus’s longtime allies, particularly Tehran and its proxy forces. Two senior Lebanese security sources told Reuters that Hezbollah had dispatched a small number of “supervising forces” to prevent the insurgents from seizing Homs. Israel said its forces stuck a border crossing between Lebanon and Syria on Friday, targeting what it said was a site used to transfer weapons to Hezbollah. A senior Iranian official said “it is likely that Tehran will need to send military equipment, missiles and drones to Syria ... Tehran has taken all necessary steps to increase number of its military advisers in Syria and deploy forces”. Tehran, which has been focussed on tensions with arch-foe Israel since the Gaza war began last year, began to evacuate its military officials and personnel from Syria on Friday, a sign of Iran’s inability to keep Assad in power, the New York Times reported, citing regional officials and three Iranian officials. The Iranian foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, held talks with his Iraqi and Syrian counterparts in Baghdad, as Iraqi ministers feared the fighting in Syria could affect their country. While Iraq’s foreign minister promised aid and increased diplomatic efforts, and Araghchi expressed Iran’s “message of support for the Syrian government and people” in facing the insurgency, the ministers offered little beyond statements of support to Damascus. The HTS leader known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, issued a message to the Iraqi prime minister, Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani, pledging that the fighting in Syria “will not spill over into Iraq”, and urging al-Sudani’s government to “distance itself from the situation in Syria”. Speaking to CNN, al-Jolani said the insurgents’ aim remains to topple the Assad regime in Damascus. “When we talk about objectives, the goal of the revolution remains the overthrow of this regime. It is our right to use all available means to achieve that goal,” he said."

          "bodyText": "When a major London art gallery is alerted to the presence of a human bone in one of its sculptures, the gallery contacts the artist’s representatives, who fly into panic mode. The sculpture, which features bones encased in glass presumed to have belonged to a deer, is the work of Vanessa Chapman, a reclusive artist who recently died. Chapman lived on Eris, a remote Scottish island with a single house on it, which is cut off from the mainland by the tide for 12 hours a day. To get to the bottom of the mystery – and to quell a possible scandal – James Becker, who runs the foundation responsible for Chapman’s work, is dispatched to Eris, which is now home to Grace, Chapman’s close friend and fierce protector of her legacy. Grace is meant to be sorting through Chapman’s belongings to determine what should go to the foundation, but seems curiously reluctant to part with them. Before travelling, Becker learns that Chapman’s estranged husband, a known philanderer, disappeared in odd circumstances decades earlier and is presumed dead. This latest thriller from The Girl on the Train author Paula Hawkins is a slow-burning affair where complex relationships and drip-fed secrets gradually build the tension. The Game of Thrones actor Gemma Whelan is the narrator, who goes a little overboard with the plummy accents of art world bigwigs, but who otherwise captures the clashing interests and inner complexities of Hawkins’ protagonists. The audiobook also includes a bonus conversation between Whelan and Hawkins in which they discuss the inspiration for the book’s characters and its unusual setting. • Available via Penguin Audio, 10hr 17min Further listening Nexus Yuval Noah Harari, Penguin Audio, 17hr 28 min Vidish Athavale narrates this history of information networks and the implications of AI from the author of Sapiens.

          "bodyText": "Its setting is remote, desolate, and windy. Its protagonist is a mercurial policeman struggling with his own personal demons. Its subject: a long-lost body found in a mountain bog. So far, so standard for a television crime drama. But there is something about Crá, a new BBC series that debuted last month, that makes it stand out from the crowd. It is written as Gaeilge, the first Irish language programme to get a prime-time slot on BBC Northern Ireland, and the latest in a small but growing genre of Gaelic noir, dramas that build on Ireland’s storytelling heritage and literary canon. “Everyone was interested in Scandi noir, but we have created a genre of our own right here: Gaelic noir with different elements,” said Ciarán Charles, the programme’s Connemara-born producer of Fíbín Films. “There is the storytelling, a Celtic composer and haunting soundtrack which people really seem to be responding to. It’s original and fresh.” Likened to an Irish take on the Coen brothers’ blackly comic crime series Fargo, Crá, which means “torment”, is set in the wilderness around Gweedore in Donegal, north-western Ireland. The six-part series combines a murder mystery with black humour with strong contemporary themes, including predatory behaviour and terrorism linked to the IRA across the border. Starring Dónáll Ó Héalai as the moody policeman who has to recuse himself from the investigation and Alex Murphy, who played the lead in TV comedy Young Offenders, the series was shot in January and started to air on BBC iPlayer on Sunday night and on BBC Northern Ireland in mid-November. Since then, it has become “the second most requested programme on iPlayer on BBC NI”, a spokesperson said, mimicking the success of two other homemade Irish language thrillers, Doineann (Stormy Weather) and An Bronntanas (The Gift). Giving the show a prime-time slot was still a gamble given that Irish is a minority language north and south of the border and most viewers need the subtitles. But Karen Kirby, BBC Gaeilge commissioning executive in Belfast, said it had paid off. There are hopes the drama will get a national network slot on BBC next year. “You might think that Irish language subtitles might put some people off, but with subtitles on social media posts, subtitles are second nature in some respects,” she said. “And people are getting hooked in. Scandi noir now has a rival in Gaelic noir. It’s a great term. It encapsulates that culture of storytelling but it’s got that depth of a thriller and a drama going on,” she said. The production received funding from the Northern Ireland Screen Irish language broadcast fund along with Screen Ireland, Dublin’s Coimisiún na Meán and the Galway media training body Gréasán na Meán Skillnet. But TG4 director general Alan Esslemont decried the lack of funding from Dublin. He blamed the Irish government’s “apathy” towards the Irish language, which, he said, persists even though Kneecap, the biopic of the Belfast hip-hop trio, and Oscar-nominated An Cailín Ciúin have proved there is a mainstream audience for the Irish language. “TG4 receives only half the public funding of S4C, our Welsh language sister channel, a reflection of the profoundly ingrained apathy of the Irish state towards its minority language media, media in the Irish language, constitutionally Ireland’s first language and recognised by the EU as a full European language,” Esslemont said. Northern Ireland Screen “easily outshines” its southern counterpart Screen Ireland for its commitment to Irish language content both for adult and child audiences, he added. “NI Screen’s appetite for Irish language drama matches TG4’s own ambition in this area and led us towards ‘Nordi noir’ [a reference to southern Irish slang for people from Northern Ireland] or ‘Donegal noir’, as I prefer to call it,” he said. “This TV series, ‘Crá’, where the austere and rugged scenery of the Donegal Gaeltacht is itself a character, deepens and widens our ambition to let the whole world enter into the secret and unique world of Ireland’s hidden language,” he said. Charles agreed that the desolate landscape plays a role in the narrative. “It is a unique part of the world. The landscape is really a character in this piece, which is why people are first drawn to it. There is something raw, inspiring and also kind of scary about the place, the weather, the ruggedness,” he said. “We really lean into that.”"

          "headline": "‘Straight in harm’s way’: can Trump open up Alaska’s 19m-acre refuge for drilling?",
          "bodyText": "The Arctic national wildlife refuge (ANWR) is one of the earth’s last intact ecosystems. Vast and little-known, this 19m-acre expanse along Alaska’s north slope is home to some of the region’s last remaining polar bears, as well as musk oxen, wolves and wolverines. Millions of birds from around the world migrate to or through the region each year, and it serves as the calving grounds for the porcupine caribou. Donald Trump has called the refuge the US’s “biggest oil farm”. The first Trump administration opened 1.5m acres of the refuge’s coastal plain to the oil and gas industry, and under Trump’s watch, the US government held its first-ever oil and gas lease sale there. In a few weeks, when Trump takes office again, the refuge – one of the last truly wild places in the world – is awaiting an uncertain future. The president-elect has promised to revive his crusade to “drill baby drill” on the refuge as soon as he returns to the White House in January, falsely claiming it holds more oil than Saudi Arabia. Project 2025, the conservative Heritage Foundation’s blueprint for Trump’s second term, calls for an immediate expansion of oil and gas drilling in Alaska, including in the ANWR, noting that the state “is a special case and deserves immediate action”. From his end, Joe Biden is moving to limit drilling in the region as much as his administration can. Experts are debating how much oil and gas there is to gain if Trump were to open up the region for drilling again. But Alaska’s Republican governor and Native Alaskan leaders in the region say they are eager to find out – seeing the potential for a major new source of revenue in the geographically remote region. Other Native leaders and activists have banded with environmental groups that oppose drilling on the refuge – and are gearing up for an arduous battle. “I see it as a David and Goliath fight,” said Tonya Garnett, a spokesperson for the Gwich’in steering committee, representing Gwich’in Nation villages in the US and Canada. “But we are resilient, and we are strong, and we’re going to keep fighting.” ‘Sacred place where life begins’ Garnett, who grew up in Arctic Village, just south of the refuge’s border, has spent most of her life trying to protect the refuge. Trump’s election has upped the urgency. The Gwich’in call the refuge’s coastal plain Iizhik Gwats’an Gwandaii Goodlit – the “sacred place where life begins”. It serves as the breeding grounds for a 218,000-strong herd of porcupine caribou – which the Gwich’in have hunted for sustenance through their entire history. “We don’t even go up there, because we don’t want to disturb them,” said Garnett. “We believe that even our footprints will disturb them.” Environmental concerns go beyond the caribou. Scientists have warned that mitigating the risks drilling will pose to polar bears will be impossible. A 2020 study in PloS One found that the infrared technology mounted on airplanes used to scope for dens is unreliable. Experts have also warned that the trucks and equipment used in even the initial stages of exploration could cause severe damage to the remote tundra, endangering the habitat of the bears and many other sensitive species. With the climate warming nearly four times faster than the rest of the planet, bears are already struggling to hunt on a landscape that is quickly melting away below them. “Drilling puts the polar bears straight in harm’s way,” said Pat Lavin, the Alaska policy adviser for the non-profit Defenders of Wildlife. All the while, extracting and burning more fossil fuels is guaranteed to accelerate global heating – further degrading the region that is home to not only bears and other wildlife, but also several Alaskan communities. Melting permafrost is releasing mercury, as well as greenhouse gases – and eroding infrastructure as the literal ground beneath many Alaskans’ feet begins to disintegrate. “It’s a scary thing,” said Garnett. ‘This issue has become symbolic’ The political zeal to drill in the Arctic has remained strong, despite industry skepticism over how much there would be to gain from drilling the ANWR. The US Geological Survey estimates that between 4.3bn and 11.8bn barrels of oil lie underneath the refuge’s coastal plain, but it remains profoundly unclear how large the deposits are and how difficult it will be to get to them. Its location in the remote, northernmost reaches of the continent, bereft of roads and infrastructure, makes it exceptionally difficult and expensive to even explore for petroleum. “We think there is almost no rationale for Arctic exploration,” Goldman Sachs commodity expert Michele Della Vigna told CNBC in 2017. “Immensely complex, expensive projects like the Arctic we think can move too high on the cost curve to be economically doable.” And yet, Republicans seem determined. Environmentalists have wondered if this zeal is more political than practical. “To some extent, this issue has become symbolic,” said Kristin Miller, executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League. “There’s an idea that if they can drill the Arctic Refuge, they can drill anywhere.” The Biden administration is working to limit exploration as much as it can in its remaining weeks in office. After two of the companies who’d bought leases in the first Trump years relinquished them voluntarily, in 2023 the Biden administration cancelled the remaining leases. However, the administration is obligated to hold a final oil and gas lease sale in the refuge as required by Trump-era law. Biden’s team has indicated it will be offering up just 400,000 acres – the minimum required by the 2017 law – with contingencies to avoid habitat for polar pears and the caribou calving grounds. It’s unclear who would bid for these leases. Already, several big banks have vowed not to finance energy development there, and big oil and gas companies have avoided the region – in large part because drilling into this iconic landscape remains deeply unpopular with many Americans. During the first Trump term, only two small private companies submitted bids for leases on the refuge, and later relinquished them. The other main bidder was the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority (AIDEA), a public corporation of the state of Alaska, which is suing the Biden administration over the cancellation of its leases last year. That group has already approved $20m to potentially bid again on leases for oil exploration in the region, even amid growing scrutiny of the extraction-focused group’s use of taxpayer funds, and its failure to meet its mandate of encouraging economic growth. The group did not respond to the Guardian’s request for comment on how it plans to proceed. ‘We’re ready to fight’ Garnett said she sees the unending drive to drill into this land as a form of colonization. The Gwich’in have built their livelihoods and culture around the porcupine caribou, and by disrupting the caribou’s habitat, oil industrialists will destroy the Gwich’in’s history and way of life, she said. “We’re ready to fight, to educate, and to go with a good heart,” she said. “Because that’s what we have to do.” The Gwich’in tribes have urged the Biden administration to establish an Indigenous sacred site on the coastal plain in the coming weeks. Not all Native groups in the region agree on that plan. Iñupiaq leaders on the North Slope have said the petition infringes their traditional homelands, and threatens oil and gas development that could benefit the Iñupiaq village of Kaktovik, the only community located within the refuge boundaries. In an October op-ed, Josiah Patkotak, mayor of the North Slope borough, which includes Kaktovik, said that the territory in question “has never been” Gwich’in territory”. “This is not about the protection of sacred sites” he wrote in response to news that the administration would consider designating the site. “It is about a federal government that thinks it knows better than the people who have lived on and cared for these lands since time immemorial.” Nathan Gordon Jr, the mayor of Kaktovik, said he’s excited about the incoming administration, and its openness to renewing oil and gas exploration. “We would be able to provide more for the community, more safety regulations and infrastructure,” he said. Gordon said he disagrees with the argument that oil and gas exploration would decimate the caribou, noting that residents in Kaktovik, too, rely on the herd for sustenance hunting. “We wouldn’t do anything to hurt our own herd,” he said. “I don’t see the main negative effects that everybody else sees.” One thing he has in common with tribal members on the other side of this issue, is that he too has spent years advocating on the issue. “I’ve been working on this ever since I’ve been a tribal councilmember,” he said. “We want to be able to use our lands.”"

          "headline": "Australian primary students score best ever result in global maths and science test, despite pandemic disruption",
          "bodyText": "Australian primary school students have recorded their best ever results in an international maths and science assessment, curbing concerns about lockdowns disrupting learning. The 2023 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (Timss), released by the Australian Council for Educational Research (Acer) late on Wednesday, analysed the skills of year 4 and 8 students. About 14,000 students in Australia participated in the test across 500 diverse schools. The report found Australian year 4 students, whose first years of schooling occurred doing Covid, ranked equal fifth internationally out of 58 countries, and equal 15th in mathematics. Both results were significantly higher than the previous Timss test in 2019, when Australian students ranked equal ninth and 23rd respectively. The boost was largely attributed to increases in the proportion of high performers. In year 8 science, Australia ranked equal eighth out of 44 countries, a slight drop from seventh in 2019, and equal ninth in maths, also down from seventh. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Lead author of the report, Nicole Wernert, said the results were a positive reflection on teachers who had navigated a challenging educational landscape. “It’s a testament to how well our teachers and schools pivoted to deal with the Covid pandemic,” she said. “Improvements weren’t the same across the board in Australia but the fact we’ve got our best ever results for year 4 and are holding steady at year 8 shows our schools and teachers did an amazing job.” But the report also found a large gender gap in favour of boys across maths and science in both age groups, primarily due to a significantly higher percentage of male students being very high performers. Internationally, Australia recorded the equal widest gender gap alongside France in year 4 maths achievement. “It’s the first time we’ve seen gender gap across both subjects and year levels,” Wernert said. “At year 4 it appears to be a result of a greater improvement in the achievement of year four 4 boys, but at year 8, girls have declined in performance and boys have stayed steady or improved. “That’s concerning – it’s a warning line that suggests we need to start paying attention.” Singapore was the top performing country overall in both subjects and age groups, scoring above 600 in all areas. A score of 625 is considered “advanced” while a score of 550 is considered “high” and a score of 475 is “intermediate”. Australia’s highest score was 550 for year 4 science, followed by year 4 maths (525). Year 8 students scored 520 in science and 509 in maths. Wernert said the lack of improvement among year 8 students could be partially attributed to young people dropping off in engagement levels after transitioning to high school. “We do find students’ self-confidence and interest in schooling decline over time,” she said. “Across board internationally only three countries improved in year 8 maths and science.” While positive on a national level, Wernert noted “disappointing” education gaps remained for priority cohorts including First Nations, regional, remote and low-SES students, and across some states and territories. Students in New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria significantly outperformed other jurisdictions, including the Northern Territory and Tasmania. First Nations students improved at a greater rate in year 4 science compared to non-Indigenous students, however they were still trailing below the national average. “While we haven’t closed the gap, we have reduced the gap,” Wernert said. “The key indicators we use in education are still showing up as being an issue. “We should be proud but not complacent of these results … we still have these areas where students of particular demographic groups are behind.” The minister for education, Jason Clare, said the results highlighted that Australia had a “good education system”, but it could be “better and fairer”. “That’s why we want to invest more money in our public schools and tie that funding to practical reforms that will help students catch up, keep up and finish school,” he said."

          "bodyText": "The Walmatjarri elder and blues musician Kankawa Nagarra has won the $50,000 Australian Music prize (AMP) for her debut album Wirlmarni, seeing off competition from Nick Cave, the Dirty Three and Amyl and the Sniffers. Inspired by the UK’s Mercury prize, the AMP focuses “entirely on artistic merit” and aims to “financially reward and increase exposure” for Australian musicians who release the best album in a calendar year. The prize – now in its 20th year – is considered Australia’s most prestigious music award and is judged by a panel of musicians, critics and industry figures. Previous winners include King Stingray, Courtney Barnett and the Avalanches. It often goes to new acts, with 10 of the 20 winners being debut albums. Also known as Olive Knight and “the Queen of the Bandaral Ngadu Delta”, 80-year-old Nagarra is a member of the stolen generations, having been taken from her parents and sent to a mission where she was immersed in gospel music. She discovered country music and rock on the radio while working on homesteads, but fell in love with the blues after overhearing a busker. She did not buy her first guitar until she was 40. She sings in both Kriol and English, and has performed all over the world, including touring with Hugh Jackman for his Back on Broadway show. On Wednesday, Nagarra said she was “thrilled and proud” to win for Wirlmarni, which “has been thousands of years in the making” as it contains sounds of the nature and people in Wangkatjungka, a remote Aboriginal community in northern Western Australia. “Coming from the remote community of Wangkatjungka, which in the past has been shown in a negative light with the focus on the issues and problems, people don’t often get to see the beautiful and positive aspects of my home,” she said. “And I know this award brings much pride to the people of Wangkatjungka, especially to the school and all the children who I hope to be a role model for.” She thanked the musician Darren Hanlon, who recorded and produced Wirlmarni; the two musicians are friends and have toured with each other. “I feel that music is a responsibility,” she added. “Caring for nature is a responsibility, and protecting culture is a responsibility for its holistic wellbeing. All these things are connected, and I make it my life’s work.” Outside music, Nagarra helped develop the Walmatjarri dictionary in the 1960s and works to raise awareness about youth suicide and substance abuse, particularly foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, within Aboriginal communities. The AMP founder, Scott Murphy, said the decision to award the prize to Nagarra “wasn’t a quick-and-easy decision to make – there were nine great albums, all quite diverse, all with judge support”, but she was a “very deserving” winner. Also shortlisted for this year’s award were Amyl and the Sniffers for Cartoon Darkness, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds for Wild God, Grace Cummings for Ramona, the Dirty Three for Love Changes Everything, Dobby for Warrangu; River Story, Hiatus Kaiyote for Love Heart Cheat Code, multi-instrumentalist Audrey Powne for From the Fire and songwriter Rowena Wise for Senseless Acts of Beauty. Wirlmarni was selected as the winner from more than 600 eligible albums released between 28 October 2023 and 25 October 2024. A judging panel then picked 46 albums as official nominations, before whittling down the selection to the top nine shortlist."

Enjoy your evenings, whether it be spent watching the Matildas take on Taiwan or anxiously reading our blog on the South Korea crisis. Here were today’s major developments: Australia’s economy put in a disappointing performance in the September quarter. Excluding the Covid disruptions, the annual growth pace of 0.8% was the weakest since the early 1990s recession, according to Westpac. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said “the growth in the Australian economy continues to be positive but it is weak”. Commonwealth Bank has conceded it did a “poor job” communicating changes to affected customers, after announcing a partial backdown over its plans to start charging users of one of its popular accounts a $3 fee for accessing money from a branch. The Greens plan to call Murdoch media executives before a Senate inquiry into greenwashing, after paid advertising from the gas lobby appeared as straight news coverage across Murdoch tabloids. They have also announced a new election policy to provide women with free access to contraceptives. The high court has ruled that aggregate sentences do count towards automatic visa cancellation on character grounds, reversing a full federal court decision that resulted in the release of more than 100 people from immigration detention in December 2022. And Australia has voted with 156 other countries at the United Nations to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible”, marking a return to the position for the first time in more than two decades. Three proposed coalmine projects will remain under assessment for potential approval after the federal government declined to review them for their potential climate impacts. The three projects are Idemitsu’s Boggabri coal project in NSW, BHP Mitsubishi’s Caval Ridge coal project in central Queensland and Jellinbah Group’s Lake Vermont coal project in Queensland. The legal firm Environmental Justice Australia said the mines would result in about 850 million tonnes in greenhouse emissions. The three mines were part of a larger bid - known as the Living Wonders case - by the Environment Council of Central Queensland (ECoCeQ) to have the government reconsider 19 projects because of the climate damage they would cause. The group also ran a series of landmark court cases in which it argued, unsuccessfully, that the minister for the environment was required to consider the lasting climate damage that two different coalmine expansions would cause. Environmental Council of Central Queensland spokesperson Ellie Smith said: This is another blow from the Albanese government, which came to power promising to protect the environment but keeps approving carbon bombs that will supercharge climate change. Environmental Justice Australia senior specialist lawyer Retta Berryman, said: In refusing to change the risk assessment for these massive coalmine expansions, the Albanese government has failed to recognise their climate harms to thousands of animals, plants and places. The peak body for the university sector has blamed a “handbrake on international education” sluggish economy growth figures released today. According to the national accounts, the economy grew 0.3% in the September quarter and 0.8% annually – the weakest non-pandemic reading since the 1990s recession. The ABS reported that education exports fell 9% in the September quarter compared with last year, dropping from $13.6bn to $12.4bn. Universities Australia Ceo, Luke Sheehy: Our economy is stuck in low gear and the handbrake on international education is a big reason for that. International students drove half of Australia’s economic growth last year. It makes no sense to put a handbrake on a $50bn industry that fuels our economy, especially when other sectors are struggling. The government has been using Ministerial Direction 107 to reduce international student numbers since last December and now we are seeing the damaging effects in the data – our outer suburban and regional unis are being hit the hardest. At a time of growing budget pressures, we should be investing in our most successful sectors, not curtailing them. Thunderstorm warning for parts of Queensland and NSW Storms are continuing to hit parts of Queensland and New South Wales, with the Bureau of Meteorology warning heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding is possible in some areas. The BoM holds particular concern for parts of New South Wales, where “very dangerous thunderstorms” are projected to hit Armidale, Glen Innes, Tamworth, Gunnedah, Narrabri and Coonabarabran over the next several hours. 46mm of rain was recorded at Ogunbil (Amaroo) in the half hour to 4.49pm, while Meldrum recorded 44mm in the half hour to 2:44pm. Queensland energy companies’ price changes did not breach competition law, court finds Queensland’s two state owned energy companies “hoped” to cause power price spikes during the summer by making late changes to power prices, but their strategies did not breach competition law, the federal court has found. Justice Sarah Derrington published a judgement on Wednesday in a class action alleging the power companies – CS Energy and Stanwell – took advantage of their market power to prevent other power generators from competing with them. The case scrutinised a practice known as “short notice rebidding”. It involved generators allegedly repricing electricity - at very high prices - that was previously offered to the market at much lower rates. The late timing of the pricing changes allegedly left other generators with little or no time to respond. Justice Derrington found that traders at CS Energy and Stanwell had “hoped that they would be able to cause price spikes over the summer period in accordance with their respective strategies”. In doing so they engaged in “profit-maximising behaviour” but did not unlawfully drive up prices. The Greens have accused Labor of capitulating to big corporations after it neglected requests to consider the climate impacts of three proposed coal mining projects. The ‘reconsideration requests’ were made by the Environment Council of Central Queensland, represented by lawyers from Environmental Justice Australia. On Wednesday, it was revealed government had rejected the requests for Boggabri, Caval Ridge and Lake Vermont Meadowbrook. They now await a final decision by Labor without a prior assessment of their climate harm. Leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, said Labor was “doing the bidding” of coal and gas corporations. Emissions are higher under Anthony Albanese than Scott Morrison, Labor has approved 28 new coal and gas projects since coming to power, and the government has pushed setting 2035 climate targets back until after the next election. Scientists say new coal and gas must be stopped to protect Australia from dangerous climate change. Pacific leaders are demanding Australia stop approving new coal and gas to give their islands a fighting chance. Albanese and Tanya Plibersek must immediately reject these three new coal projects. Man, 20, dies in WA after alleged break-in with machete In Western Australia, a 20-year-old man has died after allegedly breaking into a Kalgoorlie-Boulder home armed with a machete, police have confirmed. About 10.15am, police allege the man broke into a home on Kenneally Place armed with the weapon. A man who was at home with his wife and child confronted the man and an altercation ensued, police allege. The 20-year-old received serious injuries and was flown to Royal Perth hospital, where he later died. The male occupant received serious injuries and was sent to Kalgoorlie Regional hospital. This matter is currently still under investigation and a file is being prepared for the coroner. Guardian Australia understands the man was not in custody and was assisting police. No charges have been laid. Chalmers welcomes Commonwealth Bank’s change of heart on withdrawal fees Finally, Chalmers was asked about changes announced by the Commonwealth Bank to impose $3 fees for many customers seeking cash withdrawals. The changes have since been wound back. Jennett: Are you open to having smart ATMs in the regions and a heavier reliance on Australia Post as an alternative to some of those levy proposals that you are working on? Chalmers said he welcomed the Commonwealth Bank’s change of heart and had a conversation with CEO Matt Comyn about the issues. To his credit and to the bank’s credit, they recognise that the changes which were flagged yesterday were neither acceptable nor appropriate … people were doing it tough enough as it is, particularly vulnerable people. We welcome that change of heart. And again, we engage with the major financial institutions in a very respectable, productive and constructive way and that applies to our efforts as well to make sure Australians in regional communities get the kind of services that they need and deserve. That’s an ongoing conversation with the banking sector to see what might be possible here … we have more work to do. Chalmers says aim is to ‘get wages moving again’ Chalmers reiterated Labor’s aim was to “get wages moving again” – both the minimum wage and pay rises in industries dominated by the minimum. Pointed to a $28m deficit for the current financial year, he said the deficit was “much smaller” than anticipated when Labor came to office. How sustainable was continued wage growth? Chalmers: We’ve made progress in this year. We have delivered two surpluses in the first two years. We got the third deficit smaller and the direction of travel compared to what we inherited at the election has been a good one. What we have been able to show from reprioritising in the budget is we can get wages moving again in the care economy and in industries dominated by women. That’s one of the reasons why the gender pay gap is the narrowest it’s ever been … we don’t think people on low incomes or in an industry dominated by women should carry the can for the fight against inflation. Asked whether existing supports like energy bill relief would be extended, he said “I’m not making that argument today” and “it’s not something we’re proposing”. Jim Chalmers: ‘the economy is very soft’ Chalmers was asked whether Labor’s economic settings could be both supportive and inflationary. He replied the Reserve Bank governor had indicated the past two surpluses were helping to fight inflation. We know from the Bureau of Statistics our cost-of-living relief is putting downward pressure on inflation, not upward pressure on inflation. Those are important elements of our economic strategy, to roll out the cost of living relief in the most responsible way we can, to be part of the solution when it comes to inflation … while at the same time we protect jobs in our economy and make sure that we’re not ignoring these risks to growth. When you have economic growth come in lower than what most economists were expecting and forecasting, it makes it more important than ever that, as we maintain the primary focus on inflation, we don’t ignore what’s happening in the economy more broadly and the economy is very soft. Jim Chalmers is asked about ‘insipidly weak’ growth figures The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is appearing on ABC’s Afternoon Briefing now following those less-than-thrilling growth figures released today. Presenter Greg Jennett did not mince his words: By any measure, these growth figures today are insipidly weak … back at budget time, you had growth heading for 2% and still do on the books as we speak. How do you reconcile that? Chalmers replied Labor had taken a “very balanced approach” with a primary focus on reducing inflation. We got a lot of free advice at budget time [that] we should be slashing and burning in the budget and it would have sent the economy backwards at different points of this year. So what we’ve done instead is taken a very balanced approach, and a primary focus on fighting inflation, but without ignoring these very substantial risks to growth. In the last 18 months or so, three quarters of OECD economies have gone backwards. Our economy has continued to grow. It is ticking over but it’s ticking over very slowly. Continued from previous post Shortly after the health minister spoke, Emma Maiden - the general manager of Uniting NSW - criticised the government for inviting Ted Wheeler, the mayor of Portland in the US state of Oregon - to be the international speaker. Earlier this year, Oregon reintroduced criminal sanctions for drug possession again after decriminalising it in 2020, and Wheeler told the audience the major failure was decriminalising drugs before enough treatment services were in place. Maiden said comparing NSW to Portland was like comparing apples to oranges given the different health systems, and the financial crisis and economic downturn that resulted from the pandemic. She said a European country that has tried decriminalisation, such as Portugal, would have been a better choice. John Brogden, a co-chair of the summit and former leader of the NSW Liberal party, was asked why Wheeler was selected to speak and not a representative closer to NSW such as from the ACT, where possessing small quantities of drugs was decriminalised a year ago. Brogden said: I think [Wheeler] was very honest about what went wrong , without throwing out the idea of decriminalisation. I think we understand the ACT’s experience. The NSW government has ruled out the possibility of decriminalising drugs before its drug summit has finished and despite an overwhelming number of participants at its drug summit calling for it. NSW minister for health, Ryan Park, told reporters with a day and a half of the summit still left to go that it doesn’t have a mandate to decriminalise people possessing small quantities of drugs for personal use. Asked by a reporter if the purpose of the summit was not to determine if there was a mandate, Park said: Where we can find commonalities and agreements, we should focus on that and chart a course to achieving those things. Earlier in the summit there were calls for decriminalisation from Annie Madden, executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, who said for the past 30 years the “best advice” on reducing drug harm had been shunned in favour of the “best compromise”. Park said whilst decriminalisation had come up at the summit, he said many other issues had too. He said this included a need for more treatment services, particularly in the regions, and also “the way we handle people with drugs through the criminal justice system”. Still at the Australian British Chamber of Commerce event in Brisbane, Queensland’s new treasurer, David Janetzki, has warned it is “highly likely” the state government bonds will receive an outlook downgrade. Speaking at the Brisbane event today, the new LNP treasurer blamed the previous Labor government for billion-dollar blowouts in a range of engineering projects. He revealed a major pumped hydro project at Borumba had blown out from $14bn to $18bn. “The former government knew the risk, and they lied to Queenslanders about it,” he said, conceding the state would likely get a downgrade from its double A plus credit rating. What is clear is, it is highly likely that we have inherited an outlook downgrade and ultimately a rating downgrade here in Queensland. It is because of the former government’s economic irresponsibility that we are facing this challenge right now. Before the election, Janetzki vowed to stabilise the state’s books, telling the Australian newspaper: I don’t want to be a treasurer that has a ratings downgrade on my watch. It’s that simple. Queensland energy minister hints at ‘technologically agnostic’ approach to policy Queensland’s energy minister has hinted at a “technologically agnostic” approach to energy – but again ruled out backing his federal LNP counterpart’s nuclear plan. David Janetzki told an Australian British Chamber of Commerce event in Brisbane: In Queensland, we are developing a roadmap for an energy system that is affordable, reliable and sustainable. We will set our own path to achieve this that is pragmatic and technologically agnostic. In a later press conference he denied he was hinting the government would abandon a pre-election pledge to maintain the state’s ban on nuclear energy – but didn’t identify any other alternatives to replace the state’s coal fleet. Update on Commonwealth Bank changes The Commonwealth Bank has provided a further update on changes to legacy account holders, after conceding its announcements had been “poorly communicated”. Group executive of retail banking services, Angus Sullivan, said the changes would not affect around 9 million customers who weren’t on the Complete Access product. The changes taking place are such that the approximately 90% of customers we intend to move, and who we expect will be better off or the same, will be moved to the lower monthly fee account. If those customers don’t want to move, they can contact us to discuss their options. For the remaining customers we are changing our approach and we are pausing the migration. Instead, we will contact these customers over the next six months to discuss the most appropriate product for them given their needs. Commonwealth Bank maintains the largest branch network. Each of our branches has fee free ATMs and we have a moratorium on regional branch closures until at least the end of 2026. Review to be conducted of memoir Gender Queer In October, the federal court ordered the Australian classifications review board to review its assessment of the memoir Gender Queer, following a case launched by activist Bernard Gaynor seeking to have the book refused publication in Australia. He had sought a review of the classification of the graphic novel-style memoir about gender identity by non-binary writer Maia Kobabe on the basis of cartoon images of sex scenes in the book, one of which has been described by critics seeking a ban as “pornographic” and “paedophilic”. Guardian Australia has confirmed the ruling was not appealed and a spokesperson for the communications department said a review will be conducted: The federal court’s decision regarding Gender Queer: A Memoir has not been appealed. The Classification Review Board will conduct a review of the classification of Gender Queer: A Memoir as ordered by the Federal Court of Australia. Timing for the review is being determined. The federal court found that the board review of the submissions on the classification of the book had treated many of them as being anti-LGBTQ, despite the court finding that a majority of those submissions could not be deemed anti-LGBTQ. Tasmania police officer in stable condition after ‘traumatic incident’ in Launceston A male officer injured during a “traumatic incident” in the Launceston CBD yesterday is in a stable condition, Tasmania police have confirmed. Police tried to negotiate with a knife-wielding man in the major Tasmanian city after a member of the public raised the alarm around 10am on Tuesday. Tasmania police’s assistant commissioner, Adrian Bodnar, said the man kept advancing towards officers, who fired several shots which hit him in the chest twice. The man was given first aid at the scene and taken in a critical condition to the Launceston general hospital where he died. The injured officer is currently in a stable condition at the Launceston general hospital after undergoing surgery yesterday, police said. The officer and his family are being supported by the Wellbeing Support team and colleagues, and he is in good spirits. Our thoughts continue to be with all those involved in yesterday’s tragic incident. As is our usual process for any major incident, yesterday’s incident will be subject to a full Professional Standards investigation and also independent review by the Coroner and Integrity Commission. Prahan byelection to be held on 8 February The Victorian parliament’s Speaker, Maree Edwards, has set a date for the Prahran byelection, which was sparked by the resignation of former Greens MP Sam Hibbins. Edwards on Wednesday released a statement confirming it will be held on 8 February. Candidates will have until 17 January to nominate and the electoral roll for voters will close on 27 December. So far, Labor has ruled out running a candidate, while the Greens will run environmental engineer Angelica Di Camillo. Di Camillo was picked by the party to run in Higgins at the next federal election but the Australian Electoral Commission abolished the electorate in a redistribution. The electorate, which covers Prahran, South Yarra and Windsor, has previously been held by both major parties before Hibbins won it in 2014 in a three-way contest that took the Victorian Electoral Commission more than a week to declare. Since then, Hibbins had increased his margin to 12% against the Liberals. He resigned from parliament on 23 November, just three after he quit the Greens due to a “consensual relationship” with a staff member on his team, which was a breach of the party’s rules. As we saw earlier, Australia’s economy put in a disappointing performance in the September quarter. Excluding the Covid disruptions, the annual growth pace of 0.8% was the weakest since the early 1990s recession, according to Westpac. Investors initially reacted by lopping about 0.2 US cents off the value of the Aussie dollar vs the US dollar. The fall, though, has since continued, with the $A down to 64.2 US cents (or about 1% for the day overall), according to Bloomberg data. The dollar’s drop against Japan’s yen isn’t much better, at 0.9% for the day, so it’s not just a greenback thing. It’s only one day, of course, but a weaker currency doesn’t help the inflation fight (since imports get more expensive) but it will help foster local demand. The GDP figures aren’t the only things moving today. South Korea’s martial law flip-flop isn’t a good sign about the stability of Australia’s third-biggest export market (not to mention yet another democracy facing challenges, from the US to France and Germany, among others). We wondered, too, if Nab’s morning read on the overnight global developments might have been a little insensitive. “K-pop” was how they headlined their wrap. Hello everyone. Caitlin Cassidy here, delighted to be with you. That is all from me on the blog today – handing over now to Caitlin Cassidy who will keep you updated with the afternoon’s news. ‘Clear end goal’ is to fully decriminalise and regulate all drugs, Dr Annie Madden says Dr Annie Madden, the executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, called for decriminalisation of small quantities of drugs for personal use at the NSW government’s drug summit. “It is only reasonable that we give decriminalisation a proper chance to do what decades of prohibition has failed to do,” she says. Madden was the only speaker at the state’s first drug summit 25 years ago who was an active drug user. Portland mayor says he would ‘never encourage’ drug decriminalisation without adequate treatment system The mayor of a city in a US state that decriminalised drugs four years ago has told the NSW government’s drug summit that the greatest failure was not having adequate treatment resources in place. Oregon decriminalised drugs in favour of focusing on treatment over punishment after a public vote in 2020. But earlier this year, the city of Portland rolled the laws back and again introduced criminal penalties for drug possession after a spike in drug overdoses. The mayor of Portland, Ted Wheeler, told the summit via video call to the audience in Sydney: I would never encourage anybody to go forward with this if they do not have that treatment system in place first. Earlier in the summit there were calls for decriminalisation from Annie Madden, the executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, who said for the past thirty years the “best advice” on reducing drug harm had been shunned in favour of the “best compromise”. Wheeler said the decriminalisation of small quantities of drugs for personal use gave police the power to still issue a maximum $100 fine for those caught. But that fine was waived if the person called a number that connected them with drug treatment resources. He said this “carrot and stick” approach did not work and that the city was overwhelmed by rapid and sharp spikes in overdose calls after drugs were decriminalised. He said that the decriminalisation occurred in the context of a number of inflaming factors. This included the pandemic, the murder of George Floyd which he said had bred a distrust in law enforcement, and also the fentanyl crisis. However, he said “I still think we would have had these problems even if that hadn’t happened.” He added: Even if none of those things had happened, we took way too long to build the treatment infrastructure. ‘Parliament of landlords’ won’t solve housing crisis, says Jordan van den Lamb Van den Lamb said the aim of the campaign is to put up “empty home crime scene” stickers on as many empty homes as possible, so that the extent of the problem is made more visible. The wealthiest people in Australia have enjoyed a massive windfall from the growth in property prices over the past few decades. The system is so rigged for the rich that they often lose very little from keeping properties empty. This needs to change. Labor and the Coalition have together built a housing system in which private profits come before basic human needs. The situation is now reaching a crisis point. Homelessness is growing rapidly as are the number of people on waiting lists for public housing. The initiatives announced by Labor to address this will be a drop in the ocean. We want to build a movement – of the homeless, of renters, of everyone who is suffering from the housing crisis. We can’t expect our parliament of landlords to solve this for us. The majority of them benefit from the current system. People need to take matters into their own hands. ‘Empty home crime scene’: rental activist Jordan van den Lamb launches sticker campaign for vacant properties Rental activist and Victorian Socialists candidate Jordan van den Lamb, AKA Purplepingers, last weekend launched a new campaign leaving large bright stickers on empty rental homes. On Saturday the campaign started visiting homes that have been left empty for an extended period and putting up A3-sized stickers identifying them as an “empty home crime scene”. A recent Prosper Australia report which analysed properties’ water use estimated that there were close to 100,000 vacant homes in Melbourne in 2023 – enough to house more than 250,000 people. That’s many more than are currently homeless or languishing on the public housing waiting list. According to the report, the suburb with the highest concentration of empty homes was Brunswick East, where 1,214 or 12.7% of all properties were left vacant. Gold Coast council votes to progress world heritage cableway proposal The Gold Coast city council has voted to progress plans for a cableway through the world-heritage listed Springbrook national park. Councillors voted 10-5 on Tuesday to spend $500,000 seeking an agreement with the new state government for a route for the long-mooted scheme. The LNP has repeatedly signalled their interest in eco-tourism projects. Opponents argue the project would threaten the national park’s world-heritage status and lacks First Nations consent, among other problems. The Queensland Conservation Council, National Parks Association of Queensland and Gold Coast-based Gecko Environment Council are calling for the scheme to be scrapped. The Greens plan to call Murdoch media executives before a Senate inquiry into greenwashing, after paid advertising from the gas lobby appeared as straight news coverage across Murdoch tabloids. News Corp tabloids the Daily Telegraph, Herald Sun, Courier Mail and Adelaide Advertiser on Monday began an identical week-long series promoting the fossil fuel, with page one headlines warning Australia must “step on the gas” as the “only way to avoid higher bills, blackouts”. In some cases the stories were marked as “exclusive” and a “special report”. Inside the papers ran a double spread that said the series was an advertorial “proudly sponsored” by the gas infrastructure business APA Group and the gas companies Tamboran, Santos and Jemena. “This isn’t journalism – it’s fossil fuel propaganda,” Sarah Hanson-Young, Greens spokesperson for communications and chair of the senate inquiry into greenwashing, said in a statement. She continued: We know that the social licence for coal and gas is rapidly melting as climate change gets worse and the public learn more about who is responsible. We will look to call Murdoch media executives before our Greenwashing inquiry in the new year to explain their disregard for basic journalistic ethics and their longstanding campaign against climate science. The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, reacted to today’s growth numbers (which were weaker than expected) a short while ago. He said to press: We have been very clear that you have to get productivity back on track. You have to re-establish the physical guard rails that were in place until the government came into place. You have to make sure that direction, getting redtape out of the way for businesses in Australia to invest and grow and employ, most of all to make sure that we don’t have continued pressure on interest rates and inflation. Dutton accuses PM of selling ‘Jewish community out for green votes’ after Australia votes at UN to end Israeli occupation The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, said the prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has “sold the Jewish community out for green votes” in response to Australia voting today with 156 other countries at the United Nations to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible” for the first time in more than two decades. Dutton was asked at a presser if “that shift [is] something that you support?” earlier today. He said “we should be standing with allies like the United States instead”: It’s not something I support, and we’ve been very critical of the position that the government’s adopted, which has been at odds to the commitments that they gave to the Jewish community before the election … He looked people of Jewish faith in the eye before the election and gave them a guarantee that there would be no difference between the two parties, that there would be bipartisan positions in relation to votes at the UN and our position with regard to Israel. They’ve completely abandoned the Jewish community, the state of Israel. There is a lot of anger, understandably, in the community … and I think the prime minister stands condemned. He sold the Jewish community out for green votes in Western Sydney and places like Marrickville. That is what the prime minister has done and I think we should be standing with allies like the United States instead. The Albanese government is chasing green votes and have been prepared to sacrifice the wellbeing of the Jewish community in Australia to do so. Commonwealth Bank has conceded it did a “poor job” communicating changes to affected customers, after announcing a partial backdown over its plans to start charging users of one of its popular accounts a $3 fee for accessing money from a branch. The changes follow a sharp rebuke from the government, with the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, describing CBA’s plans as a “kick in the guts” and the “worst Christmas present imaginable”. CBA’s group executive of retail banking, Angus Sullivan, said today the bank would pause the planned migration of some customers to the new product that includes “assisted withdrawal fees” for those accessing their cash at a branch, post office or via phone. “Clearly, we’ve done a poor job of communicating aspects of this change for our customers,” Sullivan said. We know that account changes are difficult, and especially at this time of year, and with so many Australians challenged with cost-of-living pressures, we’ve decided to announce a change in our approach. We’re going to pause the changes that we announced, and we’re going to spend the next six months individually engaging with each of those customers to make sure that we have a solution tailored for each one of them. CBA has divided the roughly 1 million customers that have a legacy “complete access” account into two groups – those it believes will be in an equal or better position after the planned migration to the “smart access” product, and those who won’t. This works out to about 900,000 people in the former category, and 100,000 in the latter. The “smart access” account has slightly lower monthly account-keeping fees than the legacy product, but it contains the controversial $3 in-branch withdrawal fees. Sullivan said: The last thing we want to do is disengage or confuse our customers from banking with us, so we’ve taken a different approach. Consumers’ cautious behaviour might be rewarded by the RBA The tale of the September quarter national accounts looks to be one of more tepid growth in the wider economy than had been tipped, with falling commodity prices (pointing to China’s own weak growth) one factor. More reassuring, though, for the Reserve Bank, was that those hefty stage-three tax cuts look to have largely been pocketed by consumers. Disposable income was up 1.5% for the quarter but nominal household spending was up just 0.6%, the ABS said. That helped lift the savings rate from 2.4% to 3.2%. That spending is probably why economists missed on their growth forecasts. It’s a bit of a shell game because households didn’t spend a lot on energy thanks to those state and federal rebates (temporarily culling the veracity of “electricity bills are soaring” stories). Anyway, perhaps the CBA holding out for an RBA rate cut by February might not seem such a lonely prediction after today’s GDP figures (notwithstanding some rosier economic numbers since 30 September). You can follow along at home here too: Disability advocate Hannah Diviney urges media to ‘believe in disabled stories and not just pick one or two’ Diviney concluded her speech by placing an onus on the media to prioritise representation in storytelling. Stories are the building blocks we use to teach children about the world. They’re how we learn to identify the bad guy, or find the hero, without representation in them – what are we supposed to do? That leaves holes in you, not having any representation … to media I say – these holes can be entirely preventable if people with power are brave enough. But it means we need investment from the media. It means we need investment from people behind the scenes, from in front of the camera. We need you to believe in disabled stories and not just pick one or two – whether it is me or Dylan Alcott or Chloe Hayden. There’s a whole diverse range of people out there, and all of us deserve to be heard. But if they’re not filled in, if people aren’t brave enough to prevent those holes, they have no choice but to be filled with the very worst of what a person, in this case, a child, can think about themselves. ‘To us, it’s our quality of life’: Hannah Diviney says NDIS cuts are not just arbitrary figures Diviney, who lives with cerebral palsy, used her speech to rally behind the NDIS and adequate financial care for people with disabilities. She told the room she would not be nearly as successfully functional without the support of crucial early intervention services – an “army” of physios, occupational therapists, speech pathologists and social workers. An army every child and person with a disability should have access to no matter their postcode, financial circumstance, support network, skin colour or immigration status. The size of which, by the way, should not be determined by the arbitrary box-ticking criteria of an inflexible system overseen and executed by people without one iota of lived experience of disabled life among them. Earlier this year, the government cut $14.4bn from the NDIS. To them, that might have just been numbers, arbitrary figures on a piece of paper. To us, it’s our quality of life. It’s whether we get to achieve, it’s whether we get to live, it’s whether we get to be human. With Bill Shorten’s retirement, she said it was her “fervent hope” the incoming NDIS minister would be someone with lived experience with disability. We need better. What [the NDIS] represents now is not how it was meant to be built … you don’t get to make my life or its possibilities smaller to balance a budget. I’m a person, not a surplus tool. Disability advocate Hannah Diviney speaks at National Press Club Meanwhile, author, actor and disability advocate Hannah Diviney has been appearing at the National Press Club to mark the International Day of Persons with Disabilities. Among her many accolades has been encouraging Lizzo and Beyoncé to remove ableist slurs from their lyrics. She noted very few members of the disabled and neurodivergent community had graced the stage in the press club’s history, “which says a lot about the pathways to and construction opportunities for power in this country”. Hi, everyone. I’m Hannah, and when I was born, doctors warned my first-time parents … that in the worst-case scenario, I would never walk, feed myself or talk … If this forum is reflective of the powerful and influential here in Australia, the ones given the capacity to make decisions, shape laws and policy as well as the stories we tell as a nation, the lack of disabled voices included here makes a sad sort of sense. While you were building this, we, as a community, were collectively silenced. Hidden from view. Institutionalised and erased – in fact, in some ways, we still are. Social services minister urges organisations to join abuse redress scheme The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has urged six sporting and religious organisations to reverse their decision to not join the redress scheme “as a priority”. As we reported earlier, the government has named six institutions that have declined to join the national redress scheme, which provides capped compensation and other forms of redress to survivors of abuse. Those organisations are the Darwin Cycling Club, New Norfolk District Football Club, Townsville Indoor Sports, Crown Coaches, Christian Youth Camps, and Knox Basketball Incorporated. Rishworth said: I call on each of these institutions to do the right thing by survivors of institutional child sexual abuse, reverse their decision and join the Scheme as a priority. Joining the Scheme demonstrates an institution’s commitment to survivors at a time when the community is calling for action to end the widespread and unchecked exploitation to children and ongoing trauma for survivors. Survivors have waited too long. I hope each institution reconsiders their decision. If this does occur, their name will be removed from the Scheme’s website. Government names six sporting and religious organisations that refused to join abuse redress scheme Six sporting and religious organisations that have refused to join the National Redress Scheme have been publicly named by the federal government. Earlier this morning, the redress scheme’s website named Christian Youth Camps in Western Australia, Darwin Cycling Club, the New Norfolk District Football Club, Townsville Indoor Sports, Knox Basketball Incorporated and Crown Coaches as the latest organisations to decline to join the redress scheme. The redress scheme was set up after the royal commission to provide capped compensation to abuse survivors. It also facilitates apologies and other forms of redress. The scheme relies heavily on institutions agreeing to sign up, punishing bodies that refuse to do so, including by naming them and barring them from government funding. But a wide range of sporting organisations are yet to sign on to the redress scheme, including the Australian Rugby League Commission. The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, is meeting with her state and territory counterparts on the redress ministers board later today. The board will discuss the refusal of sporting organisations to join the redress scheme and the need for states and territories to step in as “funders of last resort” for such bodies. Without a funder of last resort for the sporting organisations, survivors are unable to have their claims for redress progressed. Jim Chalmers has confirmed the Commonwealth Bank has accepted that their plans to charge customers a $3 fee to withdraw money at bank branches “are not acceptable or appropriate,” he said at a presser. Late this morning I spoke to the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank, Matt Comyn, about the decision announced yesterday by the Commonwealth Bank. As you know, we consider the changes flagged yesterday to be unacceptable, we made our views very clear in the course of the day yesterday. The changes that were flagged and that were announced are not acceptable or appropriate. The Commonwealth Bank has released a statement in the last few minutes which make it very clear that they accept that those changes were not acceptable or appropriate. They will have another look at those changes to make sure that people are not worse off, we are talking and lots of instances about some of the most vulnerable people in the banking system. I welcome the change of heart. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, says “the growth in the Australian economy continues to be positive but it is weak”. He is addressing press: Our economy is still growing but very slowly. It is weighed down by interest rates and cost-of-living pressures and global economic uncertainty as well. Growth at just 0.3% in the quarter and 0.8% through the year is below historical averages and it is below market expectations as well. He says the growth in real incomes is “the most encouraging aspect of the data”: The most encouraging aspect and the most important aspect of today’s national accounts is what it says about real incomes growth … Growth in real incomes reflects the progress we are making when it comes to moderating inflation but also solid wages growth and very importantly the government’s cost of living tax cuts. At the intersection of those three things, a moderating inflation, tax cuts and wages growth, that is why we are seeing a real income per capita growing in today’s national accounts, but is very welcome and it is very important as well. The government has updated their Smartraveller advice for South Korea today, urging Australians to “avoid protests and demonstrations”. The website says: The situation in South Korea is evolving due to developments in domestic politics. Avoid protests and demonstrations. Sites like Gwanghwamun Square and Yeouido in Seoul may have larger crowds and more protest activity than usual. Transport and other essential services may be disrupted. Monitor the media for updates and follow the advice of local authorities. The Australian Embassy in Seoul remains open but is not offering in-person services. This comes after South Korea’s rightwing president was forced to back down after he unexpectedly declared martial law only to face unanimous opposition from the national assembly, in the most serious challenge to the country’s democracy since the 1980s. Apple offers US$1m bounty to researchers who find privacy or security vulnerabilities in AI system One of the big concerns about embedding AI into everything is the potential privacy concerns over what it learns from what people ask AI to do. Apple, which has long set itself as a differentiator based on increased privacy on devices, has tried to put these concerns to rest over its Apple Intelligence in a number of ways. Firstly, it does a fair amount of its processing on-device, meaning it stays on your device and never goes anywhere else. The second part is where it does need to process a request off the device, they’ve introduced Private Cloud Compute, which the company says never stores the data being processed, never trains their AI model from that data, and that data is deleted once no longer required. You can read more about that from the June announcement. The company is now putting its money where its mouth is, and has offered bounties of up to US$1m for researchers – who will have access to components of the source code for the scheme – if they find any privacy or security vulnerabilities in the system. The lowest bounty is set at US$50,000 if a researcher finds accidental or unexpected data disclosure due to a configuration issue. Apple has indicated it is confident that if any such vulnerability was found, it would be publicised quite quickly by researchers who would then get the bounty. The high court has ruled that aggregate sentences do count towards automatic visa cancellation on character grounds, reversing a full federal court decision that resulted in the release of more than 100 people from immigration detention in December 2022. In the Pearson case, the full federal court ruled that aggregate sentences do not trigger automatic visa cancellation, prompting the release of people who had previously served aggregate sentences of 12 months or more in prison. An aggregate sentence refers to when a person is given one sentence for multiple offences. In February 2023 Labor and the Coalition passed an extraordinary law stating that aggregate sentences do qualify for automatic visa cancellation, and that previous cancellations were all taken to be valid. In October 2023, the full federal court upheld the legality of the new law in two cases: JZQQ, a man who was sentenced to 15 months in prison for offences of intentionally causing injury and threats to kill; and Kingston Tapiki, a New Zealander sentenced to an aggregate term of 12 months’ imprisonment for offences of affray and assault. In October the high court heard a challenge by those two and the original plaintiff, Kate Pearson, a New Zealander whose visa was automatically cancelled because she was sentenced to a maximum term of imprisonment of four years and three months in respect of 10 offences. On Wednesday the high court held unanimously that the full federal court got the original decision wrong. As a result, it did not need to judge the validity of the retrospective law. RBA rate cut may be more likely as growth below expectations The quarter-on-quarter figures are more closely watched by economists and the “miss” of 0.3% growth, versus the half percentage point expansion they expected, sent the Australian dollar down against the US counterpart. Investors would now see the RBA as more inclined to cut its cash rate soon (and hence, making it less attractive to hold $A on the margin) after these numbers. The 0.3% pace was the most, though, since the September quarter a year ago, when it grew 0.5%. The year-on-year numbers, too, weren’t flash. At 0.8%, it’s the slowest since the rebound from Covid began, and likely to be the nadir in this part of the cycle (barring some nasty surprise). Australia’s economy quickened in the September quarter, thanks largely to additional government spending, stoking labour demand. Growth, though, was a bit weaker than expected, which may make an early RBA rate cut more likely. Gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 0.3% in the July-September months, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported on Wednesday. That pace compared with the 0.5% rate expected by economists and the 0.2% growth previously reported for the June quarter by the ABS. GDP was 0.8% larger than for the September quarter a year earlier. Economists had expected annual GDP growth to come in at 1.1% or similar to the 1% rate the ABS had stated for the June quarter. With the swelling population, though, GDP as measured on a per capita basis continued to retreat, easing 0.3%, for a record seventh consecutive quarter. As we noted in the blog yesterday, public demand alone contributed 0.7 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth. Still, those outlays have helped kept the unemployment rate to about 4% for all of 2024, a figure not far above the lowest in half a century. Employment in seasonally adjusted terms rose by 156,600 in the September quarter alone. More soon. Drug summit told decriminalisation ‘can be done poorly’ as Portland mayor to speak about recriminalisation More from today’s NSW drug summit. The mayor of the US city of Portland, Ted Wheeler, is due to speak at the summit today after the state of Oregon embarked on a three-year plan to recriminalise drugs after an increase in overdose deaths after they were decriminalised. Madden foreshadowed this by saying there is no “one way to do decriminalisation” and that it can be done well and “it can be done poorly”. Madden also called for a “strong recommendation” on pill testing from the summit, and an end to “harmful policing practices”. She said: We simply cannot go through another summer festival season without access to pill testing, and while we’re at it, without ending the harmful and ineffective policing practices, including strip-searching and the use of drug detection dogs. An advocate at the NSW government’s drug summit has called for decriminalisation of small quantities of drugs for personal use with a “clear end goal” of legal regulation of all drugs. Dr Annie Madden, the executive director of Harm Reduction Australia, was the only speaker at the state’s first drug summit 25 years ago that was an active drug user. This morning, at the state’s second drug summit, she told the audience that in over three decades, the main outcome in drug harm reduction has been that the “best advice” becomes the “best compromise”. “We wonder why we can’t get the results we need,” she said. Madden later added: It is only reasonable that we give decriminalisation a proper chance to do what decades of prohibition has failed to do. But beware, because doing decriminalisation in incremental steps can quickly lead to unintended and unforeseen outcomes as a result of too many compromises. I began with the term full decriminalisation, and for me that includes a clear end goal of full legal regulation of all drugs. More to come in the next blog post. Jacinta Allan says new vaccine facility makes Victoria world-leading centre of medical research The Victorian government has also hailed the opening as marking the state as a leader in medical research. With Moderna and also BioNTech establishing major hubs in the state, the government says it is the only place in the world where both mRNA leaders host research and development, as well as manufacturing operations. The premier, Jacinta Allan, said: There are now three world-leading centres of medical research – Boston, London and Victoria. Moderna mRNA vaccine facility opens in Victoria Australia has become the only country in the southern hemisphere with an mRNA vaccines manufacturing capability after a new facility opened in Victoria, which the health minister hailed as protecting against future pandemics. Early on in the Covid-19 pandemic, experts urged the government to develop domestic mRNA manufacturing capabilities warning Australia would be vulnerable to supply limitations without the ability to produce mRNA vaccines. After those predictions came to pass, the federal and Victorian governments and pharmaceutical giant Moderna struck an agreement in December 2021 to manufacture mRNA vaccines in Australia. The health minister, Mark Butler, and Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, this morning opened Moderna’s facility at Monash University’s Clayton campus which will allow for the growth of Australia’s sovereign mRNA manufacturing industry. The facility will have the capacity to produce up to 100m vaccine doses each year for respiratory diseases including influenza, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Covid-19. Butler: This is a major step forward in helping protect Australians against future pandemics, while creating highly skilled jobs, supporting local industry and promoting research collaboration. The state’s acting minister for economic growth, Danny Pearson, said: We’ll never have to fight to get our fair share of vaccines again because the southern hemisphere’s first end-to-end mRNA vaccine facility has opened in Victoria – setting a new benchmark in innovation and economic growth. Minns says no ‘magic solution’ to drugs but ‘more needs to be done’ The NSW premier, Chris Minns, has opened the Sydney leg of the state’s drug summit by acknowledging there is no “magic solution” to drug use, but that the goal of the summit is to reduce “the number of Australians whose lives have been “destroyed or diminished. He added the government’s “goal is a recognition that society has not got there yet, and more needs to be done.” The summit is the second in the state after one was held in 1999 by then premier Bob Carr. Minns said the summit helped the state recognise drug abuse as a health issue and redirect people away from the justice system towards rehabilitation. This summit, which is on its third day after the first two were held in Griffith and Lismore, has brought together experts from across various fields that intersect with the issue, including medical experts, police, people with lived and living experience, drug user organisations, families, service providers and other stakeholders. The government has said the goal is to hear a range of perspectives and “build consensus on the way NSW deals with drug use and harms”. Minns said: Drugs are a health issue. They’re also a justice issue. They’re a police issue. They can be a child protection and social services issue. They are an education issue. They’re an issue for people that want a safe and sociable neighbourhood. The best hope of lasting change on any question that particularly affects the question like drug policy, is finding points where we agree, and that we can share a common ground. Australia has voted with 156 other countries at the United Nations to demand the end of Israel’s “unlawful presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territory as rapidly as possible”, marking a return to the position for the first time in more than two decades. A total of 157 members, including Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom, voted to support the resolution, while eight, including Argentina, Israel and the US, voted against it. Seven others abstained. Australia’s ambassador to the UN, James Larsen, explained Australia would be supporting the resolution, titled the ‘Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine’, to reflect a desire for the international community “to build momentum towards” achieving a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. Larsen said: A two-state solution remains the only hope of breaking the endless cycle of violence, the only hope to see a secure and prosperous future for both peoples. The resolution demands Israel “comply strictly with its obligations under international law”, referring to the ICJ ruling in July this year. It also rejects any attempt at “demographic or territorial change” in the Gaza strip. It also supports a 2025 high-level international conference aimed at devising and implementing a two-state solution. A spokesperson for the foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, said while Australia was a “constructive middle power”, it looked to achieve the best outcomes possible at the UN. Wong’s spokesperson said: We don’t always get everything we want. But if, on balance, we believe the resolution will contribute to peace and a two-state solution, we will vote for it. On our own, Australia has few ways to move the dial in the Middle East. Our only hope is working within the international community to push for an end to the cycle of violence and work toward a two-state solution. See more: Two-thirds of over-25s say they feel better about saying no to alcohol than a decade ago Almost two-thirds of Australians over the age of 25 feel more empowered to say no to alcohol than they did 10 years ago, according to new data. Research by Drinkwise points to a shift in attitudes around drinking – the same number, 62%, said they would not feel self-conscious if they chose not to drink when others were drinking. But the data also showed drinkers tend to drink more when they’re not footing the bill – a nod to the Christmas party season that Simon Strahan, CEO at DrinkWise, says highlights the need for workplaces to be mindful of a changing drinking culture, especially given 53% of Australians want to cut back on alcohol. He said the research demonstrates that workers increasingly expect alternatives to alcohol at work functions. We continue to see positive shifts in attitudes and behaviours towards alcohol, with parties and celebrations the main occasion where people alternate between full and lower or zero strength alcohol (71%). This demonstrates a growing awareness of the benefits of more responsible drinking habits. Man charged with alleged assault at Sydney airport A man charged with allegedly assaulting a security officer at Sydney airport is expected to appear in Downing Centre local court today, according to an AFP media release. The man, 27, allegedly forced open an aerobridge door at the international terminal and boarded an aircraft on 28 October 2024. Flight crew members spoke to the man, who then exited the aircraft and allegedly assaulted a security officer, causing him to become unconscious, according to the AFP. The man was arrested and issued with a court attendance notice for assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment. GDP data likely to show growth rise even as per-capita output extends decline National accounts for the September quarter are out this morning from the ABS, which should signal the economy’s heartbeat is strengthening. Economists have seen most components already – we are two-thirds into the December quarter, after all – so they can pencil in what gross domestic product (GDP) trends roughly look like. They expect GDP growth to have quickened from 0.2% in the June quarter to 0.5% in the July-September period. On an annual basis, growth should come in about 1.1%, marginally better than the June quarter’s 1% pace. (There may be some revisions.) A lot of attention has focused on extra government spending, which the ABS reported yesterday added a chunky 0.7 percentage points to quarterly growth. In other words, without that increase, the economy would have shrunk. Some of that spending looked a bit splurgy. There were federal rebates for energy and even larger ones and other outlays in Queensland and Western Australia as governments in those two states headed for the polls. It didn’t save the Miles Labor government in the sunshine state; WA’s elections are next March. There will be some focus, too, on the likelihood per-capita GDP retreated for a record seventh consecutive quarter. Still, an accelerating overall economy means job openings should remain relatively plentiful for a while. Just don’t expect an interest rate cut from the Reserve Bank next week – and perhaps not until May. Look out for the data dump at 11.30am Aedt. Gender divide on nuclear reactors as inquiry heats up Women are strongly opposed to nuclear energy and are most concerned any consideration of the controversial power source will delay the switch to renewables, polling shows. A national survey released today to coincide with a federal inquiry found a stark gender divide, with a mere 26% of women saying nuclear would be good for Australia, compared with 51% of men. But only one in three men surveyed were willing to live near a nuclear plant. Almost two-thirds (63%) of women said they do not want to live near a nuclear plant and more than half (57%) do not think transporting radioactive waste is worth the risk. The DemosAU poll of 6709 adults between 2 July and 24 November also found a higher percentage of men (42%) said they were concerned about the safety of the technology than those who were not concerned. The findings come as a federal inquiry into nuclear power generation is scheduled to hold a public hearing in Melbourne with industry, health and climate witnesses listed to speak. Community leaders, unions and grassroots organisations plan to gather outside to declare “our shared energy future is renewable, not radioactive”. - Australian Associated Press Read more from our own Lisa Cox here: Renewable hydrogen tech could give green light to jobs: CSIRO Making equipment to produce renewable hydrogen could help Australia lead the world in the clean energy resource sector and unlock up to 4,000 jobs and $1.7bn by 2050, a study says. The research, released by CSIRO Futures today, also warned the nation had a small “window of opportunity” to take advantage of its head start before other countries recognised the market’s potential. The findings come weeks after the release of the national hydrogen strategy 2024, which outlined a target to produce 15m tonnes of green hydrogen in Australia annually by 2050. Electrolysers are specialised equipment that use renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen, creating hydrogen without producing carbon emissions. Demand for renewable hydrogen was rising worldwide, the study found, as nations sought to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Australia could create $1.7bn in revenue and 3,974 jobs by 2050 if it manufactured hydrogen electrolysers, CSIRO’s hydrogen industry mission leader, Dr Patrick Hartley, said. Installing the equipment could also create another 1,000 jobs, the analysis found, and an additional $1.2bn. - Australian Associated Press More than half of all Australia National University poll respondents lack confidence in Labor As mentioned at the top, a new poll out today has some concerning findings for the Labor government. The study by the Australian National University found that 17.4% of respondents said they had no confidence at all in the federal government; 44.8% had “not very much confidence”; 32.8% “quite a lot” and just 5% “a great deal of confidence”. However, there were some more encouraging pointers for Labor, with more favouring Anthony Albanese as prime minister over Peter Dutton. Here’s the full report: Labor MP says Australians travelling to South Korea should check travel advice MP Stephen Jones has urged Australians to check travel advice to South Korea “given things are moving so rapidly” after the country’s president declared, and then rescinded, martial law overnight. He said on ABC Radio National this morning: [It’s a] very fluid situation over there at the moment. We’re urging Australians to just check in with the travel advice. Clearly, we’ve got concerns about what’s going on over there. Our number one concern is for the safety of Australians who are contemplating a trip over there. Just watch the travel advice is the best advice I can give at this moment, given things are moving so rapidly. There have been no updates to the government’s Smartraveller advice for South Korea since 9 July 2024, which advises to “exercise normal safety precautions in South Korea”. Transport costs still taking 16% of household income over last quarter More on transport costs: The falling price of fuel had a significant impact, the Transport Affordability Index found, reducing transport costs by an average of $338 across all households. But cuts to public transport fares made the biggest impact, forcing down transport prices in Queensland, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Only Queensland’s public transport price cuts were designed to be permanent, however, with fares in other states free on a temporary basis. Despite 50-cent fares up north, Hobart claimed the title of lowest annual transport costs, followed by Darwin, while Sydney, Melbourne and Perth registered the highest costs. Transport costs also fell across seven regional areas surveyed for the index, with transport in Alice Springs, Bunbury and Geelong costing the most at over $23,000 a year, while Townsville and Wagga Wagga registered the cheapest bills at just over $20,000 a year. Even though costs fell in most cities and towns, the Australian Automobile Association’s managing director, Michael Bradley, said transport consumed 16.1% of household income during the quarter and remained a major drain on family budgets. “Transport costs are significantly higher than they were before the (Covid) pandemic,” he said. “The typical Australian household’s transport costs have risen from 13.9% of its income in September 2019 to 16.1% in September 2024.” - Australian Associated Press Deals on the bus go down and down: transport costs plunge The cost of getting around has fallen for the first time in two years, a study has shown, but households in some states are faring better than others thanks to public transport discounts. The Australian Automobile Association detailed the extent of the savings in its Transport Affordability Index today, revealing travel costs fell by an average of $921 a year for those living in capital cities. But Brisbanites were significantly better off than people in other states, saving $3316 a year on average, thanks to the introduction of 50-cent fares for public transport. On the other side of the ledger, Sydneysiders fared the worst, with transport costs rising in the city by $107 a year due to high toll prices, (as Elias Visontay reported earlier in the blog). The report, prepared quarterly by the motoring body, analysed household transport costs including registration, servicing, insurance, car loans, fuel and public transport to determine spending. - Australian Associated Press More to come in the next post. Full Story on Labor’s end-of-year legislation rush Parliament has wrapped for 2024 and politicians are now back in their electorates for the summer. Labor ended the year on a high, striking deals to pass more than 30 pieces of legislation through the Senate in just one day. And while the sitting year is over, speculation is still running hot over when the prime minister will call the federal election. In today’s Full Story podcast, Nour Haydar speaks to chief political correspondent Paul Karp about what the government achieved – and compromised – in the final frenetic sitting day, and what Anthony Albanese could now be weighing up as he decides when voters will head to the polls. The Greens have announced a new election policy to provide women with free access to contraceptives. The policy would mean women would not have to pay out of pocket for oral contraceptives, including more modern pills with fewer side effects, as well as long-acting reversible contraceptives including intrauterine devices (IUDs). Under the policy, the Greens would allocate an ongoing and indexed $250m a year to make medicines regulator approved non-PBS contraceptives free, as well as removing the PBS co-payment to make PBS listed contraceptive methods free. It would also create a contraceptive counselling medicare benefits item. The party’s spokesperson on women, Larissa Waters, says the policy would help “empower women to make decisions about bodily autonomy despite a difficult financial climate”: Our policy would make sure people can access the contraception that works for them, regardless of their bank balance and whether they live in the city, the country, or are studying on a visa. With abortion rights in Queensland potentially under threat it has never been more important to ensure women are able to avoid unwanted pregnancies. More on the new Malaysia-based maritime institute: The government is contributing $1.78m over four years to support the institute, which will train regional government officials on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, broader maritime law and ocean governance, awareness of maritime domains and environmental protection. Wong’s Malaysia visit is part of a short regional tour that also took in Singapore, where she joins the defence minister, Richard Marles, and trade minister, Don Farrell, for annual talks with their Singaporean counterparts. Speaking from Singapore yesterday, Marles acknowledged tensions elsewhere in the region around the Taiwan straits and downplayed the decision of Taiwan’s president, Lai Ching-Te, to tour US Pacific territories in a move some criticised as needlessly provocative towards China. He told ABC TV: We don’t want to see any unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan straits, and our focus is on doing everything we can in terms of exercising our international voice around promoting stability and peace in and around the Taiwan straits, in and around Taiwan. Australia launches new maritime security educational institute in Malaysia Australia is funding a new Malaysia-based maritime institute to teach officials from around the Indo-Pacific about the international laws of the sea and encourage stability, especially in the South China Sea, where competing territorial claims have seen clashes between China and its neighbours. The foreign minister, Penny Wong, will today launch the Australian National Centre for Ocean Resources and Security (Ancors) South-east Asia Maritime Institute, to be based on the University of Wollongong’s remote campus in Kuala Lumpur. Rules and norms are vital for our shared maritime region and the countries of our region make an ongoing contribution to maintaining and promoting them. The institute will deliver training to officials from across the region on complex maritime legal and policy topics. It will nurture leaders and help further our collective contribution to a peaceful, stable and prosperous Indo-Pacific region. More to come in the next post. Anglicare’s executive director, Kasy Chambers, said Australia’s employment system needs to be overhauled to put support ahead of punishment: Australians have heard a lot of rhetoric over the years about full employment and a fair go. But our snapshot shows that the employment system has given up on people who need the most help to find work. These can be people with disabilities, people who didn’t finish year 12, or older workers who lost their jobs later in life. They need entry-level jobs to get a start, but there aren’t enough of these to meet demand in any part of the country. For each entry-level role, there are 33 people looking for work. With such tight numbers, people with barriers to work barely stand a chance. It’s no wonder that many are long-term unemployed. Each year, we find that the same people are being left behind by the job market Same people locked out of job market every year: Anglicare Australia Anglicare Australia is today releasing its annual jobs availability snapshot, which shows that the job market has been locking the same people out of work every year. The snapshot measures how many jobs are available for people who don’t have qualifications or work experience. It found: For every entry-level job, there are 33 people out of work. The situation is worst in the NT, where there are 65 people for every job, followed by Tasmania where there are 50. Around two-thirds (62%) of people out of work are long-term unemployed. These Australians spend almost four years looking for work. Thank you to Martin Farrer for kicking off the blog this morning. I’ll be taking it for the day – if there is anything you don’t want the blog to miss, send it my way on X @At_Raf_ More on that Cbus report from AAP: Paddy Crumlin, the former CFMEU ACT president Jason O’Mara, and the CFMEU’s legal director, Lucy Weber, were reassessed against both the fund’s former “fit and proper person” test and a more stringent one recommended by the review authors, Deloitte. All passed, as did sitting board members. “Cbus will now work with Deloitte, as required by the licence conditions, to develop an action plan to address each of the recommendations in the review to be approved by APRA,” Cbus said in a statement, referring to the financial regulator. The fund in recent years has swallowed smaller industry funds for media, energy and electrical workers, increasing its membership by 10% to 900,000 members. It is the seventh-largest industry super fund by total funds under management and the 10th-largest overall. The CFMEU’s construction arm was placed into administration in August after allegations of criminal conduct and organised crime links on job sites. The Fair Work Ombudsman is conducting more than 40 investigations into the building and construction industry involving most CFMEU branches across Australia, as well as its officials and employers. A super fund heavyweight’s partnerships with the embattled construction union CFMEU may not have been in the best interests of its 900,000 members, a review has concluded, according to the Australian Associated Press. Cbus, which is chaired by former treasurer Wayne Swan, released an independent review of its governance and board members yesterday, instigated amid heavy scrutiny of the CFMEU’s construction arm. The fund accepted all 26 recommendations, including overhauling how it decides and documents extensive payments to the union. Nearly $1m in payments were made to the union’s various branches in the past financial year, including for rental of premises in Geelong and Perth and cross promotions. But the review found evaluation of the partnership was dominated by informal processes, including spoken feedback. It says: This is not to question intent or whether ultimately decisions are in the best financial interests of members or not. It’s just that the documentation, systems and processes do not allow for that decision to be concluded clearly. But it cleared the appointments of union-linked board members, including the CFMEU national president, Paddy Crumlin. Sydney the only city paying higher transport costs over last quarter Transport costs have eased for all Australians – except for Sydneysiders – as falling fuel prices and cheaper public transport fares combined with rising wages. Typical Australian household spending on transport declined by 2.6% in the September quarter, the largest decrease in transport inflation since 2017, despite the broader measure of inflation across society (the consumer price index) climbing by 0.2% in the quarter. Analysis of transport affordability, produced by the Australian Automobile Association (AAA), found that the consumer relief was driven by an average $338 reduction in a typical household’s fuel bill, coupled with cuts to public transport ticket costs. This includes temporary free transport offers in Canberra and Darwin, as well as Queensland blanket 50c fares which were introduced in August but have since become permanent. However Sydney bucked the trend as the only location in the country where household spending on transport rose. This was because higher toll road charges, which have annual increases baked in, offset the benefits of cheaper fuel. Brisbane’s annualised typical household transport costs dropped by $3,316, or 12.5%; Canberra’s by $1,799, or 7.2%; and Darwin’s by $1,416, or 6%. Across the five other state capitals, the average change in transport costs was only 0.7%. AAA’s managing director, Michael Bradley, said transport costs were still significantly higher than before the pandemic, with a typical household’s costs rising from 13.9% of its income in September 2019 to 16.1% in September 2024. Bradley said: Transport is a significant and unavoidable expense, and rising transport expenditure is also one of the key drivers of inflation. Governments at all levels must consider these cost pressures when formulating policy. Almost five decades on from the “gruesome” and “brutal” alleged murder of two women in their home, a suspect in the investigation into the frenzied stabbings has touched down in Australia, Australian Associated Press reports. Perry Kouroumblis landed in Melbourne late on Tuesday night after being extradited from Italy, marking the first time in about eight years he has stepped foot on Australian soil. Police were set to interview Kouroumblis on Wednesday and he was expected to face Melbourne magistrates court later in the day. Victoria police said in a statement that he will formally be charged with two counts of murder and one count of rape during this court appearance. He maintains his innocence. He was arrested at Rome’s Leonardo Da Vinci airport in September in connection to the alleged killing of Suzanne Armstrong, 28, and Susan Bartlett, 27, in January 1977. Dubbed the “Easey Street murders”, the friends were found dead with more than two dozen stab wounds in their home on Easey Street in Collingwood in Melbourne’s inner north. Good morning and welcome to our live news blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories after which Rafqa Touma will be your host. Cbus, the super fund heavyweight chaired by former treasurer Wayne Swan, has released an independent review of its governance and board members which concludes that partnerships with the CFMEU’s construction arm may not have been in the best interests of its members. More details coming up. A day after our Essential poll revealed voters thought the government had done poorly on the key issues of housing affordability and wages, a new survey shows support for federal Labor is at Scott Morrison-type low levels, with no more than six months before the next election. We have the details, plus today’s Full Story podcast looking at the state of play in Canberra. The man wanted for questioning by police over the Easey Street murders in 1977 has landed in Melbourne overnight. Perry Kouroumblis, 65, a Greek Australian, has been extradited from Italy to face questioning by police today over the alleged killings of Suzanne Armstrong and Susan Bartlett in Melbourne. He maintains his innocence. More coming up. And there’s good news for commuters – transport costs have seen their biggest fall in years. Everywhere except for one city, that is. More on that soon."

          "headline": "Tamils arriving in UK after three years stranded on Diego Garcia speak of relief",
          "bodyText": "Dozens of people stranded in hellish conditions for more than three years on the remote Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia have arrived in the UK and told of their relief that their journey is over. Lawyers and campaigners hailed the arrival of 47 Sri Lankan Tamils on Monday night as a “big day for justice”, with a further eight arriving on Tuesday morning from Rwanda, where they had been receiving medical treatment. Twelve children were among them. They are staying in a hotel on the outskirts of London, where some of the children were seen running around excitedly on Tuesday. The group seemed relaxed about the freezing temperatures and unfamiliar surroundings. “We cannot believe we are finally in the UK,” said one man. “We feel we have reached paradise.” Most found themselves in Diego Garcia – part of the Chagos Islands that the UK recently returned to Mauritius – in October 2021 after a boat in which they were travelling hoping to reach Canada to claim asylum got into difficulty. “If our lives had been good in our home country we never would have set off on a dangerous journey across the ocean in a leaking boat,” said another man. “I thought we would all die in the sea … I kept asking myself if it was better to try to save the life of one person on board or for us all to die together in the sea.” Their arrival on the tropical island was viewed as a headache for successive home secretaries, who feared that bringing them to the UK would open a new migration route. There have been long-running legal battles about their fate, with a judge and legal teams flying out to the island to hear a legal challenge to determine whether the Tamils were being unlawfully detained. “We thought we would stay on this island for three days but we ended up staying there for three years,” said one woman sadly. On Monday, a government spokesperson described the move as a “one-off” due to the exceptional nature of the situation. “This government inherited a deeply troubling situation that remained unresolved under the last administration for years,” the spokesperson said. Tessa Gregory, of the UK law firm Leigh Day, which represents some of the Tamils, said the group had “spent 38 months detained in the most squalid of conditions”, adding: “We hope our clients will now be able to seek safe haven and begin to rebuild their lives.” One woman said: “I was born the day my parents arrived in a refugee camp in India and have spent my whole life either in the refugee camp in India or in the camp in Diego Garcia. To be a refugee is to lead an incomplete life. The reason we went through this difficult journey is in the hope that our children do not have to be refugees.” They had given up on ever being set free from the island until UK lawyers got involved in their cases. “Until then nobody in the whole wide world knew we were trapped on this island,” said one man. “Then we started to glimpse hope.” The UK government has shut down the possibility of future asylum seekers arriving in the UK via Diego Garcia. Any arrivals there from now on will be sent to the island of Saint Helena, 5,000 miles away. When the deal to return the Chagos Islands to Mauritius excluding the US military base on Diego Garcia is finalised, any arrivals seeking asylum will have their claims processed in Mauritius. While the Tamils were on the island living in rat-infested, leaking tents there were mass suicide attempts, many hunger strikes and numerous incidents of self-harm –along with allegations of sexual assault and harassment within the camp. Two men with criminal convictions and another under investigation remain on the island. Eight of the Tamils have been granted international protection while on Diego Garcia. The group have been granted six months’ entry to the UK outside the immigration rules and will not be allowed to work. It is not known what will happen to them after that. Simon Robinson, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, who also represents some of the group, said: “We are delighted to welcome our clients to the UK. The decision to grant them leave to remain and allow them to enter the UK has brought to an end years of detention in inhumane conditions. “It is a big day for justice, and an opportunity for a fresh start for our clients.” He also called for further scrutiny of how the Tamils were treated on the island."

          "headline": "Who controls what territory in Syria?",
          "bodyText": "Islamist-led rebels seized large swathes of territory in Syria, including Aleppo, in a swift offensive that began last week and reversed years of regime gains in the 13-year conflict. Here is a look at who controls what territory in Syria, where war broke out in 2011 after the government’s repression of peaceful pro-democracy protests and spiralled into a complex conflict drawing in foreign armies and jihadists. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham The Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) alliance, led by al-Qaida’s former Syria branch, dominates the country’s last rebel bastion in the north-west. Last Wednesday, HTS and its allies launched a major offensive snatching Syria’s second city Aleppo and dozens of towns and villages from government control, after years of regime gains in successive Russian-backed military campaigns. Beyond Aleppo, rebels also pushed into central Syria’s Hama province, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor reporting rebel shelling on Hama city. The group controls swathes of Idlib province and territory in Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. The rebels say they are working in a joint operations room with their allies. The government Damascus initially lost control over much of Syria to opposition factions, Kurdish fighters and Islamic State (IS) group jihadists. However, the army gradually clawed back ground with support from key ally Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah group, while Russian intervention since September 2015 turned the tide in the government’s favour. Damascus controlled most of Syria, but it lost Aleppo city and swathes of the country’s northwest to the latest rebel offensive. It still holds the country’s south, including Sweida province, where anti-government protests have been occurring regularly for more than a year. The government also controls central Homs province, most of neighbouring Hama, all of Tartus and most of Latakia provinces on the west coast, and Damascus and its surrounding province. A chunk of Aleppo province in the north is still in government hands, as well parts of Raqqa province and around half of the eastern Deir ez-Zur province. Government forces are supported by local groups and pro-Iran fighters, including Hezbollah. Iran says it only deploys military advisers in Syria at the invitation of Damascus. Russian troops are stationed in several government-held areas, including the Hmeimim airbase near the city of Latakia. Moscow says more than 63,000 Russian troops have served in Syria, though the number of soldiers currently present in the country is unclear. Kurdish fighters In 2012, government forces withdrew from Kurdish-majority areas in Syria’s north and east, paving the way for Kurds to consolidate control. They established a semi-autonomous administration there and have gradually expanded territorial control as US-backed Kurdish-led fighters battled IS, dislodging the extremists from their last scraps of Syrian territory in 2019. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), formed in 2015, are considered the Kurds’ de facto army. The forces are an alliance of fighters including Kurds, Syriac Christians and Arab Muslim factions. The SDF holds around a quarter of Syrian territory, and is considered the second most powerful military force after the army. It controls most of Raqqa province including the city, a former IS stronghold, half of neighbouring Deir ez-Zur, and part of Aleppo province. It also controls Hasakeh province in the north-east, though Syrian government forces are also present there including in the cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli. US-led coalition forces, which entered Syria in 2014 to fight IS, have set up bases in the Al-Omar oilfield, the country’s largest, as well as the Conoco gas field – both in Kurdish-controlled territory. US personnel are also stationed in Kurdish-controlled Hasakeh and Raqqa provinces. In 2016, they set up a remote base in southern Syria’s strategic Al-Tanf region, bordering Jordan and Iraq. Turkey and allied factions Days after the HTS attack, Ankara-backed groups attacked Kurdish-led fighters in the Tal Rifaat enclave, wedged between territory they control and government-held areas. The Ankara-backed factions, which control territory along the Turkish border, seized the strategic town of Tal Rifaat and nearby villages in Aleppo province, said the Observatory. Since 2016, Turkey has carried out successive ground operations to expel Kurdish forces from parts of Syria’s northern border. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has long sought to establish a “safe zone” 30 kilometres (20 miles) deep along the frontier. Pro-Turkish forces control a section of the border from Jarabulus to Afrin in Aleppo province, including major towns such as Al-Bab and Azaz. Turkey and its Syrian proxies also hold a 120km (75-mile) stretch of border territory from Ras al-Ain in Hasakeh province to Tal Abyad in Raqqa. Islamic State group IS militants proclaimed a “caliphate” in June 2014 across swathes of Syria and Iraq, installing a reign of terror. It was defeated territorially in Syria in 2019 but its remnants continue to wage deadly attacks, particularly from desert hideouts. Its fighters are particularly active in the vast Syrian desert, launching attacks against the SDF and the army."

          "headline": "Tori Amos on trauma, Trump and Neil Gaiman: ‘It’s a heartbreaking grief’",
          "bodyText": "By the third UK lockdown, Tori Amos was wondering if she would ever play live again. At her remote house in Cornwall, where we meet, she began mourning the loss of connection with her audience. When the US singer and songwriter is on tour, giving her famously passionate performances, hundreds of letters pour in every day, requesting songs. “I try to read as many as I can, and we change the show every night, except the bookends. Anything else is up for grabs.” Her relationship with her fans has always been collaborative. They tell her things. They trust her. In person, she has an open-book quality that immediately draws you in. When I arrive at her place – a detached but unassuming house upfront, and a warren of more recently built workshops at the back, filled with beautiful pianos, a massive mixing desk and the harpsichord she played on her album Boys for Pele – we have lunch with her husband and sound engineer, Mark Hawley. The conversation roams through football, raving, legal training (their 24-year-old daughter Tash is studying law in Washington DC) and how good the pumpkin soup is. Amos has a friendly air, considering everyone thoughtfully from behind her glasses. At the start of her career she was often referred to as kooky, but she contains multitudes. Literally. She has 11 muses, she says – spirit guides – that help her creatively. But she’s definitely as much at home in the real world. It takes practicality and resilience to go from being a piano prodigy at five to having a thriving career at 61 in the notoriously difficult and often sexist music industry. Her work draws people into her confidence. The first single from her first solo album, Little Earthquakes, in 1992, was Me and a Gun, a haunting a cappella account of her own experience of sexual trauma, breathtakingly direct in its lyrics and delivery. “It was me and a gun / And a man on my back / And I sang Holy holy / As he buttoned down his pants”. In her 15 studio albums since, she has written about all manner of things – Ocean to Ocean in 2021 was inspired by the death of her mother a few years earlier, as well as by the pandemic and the storming of the Capitol on 6 January. But that achingly open first album, its songs including classics such as Silent All These Years and Girl (“She’s been everybody else’s girl / Maybe one day she’ll be her own”), unlocked a door for her fans. Ever since, they have streamed through it, and her shows have provided a place for them to express their collective trauma. When she finally got back on the road in 2022, after five years – her longest break from touring since Little Earthquakes – that connection with her audience resumed, and is powerfully captured on her new album, Diving Deep Live. “Some had been working in healthcare. Some on the frontline had suffered what I would say were terrible outbursts from the public.” When people were making song requests, they were “usually wrapping it around an experience … Once you read what somebody has been through and they have attached a song to it, that song expands. I begin to see it in a different way, because I had no idea that this song helped this person when their partner committed suicide. Or this person sees this song in a certain way because it made them smile when they weren’t feeling well.” In July, she was in the US, where she heard conversations that left her unsurprised by November’s election result. When she arrived back in the UK, her manager, John Witherspoon, told her about allegations that had been made against the writer Neil Gaiman, her close friend ever since Little Earthquakes. (She mentioned him in the song Tear in Your Hand – “If you need me, me and Neil’ll be hangin’ out with the dream king” – and they have collaborated on all sorts of projects since.) The Gaiman allegations were made on Master, a podcast by Tortoise, the first episodes of which were released on 3 July this year. Rachel Johnson and fellow journalist Paul Caruana Galizia spoke first to two women, and eventually to five in total, who allege sexual misconduct by Gaiman. The podcast begins with a young woman called Scarlett, who had been sent to Gaiman’s house to babysit. His child turned out to be on a playdate, so Scarlett, who was 22 at the time, was alone with Gaiman. He ran her a bath and then, she alleges, sexually assaulted her within hours of first meeting him. He says he had established consent for their physical contact in the bath (in his account it was only cuddling and making out) and denies all allegations of sexual misconduct by all five women. I ask Amos how she felt when she first heard the allegations. “Shocked,” she says. A long pause. “And if the allegations are true, that’s not the Neil that I knew, that’s not the friend that I knew, nor a friend that I ever want to know. So in some ways it’s a heartbreaking grief. I never saw that side of Neil. Neither did my crew. And my crew has seen a lot.” She says it’s devastating for the women involved, and I ask if she has listened to the podcasts. “No,” she says. “But I’ve read …” She looks as if she’s about to cry. “He’s godfather to Tash.” Her eyes well up. She struggles to contain herself. “My manager was the one who told me, because the girls” – Tash and her cousin, Kelsey – “found out about it from a paper. Tash said, ‘Kels, we’re not telling Mom’ – they call me ‘T-Bird’, but she might have said ‘Mom’ here. But she said, ‘We’re not telling Mom right now, we’re going straight to John [Witherspoon], because we don’t know, first of all, the legality. We have to work through this, and it’s the holiday weekend [4 July is Independence Day in the US], and Mom has to work through this.’ “And so John said, ‘I will speak to her as soon as she gets off the plane,’ and that’s what happened. “I haven’t publicly said anything because: what do I say? I didn’t hire the nannies. I wasn’t there. I’ve never met these people. And I’ve never received a letter – of the thousands of letters I’ve gotten in 33 years – I’ve never received anything that was about Neil, except praise for his work and how much his work meant to people. That’s all I ever knew.” She looks crestfallen and hollowed out, as anyone would, but especially someone who has spent so much of their career advocating for survivors. One of the women who has made allegations against Gaiman says he mentioned Amos to her, and said he could get her full-time work on the singer’s rape helpline – a reference to the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network (RAINN), the largest anti-sexual violence organisation in the US. Amos was the first spokesperson for the organisation (not a co-founder, as she is often described), which was set up after a show she did in the US midwest in 1994. During her performance of Me and a Gun, “a young woman – a girl, in her teens, I believe – collapsed and was taken, of course, backstage, and I went to see her afterwards. She said to me something like: can I get a job, anything, so I don’t have to go home, because my stepfather raped me last night, and he’ll rape me tonight when I get in? And I said, naively, ‘Of course. Of course.’ And my tour manager called management back in California and said, ‘T’s made up her mind to do this. To take this girl.’ And they called back and said ‘she’ll be arrested for kidnapping’. “And I watched that girl walk out the door. And I’ve never seen her again. Or heard from her. Nothing. Or any reference to her. And I was able to work with the women at the record label at the time – they were feminists and good women at Atlantic records – and they paired us with Scott Berkowitz, who had started the Rape Crisis idea of connecting a hotline across the country. It was a joining of forces to get that off the ground.” Does she feel the world has improved, generally, for women in the 30 years since RAINN began? “No,” she says bluntly, before adding that there are “places for women to reach out to that were harder to find back then”. On that night in 1994, there was nowhere “to direct that young girl to, and that was the motivating factor, being so frustrated … So I think when we ask if things have improved, I think there are services that have improved, but the fact we’re looking at an administration whereby there seems to be almost a gender apartheid happening, and where misogyny is common practice … I just didn’t think, after the last four years of the Trump administration, that women would have to face this again.” We turn to her experiences as a young musician, growing up in Maryland. Did she have a moment at the piano where she knew this was what she would be doing for the rest of her life? She says her cousin Martha, who was a teenager when she was a toddler, recently told her that watching her play the piano with both hands at two and a half was like something out of the Twilight Zone. At five, Amos began attending the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins University – one of the youngest student ever to be accepted – studying alongside teenagers, until she grew frustrated with the way she was being taught, losing her place at 11. At 13, she started playing in gay bars, building an enormous repertoire of songs. “I really think the piano became my first – no, maybe my Mom was my first friend,” she says, “but the piano became a true friend that has never let me down. She has never betrayed me. I have betrayed her.” In what way? “When I started listening to some of the boys’ club in the record industry in my 20s and instead of exploring my original voice and finding out what that is, I started chasing things on the radio.” This was when she made her first album, in Los Angeles, as part of a group called Y Kant Tori Read. It was not well received. “Someone called me a third-rate Pat Benatar. But I would say I was at least a fifth-rate Benatar. “That failure took me to a place of such lowness, where I heard laughter in this restaurant on Santa Monica Boulevard that I would go to. It was kind of an industry hangout, and I heard laughter as I walked past. Not that anybody knew who I was, but LA at the time could be a very small place. Especially if you’re at the bottom of the food chain, you know? “So in that moment, with tears rolling into my spaghetti, I just said to myself, ‘Tori, how did you manage to go from prodigy to bimbo?’ Billboard had referred to the music as ‘bimbo’. It was such an awakening.” Does she really think people were laughing at her? “Oh yeah, I do. Because the one thing that people in LA do not wanna catch is failure. More than anything else in that town, I really believe that that is the plague for them.” But without that failure, she couldn’t have written Little Earthquakes, and all the albums since; couldn’t have had a massive international hit with Cornflake Girl (likely the only song about female genital mutilation ever to trouble the charts); couldn’t have written the wildly experimental album Boys for Pele, and seen a remix of its song, Professional Widow, become a dance classic (and perhaps the ultimate anthem of enthusiastic consent, with its refrain, “Honey bring it close to my lips”). She couldn’t have experienced some of the greatest critical acclaim of her career for Ocean to Ocean. “I had to go through that,” she says. “It was sort of my moment of moment, after years of having let my instrument down, turning my back on it, because I drank the Kool-Aid.” Does she still feel she has to battle sexism now? “Well, that’s an interesting question,” she says. “We don’t know what we’re facing, with a president who seems to be fireproof. So, with the population feeling emboldened – some of them – I don’t know what kind of behaviour we’re going to have to deal with. But, in some ways, because of where I am in my life, I’m sure that I have met men who treat me differently.” To the way they treat other women? “Yes. And is that because they dared not show it to me? Because I won’t tolerate it.” Her steely side comes out. “I won’t tolerate it. I won’t tolerate it with the crew …” You won’t let it happen around you? “No. No.” And people know that? “Oh yeah. Yes. But possibly there are wolves in sheep’s clothing.” She gives me a meaningful look. “And clearly we talked about that earlier.” Diving Deep Live (Decca Records) is released on 6 December."

Voters are underwhelmed by Labor’s performance in the two critically important policy areas of housing affordability and improving wages. We’re also reporting on the father who complained to Spotify about his children being exposed to gambling ads, the News Corp “scoops” on gas-fired power, some Democrats turning on Joe Biden for pardoning his son, and there are renewed hostilities between Lebanon and Israel less than a week after the ceasefire began. Australia ‘Non-fixable’ | The beloved Neighbours star Ian Smith, who has played Harold Bishop in the soap for decades, has announced he has been diagnosed with a “non-fixable” type of lung cancer. Cost of living | The Albanese government has been rated “poor” by 53% of voters on its efforts to contain housing costs, according to today’s Guardian Essential poll, while ministers also received surprisingly little credit for increasing wages, with 35% saying they had done a “poor” job on that score as well. Climate 200 has reported a surge in first-time donors after a donation-matching campaign comparing Peter Dutton to Donald Trump. Stream of anger | An Australian father has written a formal complaint to the music streaming company Spotify after his children were allegedly exposed to gambling ads while listening to Disney classics. Thorpe apology | Senator Lidia Thorpe has apologised to Pauline Hanson for describing her as a “convicted” racist, clarifying she was mistaken about a civil finding of racial discrimination. Water ‘shock’ | Lawyers for Aboriginal residents of a remote town in the Northern Territory say it is “shocking and disappointing” that the territory’s government is trying to overturn a court ruling which found it was legally required to provide them safe drinking water. World Syria struggle | Iranian-backed Iraqi militias crossed into eastern Syria overnight in an attempt to shore up struggling forces loyal to Damascus, battling an insurgency that has swept much of the country’s north-west as Islamist militants seized control of Aleppo. Here’s our explainer on this complex story. Rockets fired | Israel has carried out airstrikes in Lebanon in response to Hezbollah rocket fire in the most serious attacks since the ceasefire began last week. ‘Selfish move’ | President Joe Biden has been criticised by some supporters for the “selfish move” of pardoning his son Hunter, although the White House has defended his actions. Donald Trump has again hinted he could pardon the January 6 rioters. Au revoir | The French government appears likely to fall this week after leftwing and far-right parties lodged motions of no confidence over the welfare cuts driven through by the prime minister, Michel Barnier. Here’s what will happen if Barnier loses a confidence vote. Georgia arrest | Police have arrested a prominent opposition leader after using water cannon and teargas to scatter anti-government protesters who rallied outside parliament for a fourth consecutive night. Climate crimes | A handful of countries should be held legally responsible for the ongoing impacts of climate change, representatives of vulnerable nations have told judges at the international court of justice. Full Story Death by Taser: the trial of police officer Kristian White Reged Ahmad speaks to Jordyn Beazely about the manslaughter conviction of Kristian White and the unresolved questions surrounding how police officers interact with vulnerable people. In-depth “Dark ages,” said the front-page headline in Sydney’s Daily Telegraph, while the Courier-Mail said, “Step on the gas.” Underneath was an article exhorting the government to ensure more gas-fired power stations were built to avoid the prospect of blackouts. What it didn’t say until, the reader turned to the inside pages, was that the “stories” were advertorials paid for by the fossil fuel lobby. Our climate and environment, editor Adam Morton, deconstructs the claims.

          "headline": "West Ham may approach Sérgio Conceição to replace Julen Lopetegui",
          "bodyText": "West Ham are considering Sérgio Conceição as a replacement for Julen Lopetegui, whose future as manager is under growing pressure after his team’s 5-2 defeat at home against Arsenal last Saturday. The Guardian revealed last month that the Spaniard’s position hinged on results against Newcastle and Arsenal, with defeats in both outings likely to have resulted in his dismissal. Lopetegui, hired as David Moyes’s replacement last summer, met the challenge by recording an impressive 2-0 win at Newcastle. Yet West Ham were unable to build on that performance when they hosted Arsenal, who sailed into a 4-0 lead inside 36 minutes after capitalising on some woeful defending. The manner of that latest collapse has placed Lopetegui under renewed scrutiny before the trip to Leicester on Tuesday night and the home game against Wolves next Monday. Although beating Newcastle has bought the 58-year-old time, it is understood West Ham have been identifying potential replacements. There is serious interest in Conceição, who left Porto last summer. The 50-year-old Portuguese, who led Porto to three league titles and twice took them to the Champions League quarter-finals, is thought to be attracted to the job. West Ham are yet to establish contact with Conceição but there is support for him within the club. Other contenders include the former Juventus manager Max Allegri, who has been pictured in London recently. There is a feeling that Graham Potter could come into contention. The former Paris Saint-Germain manager Christophe Galtier, who is coaching Al-Duhail in Qatar, has been considered in the past. West Ham, six points above the bottom three, are yet to advance interest in Edin Terzic, the former Borussia Dortmund manager. They have made checks on Kasper Hjulmand, Roger Schmidt and Stuttgart’s Sebastian Hoeness. West Ham do not have a history of swift sackings and remain reluctant to fire Lopetegui but there is growing alarm over the team’s form. The former Wolves manager has struggled to implement his vision and there is disquiet over last summer’s transfer business. West Ham spent more than £100m on players. Questions have been asked about Tim Steidten, the technical director. Lopetegui could be in serious trouble if West Ham lose against Leicester. He has been boosted by the availability of Lucas Paquetá who had been expected to give evidence in São Paulo on Tuesday to the Brazilian parliament for its inquiry into sports betting. The midfielder’s legal team successfully argued for him to appear via a remote video link. However it has emerged that Paquetá, who has been charged by the Football Association over an alleged breach of its betting regulations, is not obliged to give evidence to the inquiry and has chosen not to do so. The Brazil international denies wrongdoing. West Ham will also be able to call upon Mohammed Kudus after the forward’s five-match ban. Lopetegui said the defender Jean-Clair Todibo was a doubt."

          "headline": "Saudi Arabia makes more than 900 sponsor deals in 2034 World Cup plan",
          "bodyText": "Saudi Arabia has struck more than 900 sponsorship deals across the sporting landscape and made dozens of formalised agreements with football federations as it prepares for a controversial coronation to host the 2034 World Cup. The country’s stranglehold has been laid bare by Play the Game, a Danish-run organisation that aims to promote democracy, transparency and freedom of expression in sport. It maps what its authors describe as Saudi Arabia’s “strategic effort to reshape the Kingdom’s global image while leveraging sport as a tool of geopolitical influence” and underlines how football, in particular, has been targeted in the buildup to the World Cup announcement next week. Over the past two and a half years, Saudi Arabia has sealed more than 35 memorandums of understanding with different countries’ federations, most recently with the Football Association of Ukraine in October. In total it has 48 with individual nations and further agreements with the Oceania Football Confederation and the Confederation of African Football. All bar the Ukraine deal and additional accords with France and Croatia involve countries from outside Europe. While such arrangements, which generally involve pledges to knowledge share and collaborate on aspects of development, are not uncommon in football, the scope of Saudi Arabia’s influence and diplomatic clout is eye‑catching. Its unopposed bid for the 2034 tournament will be passed on 11 December without a formal vote, meaning the world’s federations will effectively wave it through via a round of applause in an online meeting. The Guardian understands there is disquiet among a number of federation chiefs about the remote, rushed-through nature of the decision. Of the 910 Saudi sponsorships charted by Play the Game, 194 are specifically concentrated on football. These include deals closed by Aramco, the state oil company, to sponsor the 2026 men’s World Cup and 2027 women’s World Cup, as well as further global age-group tournaments and 17 major competitions in the Concacaf region. Among Aramco’s 71 deals is a $100m annual partnership with Fifa that was described as a “punch in the stomach” six weeks ago in an open letter signed by more than 100 women’s footballers. Their call for it to be reconsidered on humanitarian and environmental grounds, in reference to ongoing concern over Saudi Arabia’s record on both fronts, has thus far fallen on deaf ears. The Saudi Public Investment Fund, which owns Newcastle United, and its subsidiaries account for 346 sponsorships across a range of sports. Boxing, esports and golf have joined football in becoming major targets for the country’s involvement in sport. The wide-ranging “Riyadh Season”, which will include Oleksandr Usyk’s heavyweight world championship fight against Tyson Fury on 21 December, has become a focus of its ability to host big-ticket events. Play the Game’s research has also underlined the fundamental connection between Saudi Arabia’s state mechanisms and key positions in sport. It finds that 1,412 positions in 207 Saudi entities are held by key members of the country’s political elite, with the Newcastle chairman, Yasir Al-Rumayyan, a key confidant of the crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, holding 22 roles. The report alleges various conflicts of interest among figures who are involved in both sport and state entities. “The sharp spike in investments and strategic partnerships speaks volumes about Saudi Arabia’s ambitions and expanding grip on international sport,” said Stanis Elsborg, one of the study’s authors, who also claims the country’s thirst for involvement has “reshaped the sports world”. On Saturday Amnesty International accused Fifa of an “astonishing whitewash” after it released its Saudi 2034 bid evaluation report and awarded a highest-ever score of 4.2 out of five."

          "headline": "Reforms announced to vocational T-levels in England after slow uptake",
          "bodyText": "The government has announced a shake-up of T-levels, its “gold standard” vocational qualifications in England, which have been dogged by disappointing uptake and high dropout rates. The reforms, to be introduced in January, will bring in significant changes to the industry placement element of the two-year qualification, which offers practical, hands-on work experience but has proved difficult to deliver. From next year, up to 20% of the placements can be completed remotely, rather than having to go to a physical workplace, with up to 50% completed remotely for those studying the digital technology T-level. Students will also be expected to gain workplace skills by doing “simulated activities” in the classroom. T-levels were introduced in September 2020 as a high-quality vocational equivalent to A-levels. A single T-level is worth the same Ucas points as three A-levels, and the 45-day industry placement is regarded as central to its appeal. There have, however, been problems finding sufficient employers willing and able to host students, and some students have complained their placements were not relevant to the course they were doing. Dropout rates have also caused concern. While retention rates for most A-level students consistently top 90%, only 71% of the 10,253 students who started a T-level in 2022 completed their studies. “We’re afraid that the 45-day industry placement, while a laudable aim, is crashing against the shores of reality,” Kevin Gilmartin, the post-16 specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said. “These placements require a big commitment from employers and it’s therefore not surprising that they can be difficult to secure.” The new hybrid arrangement will be available from January to students on all T-level courses except education and early years, and dental nursing, which have specific requirements related to licences to practice. The relaxation of the rules also means placements will “no longer be restricted to the specific T-level subject being studied by students”, allowing them to “gain experience across related subjects within their chosen route”. Jacqui Smith, the minister for skills and apprenticeships, said: “We are cutting red tape to make it easier than ever for employers and providers to take part in T-level industry placements while ensuring students benefit from meaningful, high-quality experiences. “We’ve listened to businesses and these changes reflect what they need to help them offer T-levels and our missions of boosting economic growth and breaking down barriers to opportunity. “Whether it’s offering remote placements in the fast-evolving digital sector or enabling more simulated environments for industries like engineering, we’re giving students more opportunities to gain the skills and experience they need for their future careers.” One of the key concerns about the T-level rollout has been its impact on other vocational qualifications. Plans by former Conservative governments to streamline post-16 education meant many BTecs would lose funding to make way for T-levels. Days before the first changes to funding were due, the education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, announced a rapid review of the plans, due to report in the next few weeks. On Tuesday MPs on the education select committee will question experts on the potential impact of changes."

Here are today’s major developments: Police have labelled a shooting on the Mornington Peninsula that left two people dead a “targeted” attack, as the suspect remains at large. One of the two deceased has been identified as a 29-year-old man who lived at the Rye property. More than a dozen people have been charged over an alleged multimillion-dollar attempted import of cocaine into Australia, the largest in the nation’s history. The federal government will establish an independent inquiry into sexual violence in the Australian military and ensure serving personnel convicted of sex offences in either criminal or military courts face mandatory discharge, under its formal response to the defence and veterans’ suicide royal commission. A man in his 60s was bitten by a shark while spear fishing off Curtis Island this morning. And Penrith Beach, affectionately known by Sydneysiders as “Pondi” – will reopen on 7 December for a second season. Federal court hears allegations against Health Workers Union leader Health Workers Union leader Diana Asmar allegedly claimed so-called “traitors” would regret betraying her, a couple of weeks before five staffers and two officials were stood down. Lawyers for the national union (HSU) made the allegations in the federal court on Monday as they sought more restrictions on Asmar’s role in its Victorian branch. The interlocutory application is part of a broader push by the HSU to have administrators appointed to the state branch, called the Health Workers Union. Justice Craig Dowling made orders on 7 October limiting Asmar’s powers, including preventing her from dismissing any employees or altering their employment. Asmar made an undertaking to the court that she would follow the judge’s orders. But HSU barrister Malcolm Harding SC told the court Asmar made a speech at a delegates conference on 23 October, saying there were traitors in the union who would regret betraying her. Two union officials from the Victorian branch were then stood down and five call centre workers dismissed on 11 November. Harding claimed under union rules, Asmar was the only one with the power to terminate someone’s employment. He claimed Asmar had breached her undertaking and the judge should make further orders restricting her. But Asmar’s barrister Rishi Nathwani KC argued there should not be any changes because his client has not breached any of her court undertakings. Justice Dowling will make a decision on whether to impose further restrictions at a later date. -AAP. Queensland bill ‘major step in the wrong direction’ says human rights boss Scott McDougall, the state’s human rights commissioner said: We’ve now reached the point where the attorney general accepts that this bill is not only more punitive than necessary, will disproportionately affect First Nations children and create a system which better protects adults from arbitrary detention than children, but also will likely result in children being subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. We are forging ahead knowingly violating the UN Convention Against Torture against children in any other context that is called child abuse. Is this really what the public wants? The Justice, Integrity and Safety Committee will sit a second and last time tomorrow in Townsville. It will then finalise a report with recommendations about the bill, which will be completed on Friday. The legislation will return to the floor of parliament for a final vote next week. Queensland parliament told ‘detention centres are overflowing’ Meanwhile, a series of community and human rights groups have appeared at a parliamentary inquiry into the new legislation. The committee will hold just two days of hearings into the laws, before releasing a report on Friday. The Youth Advocacy Centre’s Katherine Hayes estimated about 2,000 children had been sentenced for crimes captured by the legislation in the past 12 months, who would be given longer sentences. There’s nowhere to put those 2,000 kids. The detention centres are overflowing. The watch houses are disgraceful. Attorney general Deb Frecklington acknowledged Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children would be disproportionately affected by the legislation, but denied it was racist. She acknowledged to the inquiry it discriminated on the basis of age. We think that this legislation breaches the federal Racial Discrimination Act, and because of section 109 of the constitution, is going to be void, I think the government needs to look into that before passing it. UN calls on Queensland to ditch new youth crime laws The head of the United Nations committee on the rights of the child has called on Queensland to abandon its signature ‘Adult time, adult crime’ laws. The state’s attorney general, Deb Frecklington, concedes the Making Queensland Safer bill contradicts state and international human rights law and is discriminatory against children. The legislation drastically increases maximum sentences for children as young as 10 convicted of a schedule of offences, including a mandatory life sentence for murderers. Ann Skelton, chairperson of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, used social media to call the attorney’s concession “extraordinary”. “We do not agree that the so called exceptional circumstances warrant what will be a flagrant disregard for children’s rights under international law,” she said, on X. We also don’t agree that it will make Queensland safer. We urge the government of Queensland to stand firm with the principle that children should be treated differently from adults in the criminal justice system. NSW Essential Energy workers to go on strike Rural residents are warned they may be left without power as electricity workers walk off the job in a lengthy dispute over pay and conditions. More than 2,000 Essential Energy workers begin a series of rolling 72-hour work stoppages from Tuesday, saying pay negotiations have stalled. The NSW government-owned company operates one of Australia’s largest electricity networks, covering rural and remote parts of the state and southern Queensland. Electrical Trades Union secretary Allen Hicks said NSW energy minister Penny Sharpe on Monday indicated the government would not move on five key issues. The NSW government has made it very clear that we’re in for a tough summer when it comes to strain on our electricity grid and the workers who manage it – the government needs to make sure we’re equipped to deal with what is ahead. The network services 890,000 homes and businesses across 95% of NSW. Essential Energy said it had worked constructively to progress an enterprise agreement, including through 19 bargaining meetings since May. But the union has not shifted its position nor made counter offers to come to an agreement, the company said in a statement. -AAP. Negotiations continue between Woolworths and the United Workers Union The two parties sat down today to negotiate over worker demands for better pay and conditions, but no agreement was reached. Warehouse workers have been on strike for almost two weeks. Four Woolworths distribution centres in New South Wales and Victoria have been on indefinite strike since 21 November, leading to shortages in some stores in Victoria, NSW and the ACT. On Sunday, Woolworths said it would reopen its primary connect Melbourne south regional distribution centre today, but the attempt failed after workers and supporters picketed the site and blocked entrances. We know that there have been shortages on our shelves in some Woolworths stores and that this is really frustrating for our customers. We’ve been working tirelessly to reopen our Melbourne south regional distribution centre so we can improve the amount of essential grocery items on our shelves for our Victorian customers. The United Workers Union (UWU) is calling for a pay increase to at least $38 an hour for warehouse staff, as well as consistent wages and conditions across distribution centres. It also wants a productivity framework that pushed workers to achieve an 100% efficiency rate to be scrapped for good. United Workers Union National Secretary, Tim Kennedy, said in a statement Monday afternoon that Woolworths showed signs of recognising how important the issue of the framework was to workers. We have seen Woolworths threaten escalating industrial conflict and the importation of aggressive US-style industrial relations tactics is regrettable. But today’s negotiations show Woolworths the way they should be resolving this issue – by talking with and listening to their workers. We are hopeful of a breakthrough because our workers deserve to be safe at work. Barnaby Joyce, the shadow veterans’ affairs minister, followed Keogh He said the royal commission was “very thorough” and had come to the “best spot we would expect”. I’m not saying it’s perfect, nothing is perfect and no one in that field wants to hear you say this is a grand panacea that will fix all problems. It will assist and we still have a lot of work to do. Amongst that lot of work to do is to pass legislation. If there’s one thing I’m frustrated about, it is we were promised this would be through by the end of the year and it is not true. We managed to get through a bill apparently about not selling NBN, which we were never intending to do. Politics started playing its part and took the place of pieces of legislation, this being amongst the most vital. Asked why the Veterans’ Affairs bill didn’t progress last week, Joyce replied “because they were too busy doing other things”. Legislation was flying around the chamber like a mad hamburger being made. The thing that was vital was this, we were promised that the legislation that is currently in the house and the Senate would be passed by the end of parliament. It wasn’t and therefore the question has to go to Mr Albanese, why? Veterans affairs minister commits to royal commission recommendations Matt Keogh appeared on ABC Afternoon Briefing earlier, after the acceptance of 104 of 122 recommendations from the royal commission into defence and veterans’ suicide, including establishing a new commission to provide independent advice on suicide prevention. Keogh said one of the roles of the commission was “making sure we don’t see what has happened in the past” – where reviews with many recommendations weren’t implemented by the government. It will have a role in that. It will also have a role in looking at research. We need someone independent and separate from defence and the DVA that has an understanding of the impacts of service life on our serving members, veterans and their families and is able to work with and understand the research requirements and how to conduct proper inquiries, working with the public service to break through some of the roadblocks that have been there in the past. He said following through on the recommendations was “about making sure we are looking after our people who are serving and our veterans and their families”. The focus of what we’re doing here though is recognising the important work that has to happen to support our serving personnel veterans. Correction to report of Bruce Chapman’s Nation Press Club address Returning briefly to economist Bruce Chapman’s National Press Club address, and we have a correction to issue from his speech. Chapman took issue with calls for free higher education and the cancellation of unpaid student debt as advocated by the Greens. He was not taking issue with cancelling 20% of student debt, as Labor has announced if it is elected next year. The cost of abolishing all student debt is estimated at $80bn. Chapman compared this with increasing jobseeker payments by $2,000 per annum for 80 years or a year of the total cost of running all hospitals. What does this mean? For economists there is no such thing as free higher education – or indeed, free anything … there are trade-offs to be made with all policy decisions. Chapman said 65% of Australian adults were not university graduates, and earned less over their lifetime than university graduates. The equity issue is this … free to students and graduates means greater tax payments from, or, less services to the disadvantaged. The chief executive of the Victorian gambling regulator has resigned with two years left to serve on her term. Annette Kimmitt was appointed to the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission in March 2022 and will leave the regulator in late March next year. An email announcing Kimmitt’s departure to staff by the commission’s chair, Fran Thorn, who is also departing the organisation, said she had transformed the regulator’s approach to the gambling industry after the Crown Royal Commission. Kimmitt told Guardian Australia her decision to resign was influenced by “the pull of family”. I have got my first grand-daughter due in January, my mother is ageing and needs a bit more help. It is just that time of life where I’m deciding to step away from full-time executive work. Kimmitt admitted it had been “a very challenging and difficult three years” and that she had joined a “pretty shell-shocked and under-resourced regulator on the retreat”. I am really proud of what the organisation has done in three short years. We are now recognised as the nation’s strongest gambling regulator. We have really held the industry to account. Since January 2022, we have levied nearly $260m in fines. We had 88 disciplinary actions against the industry just last year. Man killed in NSW truck accident A man has died after a truck went through a guardrail and down an embankment on the Princes Highway in the Illawarra. At about 10.50am, emergency services were called to the highway at Bulli after reports a truck travelling southbound went through the guardrail and down an embankment. NSW Ambulance paramedics attended, however the man, who is yet to be formally identified, died at the scene. The Princes Highway is closed in both directions between the M1 Princes Motorway and Lawrence Hargrave Drive. Josh Frydenberg announced as co-patron of political leadership prize The McKinnon Foundation has appointed former Liberal treasurer Josh Frydenberg as co-patron of its annual prize for political leadership, alongside former Labor prime minister Julia Gillard. The former Morrison government minister and deputy Liberal leader joins the first female prime minister in overseeing the awarding of the annual McKinnon prize, with selection panels for the 2024 prize to be announced on Tuesday ahead of the prize being awarded early next year. Frydenberg said the prize recognised and encouraged leaders who apply “integrity and intellect, courage and conviction” to addressing the nation’s challenges. In today’s uncertain world we need leaders with these qualities more than ever, as we strive to create a better future for all Australians.” Announced in March this year, the 2023 was awarded jointly to ACT independent senator David Pocock and Tasmanian Liberal backbench MP Bridget Archer. Peak university body urges action as review begins into research and development Universities Australia has welcomed the announcement of a review into Australia’s research and development (R&amp;D) system while cautioning Labor it doesn’t need to wait for recommendations to take immediate action. Its CEO, Luke Sheehy, said including increasing stipends for PhD candidates, who were integral to the research and innovation landscape, and extending the length of research grants would immediately provide financial certainty for researchers. R&amp;D is the engine room of Australia’s future – it drives productivity, economic growth and progress. But we can’t afford to kick the can down the road. We don’t need a review to tell us what we already know – Australia needs greater, more sustainable funding for R&amp;D now. Sheehy said Australia was “falling behind”, with R&amp;D investment at just 1.68% of GDP, compared with the OECD average of 2.73%. The government can score a few quick wins now by adopting some of the recommendations in the Universities Accord final report, including increasing PhD stipends and extending the duration of research grants to provide researchers with greater job security.p Police ‘very concerned’ firearm is still out in the community Victoria police are placing “a lot of urgency” on apprehending the male: It is absolutely concerning for us and we are throwing all the resources added at this present time. Any information [will] make that arrest happen a lot quicker and we will be much more confident if that is the case. Asked why the man and woman attended the address, police said this was still under investigation – however they were alerted to the property by a 000 call. The two people, now deceased, were found within the house. We don’t know what the dispute was about … we do not know who the man is at the stage and we are yet to identify them. We are piecing that together today. Police “assume” a getaway car was used but do not have further details or a description, nor do they know where the gun was sourced. Asked if drugs were involved, police confirmed “that is part of our inquiry”. The 29-year-old deceased male was known to police. We don’t know the identities of those two people that came into the house. Certainly we will let you know as soon we do. Police say a man and a woman, yet to be identified, visited an address in Rye on the Mornington Peninsula where there was “some sort of altercation”. Shots were fired, and the woman and a 29-year-old man who lived at the property were fatally injured. The visiting male fled the scene and was still at large. It appears that a firearm or firearms have been discharged and a man who lived at that property and the woman that attended that property were seriously injured. The man who attended the property in company with this woman left before police attended. Obviously we are seeking to find out the identity of that man and locate him although I cannot go into specifics, we are actively looking for that man and we are appealing for anyone that may have been in that area at four o’clock this morning that may have seen something. I understand how distressing this is but we believe that they were known to each other, all of the parties and that it was targeted. I understand this will cause fear in the community but we are actively investigating at this time and I think we will have some good avenues to follow. NSW sets minimum pay for musicians at events that receive state funding New South Wales has become the sixth state or territory to introduce minimum pay for musicians performing at any event that receives state funding, including music festivals and sporting events. The $250 minimum fee per artist deal brings NSW in line with Victoria, South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT that all now operate under similar schemes introduced since Covid-19 cut a swathe through the live music industry. According to the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance (MEAA) half of Australia’s working musicians earned less than $6,000 last year, placing the sector in an insecure work crisis. A survey conducted by Musicians Australia earlier this year found that 60% of working musicians were paid less than $250 a gig, despite more than one-third of them having spent up to 20 hours a week rehearsing, practising or preparing for a gig. The $250 pay per gig minimum is part of the NSW government’s new 10-year contemporary music strategy. In case you missed it earlier, here’s a video detailing the Queensland police’s announced largest-ever alleged seizure of cocaine. And that’s where I’ll leave you for today. Caitlin Cassidy will steer the blog from here. A man in his 60s was bitten by a shark while spear fishing off Curtis Island this morning. The Queensland ambulance service said the man was stable but had lacerations and abrasions to both his arms. The attack occurred at about 8.25am. The man was transported to Gladstone hospital by police boat. Jobseekers protest outside job provider rated worst by members The Australian Unemployed Workers’ Union has staged a protest at APM Employment Services in Brunswick after the organisation suspended thousands of jobseekers each week and was rated the worst provider by members. Jobseekers in Melbourne were rallying outside the inner north office, with several handing over the “golden demerit” award in a ceremony. The AUWU’s Victorian coordinator, Jessica Harrison, said the high rates of suspension, as previously reported in Guardian Australia, had resulted in unnecessary stress for jobseekers: In a three-month period, APM suspended payments of 32,220 claimants. That’s over 2,600 per work. This is outrageous. It’s stressful enough to try to make ends meet in the current economic climate, without having your lifeline cut. And the privatised job agencies receive government handouts for this. One of the protesters carried a sign that said “show us your payslips” in reference to concerns the provider threatened to hand over payslip details, which would trigger a publicly funded payment. APM has previously denied any wrongdoing. AUWU said this year it had received more complaints about APM than any other provider, with jobseekers rating the agency 1.93/5 in a recent national survey. Forrest’s lawyer welcomes Meta move on advertiser verification The senior legal counsel for billionaire mining magnate and philanthropist Andrew Forrest, Simon Clarke, has welcomed Meta’s announcement that the company will require businesses and individuals to verify themselves before being able to put financial ads on Facebook or Instagram. Guardian Australia revealed this morning that Meta would begin verifying ads in February in a bid to stop fake celebrity crypto investment scam ads on the platforms. Forrest’s likeness has been used in many of the ads, and he has taken Meta to court in the US over the scam ads. Clarke told ABC Perth on Monday that the announcement was “welcome and significant”. He added: We think it’s something that Dr Forrest has been advocating for for some time, and we think it will make a material difference to the amount of fraud on the platform, it’s essentially a compliance procedure that should work at the front end to stop a lot of the criminals getting on the platform. He said he would like to see Meta allow elderly or vulnerable people to have to opt in to seeing financial ads in the first place. Forrest’s case against Meta in the US is still in the discovery process, Clarke said, which he said would give insight into how the decisions are made and to what extent there is automation. Clarke said since the case was launched, the number of fraudulent ads featuring Forrest had started to diminish, but between April and December last year, there were seven new scam ads a day, or about 1,700 in total. More than a dozen people have been charged over an alleged multimillion-dollar attempted import of cocaine into Australia, the largest in the nation’s history. Australian federal police charged 11 men and two juveniles with conspiring to import 2.34 tonnes of cocaine into the country by sea. It is alleged the men and crew of a vessel attempted to import the drugs into Queensland with multiple groups planning to collect the cocaine onshore. The men were arrested on Saturday after a collaborative effort by the AFP and Queensland police investigating a transnational organised crime syndicate. The amount of cocaine allegedly attempted to be imported weighs the same as a Ford Raptor ute. The AFP said it is estimated to have a street value of $760m and could equate to 11.7 million street deals. More on this story here: NSW foster care system not fit for purpose, government report says The NSW foster care system is not fit for purpose, a Minns government report has found, and is characterised by “a profound lack of accountability and ineffective oversight”. The report, which was commissioned by the state’s minister for families and communities, Kate Washington, found the $2bn out-of-home care system was “overly complex, fragmented, and slow to respond in the best interests of children and young people”. It also found the system was “largely devoid” of robust evidence-based practices. It comes after a damning audit into the child protection system by the state’s auditor general, Bola Oyetunji, found the state was failing tens of thousands of vulnerable children due to the “ineffective” system. The government’s report has 13 recommendations to fix the system, including ensuring foster care placements are evidence-informed and reduce the reliance on High-Cost Emergency Arrangements. Washington said: It’s shocking that some out-of-home care providers are failing to provide basic supports to children, despite being paid hundreds of thousands, and in some cases, millions, of taxpayer dollars to do so. Over the past 18 months, the Minns Labor Government has been stabilising the system, now we will begin rebuilding the foundations so that we can invest in better outcomes. Hecs architect favours levy on universities over ‘very blunt’ international student cap The Hecs/Help architect, economist Bruce Chapman, has called the proposed international student cap a “very blunt instrument” but made the case for a levy on universities. Taking questions at the National Press Club, Chapman said he wasn’t an immigration expert but there was a “better way of doing things” than a hard cap, adding: Economists hate quantity restrictions. Chapman instead made the economic case for a levy on universities, pointing to large public sector subsidies that universities had benefited from historically: Australian universities, some for well over 100 years, have been hugely subsidised in terms of research money which has built up their reputations … and on top of that, they’re rent-free. [Their] properties are getting huge public sector subsidies … the case for a levy is in part about getting a return for taxpayers. Woolies warehouse remains closed after staff picket site Hundreds of supermarket workers fighting for better pay and conditions have picketed a Woolworths warehouse that was due to reopen today after employees began rolling strikes. The United Workers Union picketed the distribution centre Melbourne’s Dandenong South on Monday, one of several distribution centres across eastern Australia subject to industrial action since 21 November. Union delegates at the scene told AAP the workers were protesting against unrealistic performance expectations, which they claim had led to frequent injuries. The supermarket giant allocates workers a certain time for a task, then ranks their performance out of 100, something they say puts undue pressure on them and has a negative impact on wellbeing. They are also demanding better wages and an agreement that workers at different sites are paid the same amount. The disruption has caused some product shelves in supermarkets across Melbourne to be left bare. One union delegate said workers would continue their around-the-clock protest for as long as it took to reach a resolution. Here’s more from my colleague Ariel Bogle on the impact Woolworths’ efficiency measures are having on workers: The architect of student loans, economist Bruce Chapman, is appearing today at the National Press Club (NPC) on the topic “Hecs isn’t broken, but it needs urgent attention”. He has called the federal government’s recent changes to raise the minimum repayment threshold and make repayment scales fairer the best changes to the Hecs/Help system in three decades. But he was less supportive of calls from the Greens to make tertiary education free and cancel all student debt – pointing out the estimated $80bn budget cost could be better used to run the public hospital system for a year or increase the jobseeker payment. Chapman has also been scathing of the former Morrison government’s Job Ready Graduates Scheme, which vastly increased the cost of some degrees, including humanities. Labor has canned the scheme, but is delaying any reform to the cost of degrees to a yet-to-be-established independent commission. • This post was amended on 2 December 2024. An earlier version incorrectly said Chapman had criticised Labor’s pledge to wipe debts by 20%, rather than the Greens’ proposal to wipe all student debt. Shorten hails changes to Centrepay, which was not ‘working as intended’ Continuing with Bill Shorten’s earlier press conference at Parliament House, the government services minister says he’s “very confident” reforms to bar predatory providers from financially abusing welfare recipients will continue after he’s moved on from federal politics. As Guardian Australia reported this morning, the government will boot “high-risk services” from the Centrepay system, which includes companies providing consumer leases and household goods. The Centrepay system allows government-approved providers of essential services, such as rent and electricity, to take money from a person’s welfare payment before it is deposited in their bank account but the types of services available have broadened in recent years. Shorten said on Monday the system had been “misfiring” nor “working as intended”. When it does work, it’s very good, but the government was seeing a whole lot of problems, where, in particular, some services that were being provided for Centrepay were really not appropriate for the vulnerable people on the government systems. About 10,000 businesses offer services to the more than 607,000 users who opt-in to the Centrepay system, Shorten said. Most did the “right thing”, he said, while others were “very inappropriate” and were taking advantage. The announcement is complicated by Shorten’s departure from parliament next month, when the former opposition leader will take up the role of president and vice-chancellor at the University of Canberra. But he insisted he was “very confident” the reform would continue after he had left. Shorten said he believed this for three reasons: an improvement in culture, advocates pushing strongly and the Albanese government recognising not to treat “people as the enemy” or view them “under suspicion”. This has been a very good process, and I think it sets a pattern for how to do consultation in the future. Shorten says NDIS is in good shape for next minister The outgoing NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, believes the $42bn program is in a good place for the next minister as he embarks on a career move out of federal politics. Shorten outlined a number of the changes made since the release of the NDIS review almost a year ago, conceding “there are still lots of things to improve, but it’s definitely headed in the right direction”. The former Labor leader was asked a number of questions about who he thought should take on the NDIS and government services portfolios after he leaves for the University of Canberra in January. Shorten said: I think [the NDIS is] a portfolio which requires passion. It requires a commitment to people with disability. It requires a lot of thought, and it requires a lot of effort, and there are many Labor parliamentarians who pass that prescription. But as for any particular names, Shorten was tight-lipped. I think the NDIS is a very important portfolio. How the prime minister chooses to construct his cabinet will be up to him … there’s 680,000 people directly benefiting from it so it certainly does require that cabinet level of attention but the machinery of government matters, it’s not on my job description … The ANZ and Indeed, meanwhile, this morning released their survey of job ads for November. While there was a 1.3% fall for the month, the previous numbers were upwardly revised to a 0.7% month-on-month increase. Yes, ads are down 27.6% from the peak reached in June 2022, but the tally remains 15.1% above pre-pandemic levels. Stability in the labour market is good for those in work (or looking for it) if not for the chances of an early Reserve Bank interest rate cut. Prior to today, the market was tipping just a 3% (ie negligible) chance of a cut in the cash rate at the RBA’s final board meeting for 2024 on 9-10 December. Finally, there was some mildly positive news on the building approvals front in October. There were 15,498 dwellings approved, seasonally adjusted, in the month, the most since December 2022. The 4.2% increase for the month was better than the 1.3% increase economists had expected. From a year ago, the approvals were up 6.1%. If maintained for a year, the October approvals would deliver a bit over 180,000 new dwellings (assuming each approval led to a completed dwelling). A bit of an improvement but still only three-quarters of the pace the federal government wants if we are to get 1.2m new homes over five years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics has released a slew of September quarter and October numbers today, most of which point to the economy holding up if not gathering a bit of pace. Retail sales in October expanded 0.6% for the month, better than the 0.4% pace expected by economists. The annual clip, at 3.4%, was the best since May 2023, and well ahead of the 2.1% headline inflation rate. It’s always a bit tricky to compare spending with earlier years because “Black Friday” spending – and all the pre-BF events – may be pulling forward some of the spending. Still, the revised stage-three tax cuts left more money in a lot of pockets/digital wallets. And there are other numbers suggesting resilience in the economy if not a gathering of growth momentum. Data for the September quarter showed wages advanced 1.2% in those three months to be 4% higher than a year earlier. Profits didn’t go so well, down 8.5%, but lower commodity prices probably played a bit of a role there. ‘Deeply disappointing’: Victorian gambling regulator criticises federal government delay on ad ban The chair of the Victorian gambling regulator has criticised the federal government’s delayed action on wagering ads, describing it as “deeply disappointing”. Fran Thorn is the outgoing chair of the Victorian Gambling and Casino Control Commission who will leave the role on 31 December. She told Guardian Australia the federal government could have at least restricted ads, if not banned them: As the outgoing chair of the VGCCC, it is deeply disappointing that the federal government has not been able to find the time to pass legislation to ban gambling advertising, even in part. This would have represented an important step forward for gambling regulation and harm minimisation. The commission has previously called for the federal government to implement the recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm, including a full ban on wagering ads after a three-year transition period. Its leaders have reported a “bombardment” of concern from parents about gambling ads. Last week, the communications minister’s office apologised to multiple people harmed by the gambling industry after delaying the long-awaited advertising reforms, admitting government action has taken “longer than hoped”. Continuing on from our last post: As the Aemo executive Michael Gatt says, “for several years, Aemo has flagged these emerging risks and with the support of state governments and network operators are developing appropriate emergency solutions”. “Aemo does not want to directly control people’s rooftop solar,” Gatt said. That said, if actions to secure the grid aren’t enough, “the temporary management of rooftop solar by network operators under state government solar management programs may still be required although we expect this may only occur in very rare circumstances”. As independent energy analysts such as Gabrielle Kuiper have noted elsewhere, Aemo could do more to explain and demonstrate the grid has a problem. If they did, it might be clear that alternatives exist before “last-resort measures” are taken to turn off rooftop solar. Why not, say, set up a contracting market much like Aemo has when demand is forecast to be too strong, and big users get rewarded by powering down. These users might be encouraged to power up during low-demand periods. Aemo might also give incentives so we get more virtual power plants that connect up batteries (including those in households), Kuiper said. The Smart Energy Council, too, said its calls for a Battery Booster program would help resolve the issue and help accommodate a lot more households joining the 4m already with solar panels. The council has been advocating “for a consistent national approach that doesn’t place the burden on equipment manufacturers, installers and the rest of the industry”, its chief executive, John Grimes, said. And as we noted a few weeks back, using “overvoltage” as the way to turn off solar inverters to stop rooftops’ exports is not without its problems: ‘Emergency backstop’ tool needed to curb rooftop solar if grid demand too low: Aemo Last week, we had the prospect of too much demand for the power grid in NSW, and the prospect of repeats during summer (as we noted in this analysis from yesterday). Well, there are challenges for the electricity market at the other end of the range. On sunny days in spring and autumn (when it’s not too hot or cold), there is so much solar energy being generated that so-called minimum system loads may not be sufficient for the grid to be secure. We looked at this issue a couple of months ago when MSL alerts were being issued for Victoria: As it happens, the Australian Energy Market Operator has released a report this morning that highlights the progress (or lack of it) in dealing with those times when rooftop solar panels are exporting a lot – perhaps too much – electricity into the grid. “Now that rooftop [photovoltaics] is supplying more than half the grid at times, this requires introduction of a new ‘emergency backstop’ mechanism,” Aemo’s report states. This mechanism would “allow rooftop PV systems to be curtailed or turned off briefly if necessary in rare emergency conditions, similar to the capabilities normally required of any large scale generator”. Now, Aemo is not saying they should be given that mechanism. Rather, the point is that various states have taken some steps to work with the distribution networks, but progress is not uniform and also not moving fast enough. Here’s how things stand: PM says service differential allowing veterans injured in ‘operational type service’ to be compensated more will remain The only recommendation the government did not support by the defence and veterans’ suicide royal commission was the suggestion to remove the service differential for permanent impairment compensation. Albanese said this wasn’t accepted because it allows for higher levels of compensation for those who are injured in “operational type service”. The service differential is a longstanding feature of Australia’s support for veterans, it’s been there a long time. While all veterans can access support for all conditions linked to their service through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the service differential supports higher levels of compensation for illness or injury that occurs in operational type service. We regard … that feature as being important. And that is why we have made the decision to maintain it. Albanese wrapped up the press conference by drawing attention to the suicide figures among Australia’s veterans: Between 1997 and 2021, there were 1,677 confirmed suicides by either serving personnel or ex-serving members. That’s 1,677 lives too many. Every single one of them is heartbreaking and I want to acknowledge, conclude by acknowledging, that today will be triggering for many families as well. It will be a really difficult day, even though this is, I think, a very strong response for the government. Veterans affairs minister says wellbeing strategy and 90-day turnaround for compensation claims to be announced The veterans affairs minister, Matt Keogh, said the government would also be shortly releasing a wellbeing strategy and another to support military personnel as they transition to civilian life. Keogh listed a number of other improvements, including compensation claims processed in less than 90 days. Keogh said: That is a huge body of work but it’s a huge body of work that happened because of the passionate advocacy of the family members of those who had taken their own life. It’s for these families, for our serving personnel, for our veterans, that we have worked so quickly to produce this response to the royal commission because we deeply understand the urgency and importance of doing this work. Keogh was also asked why healthcare fee schedules are higher for NDIS over DVA clients. He said: This is an issue we need to address with the NDIS but also DVA, the Department of Health and in aged care. That’s why government has done work around an independent pricing authority to guide government on pricing. What we’ve said is instead of dealing with veterans affairs as a stand alone area, we want to make sure we’re addressing the issues holistically across government. Marles says work of defence and veterans services commission will begin immediately The minister for defence, Richard Marles, has provided further details on the defence and veterans services commission which will be established following a recommendation by the defence and veterans’ suicide royal commission. He said the work of the body would begin immediately rather than waiting until the body is legislated next year. Marles said: I thank Julie-Ann Finney, whose advocacy was at the heart of this royal commission occurring in the first place. But for her advocacy, this would not have happened. Her dedication, her persistence, has changed our country much for the better. I would like to, in acknowledging Julie-Ann, acknowledge all the families of those who have lost loved ones to suicide and who have served. I would like to thank all of those who gave evidence before the royal commission. It was critically important, but to do so was difficult and it was brave. New commission announced with goal of ‘comprehensive reform’ of defence culture Anthony Albanese has announced a new commission to undertake “comprehensive reform” in the wake of the defence and veterans’ suicide royal commission. The prime minister, speaking to media moments after the government released its response to the royal commission, said: My government will establish a new defence and veterans services commission, to undertake the most comprehensive reform to the culture, systems and processes across defence, the ADF, and the Department of Veterans’ Affairs to prevent suicide and improve the mental health and wellbeing of service personnel and veterans. The royal commission heard harrowing evidence about the cultural problems within the Australian Defence Force over time, and identified deficiencies with the approach, services and support of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Albanese said the government had accepted the majority of the recommendations, agreeing in principle to 104 recommendations, noting 17 recommendations for further consideration, and one recommendation is not supported in part. He said it was a government’s “fastest response ever” to a royal commission. The federal government will establish an independent inquiry into sexual violence in the Australian military and ensure serving personnel convicted of sex offences in either criminal or military courts face mandatory discharge, under its formal response to the defence and veterans’ suicide royal commission. Responding on Monday to the royal commission’s final report produced earlier this year, the government has agreed that sex offences including stalking and abusively distributing intimate images should result in automatic discharge, subject to appeal. Personnel found to have engaged in sexual and related offences including harassment, unwanted touching and “prejudicial” or obscene conduct – whether through Defence’s disciplinary or administrative processes – will need to demonstrate why they, too, should not be discharged. The measures are designed to be preventive and well as punitive, serving as a warning that any level of sexually inappropriate behaviour will have serious consequences. Those facing mandatory discharge would be able to challenge the ruling in a formal process triggered by the conviction. “Sexual misconduct and unacceptable behaviour have no place in Defence,” the government’s published response to the royal commission said. “The rates of sexual violence being reported in the ADF are completely unacceptable.” The government has committed to establishing a new statutory body by September next year to oversee a system overhaul in Defence and Veterans’ Affairs aimed at preventing suicide within the defence and veterans’ community. That body will also provide evidence-based advice, with an interim head to be appointed “as soon as possible”. Tesla chair dodges questions on Elon Musk as federal review of research and development announced Tesla chair Robyn Denholm has dodged questions on her close relationship with Elon Musk and whether she can help build a bridge between the federal government and the controversial figure. The government announced today a year-long review into research and development investment, which will be led by Denholm. Asked if she’d spoken to Musk before taking the role, Denholm said: Today is about our R&amp;D future the country. Denholm, who was joined by the science minister, Ed Husic, told reporters a little earlier that she was honoured to chair the critical piece of work, saying it was vital to the future of the country: My objectives for this review is to unlock this immense potential of Australian research by turning it into tangible outcomes that deliver both economic and societal benefits. I am to shape R&amp;D settings that enhance our global competitiveness and secure our nation ‘s future prosperity. Denholm will be assisted in the review by former chief scientist Ian Chubb, former Australian of the Year Fiona Wood, and Kate Cornick, the chief executive of the Victorian government’s startup agency, LaunchVic. (We covered the details of the announcement earlier this morning here.) Flash flooding and rescues after major storms Australia’s east coast has been battered by severe storms, causing flash flooding, swamping cars and forcing drivers to call for help, AAP reports. A brutal thunderstorm battered Brisbane on Sunday, turning roads into rivers and waterlogging cars. More than 50mm was recorded in 30 minutes in Brisbane City while surrounding suburbs bore the brunt with 70mm falling at Rosalie in an hour and 77mm at Holland Park West. Farther south, Upper Springbrook on the Gold Coast recorded more than 260mm of rain in the last 24 hours. Video footage showed water turning Brisbane’s Roma Street into a river while southern suburbs like East Brisbane and Stones Corner became lakes due to flood waters. Advocates welcome Centrepay reform to protect vulnerable Australians Consumer advocates have welcomed the federal government’s proposed reforms to the Centrepay payment system, saying they reverse years of inaction by successive governments. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, announced on Monday the government would overhaul the Centrepay system to better protect vulnerable Australians from predatory behaviour. Centrepay is a payment system designed to allow welfare recipients to manage their bills by allowing approved businesses to take money from their welfare payments, prior to it hitting their bank accounts. But the Guardian revealed this year how the system has been opened up to exploitation and error by lax oversight and a failure to crack down on dodgy operators. The government will now remove high-risk businesses from the system, including rent-to-buy household appliance operators, and will improve compliance and oversight of the system within Services Australia. Financial Rights Legal Centre senior policy officer Julia Davis said: We are reassured that these proposed reforms will proceed next year since some new and critical protections have already been put in place including mandatory end dates and deduction limits for clothing and household goods and a pause on onboarding new risky businesses. Consumer groups have been calling on successive governments to remove consumer lease companies and funeral expenses providers from Centrepay for over a decade. These announcements are a long time coming and have been the result of years of consistent advocacy. Eleven men and two juveniles have been charged by federal police after an investigation into the largest seizure of cocaine in Australia’s history. The Australian federal police said it had made the charges on Monday, after the men were arrested late on Saturday and in the early hours of Sunday as part of a scheme to import 2.34 tonnes of cocaine into Australia by sea. Those arrested include the crew of a vessel allegedly attempting to import the illicit drugs into Queensland and multiple groups allegedly planning to collect the drugs onshore. The AFP has described the incident as relating to a transnational organised crime syndicate. Two people shot dead on Mornington Peninsula after reported altercation Two people have been shot dead, with police searching for the suspected gunman after reports of an early morning fight inside a suburban home. Homicide detectives are investigating after reports of an altercation between a group of people at a home in Rye, on Victoria’s Mornington Peninsula, shortly after 4am on Monday. A man and woman were found with gunshot wounds, police say. “Despite the best efforts of emergency services to revive the pair, they were declared deceased at the scene,” a spokesperson said. “It’s believed a second man fled the scene.” Police believe all three people were known to each. AAP Penrith Beach, affectionately known by Sydneysiders as “Pondi” – will reopen on 7 December for a second season. The swimming spot in western Sydney – where temperatures are routinely 10C hotter than the city’s east – will operate from 10am to 7pm and will be open every day (including Christmas) until 27 April 2025. The NSW government said it has invested $2.5m to fund amenities and staffing for a second year. The deputy premier and minister for western Sydney, Prue Car, said: This is about equity. A place like Penrith Beach is critical for the people of Western Sydney. Hundreds of thousands of Western Sydney locals showed up and enjoyed Penrith Beach last year, and I cannot wait to join them for another summer season. If you want to learn more about Pondi, I suggest checking out my colleague Mostafa Rachwani’s review: Man dies after balcony fall during police operation A man is dead after falling from a balcony during negotiations in a Queensland police operation. Queensland police said they were called to a Rockhampton home in central Queensland after reports of an unknown trespasser on Saturday night. When authorities arrived, police found a 37-year-old man standing on a second-floor balcony railing. Officers attempted to negotiate with the man but he fell from the balcony, suffering serious injuries. He died from his injuries after being taken to Rockhampton hospital. Police say the Ethical Standards Command is investigating the death and the state coroner has been advised. It will also be subject to independent oversight by the Crime and Corruption Commission. Craig Kelly joins Libertarian party for another run at parliament Craig Kelly is making another run for parliament – this time with the Libertarian party. The new political home for Kelly comes after he has tried out many others. In 2010, he was elected the Liberal MP for the electorate of Hughes. In 2021, he set up and served as leader of the United Australia Party. He ran as an independent for the 2023 NSW election and most recently was the campaign director for One Nation. Announcing his news to Ben Fordham on 2GB, Kelly said: I’m proud to announce today that I’m going to join the Libertarian party. I believe in small government. I believe in the entrepreneurial ability of Australians. Get government out of the way, get government out of their hands. That’s what the Libertarian party stands for. Unfortunately, the Liberal party that I used to be a member of appears to have abandoned all those values. Asked what happened with this role with One Nation, Kelly said: I was there working on a contract basis for a small period of time. But look, I think the future in this country as a conservative party, to the right of the Liberal party, is with the libertarian. Water quality decreasing in largest river system Leading researchers say low-cost, simple changes could improve the declining health of Australia’s long-mismanaged Murray-Darling Basin, AAP reports. As town tap water quality declines and the politics of water buybacks rage, a dozen environment and water experts on Monday released a damning assessment of the health of the basin that is home to 2.3 million Australians. The researchers found widespread failures to meet economic, environmental, social, Indigenous and compliance targets. The failures resulted in lower-than-expected river flows at 90% of sites measured, poor use of environmental flows and declining abundance of waterbirds. The researchers concluded that “despite $13 billion committed to water reforms, trends of most indicators (74 per cent) show no improvement or are worsening”. Prof Bradley Moggridge, a Kamilaroi man, said on Monday: We found Indigenous-owned water entitlements to be grossly inadequate, furthering the disempowerment of Indigenous peoples in the management of water on country and contributing to negative effects on their health and wellbeing. The assessment comes after a 12-year, multi-government plan to restore sustainability in the complex river system failed, forcing its extension to December 2027. The researchers proposed several solutions including some form of rigorous, transparent, accountable system for monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the basin’s health. Low-cost options included centralising data on threats to water quality, water law breaches, mass fish kills and town water security and supply. Reports of forced labour and exploitation up by 140% over last six years, AFP says Forced labour and exploitation reports have increased by 140% over the last six years, according to the Australian federal police, as criminal networks use deceptive tactics to traffic offshore workers to Australia. The AFP said since 2018 it has received 247 reports relating to forced labour and exploitation. The agency has raised the issue to mark International Day for the Abolition of Slavery today. In 2024, a Templestowe man was convicted on forced labour offences after he coerced someone to work 14-hour days for two consecutive years under threats of deportation. AFP’s human exploitation commander, Helen Schneider, said: Criminal syndicates will use deceptive recruitment tactics to target and force vulnerable individuals into these appalling situations, and trap them into endless cycles of debt, forced labour or domestic servitude. The AFP is the lead agency in investigating this crime type and we investigate any reports we receive but we also urge members of the public to be vigilant and alert police to any suspicions of human trafficking offences. Israel-Gaza conflict will be a ‘big issue’ for some voters, Husic says Circling back to the science minister, Ed Husic, who was on RN Breakfast a short time ago. Asked if he expects Muslim voters in Australia to follow the trend in the US where backlash increased during the election in some states over the Israel-Gaza war, Husic said for “some people” in Australia this will be a “big issue” when they go to the ballot box. There have been people for quite some time that have taken a particularly strong view about whether or not ourselves, or the rest of the world for that matter, have reacted as strongly as they could seeing the loss of so much innocent life in Gaza … and especially mothers and children, women and children who have been killed as a result of the actions by the Israeli government in Gaza, and then obviously the spread to Lebanon. There will be strong feelings about that. But again, to be able to just say definitively, this will definitely be the case, I think there’s a mix of feelings out there talking with people, but you know, again, people, when they go to the ballot box, mix of different issues will be a play. This will, for some people, be a big issue. The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has said the Greens were “definitively close” to making a deal with Labor on environment laws, but it was clear the prime minister did not want those debated. Hanson-Young is speaking on RN Breakfast about the deal Anthony Albanese overruled after last-minute negotiations between the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, and the Greens. It involved a deal to pass Labor’s key election promise to create two new agencies – an environmental protection agency to manage compliance with national laws and an information agency to manage environmental data. Hanson-Young said it “remains the unfinished business of this parliament.” She said: What I was told was that there was problems with the … set of amendments, or the areas that I have been negotiating [on] with Tanya Plibersek and that it was too hard to do this work. I walk out of the room, of course. And before we know, at the front page of the Australian, the West Australian, virtually every newspaper the next morning was saying that the business lobby, the miners and the loggers had convinced the prime minister to dump these laws. I want this on the national agenda when parliament returns. Nature’s waited too long, and nature needs us. Albanese said on Sunday the government still planned to move forward with the changes but indicated it would not concede on Labor’s “values” with crossbenchers. The science minister, Ed Husic, is speaking on RN Breakfast now about the year-long review of Australia’s research and development investment. He is being questioned by Patricia Karvelas about the decision to appoint Tesla chair Robyn Denholm to lead the review. Asked if the link to Tesla and Elon Musk and his growing influence was part of the consideration, Husic said: No, I think, if I may emphasise, I guess, Robyn’s involvement in a company that recognises, crucially, the value of R&amp;D and improving the way to get things done and to be able to create an edge, and particularly if you look at what Tesla has done, be able to turn an idea into reality at a time where there are a lot of doubters over a long period of time. The type of people that we’ve got involved, we’ve been thinking about for quite some time, and what they bring to the table. Husic said Australia’s research and development performance has been dropping in the past ten years in comparison to “our competitors in the OECD”. Labor announces R&amp;D review in hopes of boosting Australian science and manufacturing A year-long review of Australia’s research and development investment will soon be under way in an effort to boost the country’s scientific output and manufacturing self-sufficiency. The science minister, Ed Husic, announced on Monday the review will inquire into the value of existing investments and ties between research and industry in order for Australia to boost its value and drive productivity. The investment into research and development as a proportion of GDP is at 1.68%, the government said, tailing behind the OECD average of 2.73%. In 2022-23, federal and state government expenditure stood at $4.3bn. The review will be led by Tesla chair Robyn Denholm, who will be joined by former chief scientist Ian Chubb, former Australian of the Year Fiona Wood, and Kate Cornick, the chief executive of the Victorian government’s startup agency, LaunchVic. The report will be delivered by the end of 2025. Husic said: Our ideas and intellectual property are an indicator of future economic success. This review is designed to give us an evidence-based pathway to stronger growth. We said after the pandemic we would boost our manufacturing self-sufficiency. That is a big challenge, but Australian knowhow can help us do things smarter and sharpening our edge against international competition. Apple and Google app stores to be forced to play fair on search and payment Australians are set to get more choice and control over how they search for apps if new rules to slap big tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, with $50m fines for not playing fair are passed. The plans would give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission more powers to prevent digital platforms from promoting their own apps over competitors, forcing users to pay for in-app purchases through their payment systems and stopping users from switching from a platform’s app to an alternative. In a speech to be given on Monday night, the assistant treasurer, Stephen Jones, will say: “We want to knock these practices on the head. And we want to lift transparency in a sector that has often been shrouded in secrecy so that consumers get a fair go. And that small businesses have a chance to deliver good products to the market.” The plans will focus on app marketplaces and ad tech services and will allow the consumer watchdog to fine offending companies up to $50m or 30% of annual turnover. Jones will say: This framework will lead to more choice, lower prices and fairer outcomes for consumers. And it will level the playing field for small businesses and give them a chance to compete with good, innovative ideas. One of the biggest stoushes in recent years over the prace is between Fortnite developers Epic Games, and Google and Apple. The popular game developer is taking Apple and Google to court in Australia after Fortnite was removed from their app stores for introducing its own in-game payment system, which circumvented the marketplaces’ fee system. Good morning, I’ll be with you on the blog today. Australians are set to get more choice and control over how they search for apps if new rules to slap big tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Facebook, with $50m fines for not playing fair are passed. A year-long review of Australia’s research and development investment will soon be under way in an effort to boost the country’s scientific output and manufacturing self-sufficiency.

          "bodyText": "The federal government will boot predatory rent-to-buy operators off its Centrepay debit system as part of sweeping reforms designed to stop the financial abuse of vulnerable Australians. The reforms, set to be announced Monday, follow a Guardian Australian investigation that revealed shocking failures in the Centrepay system and helped trigger an urgent government review. The Centrepay system was designed as a budgeting tool for welfare recipients, allowing government-approved providers of essential services like rent and electricity to take money from a person’s welfare payment before it is deposited in their bank account. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email But weak oversight of the system opened it up to error and exploitation, which caused profound harm to vulnerable people. Guardian Australia revealed this year how multiple energy retailers, including AGL, Origin and Ergon, allegedly used the system to continue deducting million of dollars from the welfare payments of former customers long after they had left or switched energy providers. The Australian Energy Regulator successfully took AGL to court over its use of Centrepay and has said it is now considering action against three other firms. Guardian Australia also revealed how an extreme Christian rehabilitation centre used the system to prop itself up financially while subjecting its residents to gay conversion practices and exorcisms, and showed how rent-to-buy companies used Centrepay to lock Indigenous Australians in remote communities into paying exorbitant amounts for household appliances. The government services minister, Bill Shorten, said Centrepay, when working as intended, was a convenient service helping welfare recipients meet the costs of basic needs, including housing, school fees and medication. “But it’s clear from the extensive feedback we’ve received that changes were needed to ensure Centrepay wasn’t undermined by predatory behaviour,” he said. “Predatory behaviour is unacceptable. The improvements we’ve announced today will ensure there are safeguards in place to reduce the risk of financial harm and we’ll continue to work with regulators and across government to stamp out this behaviour.” The government will remove what it describes as “high-risk services” from the Centrepay system. That will include companies providing consumer leases and those offering rent-to-buy arrangements for household goods, otherwise known as rent-to-buy operators. The Australian Securities and Investment Commission and financial advocates have for years been warning that the ability of rent-to-buy operators to access Centrepay was causing severe financial harm, particularly to Indigenous Australians. The government will also impose mandatory target amounts and end dates for Centrepay deductions, a measure in part aimed at stopping energy retailers from wrongly receiving money from the welfare payments of former customers. The reforms will include stronger oversight and compliance, including a new application and approval process for businesses wanting to gain access to the system, and formalised complaint-handling processes. The government will also employ complaints and compliance specialists within Services Australia to “make sure businesses are accountable for how they use Centrepay”. The announcement has been met with broad support from financial rights groups and the Australian Council of Social Service, the peak group for community services. The chief executive of Acoss, Cassandra Goldie, said the government efforts to protect people from exploitation has been “genuine”. The financial counselling and strategy lead for Mob Strong Debt Help, Bettina Cooper, said the engagement with First Nations and other consumer advocates “has been a true consultation”. “All government departments can learn from their open and collaborative approach to achieve fair outcomes,” Cooper said. The announcement comes after Asic announced on Friday it had suspended another retailer from the Centrepay system. Asic has made a final stop order preventing Indy-C-Fashion Accessories from offering Centrepay credit arrangements to consumers in its store in Katherine. The deputy chair of Asic, Sarah Court, said Indy-C provided credit arrangements to First Nations people to buy clothing and household goods “without considering whether the credit arrangement would be consistent with the consumer’s objectives, financial situation, and needs … “We will continue to use our full range of powers, including stop orders, to disrupt entities in these circumstances.” The government expects its Centrepay reforms to be phased in from mid-2025 and says it will consult with “impacted businesses before the changes are finalised”."

          "bodyText": "More than 1m kilometres of cables snake along the world’s ocean floor, ferrying data between distant lands. Fibre-optic filaments whisk emails, Netflix and military secrets through deep water, where the cord – about as thick as a garden hose – gathers barnacles and seaweed. Australia is connected to 15 of them (that we know of), with the main landing stations in Sydney and Perth. They are buried under the beach, then fed out into the open water at depths of up to 8km before re-emerging in landing stations in Singapore, Oman and Hawaii, among others. And they’re vulnerable to sabotage and accidents, to hacking and (very occasionally) sharks. Last month two cables in the Baltic Sea – one connecting Finland and Germany, the other connecting Sweden and Lithuania – were damaged in a suspected sabotage attack. They were damaged at about the same time a Chinese-registered ship passed over them. On Thursday the Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said the Baltic Sea was now a “high-risk” zone. And experts say Australia’s own cables are not immune from threats. Despite the blustering promises of satellite technology, and despite the difficulty of building infrastructure thousands of metres beneath the surface, these cables still carry 99% of Australia’s data. They can carry up to 300 terabits of data a second, making their capacity “virtually limitless”. The maritime security expert Sam Bashfield is a research fellow at the University of Melbourne’s Australia India Institute. He says satellites are critical for remote areas, war zones and some backup, but the “backbone” of the internet are cables. Sign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads “We see this huge increase in demand for bandwidth … even though we see satellite technology improving,” he says. “The global demand for data is also increasing at this crazy rate, so it still requires these submarine cables. “Elon Musk’s Starlink gets a lot of media headlines [but] the big issue is that cable remains the backbone of global data transfer. It’s so much faster, it’s so much cheaper and the capacity is just so much higher.” If Australia was cut off entirely from those cables, essential services would be disrupted and there would be political, military and economic ramifications – digital technology contributes $167bn to the economy each year. “Without them, the internet as we know it would cease to exist,” Cynthia Mehboob, who is doing her PhD on the politics of undersea cables, says. Mehboob, who is in the Australian National University’s international relations department, says Australia’s reliance on the cables will only grow. “They’re vital for defence, for sharing intelligence,” she says. “Our Five Eyes arrangement is reliant on subsea cables. “Disrupting these cables would have a very serious geopolitical impact on Australian security.” In 2014 Google announced it was reinforcing cables with a Kevlar-like substance after a series of shark bites. A widely shared video showed a shark wrapping its teeth around a cable briefly before swimming off. But that’s not the biggest threat. Bashfield says fish bites are only responsible for 0.1% of damage. It’s fishing incidents that are far more common. Dredging, nets and trawlers can do damage, and anchors dragged over the cables can destroy them. Then there are geological events, such as underwater landslides or volcanoes. “That’s the unintentional damage,” he says. “Then you get into statecraft … the intentional stuff, this cutting of cables, they’re intentionally sabotaged as an act of war or in a grey zone conflict.” There are “choke points”, Bashfield says, where the cables hit the landing stations and all that data is flooding through. They are the potential sites for espionage and siphoning data for intelligence, he says. Mehboob says a “black swan” event, such as all the cables being cut at once, was “incredibly unlikely” but not impossible. “If it happened, it would be a catastrophe,” she says, adding that repairs could take weeks. There are between 100 and 200 breaks a year but only a limited number of ships that can fix them. When two of the three cables connecting Tasmania to the mainland were accidentally cut on the same day in March 2022, it gave an idea of the disruption that occur. Tonga, which has only one cable connecting it to the rest of the world, spent weeks without the internet this year. Last week Google Cloud revealed its Australia Connect project. New cables will connect Australia with Christmas Island and Fiji, where other connections go on to Singapore and the US. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, said the new systems would “expand and strengthen the resilience of Australia’s own digital connectivity” and “support secure, resilient and reliable connectivity across the Pacific”. Australia has also announced it will spend $18m over four years on a cable connectivity and resilience centre to strengthen engagement in the region – a move broadly seen as part of the Quad’s efforts to limit China’s influence. But it doesn’t own the cables – they’re owned by telecommunications companies and increasingly the “hyperscalers”, including Amazon, Meta and Google. Meanwhile, the geopolitics involving Australia, China, Taiwan and the Pacific remain complicated. Mehboob says while Australia has cable protection zones, even flagging them makes it clear to potential bad actors exactly where the cables are. And there’s no easy way to work out if damage has been done intentionally. “It’s a tricky attribution space,” she says. “Identifying intentional sabotage on the sea bed has always been a challenge. “It makes things a lot more murky.”"

Our room had a four-poster bed, and plenty of space for a sofa and armchairs. There’s a resident ghost, the green lady, as well as a panelled great hall, a dungeon and a friendly bar where we enjoyed smoked salmon and gin distilled about a mile away at GlenWyvis.

My bathroom alone was worth the trip: a vast, claw-foot, freestanding tub in the oldest part of the castle, a 12th-century tower. There are records of Thorntons owning the castle as far back as the 13th century: the current owners are descended from a lawyer who was distantly related to the original Thorntons, and bought it back in the 19th century.

It later became a ruin, before being rebuilt in the 1980s by an Aberdeen architect. Today, Nicola serves the drinks and gives you the tour, while John cooks your haggis-stuffed Balmoral chicken, local salmon or vegetable moussaka, eaten at the long table in the baronial hall after drinks in the cobbled courtyard garden.

Each main bedroom has its own floor and there’s an outdoor dining area and a balcony from which to gaze out to sea. Best of all is a turret-top, round viewing room, the perfect place for a drink as the sun goes down. And hard-pressed parents will love the castle’s best secret: a rooftop walkway leads to a tiny sauna, the ideal place for some “me” time, just a few steps from the kids.

          "headline": "Jamal Musiala hits back for Bayern Munich to break Dortmund hearts",
          "bodyText": "Jamal Musiala ran away patting his head in wonderment but, even if nodded equalisers are hardly his stock-in-trade, there was little to feel surprised about. Bayern Munich had been knocking on the door all half against opponents who never looked secure and eventually they did as they have all season, averting defeat and fending off any breathless predictions of a revived Bundesliga title race. Of course it was Musiala, who had already won them two games in November, rising above the mean on Germany’s highest stage. The tale of how Musiala was lost to England is well told by now. So the real story here was about someone who may shine in his stead; a player whose first senior call-up is surely a matter of time. Jamie Gittens illuminated this fixture, a modern-era classic in name and nature, by scoring a sensational goal just before the half-hour and tormenting Bayern all night from his perch on the left. If he lies on the periphery of public consciousness back home, perhaps now is the moment to remember his name. While a flagging Dortmund could not complain about being pegged back, their 20-year-old winger deserved to be on the winning side. It has taken time for Gittens to build momentum since joining from Manchester City’s academy four years ago but he is hitting a formidable stride. His eighth goal of the season, and third in three games, was a supreme piece of high-octane forward play. Dortmund had built patiently from the back when, fed in a seemingly tight position eight yards inside his own half and next to the touchline, he spun and left Konrad Laimer for dead. There was evidently no catching him as the pitch opened up and the only question, as he entered the penalty area, was whether he possessed composure to match warp speed. As the angle tightened he answered with a shot thrashed high beyond Manuel Neuer; the whole exhilarating sequence had lasted just eight seconds and it felt, to locals as well as those with concerns across the ocean, like a moment of arrival for the latest English talent to shine here. Perhaps Gittens would thrive running into the spaces Harry Kane creates. But if he might soon be England’s gain, there was pain in the striker’s departure five minutes after the opener. Kane had barely been involved during a curiously laboured first half from Bayern and was withdrawn after brief treatment for what looked like an upper leg injury. He was seen walking onto the team bus freely afterwards but the antennae of any watching FA emissaries will have been raised. “He said it’s not too bad, hopefully that’s the case,” Vincent Kompany said. On Sunday, Bayern released a statement: “Harry Kane picked up a minor muscle strain in his right hamstring. This was confirmed by a scan carried out by the FC Bayern medical unit. Bayern will therefore be without Kane, 31, for the time being.” Kompany could reflect that he had just about passed his biggest Bundesliga test to date. Dortmund had begun the day 10 points behind Bayern and remain too remote to be genuine positional rivals. But emerging unscathed, amid the usual febrile atmosphere at a game for which the hosts could have sold 400,000 tickets, represented a hurdle cleared. “No successful team can go through a season without such moments,” he said. For Dortmund and Nuri Sahin, two and a half years younger than Kompany at 36, a transitional year was always going to bring hard knocks. They shrugged off a lengthy injury list to outrun Bayern before the interval, forcing numerous mistakes and seeing Felix Nmecha, another City alumnus, shine at the base of midfield. Counters presented a threat and if Marcel Sabitzer had scored after the hour, rather than shooting against Manuel Neuer’s legs, they may have been out of sight. But Bayern, shaking off Kane’s departure, should have been level long before an unmarked Musiala glanced in a deliberate cross from the substitute Michael Olise. Had Gregor Kobel not saved brilliantly from Thomas Müller, or if Leroy Sané had hit the target when through, they may have had time to win it. Instead memories could linger on the sight of Dortmund’s yellow wall, a reassuringly special sight in a turbulent and troubled sport, pulsating to Gittens’ brilliance. “I hope in the next camp he gets selected, if he keeps going like this he’s got such a huge future ahead of him,” said Nmecha, asked about his teammate’s England prospects. The secret may now be out."

          "bodyText": "Earlier this year, teachers at Gilgandra high school, five hours drive north-west of Sydney, noticed a drop in the number of girls participating in sports. “We were brainstorming what the reason was that they were not participating, who the students were, and which activities they were not wanting to participate in,” says the school’s relieving deputy principal, Ilana Austen. They soon realised the problem: sports bras. “The students who are at the end of year 7 and are going into year 8 and 9, that’s when they’re going through lots of growth and development and that’s when we identified a real need,” Austen says. “Where we are, access to resources is quite difficult and there are no shops in town really that sell bras or underwear but we wanted to provide resources for all the students. The question was, were we able to provide appropriate sporting material for females as they were developing?” Austen had previously visited professional bra fitter Philippa Mitchell from The Fitting Studio. Based in Orange, 200km away, Mitchell travels to rural and regional towns fitting women of all shapes and sizes, from size 8 to 30 and AA to K cups, including women who have had cancer and need mastectomy bras and prosthetics. But fitting a school group was a new project. “[Austen] asked if they could buy 120 bras. So, we set it all up and fitted all the girls, ordered the right bras, boxed them up and all the girls got the same bra in the same colour on the same day,” Mitchell says. “The girls were very excited.” Sign up to receive Guardian Australia’s fortnightly Rural Network email newsletter Mitchell worked one-on-one with each of the teenagers. “If they were nervous or anxious I would say to them that I’m there to respect and support them,” she says. “For that five minutes, it’s me and them and it’s all very discreet and private.” Each girl received their bra before the school’s athletics carnival. Austen says it resulted in a 70% increase in female students participating on the day. The school’s equity funding paid for the initiative, and she hopes it can continue. “We know our kids, we know our community and are very in touch with the increased cost of living.” Mitchell has since received requests from schools in Dubbo, Binnaway, Singleton, Barham and Maitland. Binnaway central school principal, Lisa Wright, says it was difficult for her students to get professionally fitted for bras. “[We’re] fairly remote. The nearest place would be Dubbo, and we’re a low socioeconomic [region] so most of the community would not have access to get to Dubbo,” she says. “[Mitchell’s help] means our young ladies had the opportunity to be professionally fitted, which they may otherwise not have got, and it has increased their confidence. It’s a great initiative.” Mitchell says she only travels to places that don’t have a lingerie shop, and where the women are two or more hours from a major centre. She sets up at a shop in town, offers virtual fittings, and also owns a vintage retrofitted caravan that she takes to markets and expos, travelling as far afield as Millthorpe, near Orange, to Nyngan, 300km north-west. “There are many shops in metropolitan areas that offer this service, but in rural and regional areas the service is very limited,” she says. Self-worth, dignity and a well-fitting bra Charity organisation Support the Girls is also striving to provide professionally fitted bras and other essential products to disadvantaged and isolated women and girls, and using those services to drive participation in health checks like mammograms. Operating in Queensland and NSW, the organisation reaches more than 2,000 women every year. Founder Jane Holmes says the charity uses its gifting events to bring women together in a safe space, professionally fitting them “so they’re actually walking out the door with the correct product”. “All of the service that we do is complimentary,” she says. “It has a huge impact on their self-worth, their self-esteem and their dignity, which is really important.” The charity also holds breast screen events, which Holmes says have encouraged Indigenous women to participate in the free health checks. “Until now, the participation rate in mammograms has been drastically lower within our rural communities for Indigenous women. So it’s about closing the gap, but also about changing lives,” she says. Helen Byrne is another professional bra fitter based in Axedale, 22km east of Bendigo in central Victoria. “I’m all about building relationships with my clients,” she says. “I’ll re-service an area every 12 months because women change in bra size on average six times in their lives – there’s weight loss, having babies, weight gain.” “Last week, I went to visit three generations and they said they could never have got that service anywhere else.” One of her clients, Kate Edwards, who lives in Hilldene, 90km south-east of Bendigo, had her bra professionally fitted by Byrne for the first time this month, in the Victorian town of Seymour. “She is easy to deal with, full of knowledge about the best fit, and it’s so convenient,” Edwards says. “We have to travel at least an hour to buy a quality bra and it always gets pushed to the back of your list.” Byrne says she’s been asked many times to go to the city, but she wants to focus on serving country women. “I’ve lived most of my life in the country,” she says. “I know what a country woman does every day and I know my own personal challenges; working my business, to working the horses, to working on the property. That’s my passion.” Sign up for the Rural Network email newsletter"

          "headline": "‘I will never give up’: mother seeks new clues about British son missing in Sardinia",
          "bodyText": "The anguished mother of a British man who vanished in Sardinia this summer has urged a woman from Jersey, who he was with in the days before he disappeared, to come forward and assist with the police investigation. Michael Frison, 25, from Chard in Somerset, went missing in mysterious circumstances from a farm in Luras, a remote, barren area in the north-east of the Italian island on 13 July, the day he was due to return home from a holiday visiting his grandparents. Police conducted an on-the-ground search, assisted by firefighters, sniffer dogs and hundreds of volunteers, but found no trace. The search operation was called off after just two weeks, although an investigation is ongoing. Meanwhile, his mother Cristina Pittalis, originally from Sardinia, has travelled to the island several times in her unrelenting hunt for clues, saying there was “no reason” her son, a swimming instructor, would have just disappeared. “Michael would never have willingly left his family – he would not have done that to us,” she told the Observer. “I will never give up looking until I have answers.” Pittalis believes some of those answers could lie with a Jersey woman called Niomi, who she had never met but who joined Michael about a week into his holiday. Niomi needed somewhere to stay, so Michael asked his grandparents if she could stay with him in their home in Sassari for a few days. The pair then travelled to Luras to volunteer on a farm in exchange for food and accommodation. “Michael contacted me to say Niomi was expecting her father to arrive in Sardinia,” Pittalis said. “He felt uncomfortable leaving her alone in a foreign country and went with her to this farm. The plan was to stay there until her dad arrived and then he would come home.” Pittalis last spoke to Michael on 12 July. According to accounts given to police and Pittalis by Niomi and the farm owner, Michael returned from a walk the next morning in a confused state of mind, possibly due to heat-stroke. They put him in the shade and gave him water, only for him to go for a second walk and never come back. The shorts, T-shirt and trainers he had been wearing were found about 200 metres away, meaning he would have walked off in his underwear. All his other clothes, documents, laptop and mobile phone were found in the tent where he had been sleeping. Niomi left the island soon after and has since been uncontactable by Pittalis, despite several attempts. There are no accusations against her. “But it would be useful for her to tell me the story again, and the police too, to understand more about Michael’s state of mind,” said Pittalis. “There are so many things that just don’t add up.” She added: “It’s impossible to believe that Michael would have just gone for a walk, naked, in such impervious terrain – the land is full of scrubs and thorns; you cannot walk on it – and in temperatures of 40-45C. My motherly instinct tells me that he was taken, that others were involved.” Michael’s disappearance came after the high-profile searches this summer of TV presenter Michael Mosley in Greece and Jay Slater in Tenerife. But there has been little coverage of his story in the press beyond Italy. The trip to Sardinia had been a 25th birthday gift from Pittalis, who also has a 10-year-old son. “Michael is an amazing young man who never judges anyone and is always happy to help people,” she said. “He adored and was very protective of his little brother, who is heartbroken. Michael and I are very close, and he always had the freedom to live his life, which is why I don’t accept people who say he just wanted to disappear.” Pittalis said there were no signs that Michael was struggling with mental illness: “He was happy; he was sunny.” Police in Sassari did not respond to a request for comment. Hundreds of volunteers accompanied Pittalis on a recent search on the island, and she will return on 6 December. “I am constantly appealing to the public to keep awareness high, as if there is no body, it means that Michael is still alive,” she said. “It’s horrible not knowing. We’re living in limbo. It’s extremely difficult to sleep. But I will never, ever give up.”"

          "headline": "Musk could use the ‘Department of Government Efficiency’ for self-enrichment",
          "bodyText": "Elon Musk, named by Donald Trump to co-lead a commission aimed at reducing the size of the federal government, is poised to undermine funding for rural broadband services to benefit his satellite internet services company, Starlink. Musk has long been a critic of the Biden administration’s Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (Bead) Program, which provides $42.45bn through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill to expand high-speed internet access in rural communities. Starlink, the satellite internet services subsidiary of SpaceX, has largely been shut out of this funding after government agencies deemed it too slow to qualify. But with Trump’s election, and the deference Trump appears poised to give to Musk’s desired reforms, the world’s richest man could re-prioritize how the federal government provides high-speed internet to rural America, creating an immense conflict of interest. If Musk recommends cuts to government spending on rural fiber optic broadband – as he has repeatedly suggested – it directly increases the value of Starlink’s satellite internet services. “We have never had a situation where the leading shareholder of a communications company has both a position – both in terms of influencing the president, but also having an assignment to drive efficiency in government – with so many government contracts,” said Blair Levin, a telecommunications industry analyst with New Street Research and the Brookings Institution. “That is an extraordinary situation. That is unprecedented.” Levin suggested that Trump could order Bead funding to be withheld indefinitely as soon as he takes office, even though Congress has authorized the funding. Doing so would violate the 1974 Impoundment Control Act, a law Trump fell afoul of in his first term that ultimately resulted in one impeachment. But Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who will co-lead the commission to reduce the size of the federal government, argued in a Wall Street Journal editorial last week that Trump should pursue impoundment when he deems it necessary. “Mr Trump has previously suggested this statute is unconstitutional, and we believe the current supreme court would likely side with him on this question,” they wrote. Any move like this would tie the program in legal knots as lawsuits abound, Levin said. But the delay is the point. “While states and others could file legal actions to stop such a pause, we think most courts would be reluctant to enjoin or otherwise stop the administration from reconsidering some elements of the program. Even actions of dubious legality can benefit Starlink through delay or through litigation.” *** Musk had set his sights on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) long before Trump’s victory. The NTIA administers federal grant funding for the Bead program. Without a government subsidy, rolling fiber optic lines down country roads to serve a handful of houses at a time is usually too cost-prohibitive for an internet service provider. But to companies like AT&amp;T or Verizon, a government subsidy to a local internet service provider also looks like the government funding the competition. Big telecom companies and the FCC argued long and loud about what parts of the country had access to high-speed service, and thus didn’t need government money. But the definition of “high speed” used by industry and the government was often slow by many standards. After years of negotiation, lawsuits and politicking, the FCC and the NTIA settled on a modern definition for broadband service: 100 megabits per second (Mbps) download speeds, 20Mbps upload speeds, with less than 100 milliseconds of latency. Right now, Starlink doesn’t meet that standard. It has been getting slightly slower over time even as more people sign up for service, according to internet performance testing service Ookla’s speed tests. In 2022, the FCC rescinded a $900m grant from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund to Starlink to connect rural communities to the internet, citing its failure to meet the speed and latency standards and declining network performance. Musk erupted on an X post. “Starlink is the only company actually solving rural broadband at scale! They should arguably dissolve the program and return funds to taxpayers, but definitely not send it those who aren’t getting the job done,” Musk wrote. ”What actually happened is that the companies that lobbied for this massive earmark (not us) thought they would win, but instead were outperformed by Starlink, so now they’re changing the rules to prevent SpaceX from competing.” In June, Musk described the Bead program, which began rolling out grants to states this year, as “an outrageous waste of taxpayer money and is utterly failing to serve people in need”. A month later, Musk endorsed Trump and began a $100m spending campaign in support of his candidacy. After Musk started to gain Trump’s ear – and particularly after Musk’s endorsement and Starlink’s deployment of satellite terminals to areas hit by Hurricane Helene, which Trump praised regularly on the campaign trail – Trump’s language about rural broadband began to shift in Musk’s direction. Trump described Starlink as “better than the wires”, when talking with Joe Rogan in the much-watched podcast interview. “We’re spending a trillion dollars to get cables all over the country, right, up to upstate areas where you have like two farms … They haven’t hooked up one person.” Over the last year, the FCC commissioner – and Trump’s newly named FCC chair – Brendan Carr has also echoed Musk’s position, arguing that the public might be better off by subsidizing the cost of Starlink terminals instead of fiber optic broadband. After Trump’s election, Carr said the FCC is unlikely to revisit its rescission of Starlink’s grant, citing procedural hurdles. But Carr, who authored the FCC chapter of Project 2025, has suggested that as much as a third of Bead funding could go to satellite internet providers. Republican senators have also been agitating for changes to the Bead program. Senator Ted Cruz, poised to take over the Senate committee overseeing telecommunications, sent a letter last week lambasting the NTIA administrator, Alan Davidson, for alleged waste and administrative bloat in the Bead program. “Fortunately, as president-elect Trump has already signaled, substantial changes are on the horizon for this program,” Cruz wrote. “Congress will review the Bead program early next year, with specific attention to NTIA’s extreme technology bias in defining ‘priority broadband projects’ and ‘reliable broadband service’.” Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa sent Musk and Ramaswamy a letter on Tuesday with a roadmap for cost-cutting. The Bead program was on her target list. Davidson responded to earlier inquiries by Cruz, noting that the NTIA “has obligated over $28bn to states and territories, all of whom also received planning grants through the program”. The program “also creates room for all strategies, and the NTIA expects states and territories will use a mix of technologies to connect their unserved and underserved locations”, Davidson wrote. The NTIA announced earlier this year that Starlink could qualify for some Bead funding for services in extremely remote locations. In areas without broadband service from a landline operator, Starlink is often the only option. Project Kuiper by Amazon is also a low-Earth-orbit satellite internet service, which Amazon says will begin consumer offerings next year. *** SpaceX and its Starlink subsidiary are private companies that do not regularly disclose their finances. But analysts have argued that, until recently, Starlink had been losing money despite the success of SpaceX. That has changed over the last year as Starlink’s 6,000-plus low-Earth satellite network has come online and courted business in developing countries. Analysts from Quilty, a space industry intelligence firm, suggest that Starlink’s revenue has exploded, from $1.4bn in 2022 to $6.6bn in 2024. SpaceX and Tesla have about $15.4bn in government contracts, according to a recent New York Times analysis. Starlink is also competing with 15 other companies for US space force contracts worth nearly $1bn. Starlink did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Despite the obvious interest in government contracts, Musk and biotech entrepreneur and former presidential candidate Ramaswamy’s “Department of Government Efficiency” will be tasked with reducing the federal government headcount and cutting costs, which could include the Bead program. “Starlink and Bead are seeking to provide broadband to the same population: those living in low-density America,” Levin said. “While Starlink already has a network that covers the entire country, spectrum constraints and its relative functionalities compared to wired broadband service providers mean that the primary market for Starlink is in low-density America.” Starlink benefits from any delay in Bead funding, Levin said. “Every day Starlink is signing up customers in low-density America. Today, those in unserved and underserved locations likely believe that if they want a baseline broadband service, they have no choice but to subscribe to the Starlink service. The longer it takes for an alternative provider to come online with a similar or better service, the better it is for Starlink, as its sales process benefits from the current lack of broadband alternatives.” Reallocating funding from fiber to satellite would put money in Starlink’s pocket at the direct expense of terrestrial competitors. “While there are other technology options for high-speed connectivity, the most reliable, efficient and future-proof solution is fiber optic technology to the home or business,” said Tom Dailey, head of regulatory and government affairs at Brightspeed, an internet service provider competing for Bead funds. “Satellite broadband is a costly option that does not provide the same level of reliability or speed that fiber optic technology provides … We don’t anticipate that the Bead program will be eliminated. In fact, we believe it will continue and there is strong bias for fiber technology as the main means of connectivity given its superior speed and bandwidth capabilities.”"

          "headline": "Vote on assisted dying summons ultra-rare Commons sight: intelligent debate",
          "bodyText": "Who would have guessed? All too often debates in the Commons are partisan affairs, punctuated by jeers and braying. Where reason is superseded by dogma and ill-temper. This was a very different occasion. Parliament on its very best behaviour. Where necessary, people – mostly politely – agreeing to disagree. MPs heard in silence. Some in tears. Even more remarkable was the feeling there was intelligent life on view. The quality of argument was a cut above the average. There again, this was no ordinary debate. Most Fridays, Westminster is a ghost town with MPs back home minding their constituencies. But this was an exception. The day when a private member’s bill to legalise assisted dying for terminally ill people took its first step to becoming law. When some men and women of faith tried to imagine making laws for those of no faith. You could sense the passion. The importance. So often parliament feels remote. This was a law that may affect us all at our time of maximum need. After all, death is the only certainty. It’s just the timing and the manner that’s up for grabs Here the chamber was packed throughout the five-hour debate. Then a vote in which parliamentarians were free to go with their conscience. Governments don’t allow this sort of thing too often. We might end up with far better laws. Heaven forbid. The bill passed its second reading quite easily by 330 votes to 275. Not nearly as close as some had predicted. This was the Labour backbencher Kim Leadbeater’s bill so she got to talk first. Horror stories of people dying agonising deaths – deaths that no one would wish on their worst enemies. Jennie the guide dog snoozed in an aisle. Her dreams untroubled. She knew that when the time comes, her end will be painless and swift. Even if not of her conscious choosing. Leadbeater talked through the mechanics. This wasn’t a matter of life or death. It was one of death or death. Only adults who have been given less than six months to live qualify and even then two medical practitioners and a judge had to give the go ahead. Various opponents intervened to raise the issue of coercion. Not so much from families pressurising sick relatives to kill themselves, but terminally ill people believing they had a societal obligation to die sooner. There were no easy answers to this. We were trading in imperfections. There were no certainties in life. But it was far better to have a situation where these conversations were out in the open. Where doctors were on the lookout for signs of coercion. Because whether terminally ill people were allowed assisted dying or not, they would still be having the same feelings. And why shouldn’t sparing relatives from the agony of your death not be a small part of choosing to end your life? At present, 600 terminally ill people kill themselves each year. Those that can afford it go to Dignitas. Often alone and sooner than they might ideally like in order not to incriminate loved ones. How is that more humane than a medically sanctioned death at home? Some terminally ill people are going to want to kill themselves regardless. This bill was for them, said Leadbeater. Oliver Dowden interrupted to suggest that judges would inevitably seek to expand the scope of the bill. He seemed to think that all judges were natural born killers. Not content with dispatching the terminally ill, they would soon start working their way through the perfectly well. Weirdly, when it came to the vote, Olive walked through the aye lobby. There again, maybe he thinks it’s a good thing that judges kill as many people as possible. It’s a view, I suppose. Speaking in opposition to the bill, the Conservative MP Danny Kruger began by saying he was mindful of those whose lives would be prolonged against their wishes. His solution was better palliative and hospice care. Which sounded great. Except no government has ever been prepared to fund that properly. There just aren’t enough to go round. And added to this, there are limits to palliative care. There are some conditions that morphine can’t touch. The pain excruciating. And many people don’t want to die in a state of semi-consciousness. Danny also had it in for doctors. They too were basically killers at heart. Never come across a patient they didn’t think wouldn’t be better off dead. Best not to give doctors any more excuse than they had now. Going to see his GP must be a troubling experience for him. Never know quite whether you’re going to get out alive. The quality of debate was uniformly high. Labour’s Florence Eshalomi and the Conservative Kit Malthouse excelled while arguing for opposite sides. The veteran Tory MP David Davis made the case for keeping the debate going by voting for the bill. Otherwise it would be dropped for at least a decade. Amendments could be made at later stages for those worried about inconsistencies or mission creep. There were exceptions though. James Cleverly – yet again disproving nominative determinism – argued that if the bill was so good, why didn’t we extend it to children. Really. Honest Bob Jenrick used his time to have another go at ECHR. Everything that’s wrong in his world starts at Strasbourg. The independent Adnan Hussain thought we had already started assisted dying by removing the winter fuel allowance. For the only time in the debate, cries of “shame” were heard. Shortly before the debate wound up, Keir Starmer finally turned up in the Commons fresh from summarily sacking the transport secretary, Louise Haigh. Once the votes had been announced by the speaker there was a brief moment of immanence. When time seemed to stand still. No one quite able to believe what they had done. A change under way as momentous as equal marriage and the abolition of the death penalty. Esther Rantzen gave a statement on TV. The Commons then reverted to debating ferrets. Keeping it real.

          "headline": "Iran and Europe seek to break nuclear impasse before return of Trump",
          "bodyText": "Iran and the so-called E3 grouping of the UK, France and Germany have agreed to continue holding talks in the near future in an attempt to find a way out of an impasse over Tehran’s nuclear programme, in what may be the last chance of a breakthrough before Donald Trump takes up the US presidency again. Trump, who pursued a policy of “maximum economic pressure” against Iran during his first term, returns to the White House on 20 January. The decision to hold a further round of talks following a meeting in Geneva on Friday suggests the two sides believe there is still diplomatic space for an agreement whereby Iran would be more transparent about its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. But the chances of even an outline agreement before Trump returns to power seems remote. Iran is under pressure regionally after setbacks for the forces it has supported in Syria, Lebanon and Gaza. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian deputy foreign minister, said there would be more talks in the near future without going into further details. His tone was markedly more restrained than before the talks, when he said the EU “should abandon its self-centred and irresponsible behaviour” on a range of issues including the war in Ukraine and the Iranian nuclear issue. Europeans have become increasingly frustrated with Iran’s approach, including its provision of arms for Russia’s war in Ukraine and its lack of cooperation with the UN nuclear inspectorate, the International Atomic Energy Agency. Some Europeans fear that Iran’s growing stockpile of highly enriched uranium reveals it is on a covert path to building a nuclear bomb. Iran believes Europe rebuffed a clear signal of willingness to negotiate when Tehran offered to cap its uranium enrichment programme at 60% and to allow experienced IAEA nuclear inspectors back into the country. The aim of the Geneva meeting was to see if there was a basis for the Iranian offer to be developed, as well as to seek limits to Iranian-Russian military cooperation. In return, the EU could try to lift some economic sanctions, but the timetable is short before Trump takes power. Iran insists it has not provided any ballistic missiles to Russia, an assurance that the US does not accept. Speaking in Paris on Friday alongside his British counterpart, Richard Moore, the French foreign intelligence chief, Nicolas Lerner, said the risk of an Iranian nuclear proliferation was expected to be the most “critical threat” in the coming months. Moore said the Iranian regime’s nuclear ambitions “continue to threaten all of us” despite the series of blows dealt in recent months to Tehran’s allied militias across the Middle East. In a pre-meeting between Gharibabadi and the EU’s chief negotiator, Enrique Mora, little common ground was found, judging by the accounts of the exchanges issued by both sides. Gharibabadi, Iran’s deputy foreign minister for legal and international affairs, wrote on X: “Europe should not project its own problems and mistakes onto others, including with regard to the conflict in Ukraine … With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility.” Mora issued a shorter statement on social media, saying the two sides had frank exchanges. He added: “Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights.” The distrust between the two sides was made evident when the E3 countries on 21 November pushed ahead with a motion ordering the nuclear inspectorate to prepare a “comprehensive” report on Iran’s nuclear activities – the stepping stone necessary for European countries next autumn to snap back the UN sanctions that were imposed on Iran before it signed the 2015 nuclear deal. The UN nuclear agency has confirmed that Iran plans to install about 6,000 new centrifuges to enrich uranium, according to a report seen by AFP on Friday. “Iran informed the agency that it intended to feed” about 6,000 centrifuges at its sites in Fordo and Natanz to enrich uranium to up to 5%, higher than the 3.67% limit Tehran had agreed to in 2015. Seyed Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s foreign minister, said this week that the aim of the meeting was to find out whether the EU wanted cooperation or confrontation. He said that any snapback of UN sanctions was likely to lead to a change in the debate inside Iran about its possession of nuclear weapons. Iran has a fatwa in place opposing its possession of nuclear weapons, and the country insists its nuclear programme is only for civil purposes. Araghchi felt frustrated that Europe did not take a clearer independent approach after Trump pulled the US out of the nuclear deal in 2018, undercutting reformists inside Iran who said cooperation with the west over its nuclear programme would lead to a lifting of economic sanctions. Araghchi said Europe had done little to seek compromise since the election in the summer of the reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, who is committed to lifting sanctions by offering a more balanced policy between east and west."

          "bodyText": "“The noise never stops,” says Karla Hart, her voice competing with the hum of approaching helicopters. “I can feel them before I see them.” She looks at her phone to check a website that monitors air traffic and identifies operators. Hart wants to know whether the pilots are adhering to legal flight routes. A few minutes later, five helicopters, flying in formation, crisscross the grey October skies above Hart’s home in Juneau, Alaska’s capital. “I get groups of two to five helicopters flying over my house every 20 minutes. On any given day, that adds up to 50 to 75 flights. It’s impossible to enjoy my garden or concentrate on work.” For Hart and other Juneau residents, the noise from helicopters shuttling cruise tourists to remote glaciers is one of the many reminders of how their lives are being upended by a city that has embraced industrial tourism. Cruise passengers disembark to explore Juneau, Alaska, in September. Vessels like the Ovation of the Seas can carry more than 4,000 passengers. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian Juneau is one of the US’s most remote towns, accessible only by air or sea. The waters surrounding it are the traditional fishing grounds of Alaska’s Indigenous communities. It is wedged between towering mountains and the Gastineau Channel, a dramatic vista for more than 1.5 million cruise passengers who visit annually. Juneau was historically reliant on timber and gold, but as those industries have declined, the city now depends on tourism and government sector jobs. Cruise season runs from April to October, with as many as five vessels docking daily in the heart of the historic district. Ships such as the Ovation of the Seas and Norwegian Bliss, with passenger capacities exceeding 4,000 plus crew, arrive in the morning and depart by nightfall, only to be replaced by new arrivals. This cycle continues until the treacherous Taku Winds, with gusts reaching more than 100mph, signal the end of the season. Juneau activist Karla Hart in her home office. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian The rhythm of the cruise season dictates daily life for Juneau’s 32,000 residents. Local people monitor the schedule provided by the Alaska Cruise Ship Association and avoid the centre during peak cruise hours. Traditional seasons have been replaced by two distinct periods: cruise and non-cruise. Under an agreement with the City of Juneau, up to 16,000 cruise passengers disembark daily from Sunday to Friday, with a cap of 12,000 on Saturdays. Annually, cruise passengers outnumber the local population by 50 to one. Hart eagerly anticipates the end of the cruise season. It will offer a break from traffic congestion on the town’s single-lane road, and the relentless noise from aircraft ferrying tourists seeking a brief taste of Alaska wilderness. Souvenir shops selling little that’s authentically Alaskan, alongside jewellery stores offering Tasmanite and pendants for couples celebrating milestones, will shutter. Themed pubs, aspiring to evoke a bygone era, will close for the season. Hart, a former tourism business owner turned activist, is at the centre of a political fight that has divided the community. She spearheaded Proposition 2, a ballot initiative aimed at banning cruise ships on Saturdays and 4 July. In October, it was defeated by a margin of about 60/40, with approximately 10,000 people voting, more than in the mayoral election, which took place at the same time. “We’ve become an amusement park,” Hart says. “The soul of Juneau is being sold off piece by piece.” Ships must negotiate the Gastineau Channel before docking in Juneau’s historic district.

Photograph: Paul Souders/Getty Images Residents cherish their access to Alaska’s vast wilderness – its forests, mountains, waters and glaciers. They value the security and sense of community that defines small-town life in America. But Juneau’s identity has fundamentally changed with the rise of an industry that monetises experiences local people take for granted. Hiking, whale watching, fishing and kayaking – everyday activities for Juneauites – are packaged and sold at premium prices aboard the cruise ships. “It is a once-in-a-lifetime trip,” says Pat Farrell, who is in Juneau with his wife, Freda. The semi-retired couple from Dublin are passengers on the Celebrity Solstice and are on a typical seven-night Alaska itinerary. After a day of excursions, they return to the ship, where meals and drinks are already paid for. They take a few minutes to break away from the stream of passengers descending the terminal and crossing the ship’s gangway. Nearly 320 metres long and 19 decks high, the Celebrity Solstice is fully lit, shimmering in the late Alaskan summer evening. It’s hard to argue that these giant ships aren’t an engineering marvel. Many passengers see their experience as a ‘once-in-a-lifetime trip’, but this is also seen as ‘last-chance tourism’ because of climate breakdown. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian “I wanted to see the glaciers before they melt,” says Freda. Pat adds: “We’ve seen things we never would have, like glaciers and whales. It’s just beautiful.” Though conscious of the environmental impact of their cruise, they wanted to see these places before it was too late. The Farrells have noticed banners and storefront display stickers promoting cruise ship tourism but they are also aware of community divisions. “I see that some of these towns depend on the cruise ships,” Freda says. The ease of travel made the cruise an attractive option though. “Everything is well-organised, and the service is top-notch. It’s hard to resist the temptation. It’s the adventure of going to Alaska.” They tried to support local businesses. “We made it a point to shop at a store that says it’s Alaskan-owned, but I do wonder how the locals feel with so many of us here.” A cruise ship docked in Juneau, Alaska, 5 September 2024.

Photographs: Ed Ou/The Guardian *** The cruise industry is one of the fastest-growing tourism sectors, with more than 30 million people choosing cruises each year, according to the latest report from the Cruise Lines International Association. The industry promotes frontier tourism – visiting remote and “exotic” locations – with ships going into regions such as the Arctic, South Pacific and Galápagos Islands. Prof Jackie Dawson of the University of Ottawa termed the idea of seeing wildlife and habitat before they disappear as “last-chance tourism”. Others have labelled it extinction tourism. Environmentalists are sounding the alarm about the impact of cruise ships on fragile ecosystems. Arved Fuchs, a German adventurer and the first person to reach both the north and south poles on foot in a year, warned five years ago of the problem: “The number of cruise ships is rising, that’s the crux. And the bigger the ship, the more problematic this is.” Cruise ships travel along the Gastineau Channel as Juneau’s pet owners walk their dogs at Savikko Park. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian At a gathering at the Gold Town Theater, where activists and concerned local people are meeting to discuss the daily impact of cruising on Juneau, Stacy Eldemar, a member of the Tlingit Indigenous community, offers a particularly poignant perspective: “I don’t like the uncontrolled growth, the impact on the ecosystem that I’m seeing. [The ships] killed off the herring run. We used to gather herring. Our sacred spaces are disappearing. It is so important that we have these places where silence speaks.” Protect Juneau’s Future, a coalition of business owners and tour operators, opposed Proposition 2. It argues that limiting cruise ships will severely affect businesses, many of which are still recovering from the financial fallouts of the Covid pandemic. The coalition is heavily funded by cruise ship companies, primarily headquartered in Miami. The Alaska Public Offices Commission has recorded donations from Carnival Corporation, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and the Royal Caribbean Group of $75,000 each to Protect Juneau’s Future. Disney Worldwide services has contributed $30,000. In total, the Commission reports that Protect Juneau’s Future has generated $495,988 in direct cash donations from cruise lines, businesses with cruise ship interests, and a few individual supporters. It has employed two public relations companies to support its work. By contrast, supporters of the ballot have raised about $500. Portland Sarantopoulos, campaign manager for Protect Juneau’s Future, told Juneau Empire in September: “Protect Juneau’s Future is a local organisation led by residents from diverse backgrounds. Our 22 co-chairs and five executive committee members all live in Juneau. In addition to monetary donations from the cruise lines, we are proud of the many small dollar donations made by residents concerned about the negative impacts of Proposition 2.” Karla Hart, seated in front, at a town hall discussion on cruise ship tourism in Juneau in September. Proposition 2, which she backed, was defeated in a ballot a month later. Photograph: Ed Ou/The Guardian When asked about Proposition 2, the Cruise Lines International Association, the industry’s trade group, responded: “We believe ongoing, direct dialogue with local communities is the best way to collaboratively self-regulate, ensuring great experiences for both residents and visitors while providing a stable market for the many local businesses that depend on the cruise industry.” For business owner Holly Johnson of Wings Airways, the stakes are high. Her company operates five floatplanes that take tourists to see glaciers. She employs 78 people, 18 full-time, and helped to negotiate the agreement to limit cruise passenger numbers. Johnson argues that limiting cruise ships beyond the existing cap would have a real impact on businesses and the community. “Everybody is somehow touched by tourism because that’s the fabric of community, right?” she says. “There’s no bubble where the tourism people live and the other people live, and they go to different grocery stores, and their kids go to different schools, and they go to different hospitals.” She emphasises the ripple effect tourism has on secondary businesses – electricians, food producers, mechanics, fuel stations, for example – and how it provides jobs for young people, who might have few prospects otherwise. Alaska’s wilderness, including the Mendenhall glacier, pictured, is what attracts many visitors but overtourism also puts it at risk. Photograph: Patrick J Endres/Getty Images But Eldemar disagrees. “It’s ironic that the very thing these tourists are seeking is being destroyed by the industry that’s bringing them here.” Finding a balance between economic necessity and preserving Juneau’s way of life may be the town’s most significant battle yet.

          "bodyText": "Good morning. Despite Donald Trump’s decisive victory in the presidential election, a political scientist who developed a model that correctly predicted his sweep of battleground states warns that voters have not necessarily given the president-elect a mandate to make radical changes. Peter Enns, a Cornell University professor of government, said his model’s conclusions suggested voters chose Trump not because they wanted to see his divisive policies implemented, but rather because they were frustrated with the state of the economy during Joe Biden’s presidency, an obstacle Kamala Harris was not popular enough to overcome. What did Trump’s Ukraine envoy pick controversially propose? The retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg has written that the US could help end the war by withdrawing weapons from Ukraine if it does not enter peace talks – and giving even more weapons to Ukraine if Russia does not do the same. What’s Musk’s latest big idea? The tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has been tapped to run a “department of government efficiency” has said he wants to “delete” the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog that helps protect consumers from predatory financial practices. Mexican president claims ‘no potential tariff war’ with US after call with Trump Claudia Sheinbaum has said her “very kind” phone conversation with Trump, in which they discussed immigration and fentanyl, means “there will not be a potential tariff war” between the US and Mexico. The president of Mexico spoke on Thursday after Trump’s threat earlier in the week to apply a 25% tariff against Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff against China, when he takes office in January if the countries did not stop all illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling into the US. Sheinbaum clarified she did not agree to shut down the border. Did they discuss tariffs? No, according to Sheinbaum, but she nevertheless said that her conversation with Trump had reassured her that no tit-for-tat tariff battle would be needed in future. Israeli military to remain in Gaza for years, food minister says The Israeli military will remain in Gaza for many years, fighting against fresh Hamas recruits in the territory and could be responsible for delivery of humanitarian aid there, a senior Israeli minister has said. The comments by Avi Dichter, Israel’s minister for food security and a member of the security cabinet, confirm an emerging picture of a long-term deployment of Israeli troops inside Gaza. There is no immediate Israeli plan for any other administration to govern the territory’s 2.3 million people and begin reconstruction there. Israel has been accused of clearing parts of Gaza as part of a deliberate plan to permanently displace residents, but denies the charge. So what will happen to Gaza? Dichter said Israeli forces “are going to stay in Gaza for a long time” and that the ruling system would resemble “some kind of West Bank situation where you go in and out”. In other news … Police have clashed with protesters in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, after the ruling party said the government would suspend talks on EU accession until 2028. Women targeted by Taliban officials and detained under anti-begging laws have claimed they were subjected to sexual abuse, torture and forced labour, and witnessed children being beaten and abused. Spain’s leftwing government has approved “paid climate leave” of up to four days to allow workers to avoid traveling during weather emergencies, a month after floods killed at least 224 people. Authorities in Laos have banned the sale and consumption of a brand of whisky and vodka after the death of six tourists from a suspected mass methanol poisoning this month. Don’t miss this: Germany and the Nordic countries prepare citizens for possible war In the event of attack, Germany is developing an app to help people locate the nearest bunker. Sweden is distributing a 32-page pamphlet titled If Crisis or War Comes. Half a million Finns have already downloaded an emergency preparedness guide. If the prospect of a broader conflict in Europe seems remote for many, some countries at least are taking it seriously – and, in the term used by Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, taking steps to get populations kriegsfähig: ready for war. … or this: Astonishment as missing Canadian hiker emerges after weeks in wilderness Sam Benastick, a 20-year-old hiker, was moving slowly and unsteadily with the help of a walking stick in each frostbitten hand when he encountered two oil and gas workers in the British Columbia wilderness. When they took the sticks from his hands to help him into their truck, he nearly collapsed. He is now being treated in hospital after surviving 50 days lost, before being found alive “in an unbelievable miracle”.

          "bodyText": "This week, world leaders are gathering in Busan, South Korea, to hammer out a global plastics treaty to try to curb pollution from one of the most dangerous materials on the planet. While such a high-level event might seem far removed from our everyday lives, it is the products we use every day that are at the heart of the negotiations. Some plastics are worse than others and have a unique impact in various parts of the world. Here, we look at five of the worst offenders. Plastic sachets, Indonesia The sachet was popularised across Asia primarily by Unilever in the 1980s as a way to sell food and hygiene products in smaller, more affordable quantities. But in Indonesia, they replaced existing bulk-buy, reuse and refill systems. The result is that 5.5m sachets are now sold every day just for detergent in the country, whose citizens each produce 4kg of sachet waste a year, according to the nonprofit Plastic Diet movement. The problem is that the sachets’ multilayered construction – of plastic and metal – makes them virtually impossible to recycle. Overwhelmed waste management systems leak sachets into the environment, where they clog drains and contribute to floods. Some are burned as cooking fuel, which emit toxic chemicals that enter air and food. “The distribution is massive. We find them in even remote islands in Indonesia,” says Zakiyus Shadicky, senior research lead at Plastic Diet Indonesia. Unilever said that tackling plastic sachet waste is a priority for the company, and that it has so far installed more than 1,000 refill stations across Indonesia, saving an estimated six tonnes of plastic. Polyester clothing, Ghana and Kenya We typically don’t think of discarded clothes as plastic pollution. But between 60% and 70% of textiles are manufactured from synthetic fibres such as polyester. This becomes a problem when it ends up in unmanaged landfills in places including Ghana and Kenya. These countries accept secondhand and deadstock clothing traded by the EU and UK. But an investigation by the Changing Markets Foundation revealed that in Kenya, up to half of these garments are discarded, often because they are too damaged to wear. Dumped in open landfills, the clothes gradually disintegrate and pollute surrounding soils and rivers. “The trade of this used clothing from the global north to the global south is, to a large extent, the export of plastic waste,” says Urška Trunk, senior campaign manager at the Changing Markets Foundation. Globally, less than 1% of textile fibres are recycled, so Trunk is concerned about the increasing use of synthetic fibres, particularly by the 50 brands identified in its report. One of those was Shein, beloved by teenagers but, according to the Changing Markets Foundation, with the highest ratio of synthetic to natural fibres of the 50 fast fashion brands surveyed: four-fifths of its material output is made from fossil fuel-based textiles. “Plastic fashion is a problem, and it should be dealt with at the source,” says Trunk. Shein responded saying that “we are committed to continuously improving our sustainability practices”, and added that it is working on sourcing lower-impact fibres, using surplus materials from other brands, and transitioning to 31% recycled polyester in its Shein-branded products. Drinks bottles, Caribbean islands Every year in Ocean Conservancy’s international coastal cleanup (ICC) one type of litter consistently appears in the top five most-collected items: plastic drinks bottles. In the Caribbean especially, an estimated 2,000 plastic items litter each kilometre, one-fifth of which are bottles. Data from the ICC shows that in 2022 and 2023 alone, volunteers in Trinidad and Tobago collected 86,410 plastic bottles – almost half of all plastic waste collected there. Consumption patterns, paired with a shift from refillable glass bottles to single-use containers in the 1980s, might explain the scale of this pollution in the Caribbean. Plenty of plastic also washes up from other locations on to Caribbean shores. But there is also the role of increasing production by companies such as Coca-Cola, which sells more than 100bn plastic drinks bottles a year. A study based on 1,576 brand audits in 84 countries found that 11% of total branded plastic waste originated from Coca-Cola, more than any other company. Coca-Cola responded, saying that in several Caribbean countries they “are working on efforts to increase recycling rates with ongoing projects”. Food and beverage cartons, Vietnam In lives increasingly cluttered by plastic, there is a feelgood factor to rinsing out those folded cardboard containers that hold milk, pasta sauces and soups, and placing them in the recycling bin. Most of these cartons are made by the food packaging multinational Tetra Pak. But their neat cardboard exteriors conceal a more complex truth: layers of paper, metal and plastic lie nestled within. Multi-material products can be incredibly challenging to process and global recycling rates of Tetra Pak hover at about 25%. Yet the company has claimed that its packages are “simple” to recycle. In 2018, the Guardian conducted an investigation in Vietnam that showed recycling systems ill-equipped to process the complex material, paired with limited waste management. This created a scenario where Tetra Paks littered the country’s beaches or were being incinerated. A Tetra Pak spokesperson responded, saying that its packages “can and are being recycled where collection, sorting, and recycling infrastructure exists at scale”. The company added that in Vietnam it is working to meet a 15% government-mandated carton recycling target, and that since 2018 it has invested in local mills to increase their recycling capacity. Wet wipes, UK Each year, the UK disposes of 11bn wet wipes, but this ubiquitous symbol of personal cleanliness has a polluting underside. Many wipes are manufactured with synthetic fibres such as polyester, which take years to disintegrate. When wipes are flushed, they accumulate in sewers, gathering fat and congealing with other waste to form gigantic, pipe-blocking “fatbergs” – such as the 35-tonne monster that was pumped out of London pipes in May. Last year, the Marine Conservation Society (MCS) cleared 21,000 wet wipes from beaches across the UK and Channel Islands. In 2024, the UK government passed legislation banning plastic-infused wet wipes, giving manufacturers 18 months to adapt their products. “We need to see this implemented as soon as possible to reduce the amount of plastic blocking up our pipes,” says Catherine Gemmell, policy and advocacy manager at the MCS. Many manufacturers have switched to plastic-free materials in light of the legislation. However, the UK will continue to allow the manufacture of plastic wipes in the UK, which will then be exported to countries with looser regulations. That’s a good illustration of why global controls are needed, says Anja Brandon, director of plastics policy at Ocean Conservancy. “That’s where the [global plastics] treaty has potential value, in bringing in harmonised rules for everyone, so everyone has the same set of products that we’re restricting or prohibiting.”"

          "bodyText": "Germany is developing an app to help people locate the nearest bunker in the event of attack. Sweden is distributing a 32-page pamphlet titled If Crisis or War Comes. Half a million Finns have already downloaded an emergency preparedness guide. If the prospect of a broader conflict in Europe seems remote for many, some countries at least are taking it seriously – and, in the term used by Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, taking steps to get populations kriegstüchtig: war-capable. Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has dramatically raised security tensions across the Baltic region, prompting Finland and Sweden to abandon decades of nonalignment and join Nato. Military capability, however, is not all: citizens have to be braced too. “We live in uncertain times. Armed conflicts are currently being waged in our corner of the world. Terrorism, cyber-attacks, and disinformation campaigns are being used to undermine and influence us,” the Swedish pamphlet’s prologue says. Also available in English, it adds that collective resilience is essential and if Sweden is attacked, “everyone must do their part to defend Sweden’s independence – and our democracy … you are part of Sweden’s overall emergency preparedness”. Swedes have long been familiar with such public information pamphlets: the first was issued in the second world war. The latest advises on, among other topics, warning systems, air raid shelters, digital security and how to use the toilet if there is no water. It also recommends keeping a good supply of water at home (and checking annually to see if it is still safe); having plenty of blankets, warm clothes and alternative heating; getting a battery-powered radio; and storing plenty of energy-rich, quick-to-prepare food. Reaction among Swedish residents has been mixed. Johnny Chamoun, 36, a hairdresser in Solna, near Stockholm, said it was “good to be prepared”. But, he said, while the brochure was a good idea, it had not been much of a talking point. “In the salon I’ve not heard many people talk about it. Just one said they had got it,” he said. “They’re not stressing or anything.” But Muna Ayan, a healthcare worker from Stockholm, was concerned by how unconcerned many Swedes were. Having experienced conflict firsthand in Somalia, Ayan said she was frightened. “I am scared because I know what war means – I have survived war,” she said, adding that she had stocked up on water, battery lights, candles and Vaseline. She was also trying to work out how to tell her five children without scaring them. For people from Somalia, Syria or Iraq, talk of conflict in Sweden was traumatic, she said. “We who have been in war, we are not well. We are very worried, because if there is war we know what will happen. In war we have lost relatives, some children will disappear.” And Fatuma Mohamed, a health communicator in Stockholm, said many families in poorer areas did not have food for everyday life, let alone for stockpiling, while others were trying to find out where their local shelters were. She said she would like to see more information provided to people in person, rather than just in a brochure. Norway’s directorate for civil protection, DSB, has distributed a similar booklet to the country’s 2.6 million households. “We live in an increasingly turbulent world,” it says, affected by climate change, digital threats and “in the worst case, acts of war”. The Norwegian pamphlet advises people, for example, to hold at least a week’s worth of non-perishable food including “crispbreads, canned pulses and beans, canned sandwich spreads, energy bars, dried fruit, chocolate, honey, biscuits and nuts”. Norway also advises residents to stock up on essential medicines – including iodine tablets, in case of a nuclear incident – and, like Sweden, recommends that people have several bank cards and keep a ready supply of cash at home. In Finland, an exhaustive online guide called Preparing for incidents and crises offers residents information and advice on anything from water outages to wildfires, the collapse of the internet or “longer-term crises … such as military conflict”. More practically, on a separate website, 72tuntia.fi, Finland – which shares an 830-mile (1,340km) border with Russia – asks its citizens bluntly: “Would you survive 72 hours?” in a range of crisis situations, inviting them to put both their skills and their supplies through a series of tests. The site has tips on strengthening psychological resilience “to increase your ability to cope in difficult circumstances”, improving personal cybersecurity and sheltering indoors (“Seal doors and windows. Turn on the radio. Wait calmly for instructions.”) Suvi Aksela of the women’s national emergency preparedness association (Nasta), who is on the 72hours expert committee, said it had considered raising Finland’s food storage recommendation to a full week of supplies, as Sweden and Norway had done. But in the end, the committee decided against it because the 72hours messaging was so well-established in Finland, she said. “The 72 hours has become a brand here in Finland, so we didn’t want to break that. But that is just the minimum.” Russia’s war on Ukraine had been a “wake-up call” even in a country that had long been prepared, she said: women had signed up for preparedness courses, battery radios had flown off the shelves, and questions like “how much water do you have at home?” or “do you have a camp stove?” had become “more mainstream”. Germany’s focus, meanwhile, is on ramping up the number of its bunkers and protective shelters after an official estimate that the nation of 84 million has fewer than 600 public shelters, together capable of holding just 480,000 people. Many cold war shelters have been dismantled owing to the belief they would no longer be needed, but Berlin has now launched a national bunker plan under the Federal Office for Population Protection, including a geolocation phone app. Experts predict an attack by Russia may be a possibility within the next five years and the search is now on for any structure that could be used if such an event occurred, including metro stations and basements of public offices, schools and town halls. German households have been urged to adapt their own cellars, garages or store rooms, or excavate old bunkers, while housebuilders will be legally obliged to include safe shelters in new homes – as Poland has already done. The Frankfurter Allgemeiner newspaper this month revealed details of a 1,000-page army document aimed at German businesses – advising them, for example, to train extra lorry drivers – but containing civil preparedness recommendations for individuals. • This article was amended on 29 November 2024 to quote Boris Pistorius as using the term kriegstüchtig, rather than kriegsfähig, and to better translate this as “war-capable”."

          "headline": "Don’t be naive about the ceasefire in Lebanon. It may mean more horror and death in Gaza",
          "bodyText": "Joe Biden is making the most of the cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that he helped to broker. “It reminds us that peace is possible,” he declared in the White House Rose Garden, where US presidents habitually preen rather than prune. Yet Biden’s flowery self-congratulation jars at this fragile moment. It sounds like cruel mockery to the beleaguered people of Gaza. With the truce holding for a second day – despite some apparent breaches – Lebanon has been spared more death and wanton destruction, for now. Many people are celebrating and heading home to the south despite Israeli warnings. But Biden’s belief that the accord will hasten a Gaza ceasefire, spike the guns of Iran and its proxies, and open the way to the wider regional settlement he has long sought finds scant justification in fact. It’s a fact, for example, that Benjamin Netanyahu has not suddenly turned dovish peacemaker. Having unjustifiably ordered a large-scale ground invasion in Lebanon last month, preceded by aerial bombing and sabotage attacks in Beirut, Israel’s hawkish prime minister is quitting while he’s ahead. Operation Northern Arrows is being presented to the public as a success, unlike the 2006 war. Hezbollah’s military power has undoubtedly been seriously degraded. Yet the reasons why Netanyahu has refused for more than a year to accept a similar ceasefire in Gaza are intrinsically unchanged. The war there suits him politically and personally. Unlike in Lebanon, he continues to seek “total victory”. Concessions to Hamas, such as releasing Palestinian prisoners, would sink his hard-right coalition. The war keeps at bay an official investigation into the security failures surrounding the 7 October 2023 Hamas atrocities – and likewise, court proceedings against Netanyahu for alleged bribery and corruption. Whatever Biden may hope to achieve in the dog days of his presidency, Netanyahu has no incentive to end Gaza’s agony before his ideological ally, Donald Trump, swaggers into office on 20 January. Only then will he maybe act – and that’s a big maybe. The Lebanon ceasefire means cohorts of Israel’s overstretched army, once rested and rearmed, may concentrate in even greater force in Gaza. It brings closer the forced depopulation and de facto annexation of northern areas of the territory urged by Israel’s far-right extremists. Biden’s sudden Rose Garden conversion into an advocate for Palestinian rights – “the people of Gaza have been through hell,” he said – leaves an especially bad taste. As more than 44,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly civilians, died and innumerable others – young and old – were injured and traumatised, Biden refused to fully condemn Netanyahu’s illegal actions, impose credible sanctions or cancel weapons deliveries to curb Israeli excesses. It’s also a sobering fact that, under this agreement, Netanyahu can restart the war any time he chooses. Israeli troops have 60 days to withdraw. That timeline may stretch out. If Israel decides Hezbollah’s forces are not staying put behind Lebanon’s Litani River demarcation line, 18 miles north of the Israel-Lebanon boundary, or are rearming, then boom! The whole horror show resumes. If Netanyahu decides, arbitrarily, that a touch more war would be politically useful, he can have it, thanks to a flimsy deal that may be blown away in a moment. Almost forgotten, again, and not least by Netanyahu, are the 100 or so unaccounted-for Israeli hostages taken on 7 October. Hamas may be weakened by Hezbollah’s defeat. But there are no imminent or credible signs that the terrorist group, though more badly mauled than even its Lebanese ally, is minded to surrender its remaining “bargaining chips”. It is sticking to its demand for a full withdrawal by Israel. In point of fact, as Biden noted, there is presently no bargaining at all. He has reportedly made a ceasefire and hostage release deal that leaves Hamas “without power” in Gaza a top priority for the remainder of his term. He hopes that Egypt, Qatar and Turkey will help him out. He has failed in this repeatedly. The chances of success now are slim to nonexistent. Biden’s long-nurtured dream of a wider Middle East settlement looks as remote as ever. The plan revolves around the normalisation of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, on the model of the Abraham accords negotiated by Trump. This, it is thought, would help marginalise Iran while binding the Saudis more closely to the west (and keeping China at bay). Yet the fundamental snag facing this scheme is that it depends on substantive progress towards a two-state solution – in short, a sovereign Palestinian state. Since 7 October, attitudes on both sides of the Arab-Israeli divide have hardened. The Saudis absolutely insist on Palestinian self-determination. Netanyahu and his far-right crew absolutely insist on thwarting it by any means. This will not change simply because the guns have fallen silent in Lebanon, nor because Biden, at last knockings, wants to bequeath a peace president’s legacy. Not least because of business interests in the Gulf, Trump is also expected to pursue Saudi normalisation. But he lacks skill and focus. He will want an easy win, or he will lose interest. Like Netanyahu, he demonstrates open contempt for Palestinian rights. As a result, any more ambitious peacemaking effort looks bound to fail. Another fact: if the Americans cannot bring about a lasting, comprehensive Middle East peace, no one can. In the coming vacuum, Hezbollah, battered but unbowed, will surreptitiously begin to rearm, assisted as in the past by Iran. Its nose bloodied badly by Israel, the Tehran regime, too, will look for ways to reassert its regional standing and boost proxies such as Yemen’s Houthis before the next bout. One ever-more probable Iranian option, with growing, illicit support from Russia, is to move to develop, rather than just talk about developing, nuclear weapons – especially after its offer this month of a new nuclear pact was rebuffed by the west. It’s too much to hope that Trump will deal sensibly or even sanely with the reality of an Iranian bomb or all the other super-complex Middle East challenges. His capricious incapacity will exacerbate the chronic instability and paralysis that besets a region; a place where fleeting, fragile ceasefires merely mask the true terror of war without end.

          "headline": "Astonishment as missing Canadian hiker emerges after weeks in wilderness",
          "bodyText": "He returned as a ghostly apparition on a forestry road in western Canada, moving slowly and unsteadily with the help of a walking stick in each frostbitten hand. A cut-up sleeping bag was wrapped around his legs, shielding them from the bitter cold. The two oil and gas workers, who had spent the previous week surveying the trail, stared dumbfounded. When they took the sticks from his hands to help him into their truck, he nearly collapsed. The harrowing details are a coda to the “unbelievable miracle” of a hiker who survived 50 days lost in the Canadian wilderness – and to the sustained and desperate search by his family and friends. On Wednesday, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police confirmed that Sam Benastick, 20, was being treated at the hospital in Fort Nelson, British Columbia, more than seven weeks after he was last seen heading into the wild. He was suffering from frostbite and smoke inhalation caused when his makeshift shelter burned down. Benastick set out on 7 October, on what was supposed to be a 10-day camping trip; he was reported missing by his family after he failed to return home on 17 October. An avid outdoorsman, Benastick was destined for Redfern-Keily provincial park – an 80,000 hectare swathe of “lush alpine meadows, forested valley bottoms, serrated peaks, glaciers, waterfalls and large valley lakes” in the northern reaches of the Rocky mountains. Access is challenging: the park is 50 miles (80km) from the closest road. And its website warns the remote backcountry landscape can be unforgiving. “Be prepared for any weather conditions while visiting the park: you are in an isolated area and weather can change rapidly,” it says. In recent days, temperatures have dipped to below -20C and snow has blanketed the ground. For Benatstick’s family, news he had survived against the odds was vindication for the the sliver of hope they had long clung to. On 23 October – more than a month before Benastick was eventually found – his aunt Karen Crocker Essex posted on Facebook that “tomorrow is a big day for our family with helicopters and a larger crew” to support this search. “Winter is setting in and we need to bring Sam home!” More than 50 people, and search dogs, scoured the region for any hint that Benastick was alive. But a week later, his mother, Sandra Crocker, thanked the “endless volunteers” who had been unable to find a trace of her son. The official search had ended, but family refused to accept that Benastick had succumbed to the worsening conditions. Family and friends speculated he might have run into trouble 19 miles into the hike, turning around to sleep in his car, possibly to a different location. They also scoured his online searches of hiking locations, and scouted the nearby Sikanni Chief River with no luck. In the end, Benastick was found close to where the initial search had begun. The oil rig workers piled a cold, fatigued and dehydrated Benastick into their truck and fed him their sandwiches. When they got him back into the range of mobile phone service, he called his father. His voice was weak. Later that day fatigued Benastick told police he had stayed in his car and then walked to a creek, where he camped for nearly 15 days. He later built camp in a dried-out creek bed, before finding the road and flagging down the two oil workers. The Central Okanagan Search and Rescue, which was involved in the search along crews from four other regions, called the discovery an “unbelievable miracle”. Mike Reid, the general manager of the Buffalo Inn in Pink Mountain, BC, said he first received a message from the hotel owner that “Rob” had been found alive. For 24 days, Sam’s parents had stayed at the Buffalo Inn while formal search efforts intensified, ebbed and were eventually called off. “I didn’t know who Rob was, but I had a flash of hope. So I texted Sam’s dad to check in on how they were doing. I didn’t want to get their hopes up. Within a minute, he called me back and said ‘they found him,’” said Reid. After seeing the family through a string of low points, Reid said the news is “unbelievably good”. During the search, Reid forwarded a newspaper clipping from 1969 to Benastick’s mother: it told the story of two survivors of a plane crash in the area, who lasted 49 days in the bitter cold before they were eventually found alive. “I sent it to Sam’s mom and told her this could happen to your son,” he said. “And when I spoke with her yesterday, I said, ‘Hey, remember that clipping about the plane crash? And she said, ‘I’ve been thinking about it all day.’ Sam loves the outdoors. That’s why he was out here. And that’s how he survived.” News of Benastick’s survival was bittersweet for the region, after hunter Jim Barnes and his dog Murphy were reported missing 18 October after leaving for a grouse hunting trip, less than 140 miles from where Benastick was last spotted. Search teams found his truck as well as his keys, wallet, backpack and rifle. Neither Barnes nor Murphy were found near the vehicle. The search was suspended on 25 October, but a day later a frozen boot print and dog print were spotted along a river bank."

          "bodyText": "A lawyer for the Northern Territory police has told an inquest into the death of Kumanjayi Walker that it is “absolutely undeniable” that Zachary Rolfe is a racist. The inquest into the death of Walker is holding its final hearings, almost two years after it was due to be completed. Walker, 19, was killed by the then Northern Territory police constable Rolfe during a bungled arrest in the remote NT community of Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. Rolfe was later charged with murder but was acquitted of all charges after a supreme court trial. The inquest into the case is hearing final oral submissions in Alice Springs this week. Ian Freckelton KC, for the NT police, told the coroner, Elisabeth Armitage, on Thursday that a combination of Rolfe’s text messages, his evidence, and other corroborating evidence meant that “it is absolutely undeniable that Mr Rolfe is a racist”. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email “People who talk about loser locals, coons, neanderthals, losers on the basis of their Aboriginality, are racist, and it’s important to call it as it is. And the position of the Northern Territory police force is that it is trying to call things as it is. “We have no reservation about saying to your honour that you should have no hesitation in making similar robust characterisations.” Rolfe said during his evidence earlier this year that racist language was normalised in the force, but that he had never seen an officer treat anybody differently because of their race. Freckelton said Rolfe was “sexist, misogynistic, homophobic” and had a “distrust for authority and contempt for bush cops”. He said his attitudes were “inconsistent with contemporary policing anywhere in Australia”, including in the NT. “He lacks insight, he has a propensity to deny what cannot be denied, and he rationales what he cannot avoid confronting. “His credibility, to put it in a very generous way, is open to serious doubt.” Freckelton went on to say, however, that concerns about Rolfe’s attitudes, and about five incidents where excessive force may have been used during his policing, were not known at the time Walker was killed. He said it was wrong to think that the force allowed Rolfe to engage in a pattern of behaviour that culminated in the death of Walker, and submissions to Armitage that suggested this lacked cogency and rigour, and were not supported by evidence. Freckelton said the force was committed to reform, including in weeding out “warrior mentality”, taking a zero tolerance approach to racism, which resulted in the recent removal of recruits from training, and would consider working with the Yuendumu community to limit the occasions when guns were carried by officers. “We know about what Mr Rolfe really thought … but the issue for the Northern Territory police force is what to do to try to eradicate these kinds of values.” Freckelton said the force’s appointment of Leanne Liddle was not tokenistic or an experiment, and she was not a panacea or a magician, but that her work in the first five months of her tenure was “very positive”. “There is every reason, we submit, to be optimistic that the police force has learned lessons,” Freckelton said. “We very much hope that those who loved and valued Kumanjayi Walker can derive some modest comfort that they have been listened to and changes have been made, and more will continue to be made.” Rolfe’s lawyer Luke Officer said on Thursday that Armitage should “be careful not to single out Mr Rolfe” if she came to make findings in relation to racism, given the court had heard evidence about other police being racist. This included officers in the Tactical Response Group who were revealed after Rolfe’s evidence, Officer said. On Wednesday, Officer said that Armitage should limit the scope of her findings to matters that directly related to Walker’s death, and that to do otherwise would risk her threatening the jury verdict in Rolfe’s case. Armitage said that she would consider an invitation to deliver the findings of the inquest in Yuendumu. She said she expected to deliver these findings in late February."

          "bodyText": "Good morning. At 4am local time on Wednesday, a ceasefire began between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon. By that time, some displaced residents of Lebanon’s devastated south were already on their way back, many of them wondering as they travelled whether the homes they had fled were still there. The pause in hostilities has been broadly welcomed in Lebanon, Israel and beyond, both for those who have been exiled on either side of the border and as a step towards regional stability. There are even some optimistic claims that it might help bring about a ceasefire in Gaza. But as the Lebanon ceasefire begins, a formidable task remains: the reconstruction of a shattered region of a country that is perilously close to being a failed state. For today’s newsletter, I spoke to the Guardian’s William Christou, as he returned from a reporting trip to the southern border, about what he saw and what comes next. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Assisted dying | The former president of the supreme court, who ruled on the most high-profile assisted dying cases, has declared his support for the law change. David Neuberger’s intervention came as MPs backing the bill say they believe they have the numbers for Friday’s historic vote to pass. UK news | Police believe Mohamed Al Fayed may have raped and abused more than 111 women over nearly four decades, with his youngest victim said to have been 13 years old. The Metropolitan police said that five unnamed individuals were being investigated for facilitating the offences. Ukraine | Ukraine’s power infrastructure was “under massive enemy attack” on Thursday, the country’s energy minister said, after a nationwide air raid alert was declared due to incoming missiles. Weather | The third named storm of the autumn, Conall, has brought more disruption to the UK, with trains cancelled in parts of southern England on Wednesday and the Met Office warning of delays on roads and potential power cuts. Trade | Canada’s federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces have agreed to work together against a threat by US president-elect Donald Trump to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Possible retaliatory measures are under consideration after Trump said one of his first executive orders would be a 25% tariff on all products from Canada and Mexico. In depth: Tackling mass displacement and destruction with meagre resources William Christou set off from Beirut to the devastated port city of Tyre at 7am yesterday. You can read about his visit here. The drive usually takes just over an hour: this time, it was twice as long. “There were jubilant scenes on the highway,” he said. “There were people clapping, cars with mattresses on top, a minority waving Hezbollah flags. There was a sense of excitement at going home.” Later, the traffic intensified: the BBC’s Hugo Bachega reported that the drive from Beirut to Sidon, the first major city on the coast south of Beirut, took more than four hours instead of the usual 20 minutes. But on a tour of areas near the border organised by Hezbollah later in the day, a grimmer reality presented itself. About 6km from the border, William saw two dogs eating the corpse of a dead horse in an otherwise deserted village, Silaa. In a nearby town, Zibqeen, two sisters called Zeinab and Dina, aged 19 and 28, said that they had started driving at 3am. “They were excited to make the journey, but sad for those who had died, and for the damage that has been done,” William said. “Their house had been destroyed.” *** The return | Many will have to stay in shelters At least 1.2 million Lebanese people have fled their homes since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel began. About 96,000 Israelis have been displaced on the Israeli side of the border. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than a fifth of internally displaced people in Lebanon are in collective shelters and more than a third are children. Yesterday, Lebanese parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri told those forced to flee: “I invite you to return to your homes … return to your land.” But the Lebansese government and military, as well as the Israeli military, have warned people not to rush back to war-torn areas. And it is likely that most of those going home are realistic about the fact that they will not be able to stay there, William said. “They are mostly just checking on their houses – many of them will be gone, and there may be unexploded bombs.” The Lebanese Real Estate Authority warned that bombs, weapons and booby-traps could still be in and around people’s homes, and urged the authorities to conduct a thorough survey before people are given the green light. “So they will still need to be housed elsewhere, whether that’s in shelters or with relatives,” William said. “The internal displacement crisis will continue.” *** The reconstruction | A huge task with few resources More than 100,000 homes have been destroyed in southern Lebanon, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. The destruction is most intense in the border area, which Israel has been attempting to clear out to prevent cross-border attacks by Hezbollah in the future: an NBC News investigation using satellite data found that 42% of buildings in areas seized by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been destroyed. Water and electricity supplies have widely been cut off, as well. There were some nascent signs of a reconstruction effort yesterday, William said, with excavators arriving, rubble being removed and roads being cleared. “But it’s not clear how the work can be done on a large scale.” Lebanon has been in the grip of corruption and an economic crisis for years, and is virtually a failed state, while Hezbollah, which has long effectively ruled much of the south, has been vastly weakened by Israel’s onslaught. After the last war between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006, “the Gulf states [and] Russia put money in. It’s not clear if they’re interested this time.” Meanwhile, an international summit in Paris last month secured about $1bn in reconstruction pledges from international donors. But a World Bank report two weeks ago estimated the damage and loss from the conflict so far to be about $8.5bn. Lebanon’s GDP is $20.1bn. *** Hezbollah | Claims of victory undermined by severity of losses Hezbollah might once have been expected to fill much of that gap, perhaps using resources funnelled from its Iranian sponsors. That appears less likely this time. Yesterday, William asked Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah how it would be involved in reconstruction efforts: “He answered in vagaries. He couldn’t say how long it would take.” Despite the vast losses it has suffered, with all of its senior leadership killed, including secretary general Hassan Nasrallah, and its capacity to wage war vastly diminished, Hezbollah has sought to present the ceasefire as a victory. “The new secretary general, Naim Qassem, made a speech recently saying that it’s going to be Hezbollah cleaning up the roads and coordinating the work,” William said. “They say they’re not going anywhere.” But whether they will retain the support they have long enjoyed among a section of Lebanon’s population is not clear. One image in particular, which summarised how much they have been weakened, stuck with William: “In 2000, Nasrallah gave a famous speech to a huge crowd at the Bint Jbeil stadium after the Israelis withdrew from south Lebanon. We went there, and there’s still a little memorial where he stood. Hassan Fadlallah spoke in the same place with an audience of a dozen journalists and empty stands covered in wreckage. He declared victory, and it rang hollow.” *** The Lebanese army | A new role – but a very weak force In theory, the Lebanese army will now be taking charge of the south of the country, and the ceasefire calls for a deployment of 5,000 troops. Yesterday, former Lebanese army general Khalil Helou described the ceasefire as a chance for the army to “assert itself”, and added: “It’s not only a matter of hope, it’s a matter of taking responsibility.” The army lacks the cohesion and support it may need to take a more commanding role. Meanwhile, Lebanon’s economic crisis has left the army denuded of resources, and at least for now it has no significant presence in the south. “It was telling that this tour was organised by Hezbollah, not the army,” William said. “No one was manning the army checkpoints. And Unifil [the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] says that it can’t always coordinate patrols with the army because they don’t have gas for their vehicles. Soldiers are paid about $100 [£79] a month.” *** What happens next | Anxiety about whether the ceasefire will hold The ceasefire has been agreed for 60 days. In theory, it should then lead to a permanent cessation of hostilities. “But there is a lot of apprehension in Lebanon about whether the 60 days will hold,” William said. “That’s not so much on the Hezbollah side: they have their tail between their legs, and they’re not in a position to fight.” But Israel has reserved its right to respond to military activity on the ground, and the IDF said that warning shots were fired yesterday to dissuade suspected Hezbollah operatives in border areas. “The worry is: if Israel sees weapons being transported and launches a drone strike, would Hezbollah then respond? It will be quieter in the short term, no doubt. But in the long term, Hezbollah is going to want to rebuild, and to return to a scenario where it is able, despite an agreement that says otherwise, to operate freely.” As for the wider picture in the region: in this analysis piece, the Guardian’s senior international correspondent Julian Borger writes that Israeli domestic politics mean that “the ceasefire in Lebanon arguably makes it less likely that an agreement can be struck in Gaza”. For now, at least, the prospects for real stability at Israel’s borders look remote.

It was a real challenge to balance the business with family life, as the pair worked 15-hour days and had no relatives living near them in Victoria, south-eastern Australia. But they discovered an unexpected solution through their local community. Along with three other families who also had no extended family nearby, they formed a supportive “village” to help raise each other’s children together. As the restaurant grew, earning industry awards along the way, the family’s dynamics transformed. Kazuki found a better work-life balance, and he is now closer to his children than ever. “I love serving fine-dining to my customers, but I cherish making home-style food for my family too,” he writes. “I love that my children get excited thinking about what to eat”.

          "bodyText": "Abandonment, when it came, crept in from the outskirts. Homes at the edge of town were first to go, then the peripheral grocery stores. It moved inward, slow but inexorable. The petrol station closed, and creeper vines climbed the pumps, amassing on the roof until it buckled under the strain. It swallowed the outer bus shelters, the pharmacies, the cinema, the cafe. The school shut down. Today, one of the last institutions sustaining human occupation in Tyurkmen, a village in central Bulgaria, is the post office. Dimitrinka Dimcheva, a 56-year-old post officer, still keeps it open two days a week, bringing in packages of goods that local shops no longer exist to sell. Once a thriving town of more than 1,200, Tyurkmen is now home to fewer than 200 people. On a warm spring afternoon, Dimcheva stood in the town square. “The weddings took place here, all of the folk dances, the volleyball. There were lots of young people. A pool,” she said. She gazed around, pointing to ruins or now-empty spaces where buildings once stood, remembering. There, the building that housed a small cinema. Behind it, the space for a school that burned down, was rebuilt, then closed. “Life was bubbling.” Now, she said, “life in the villages is dying”. Thousands of similar villages are scattered across Bulgaria. After the fall of communism, people flocked to the cities in search of work, and over the next 30 years many villages emptied to the point of obliteration. As of the 2021 census, almost 300 villages were completely abandoned, and more than 1,000 had populations below 30 – most of them very elderly. With its low birthrates and high rates of emigration, Bulgaria has been emptying out for decades. Its population has dropped from close to 9 million in 1989, to fewer than 6.5 million – one of the worst peacetime population declines in modern history. Bulgaria lies at the extreme end of this kind of demographic change, but the forces reshaping it are acting everywhere. Over the past half century, the global portion of people living in rural areas has decreased by almost a third. Farming is becoming increasingly industrial and concentrated. More than half of all people now live in and around cities, and that figure is expected to rise to 70% by 2050. In many countries, birthrates are dropping steadily, and while the global population is projected to keep growing until 2080, around half of that growth is being driven by fewer than 10 countries. As populations move and shrink, people are leaving long-occupied places behind. Often they leave everything in place, ready for a return that never comes. In Tyurkmen, Christmas baubles still hang from the curtain rails in empty houses, slowly being wrapped by spiders. In one abandoned home, a porcelain cabinet lay inside a crater of rotted floorboards, plates still stacked above a spare packet of nappies for a visiting grandchild. Occasionally, abandonment happens all at once, when a legal ruling or evacuation sends people scuttling. But mostly, it is haphazard, creeping, unplanned. People just go. Since the 1950s, some scholars estimate up to 400m hectares – an area close to the size of the European Union – of abandoned land have accumulated across the world. A team of scientists recently calculated that roughly 30m hectares of farmland had been abandoned across the mainland US since the 1980s. As the climate crisis renders more places unliveable – too threatened by flooding, water shortages and wildfires to build houses, soil too degraded and drought-stripped to farm – we can expect further displacements. This world-altering shift has drawn remarkably little attention. “It has been there all the time – but we did not really describe it,” says Prof He Yin of Kent State University, one of the scientists now using remote sensing to create global maps of abandoned land. “We talk about expansion,” he said, referring to development of land. “Yes, absolutely that’s important. But there’s this other side – abandonment – that people don’t really talk about.” Alongside this story of depopulation is another story – of what happens to the land left behind. To preserve a livable planet, it is crucial to preserve and expand forests, grasslands, healthy ecosystems and wild places. Huge expanses of abandoned land represent an opportunity but also a question, an ongoing experiment without clearly predictable outcomes. For thousands of years, humans have dramatically shaped the places where they live, transforming the Earth’s face. So what happens to the natural world when people disappear? * * * It was this puzzle that drew ecologist Gergana Daskalova to Tyurkmen. On a hot, quiet morning in May she walked down the main street. It was empty of people, but lined by papers that fluttered in the early summer heat, tugging at their staples on the fences, gates and power poles. When a member of the household dies in Bulgaria, it is traditional to mark their passing with a notice. The A4 printouts featured a name, photograph, date of death and a brief tribute. Each noted how long ago the loved one had died: six months, a year, a decade, 22 years. In villages across the country, these posters often also mark the end of human habitation. “If you walk around, you’ll see it’s like this clock that’s ticking, measuring the time since those people have left us,” Daskalova said. “On a human level, that’s very sad. But that clock, it’s also measuring the end of human impact, and the onset of environmental change afterwards.” Daskalova specialises in global change ecology: how large-scale human activity is reshaping the natural world. She is in the middle of an ambitious research project, studying 30 villages across the Bulgarian countryside in different stages of abandonment. Along with collaborators and students, she is gathering a huge range of data: using aerial drones to map the return of forests, block-by-block botany surveys to see what plants are growing, audio recorders on trees to capture shifts in the density and volume of birdsong. Over time, she hopes to compare the ecology of derelict villages with those where some people remain, providing a comprehensive picture of how nature responds when humans leave. Daskalova, is in her early 30s, with a chatty warmth and patient knack for breaking down scientific theory, possibly honed by a year of explaining to curious shepherds why she’s out strapping microphones to trees in remote fields. She recently gave birth to her son, and on some days he watched from her hip, swaying and serious-eyed, as she strode around research plots. Tyurkmen was not a randomly selected research site – it is the place she grew up. Like many of her generation, as a young child Daskalova was largely raised by grandparents while her parents went to work in the nearest city. Eventually, she left for university. “For a decade, I was one of the people who left the village and only returned occasionally, and every time I came back, there were less and less people living on my street,” she said. When she was younger, Daskalova would track the creep of abandonment in the wintertime, watching to see whether smoke emerged from a chimney down the street, or light shone from one of the windows. “Instead, one by one, the lights get turned off,” she said. For the first few years of her career, Daskalova worked in far-flung places, including the arctic tundra. But she remembered the great depopulation she had lived through, and recognised that it was part of something wider, with scope to reshape the future of thousands of species. Today, she lives and works in the home in Tyurkmen that once belonged to her grandparents. All around her, homes stand empty. Across the street, one house has crumpled inward, like a cardboard box left in the rain. Inside, that morning, nesting barn swallows orbited a bedroom. The front door had been knocked off its hinges, still carrying an enamel plaque: an award dispensed by communist-era local authorities, reading “exemplary home”. Abandoned places are not the most alluring research sites: “They’re not the rainforests, not the gorillas,” said Daskalova. Individually, each research site is just a village, like thousands of others. “But in a way that’s what makes it special,” she continued, “because depopulation is happening at a really big scale.” And what comes after abandonment is often not what we expect. * * * News that great swathes of our planet are being abandoned can excite visions of a rewilded Eden in the ruins of humanity. In the absence of humans, nature will come roaring back. Deer will roam the streets of crumbling cities, vines will crack the concrete, football fields will give way to forests. The skies will clear and species will flourish. In 2020, lockdowns gave many people a taste of what semi-abandonment might look like. As humans were forced indoors, wild creatures returned to some urban streets and suburban gardens. “Humans are the virus,” observers declared, in a mixture of earnest commentary and internet punchlines. In their absence, “nature is healing”. Visions of humans as a pox upon the natural world – and of paradise sprouting in our absence – are intertwined with some of ecology’s oldest ideas. In the late 19th century, botanist Frederick Clements helped popularise succession theory, the idea that left to its own devices, any disturbed landscape will follow a step-by-step progression. A ploughed field, for instance, will be overtaken first by fast-growing grasses and weeds, then shrubs, which finally thicken into trees and forest. Clements argued that any place would move through succession to a “climax” state of stable equilibrium. The final result could differ according to climate and geography, an alpine forest being different from a swamp or desert. But the essential trajectory was always the same: a “universal law”, Clements wrote, of ecosystems climbing toward climax like an animal progressing through infancy toward adulthood. The idea gained traction through the early 20th century, coinciding with a period of explosive growth in human cities, populations and industry. It had a kind of simple, elegant beauty. As people watched human activity transform the earth around them, it also offered a certain comfort. No matter how dramatic the disturbance – whether the retreat of a glacier or the razing of a forest for farmland – nature’s capacity to return remained. That ideal climax state would rest like a substrate beneath the soil, lying dormant even as the land above was tilled or excavated or burned or paved. To return, all it needed was time and benign neglect. Over time, Clements’ more sweeping theories were picked apart by fellow botanists. The stable, permanent climax communities he had theorised proved elusive: field studies continued to find ecosystems passing through unpredictable cycles of collapse, regeneration, divergence and stasis. Today, this deterministic version of succession theory is seen as widely debunked. But Clements’ vision endured in the popular imagination – sometimes to the frustration of ecologists. “Many popular ideas about the environment are premised on the conviction that nature is … capable of preserving its natural balance more or less indefinitely if only humans can avoid disturbing it,” ecological historian William Cronon wrote in 1995. “These stories are ours, not nature’s. The natural world does not organise itself into parables.” In practice, scientists have found that humanity’s relationship to the natural world is far more complex than we often assume. This is one of Daskalova’s more counterintuitive findings: rather than always being antithetical to nature, human presence can help make life possible for a vast array of species. Even more surprisingly, total abandonment can sometimes have worse consequences for biodiversity than landscapes where some people remain. * * * To show how this could be possible, Daskalova drove me to a village buried in vines. Kreslyuvtsi lies in semi-mountainous regions of central Bulgaria. For years now, most of the village has been completely abandoned. In the spectrum of villages that Daskalova is studying, it offers a case study of what something approaching absolute human absence brings. Standing at the edge of a hillside, Daskalova gingerly took a step off the path and out into space. When her foot landed, she bounced ever so slightly, held up by the latticing of thousands of bramble vines, woven tightly enough to create their own buoyant elasticity. Somewhere beneath was a steeply sloped bank of land, and out a few metres in front was one of the long-abandoned homes of Kreslyuvtsi village. Its form was slowly collapsing as the stone walls crumbled. Brambles had surged up over the house until only an upper corner of the tiled roof was fully visible, jutting above the vines like the prow of a boat in its final stages of sinking. “They will swallow this place whole,” Daskalova said. The brambles illustrate the first force that abandoned land faces: when humans leave en masse, new dominant species can make a clean sweep. The worst offenders are not brambles, but imported, invasive species. In Poland, where about 12% of farmland was abandoned after the fall of communism, the fields have turned thick mustard yellow, blanketed by the bright pollen cascades of Canadian goldenrod. This species has colonised about 75% of the country’s abandoned fields, and where goldenrod grows, little else thrives. Scientists studying this abandoned land found that wild pollinators decreased by 60%-70%, and the number of birds halved. In Bulgaria, an emerging threat is the Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima), a hardy, fast-growing, disease-resistant tree from northern China, with bitter-smelling sap that repels other plant, animal and microbial life. These monocultures can create “biological deserts”, where just one species grows. The need to diversify them is not only an aesthetic, human preference. Monocultures are associated with soil degradation and nutrient depletion, extinctions of other species, difficulty purifying water, catastrophic wildfires, vulnerability to drought and the rapid spread of disease. In some cases, a monoculture’s dominance is temporary. Even virulent invasive species can sometimes act as “nursery” environments for a variety of plants and creatures that might eventually outgrow them. Other times, an ecosystem may stall, failing to recover or diversify. “It is widely believed that once destroyed, forests can recover naturally from grassland or shrubland within a few decades in a process known as forest succession, and that tree planting can help,” scientists discussing the process on Hong Kong plantations wrote in 2023. “Our study shows that forests do not recover as much, or as rapidly, as people think they do.” * * * Humans are often responsible for creating monocultures. But there is also a surprising, unacknowledged role that people can play in holding them back. Out among the brambles in Kreslyuvtsi, Daskalova turned, carefully dragging her gumboots back toward the path winding up the hillside. Reaching the path, she crouched in the grass and began to name species around her feet: grasses, ivy, but also buttercups, purple flowering vines, a tiny yellow orchid. “I can’t imagine many people walk up this road, but every once in a while some do,” she says. In the process, they have held back the rising tide of brambles, and opened up space for this small flurry of species, a scatter of colour against the flat green opacity of vines. From where Daskalova stood, the path led up to an opening in the trees, where long grass and wildflowers grew in a clearcut meadow. Here, again, a small island of fragile blooms revealed the history of this land. Buttercups and agricultural weeds signalled that humans were here in the not-too-distant past, as did the clearing itself. Daskalova pointed to the thick-woven darkness of trees around the space, arranged like an audience in an amphitheatre, their network of branches already forking into the precious light of the clearing. “They’re right at the edge, ready to move in when that opportunity arises,” she said. “If there’s no grazing or mowing, it could only be something like five years until it’s all in the shadows of a denser canopy.” When people imagine ecosystems recovering, this return to forest is often what springs to mind. But forests only represent a small sliver of possible habitats. For other species, the currency of life is light, and a dense, closed canopy of forest is impossible to survive. A swallow is perfectly adapted to vast, open fields: the curve of its wings and distinctive forking tail designed for fast pursuit of insects hovering above meadows. A starling murmuration, moving across the sky like spilled pepper over a tablecloth, is an adaptation to open fields: repelling predators, protecting the roost. Vast numbers of species adapted and co-evolved with these open places – plants, mammals, insects, grazers, species like wildflowers, that relish disturbance and light. The rich biodiversity of open grasslands can be even greater than that of temperate forests. Once, many of these kinds of environments were created by megafauna. Mammoths, giant water buffalo, bison and cave bears were large enough to reshape forests, toppling trees to create steppes and prairie. Scientists have estimated that megafauna were responsible for keeping about 30% of South America’s forests at bay. Almost all of them are now extinct, the timing of their demise usually linked to the arrival of humans. In many places, humans are the only remaining creatures that can consistently reshape landscapes in these radical ways, pushing back the shade of the trees for other creatures to take root. For millennia, all across the planet, humans have been using fire and tools to open up land for agriculture, gardens, grazing and hunting. In the process, we created ecological “mosaics”, or “patchworks”: landscapes that hold a mixture of habitats, like meadows, gardens and forests. These places were not designed as nature reserves, but they often catered to hugely diverse animal life. In her book Nature’s Ghosts, Sophie Yeo details research indicating that European hay meadows cultivated for animal feed were actually more successful at preserving a vast array of species than meadows explicitly cultivated for biodiversity. Looking back over the early Holocene – beginning 11,700 years ago – researchers have found that human presence was about as likely to increase biodiversity as reduce it. Not all human-created landscapes have the same value. A paved subdivision with astroturfed lawns is very different to a village with diverse vegetable and flower gardens. A traditional hay meadow is radically different from a pesticide-drenched plantation of soya beans. But scientists continue to find evidence that the old idea of humans as antithetical to nature is also wrong-headed, and that rosy visions of thriving, human-free environments are more imaginary than real. “People are still imagining [nature as] this kind of pristine place that’s going to be saved from people,” says US environmental scientist Erle Ellis. “That is definitely a misunderstanding.” In 2021, Ellis published new research that looked back 12,000 years. He and his colleagues found that nearly three-quarters of Earth’s land was occupied and shaped by human societies. Other researchers have pushed even further back. Examining human-biodiversity interactions in the Late Pleistocene – back as far as 120,000 years – scientists concluded that across most of the planet, “‘Pristine’ landscapes simply do not exist and, in most cases, have not existed for millennia”. Many of the landscapes people now tend to think of as untouched, from the savanna lands of equatorial Africa to the deep Amazon rainforest, have already been deeply transformed by human presence. “The essential role that people play in ecology is the critical thing, and it’s been ignored,” Ellis says. “The most biodiverse places left on Earth – this is almost universally true – have Indigenous people in them. Why? Well, they conserve a lot of that biodiversity and actually produce it. They maintain that heterogeneous landscape.” There is no question that recent human activity – particularly the massive clearing of ecosystems and industrial consumption of fossil fuels – has been an ecological catastrophe. But for nature to be restored to a past version of itself, the question might be less one of human absence, than what form human presence can take. * * * In the small communities riding out abandonment in Bulgaria, you sometimes see patches of gentle human presence that might offer paths for the future, as well as glimpses of the past. Off Tyurkmen’s main street, a dirt road leads to a stretch of scrubby meadowland. On the day I visited, Slavcho Petkov Stoyanov, who is 56 years old, stood watching as his sheep grazed among the shrubs. “Years ago, nobody would have let me graze here,” he said. “All this was used for growing vegetables.” His is the last flock in the village and he usually employs shepherds to watch them – but recently those young men left town and he was back out in the fields himself, sitting in a patch of shade to dodge the midday sun. Stoyanov is one of the few remaining people here who help to maintain a diverse, “mosaic” landscape: in some empty blocks, the canopy of trees is expanding, but others are cleared by grazing and littered with wildflowers. He offers an example of how some forms of human occupation can be a protection against environmental damage rather than a source. As rural places like Tyurkmen depopulate, they become vulnerable to new forms of exploitation: land prices drop, and there are fewer people around to oppose projects like mines and quarries. “What you can get is depopulation as a stepping stone to industrialisation,” Daskalova told me. Stoyanov pointed to the reservoir below the fields. His grandparents helped dig it themselves. Then, a few years ago, a company was granted cheap contracts by the municipality to take fish from it. The process followed a brutal, short-term logic: they installed pumps, drained the reservoir, and scooped the fish out. Almost everything else died. “They got about 20 tonnes of fish,” Stoyanov said. The remaining villagers were furious, and mounted a successful campaign to have the contract ended. The reservoir has slowly refilled, with water, fish, birds. Over time, he hopes parts of the village will refill, too. They have new opponents now, including a limestone quarry proposed at the village boundary. To harness the full environmental possibilities offered by the great abandonment will require changing our conception of humanity’s relationship to nature, and understanding how our species can benefit ecosystems as well as harm them. It will also require human intention: neglect alone is not enough. Around Slavcho’s herds, the backdrop of Tyurkmen was transforming. Patches of forest thrust outward, vines demolished villas, chemical-smelling invasive thickets occupied meadows. The march of nature seemed inexorable, but its future was still uncertain, contingent on the remaining people: what would they allow to grow? What would they keep at bay? This point about uncertainty recurs again and again in conversations with scientists studying abandoned land. For biodiversity to thrive it needs time. The same forces that drive people from a place – pandemics, wars, shifting economic tides – can send them flowing back. He Yin, working with a group of scholars, found that millions of hectares of abandoned land were recultivated within a few decades. Their neglect was “too ephemeral” to translate into true gains for nature. At one of Daskalova’s longest-abandoned monitoring sites, she had seen the trees grow thick and steady, undisturbed since the last occupants left. “Nobody had stepped on that plot in nearly half a century,” she said. Then, this year, a new set of owners appeared. They had plans for a guesthouse, transforming the isolated plot into a sanctuary for holidaymakers. “The first thing they did was to clear every single bit of vegetation – they just bulldozed the whole thing,” she said. The forest was shorn back and ploughed into dirt, the plot left dotted with a few invasive weeds. After clearing the land, the buyers realised their new project would not be profitable. “They gave up on the guesthouse idea,” Daskalova said. “Now it’s abandoned again.” • Listen to the Long Read podcasts here and sign up to the weekly email here.

          "bodyText": "The atmosphere in the club is friendly, people generally aren’t drunk, and since it’s dark inside, it could just as well be 4am instead of 4pm. Welcome to the daytime rave, where you can dance, meet people and still be curled up on the sofa afterwards in time for Newsnight. It’s a home from home for Joyce Harper, who says she has been “a big clubber my whole life. In the 1990s, I used to go religiously twice a month and we’d stay up all night. We were knocked out for days and always felt terrible. I realised, as I’ve got older and wiser, the importance of sleep.” Last week she was at a day rave at the London club Fabric, and the week before that at Ministry of Sound. “I am aiming to do two a month at the moment,” says Harper, who is professor of reproductive science at University College London, as well as a podcaster and author. She’s 61 but, she adds, “For any age, staying up all night has so many disadvantages – obviously all the effects on sleep, but also things like getting home, having to wait for the first train.” In the last couple of weeks alone, several conversations I’ve had have highlighted how rare a big night out is becoming. First, the person who partied till 6am was talked about in my social circle with a kind of hushed awe. Someone else went out on a Saturday night and reported that the pubs were dead. Other friends went to a daytime club and headed home by 10pm. All this is secondhand reporting from the field because I, of course, am in bed shortly after 9pm, even at the weekend. This is not just the life of a middle-aged bore – there are multiple warning signs that the night out is in peril. At the weekend, David McDowall, chief executive of the Stonegate group, which runs more than 4,000 bars, said people’s drinking habits had gone from night to day. At the Slug and Lettuce chain, the busiest time is now between 3pm and 4pm on a Saturday; it used to be between 9pm and 10pm. “By the time 8pm comes around, it is time to head home,” he told the Sunday Times. As for Friday evening, traditionally the time to let your hair down after a week of work, it’s “bingo night” at the chain. Nightclubs are under threat – a report by the Night Time Industries Association (NTIA) last month found 31% of clubs had closed between March 2020 and December 2023, an average of 10 a month. Meanwhile, all sorts of other leisure spaces, from escape rooms to ice-cream parlours – the type of places that close at a reasonable hour – are thriving. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported that the “hottest new bedtime for twentysomethings” was 9pm. Those aged between 18 and 35 were going to bed earlier, and businesses were shifting in response – bars and clubs in New York were hosting earlier events, and pre-6pm dinner reservations were increasing. One woman, a 32-year-old actor who likes to go to bed between 8pm and 9pm, said social media had helped make an early turning-in time more acceptable, such as TikTok’s “soft life” trend, which prioritises peace and rest above hedonism and hustle culture. To look at the complaints of clubbers online, everything from sexual harassment to the boom in the tranquilliser ketamine has been blamed for killing the party vibes. As with everything these days, people filming on their phones, rather than enjoying the moment, seems to be an irritating fixture of club life – and nobody wants to be the person whose dancing becomes a viral meme. Nightlife, says Patrick Hinton, editor of the dance music magazine Mixmag, is in danger of “dying out for a list of reasons, which cross political, economic and sociological boundaries”. He thinks people are going out much less frequently, and when they do, it tends to be to a big club or music venue. “We’re seeing a shift to massive festival-style events, massive clubs, and a real concentration of money in the biggest parts of the industry, rather than the regular weekend grassroots clubbing that was more common in the past.” Covid was catastrophic for venues, and the energy crisis has put pressure on profit margins. Everything is more expensive, and people – especially younger people – have less disposable income to spend each week on Friday and Saturday nights out. “About 10 years ago, a nightclub ticket might be £5; the bus home would be £1. But now, you’re looking at £40 or £50 for these big nights, and even the smaller club nights are about £20. The economic impact is huge in general – it’s harder to be a musician, it’s harder to put on events. A lot of grassroots club nights are run by passionate individuals who aren’t careerist, but a 19-year-old promoter still can’t afford to lose thousands of pounds on a night.” The pandemic and its lockdowns meant that those who were in their prime early clubbing years – the older teens – never really got into the habit of going out, says Hinton. “A lot of people’s introduction to dance music was from livestreams on the internet. We’ve seen 90s rave nostalgia booming among gen Z, but these are scenes that are developing on platforms like TikTok. DJs are getting loads of followers, but people aren’t going out to see them as regularly.” Young people, says Hinton, are into dance music and culture, but “they’re poorer, they have less opportunities for it. It’s harder for them to go out in the same way, or with the same frequency.” He worries about the effects. “Historically, nightlife has been pretty good at weathering economic downturns, but now people aren’t turning to it in the same way. If there isn’t more policy and funding from the top to help the bottom, we are in danger of seeing more decline in a really important aspect of UK culture.” The primary concern for clubs and bars, says Mike Kill, director of the NTIA, is the economic situation and high running costs, but there are other challenges – “things like transport infrastructure that doesn’t support the late-night economy”. The increase in remote working has put an end to the spontaneous night out and virtually killed the Friday blow-out, with more people working from home at the end of the week. Late-night safety is also a concern – this week, the spiking of drinks was highlighted and the government announced that thousands of bar staff in England and Wales will be trained to deal with it. “We know that there are places up and down the country where petty crime and antisocial behaviour is rife because the policing isn’t strong enough,” says Kill. Nightclubs, he thinks, tend to be good at managing issues inside, “but the reality is, as soon as people leave to go home, that’s where the concerns lie”. The pandemic supercharged some aspects of on-demand life, meaning we need never leave home – we can order restaurant food, find a partner and spend hours watching TV. “We’ve got to work hard to get people out,” says Kill. “There is that societal armchair culture that we’ve got to battle against.” For those who drink, alcohol prices in bars and clubs are alarming, compared with a night at home with a pack of supermarket beer. Then there are the growing number of people who have gone sober, or decreased their alcohol consumption, particularly among younger generations, who are now the most likely of any age group not to drink. Millie Gooch, the founder of Sober Girl Society, gave up drinking when she was 26 (she’s now in her early 30s). She had been a “party girl”, she says. “I loved it until it got dangerous for my mental health. I started drinking when I went to uni, and I was using drinking as a bit of a crutch, going out drinking myself into oblivion, waking up, having hangover anxiety for the next three days, and then got into a bit of a cycle.” She still had nights out after she stopped drinking, but it tailed off. “It’s got a lot to do with age, but I realised that I didn’t enjoy nights out as much without drinking. I would get more tired, and go home earlier, whereas before I’d stay to the very end. I think when you’re sober, you notice your energy levels dipping a bit towards midnight – it’s that point when everyone around you is on a different level.” Gooch doesn’t miss it, though. “My whole social life has just shifted forwards. I do a lot more afternoon activities, lovely dinners, so it’s just a case of not being out until the early hours of the morning any more.” It’s possible to admire sensible young people for not drinking themselves sick and staying out all night as older generations did, while at the same time mourning the decline of the big night out and what it might mean for all of us – even those of us who do prefer to be in bed by 9pm. In the 1990s, says Dave Haslam, a DJ, writer and the author of Life After Dark: A History of British Nightclubs &amp; Music Venues: “People would go out every week. It’s almost inconceivable now.” It’s not that younger generations value culture and music any less, he says. “I just think that they consume it in a different way and some of their choices are down to the fact they haven’t got the money.” Grassroots venues – “what we used to call the underground”, he says – are particularly vulnerable to closure. “It is where people are interested in new or weird things, or emerging things. The grassroots drives all kinds of culture. Great art always starts outside of the cultural institutions; great music starts outside of the major venues. I’m very utopian about the whole idea of small clubs and music venues – they’re an incredible resource in any town and city. They have a personal impact on people when they discover somewhere they feel at home, that’s providing them with entertainment they feel is really life-enhancing. So we lose a lot personally, socially and culturally when those smaller underground venues disappear.” Haslam hopes the Labour government will see their value and intervene. Whether or not the popularity of daytime raves or gigs could produce the next influential subculture remains to be seen. But for those of us who enjoy an early bedtime, it’s a welcome development. “I just think it’s the best thing ever,” says Harper, who is already planning her next daytime parties. “I think dancing and music is a really important part of our wellbeing, and it makes people very happy. It’s so good for our mental and physical health. We’re there to hear great music, support DJs, dance, meet people, be social – it just ticks every box for me.” While the crowd does tend to be older, she says there are a lot of young people too, who presumably also value an early night. “I wish I hadn’t spent so much of my younger years staying up all night and then feeling absolutely terrible for days afterwards.” • Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

          "bodyText": "Maenan, in north Wales, is not a place where very much happens. But earlier this week armed police descended on this tiny settlement, leaving neighbours in “disbelief”. They learned that a man they had sometimes seen near his home on the outskirts of the woods was in fact one of the FBI’s most wanted men. Daniel Andreas San Diego, 46, was arrested on Monday by officers from Britain’s National Crime Agency (NCA), supported by North Wales police. Describing him as an “animal rights extremist”, the FBI said he is alleged to have been involved in the bombing of two office buildings in San Francisco, California, in 2003. San Diego kept very much to himself, his neighbours said, and they knew very little about him. But they did not suspect for a minute that the reason he always stayed close to his remote rural home was because he was allegedly hiding out from the FBI. “I’ve never seen him at all,” a neighbour said. “He never goes out, the car is always on the drive, it never moves.” In Maenan, where only a few hundred people live – the majority of them Welsh speakers – most people only knew that “an American man” had moved into the house by word-of-mouth. He is believed to have been living under an assumed name. The FBI had offered a reward of up to $250,000 (£200,000) for information leading directly to his arrest and considered him “armed and dangerous”. The agency said the first alleged bombing was in August 2003, with two explosions an hour apart on the campus of a biotechnology firm. A month later a nutritional products company was bombed. Now, 21 years later, he is facing extradition, after he was apprehended more than 5,000 miles away, in the settlement of Maenan, between Conwy and Betws-y-Coed. San Diego is believed to have been living for around a year or two in a house on the edge of the woods, many twists and turns away from the main road, high up along a steep, barely surfaced country track. He may have been living in Wales for several years. He is believed to have been working – although in what field is not clear. In Maenan, neighbours said they knew a “single American or Canadian man” had moved into the house which they said looked “well kept” from the outside. The house is right at the very end of a track, where most homes appeared to be holiday lets. The glass patio doors look out on to nothing but rolling countryside and the valley below. On Wednesday, the building he had supposedly been living in was empty, but from looking through the windows it had clearly been recently occupied. Men’s clothes hung on a drying rack, a wetsuit had been hooked from the top of the glass doors, while a plate, fork, and mug discarded on the sofa indicated that the occupant had perhaps left in a hurry. Nobody in this remote corner of rural Wales said they saw or heard armed police swarm the house on Monday. Nor did they really know anything about the man who had been living there. Others had seen him in the woods but had never spoken to him, or really given him a second thought, until they recognised San Diego’s picture on the news. “My partner saw him, a bit of a way up there,” said David Hughes, owner of the Maenan Abbey Hotel on the main road. “It’s quite remote, you would never be able to find him, it’s quite a way off the main road.” His partner had been walking his dog around four weeks ago when he had seen San Diego in the woods, he said, later recognising him from his picture on the news. “I just feel a bit of disbelief really,” Hughes said. “It’s a sleepy little place, and you don’t expect things like that to happen here.” “It’s not even a village, it’s a parish,” he added. “There’s 20 different addresses that all share the same postcode.” In the biggest nearby town, Llanrwst, a pretty place on the River Conwy, dotted with antique shops, cafes, and pubs, nobody knew anything of San Diego at all. Although it is less than three miles away, news of his arrest had not reached Llanrwst. “If someone here knew about it, we’d all know,” said one man, sipping a pint of lager at the bar of the Pen Y Bryn pub. “There’s remote areas everywhere,” he added. “You could drive five minutes anywhere from here, and you’re in the middle of nowhere.” “It’s a good choice of place, I suppose,” his friend added. “There are worse places to hide.”"

          "headline": "Zachary Rolfe’s ego ‘had a lot to do with’ Kumanjayi Walker’s shooting death, NT inquest told",
          "bodyText": "Zachary Rolfe’s ego “had a lot to do with” the death of Kumanjayi Walker, and the former police officer “lied” about the Warlpiri man attempting to take his gun before the fatal shooting, a court has heard. The inquest into the death of Walker is holding its final hearings, almost two years after it was due to be completed. Walker, 19, was killed by then Northern Territory police constable Rolfe during a bungled arrest in the remote NT community of Yuendumu on 9 November 2019. Rolfe was later charged with murder but was acquitted of all charges after a supreme court trial. The inquest into the case is hearing final oral submissions in Alice Springs this week. The counsel assisting the coroner, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, said on Wednesday that it would be submitted to the NT coroner, Elisabeth Armitage, that she should find Rolfe “invented” evidence during his trial that Walker tried to take his police weapon and she could not accept he feared for his life at the time of the shooting. Dwyer said Armitage should also reject submissions on behalf of Rolfe that his conduct prior to November 2019 was irrelevant to the case. Dwyer said it was important to consider Rolfe’s history in the NT police force and before he joined, including his being dishonest during his application, and that he held racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people. “It’s not done in order to be overly critical of Mr Rolfe, or demonise him … He is more than the sum of what happened on 9 November,” Dwyer said. “Mr Rolfe’s legal team urges your honour not to sugarcoat what happened in relation to Kumanjayi Walker’s behaviour on 9 November, and neither should your honour sugarcoat the actions of Rolfe.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Dwyer said Rolfe had a history of using force during arrests and a contemptuous attitude to authority and the rules; used violence to demonstrate his dominance over others, particularly young Aboriginal men; and had a tendency to seek out situations where the use of force could be necessary. “Ego was wrapped up in his use of force, and ego had a lot to do with the events of November 2019. “Perhaps Mr Rolfe could have been shaped to be a better officer … This court will never know.” Dwyer said that counsel assisting’s submissions to the coroner would recommend that Armitage find Walker did not try to take Rolfe’s police firearm immediately before the officer shot him three times. Walker tried to stab the officers with scissors when they attempted to arrest him. But Rolfe said during his trial that Walker also put his hand on his gun as they struggled before the shooting. Dwyer said Rolfe had never provided that detail before giving evidence, including in conversations with colleagues, lengthy notes about the shooting in his police diary, and in multiple takes of a video interview with a journalist at The Australian. She said the evidence Rolfe gave at trial about the gun was “an invention”. “That’s a significant finding, your honour, and I make it carefully and after careful consideration, and we have set out the evidence in full,” Dwyer said. “As a result of this lie, the lies Mr Rolfe told regarding the broader events of 9 November 2019 and the significant issues with respect to his credibility as a historian of his own use of force mean that your honour couldn’t accept, even on balance … Mr Rolfe’s evidence that he feared for his or [his colleague’s] life when he fatally shot Kumanjayi Walker.” Rolfe denied he lied about Walker attempting to take the gun when he gave evidence during the inquest earlier this year. In relation to his credibility, Dwyer said Rolfe had a tendency to “dissemble” during his evidence in court, and that Armitage should also consider his history of lying in the past. Julian McMahon SC, representing the Parumpurru committee of Yuendumu, said that the dying words of Walker summed up the inquest. “The truth is that after he was shot and handcuffed and dragged across the dirt, Kumanjayi Walker cried out to his captors. “He was dying, he was barely educated, he was in agony, but even so, he saw and he said what was truly happening … ‘You mob got no respect, shame on you.’ “In eight words, despite all of his disadvantages in life, he summed up pretty much everything we’re doing here.” Phillip Boulten SC, for the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency (Naaja), told the inquest Walker “was a young man who was killed by a racist and violent police officer”. He said that about 75 Indigenous people had died in custody since Walker was killed. “This is a national crisis, but it is not recognised as such by the systems of government.” Luke Officer, for Rolfe, urged Armitage to reject many of the submissions of the parties in relation to his client. He said that if she accepted those submissions including in relation to Rolfe’s conduct on the night of the shooting, prior use of force and attitudes towards Aboriginal people, it would lead to her undermining the verdict of the jury which acquitted him. “Accepting some submissions from parties will in truth give it the hallmarks of a royal commission into Zachary Rolfe,” he said. Officer said that Rolfe’s text messages and prior conduct as a constable should not have been admitted as evidence in the inquest, and Armitage should decide to ignore this evidence when considering her findings. He said Rolfe and the NT police both submitted that racism played no part in the death. “We’re not saying racism can’t be a topic, that would be ridiculous … we don’t shy away from the fact that racism might be a relevant topic,” Officer said. But he said Armitage must be clear about what the inquest could achieve. “This has never been about heroes and villains … there are no winners,” Officer said. “But your honour should set realistic expectations. “Let’s apply common sense … there are constraints under your act about what you can do and what you must not do.” Dwyer said it was important the public understood that the primary reason for the delays in the case were a series of legal challenges, all of which had been unsuccessful, though she said she was not critical of the challenges. Dwyer added that Walker’s story was another example of what Armitage found in a family violence inquest, which delivered its findings this week: that children exposed to violence were more likely to become involved in the criminal justice system. Dwyer said evidence before the inquest showed Walker lived in a home that was plagued by excessive alcohol consumption and domestic violence from the ages of four to 10. “Kumanjayi Walker’s story exemplifies exactly what your honour has said in the context of the family violence inquest,” Dwyer said. “To avoid another tragedy we need a holistic approach that recognises the strengths and challenges of children in Yuendumu and remote communities like it.” The hearing will continue on Thursday. In Australia, the national family violence counselling service is on 1800 737 732. In the UK, call the national domestic abuse helpline on 0808 2000 247, or visit Women’s Aid.

          "headline": "The City and Its Uncertain Walls by Haruki Murakami review – a labour of love",
          "bodyText": "The elegiac quality of Haruki Murakami’s new novel, his first in six years, was perhaps inevitable considering its origins. The City and Its Uncertain Walls began as an attempt to rework a 1980 story of the same title, originally published in the Japanese magazine Bungakukai, which Murakami, unsatisfied, never allowed to be republished or translated. “I felt that this work contained something vital for me,” Murakami writes in the novel’s afterword, “at the time, though, unfortunately I lacked the skills to convey what that something was.” Five years later, his first attempt at a revision developed into the novel Hard‑Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, a narrative that ran “parallel” to the original – “like two crews digging a tunnel, one from each end, breaking through and meeting up in the exact middle”. Yet still, Murakami writes, the story “bothered” him. And so 35 years later, as the Covid-19 pandemic began in earnest, Murakami circled back to the material again, spending three years expanding it into this lengthy tripartite novel, now translated into English by Philip Gabriel. Were his efforts rewarded, this third time around? For Murakami himself, it seems the answer is a resounding yes: he writes of his “relief” at finally bringing the material into a conclusive form. But as a reader, this protracted, foggy and self-referential novel feels ultimately scant in its rewards. The City and Its Uncertain Walls is narrated by a man of indeterminate middle age. In its opening section, he recalls his first love: the sweetheart he meets at the prize-giving ceremony for an inter-school essay writing competition, aged 17. Their unsophisticated, all‑consuming romance plays out across one perfect summer between Tokyo and the narrator’s coastal home town. It is convincingly drawn, though perhaps a little too saccharine (at one point the narrator, marvelling at the smallness of his lover’s hands, is “impressed that such tiny hands could do so much. Twisting open bottle tops, for instance, or peeling tangerines”). The lovers exchange letters, and occasionally meet up on park benches to kiss and talk. When she begins to describe to him a mysterious town, full of “made-up stories and contradictions”, surrounded by a high wall, he is as entranced by the notion of this strange place as he is by her tiny hands. This walled town, she says, is where the “real her” lives. Months later, as the new school year begins and their meetings become fewer and further apart, his lover vanishes without explanation. This story of tragic young love unfolds across short chapters that alternate with a second narrative, set in the walled town of the young woman’s imagining. Here, again, is our narrator, though now middle-aged. Here, again, is our teenage girl, still a teenage girl. In this town, the narrator works as a “dream reader” in a mysterious library, and the girl is his assistant. The town is populated by strange unicorn-like creatures and veined by willow-fringed rivers. It is serene, colourless and timeless. With its ever-changing walls, it is later described as “a dark realm of the unconscious” – but it’s hard not to read it as a symbolic manifestation of the stasis produced by grief over lost love. In any case, Murakami drops hints like anvils on the implausibly jejune reader who might be plodding along in ignorance of the setting’s polysemic metaphorical power. “Just as the human brain is divided into right and left,” we are told, “the river divided the town into two halves, north and south”; “In the plaza … loomed the clock tower, with its clock without hands, like some sort of symbol.” Despite this heavy handedness, the walled city chapters are compelling. Murakami blends the whimsical and the threatening with the skill of that other pre-eminent Japanese visionary, Hayao Miyazaki (and The City includes multiple references to the film director’s work). I would have liked to spend more time in this world than the novel allows us. In the second and third parts, our narrator, having found a method of escape from the walled town, is returned to his “real” existence. Attempting to fill the void created by the disappearance of his first love, he impulsively takes a job at a library in a remote, mountainous town in Fukushima province. It is here that the novel’s meandering, repetitious styling crosses over from hypnotic to tiresome as enigmatic occurrences and perplexing situations pile up. Murakami’s same heavy-handedness comes into play as an unfortunate tendency to overexpose the magic realist elements of the novel. There are countless exchanges between characters in which the details of a particular event are stated, restated in almost exactly the same words, confirmed, restated again with a pretty flourish of simile, and then pondered inconclusively. So, what you’re saying is: there are countless exchanges between characters in which the details of a particular event are stated, restated in almost exactly the same words, confirmed, restated again with a pretty flourish of simile – and then inconclusively pondered? Yes: the novel becomes like watching a fish rolling through the dark depths of a pond, before it vanishes from sight with a flicker of its tail. Mesmeric, to a certain extent, but ultimately deficient. There are references to Gabriel García Márquez, and to Marcel Proust, but Murakami is unable to match the imagistic flair of the former or emotional insight of the latter, while the unadorned, melancholy beauty he does excel at evoking becomes smothered in redundant expositional bloat. This almost felt like an issue of mistrust; as though Murakami wasn’t convinced the reader would follow him unless he threw up uncertain walls of his own around the narrative. I do not doubt that fans of Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World will find this companion piece rewarding, and that for Murakami, the novel was a labour of love, the fulfilment of a creative impulse carried across decades. But finishing it, for me, just began to feel like a labour. • The City and Its Uncertain Walls is published by Harvill Secker (£25).

          "bodyText": "Soaring temperatures and strained power supplies have prompted the New South Wales government to ask residents to reduce electricity use in a bid to avoid outages. The premier, Chris Minns, said Sydney residents should avoid using power-hungry devices if they can during a crunch period, which was expected to last for five hours. “We are asking you not [to] run your dishwasher, not to run your washing machine this afternoon, between 3 and 8 [pm AEDT],” Minns said. “You’ll be helping the grid.” “We’re hoping that these measures reduce the amount of demand on the energy system over that crucial … period, and as a result won’t lead to load-shedding or blackouts,” he said, adding the government would keep the public updated. The heatwave toasting eastern Australia was forecast to peak on Wednesday, as temperatures again climbed towards 40C in parts of Sydney. By mid-afternoon, Penrith in Sydney’s west had reached 39.9C, its highest reading since 29 February, marking the site’s fifth consecutive day of 35C-plus heat. It was also the country’s hottest location, edging remote regions in Queensland and WA. The energy minister, Penny Sharpe, said state, federal and ACT government agencies, water utilities and local councils had also been asked to voluntarily cut electricity use. “Agencies will do this by increasing the set point of air conditioning where safe and feasible, closing blinds, turning off non-essential lighting and turning off equipment when not in use,” Sharpe said. Residents should set air-conditioners to 24 to 26C between 3pm and 8pm The energy market operator was also preparing to request some big users to cut loads if needed. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Sydney’s CBD was also predicted by the Bureau of Meteorology to be the hottest capital for the day, with a top of 34C forecast – or the warmest since the end of February. Its temperature reached almost 33C at about 11am, before sea breezes and cloud cover nudged the mercury down. Regions expecting low to high 30s today also include the Hunter and Illawarra districts to Sydney’s north and south, respectively. “Severe heatwave conditions are expected to peak on Wednesday, then ease by the weekend,” the bureau said in a warning alert. “Locations likely to be impacted include Batemans Bay, Camden, Campbelltown, Hornsby, Liverpool, Nowra, Penrith, Parramatta, Richmond and Wollongong.” In line with recent days, the Australian Energy Market Operator (Aemo) has been issuing alerts calling for more generation from electricity suppliers to ensure power is not interrupted. On Wednesday morning, Aemo said a so-called level 3 lack of reserve (LOR3) condition was possible later in the day as solar output decreased towards sunset. By 4.30pm AEDT the market was likely to require 84 megawatts of additional supply to avoid interrupted load – or blackouts. Aemo also indicated that it was preparing to activate its so-called reliability and emergency reserve trader scheme later on Wednesday. If triggered, big energy users that have signed up to the scheme could be asked to cut power use in return for compensation. “Aemo continues to work with industry and the state government to manage expected low electricity reserves this afternoon in NSW,” a spokesperson said. “Ahead of this tight supply-demand period, Aemo has requested that all available generation and transmission resources be deployed to ensure consumer electricity needs are met.” It also said “additional reserves” had also been secured through its Reliability and Emergency Reserve Trader (RERT) mechanism that rewards big users for powering down during tight conditions. At least one smelter may have responded to the request, according to Dylan McConnell, an energy specialist at the University of NSW. About 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power station capacity remained unavailable, including about 3GW that was not previously scheduled. Many of Australia’s coal plants are nearing the end of their design lives, requiring more frequent and more costly repairs to keep operating. Aemo also issued LOR2 level alerts for NSW for Wednesday afternoon and for periods on Thursday and Friday as the heatwave slowly ebbs. Such alerts are calls for generators to provide extra capacity as a backup in case committed plants do not operate as expected and drop off without warning. Power prices were reaching the $17,500/megawatt-hour cap in the wholesale market soon after 3pm. That compares with average prices of the order of $125/MWh. As of early afternoon, Aemo was looking for about 700MW more power to be in reserve from 3.30pm to 8pm. Wholesale power prices may also spike to their ceiling of $17,500/megawatt-hour later on Wednesday, Aemo data indicated. Stephanie Bashir, chief executive of Nexa Advisory, said authorities wouldn’t be scrambling now “if they were properly enabling consumers to manage their own demand, and unleashing development and connection of renewables, including through orderly closure of coal plants”. ‘The Minns government is yet to publish its energy plan for NSW,” Bashir said. “Projects already in the pipeline are clogged inside it.” The weather setup, meanwhile, would favour thunderstorm activity over parts of eastern Australia including the prospect of heavy rainfall as tropical moisture was dragged southwards. Melbourne was facing severe thunderstorms, with the potential for damaging winds, hailstones and heavy rainfall on Wednesday afternoon. Thursday will likely bring more thunderstorm activity, with Sydney and Canberra among the centres facing storms. Sydney may collect 15mm of rain on Thursday, with falls of as much as 30-35mm on both Friday and Saturday, the bureau said. The NSW State Emergency Service said “widespread and potentially severe storms with heavy rain, damaging winds and large hail is possible in many parts of the state including Western NSW, Sydney, Mid North Coast, parts of the Hunter and Illawarra”. “From Friday through to Sunday widespread moderate to heavy rain is expected in many areas as a rain band moves into eastern parts of the state,” it said in a statement."

          "bodyText": "New private residential construction is at its lowest level for almost four decades but spending on renovations has boomed, according to a new analysis. The report by KPMG found that new private residential construction spending per capita is at its lowest level since 1987-88, as renovation spending surged from 34.2% of total residential construction spend in 2018-19 to 40% in 2023-24. “For every nail hammered and brick laid in residential construction, 40% of it is going into renovating a pre-existing home,” said Terry Rawnsley, an urban economist at KPMG. “This indicates that there is not enough money and resources being attracted to expanding the housing stock. “More straightforward planning processes and lower risks for builders make renovating existing homes a favoured option over adding multiple homes on the same block.” New private residential construction also includes demolishing a detached property and replacing it with a single new home, known as a one-for-one replacement. Almost 10% of new private residential construction spending is on one-for-one replacements, KPMG found, with Victoria having the highest rate at 12.6% of new residential construction, followed by Western Aaustralia at 9.1%, and New South Wales at 8.7%. Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email The analysis found that investment in new housing per resident averaged $186,000 per new resident since 1993-94. Between 2012 and 2019, new housing spending increased by 58%. But the departure of international workers and students in 2020-21 during the pandemic led to a per-capita investment spike of $1.9m per capita. Two years later, the per-capita investment has declined by almost 50%, sinking to $113,000 in 2023-24 as population growth surged and investment flatlined, the analysis found. Covid also had an impact on renovation spend, according to the analysis. As new housing investment increased between 2012 and 2020, alterations and additions investment declined and reached its lowest share of 33.5% in 2017-18. But this investment rebounded significantly in recent years – a trend further amplified since 2020 as those driven by remote work and lifestyle changes opted for larger and better homes. An analysis of NSW, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia found that the local government area with the greatest spend on renovations was Brisbane, followed by Sydney’s northern beaches and Boroondara in Melbourne’s east. Mornington Peninsula, south-east of Melbourne, and Stonnington, in the city’s inner south-east, made up the top five. The analysis showed that there needed to be planning settings which encouraged investment in increasing housing density, rather than preference for one-for-one replacements, KPMG said. “Homeowners are absolutely entitled to renovate their homes to add value to their investment and to ensure existing housing stock is maintained,” Rawnsley said. “However, shifting some of the labour and materials away from renovations and one-for-one replacements towards the construction of new housing stock can help to relieve current housing shortages.”"

          "bodyText": "Mathilde “likes dogs, but she hates children. Especially girls.” Mathilde “refuses to work with small-calibre firearms, which, she firmly believes, are good only for bourgeois soap operas and adultery”. Mathilde is also 63, a small, stout hero of the French Resistance (it’s 1985, so there are still a fair few of them around) – and a much-in-demand contract killer. No one suspects her. But, after she wipes out her latest target on Paris’s Avenue Foch with “the sort of gun that could stop a stampeding elephant in its tracks”, the readers of Pierre Lemaitre’s truly delicious Going to the Dogs (Mountain Leopard Press) start to realise that her mind isn’t quite what it was. And a contract killer who can’t remember if the name she has written on a piece of paper is her next target or her new cleaner isn’t the safest person to have around. Brilliantly translated by Frank Wynne, this book is a sort of French take on Richard Osman, if Osman were a lot darker and kept on bumping off characters you’d been made to care about. Deft, funny, sharp, and very French – Lemaitre’s detective muses that “there is a certain poetry to the rain falling on the Seine” – it is an absolute delight. Will Dean returns to his series detective, deaf journalist Tuva Moodyson, in his latest outing, Ice Town (Hodder &amp; Stoughton), a locked-town mystery in which the bodies of local people keep turning up in Esseberg, an atmospherically creepy location in Sweden’s remote centre that can only be reached through a tunnel that closes at night. “There is a special kind of murk that accompanies snow and extreme chill up here. A unique variety of silence.” Tuva is drawn to the case because a deaf teenager from Esseberg has gone missing with no money. “He’s out there and people are screaming his name trying to help him and he can’t hear them,” says his desperate grandmother. As the deaths mount, residents start to leave, the tension grows, and Tuva tries to make inroads into this strange and closed community. “Less than a thousand people. Everyone in everyone else’s business. I think half the town’s been on the verge of a killing spree for decades,” an outsider tells her. I’m not sure I totally bought the payoff, which felt a little preposterous after such a great buildup, but our hero takes it all in her stride and is as compelling as ever. Overall, Ice Town is a thrilling, chilling read for a wintry evening. Benjamin Stevenson is unashamedly tapping into the demand for festive mysteries with his latest novel, Everyone This Christmas Has a Secret (Michael Joseph). His series character Ernest Cunningham – not a detective, just a regular guy who keeps solving murders – starts by thanking the “literary god [who] had the foresight to drop a corpse at my feet at Christmas time”, and then reminds “the cynics out there” that even the likes of Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle “aren’t immune to a little yuletide cash grab”. Duly warned, there’s lots to enjoy: Ernest is called to Katoomba, a small town in Australia’s Blue Mountains, by his ex-wife Erin, who has been arrested for the murder of her new partner, Lyle. Only problem is, he’s got to keep it secret from his fiancee, Juliette, who won’t be delighted to learn he’s at Erin’s beck and call. Once Ernest is up in Katoomba, attending a magic show (it does make sense in the context of this particular murder), you guessed it: more bodies start to stack up. This is light and fun, if you don’t mind the archly knowing air of it all; the sort of thing to pop in the stocking of your fellow mystery fan on Christmas Day. Which I’m sure is exactly what Stevenson intended. The Peacock and the Sparrow (No Exit Press) by IS Berry, a former CIA officer, tells us the story of almost-past-it American spy Shane Collins, who is on the verge of being forcibly retired from his mission in Bahrain. As Collins drinks heavily, meets sources and deals with the fallout from a series of bombings, revolution threatens, and he starts to fall for a beautiful local artist, Almaisa. I’m sure all the tradecraft aspects of this novel are spot-on, and Collins is a believable and vibrant rendition of a spy. The problem is, he’s so unpleasant to spend time with – “She had none of the triviality or false femininity of American women; neither did she have the humourless affectation of European women,” he thinks of Almaisa – that his company starts to wear after a while. Still, this debut comes garlanded with awards – the 2024 Edgar for best first novel, the International Thriller Writers Award for best first novel, numerous prize shortlistings – so others clearly aren’t bothered. It’s gritty, it’s realistic (I assume); I just couldn’t quite care enough about Collins’s travails to make me love it.

          "bodyText": "That’s it for today, thanks for reading. Here are the main stories: TikTok warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a “licence to be online” because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The Human Rights Commission said the social media ban should not pass in current form. At least three Nationals publicly voiced their concerns over the social media ban bill, including Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and Bridget McKenzie – as well as Liberal MP Garth Hamilton. Opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, later said the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. Australia-China relationship are in “very good shape after “immense improvement”, Chines ambassador Xiao Qian said. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, said findings of missing and murdered Indigenous women inquiry are “horrific”. The sports minister, Anika Wells, said changes to gamblings advertising could affect Australian sport on world stage. An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, announced new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that were introduced to parliament today. Labor’s housing bill passed the senate this afternoon, coming after the Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather ,said his party had “pushed as hard as we can” on housing. The NSW government will refund $5.5m in fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. Queenslanders gathered outside parliament to protest LNP’s treaty stance. Sydney and Melbourne house prices to keep falling but rate cut will cause bounce, report predicts. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. Leading economists have predicted a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year. Christian lobby welcomes anti-abortion bill stay The Australian Christian Lobby has hailed the failure of a Greens motion aimed at discharging a private senators’ anti-abortion bill as “a victory for the democratic process”. The Greens Senate leader, Larissa Water, wanted the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The ACL CEO, Michelle Pearse, welcomed the Coalition and seven crossbenchers voting down the bill: “The ACL was pleased to see senators afford this Bill an opportunity for proper consideration and debate rather than shutting down the democratic process. We must allow this Bill to go to a proper vote.” The Greens motion to discharge the bill followed the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, telling Coalition MPs recently that they should not seek to restart public debate on abortion ahead of next year’s federal election. NSW avoids power supply issues but still faces ‘tight’ days Without jinxing things, NSW has so far avoided any blackouts as temperatures climb in eastern Australia. Sydney’s top temperature was kept to a bearable 28.2C while about 50km to the west, Penrith reached 39.7C to mark the Sydney basin’s warmest maximum for Tuesday. Penrith and a few other outer suburbs can expect a similar top on Wednesday at 39C, the Bureau of Meteorology predicts. The CBD, though, will be a bit hotter than today, heading form 34C – which would be the hottest there since late February. According to the Australian Energy Market Operator, wholesale power prices may yet hit their ceiling of $17,500 a megawatt-hour (compared to more typical prices of $125/MWh) later on Tuesday as an indication of a “tight” or strained market. And tomorrow evening there will be more of the same, with a sign that an administered price cap of $600/MWh may kick in too: Aemo has been busy issuing its so-called lack of reserve alerts for NSW and Queensland in the past couple of days. They are intended to highlight when it wants more capacity brought on to ensure “the lights stay on”. The market does tend to respond (hence the absence of blackouts) but the fact Aemo is issuing them from lengthy periods for NSW for parts of Wednesday, Thursday and Friday (before they get cancelled) point to the lingering impacts of the heatwave on the grid. And there are storms to look forward to, too. Bubble tea franchise Chatime fined $132,840 for underpaying workers The Fair Work Ombudsman has fined bubble tea franchise Chatime and its managing director $132,840 for the underpayments of more than $160,000 to vulnerable employees at 19 stores across Sydney and Melbourne. Earlier today, the federal circuit and family court imposed a $120,960 penalty against Chatime Australia, and a fine of $11,880 against Chatime Australia managing director, Chen “Charlley” Zhao, for his involvement in some of the underpayments. The court found that between August and December 2016, Chatime Australia paid employees at stores it directly operated flat rates as low as $7.59 to $24.30 an hour and adopted a practice of not paying Fast Food Industry Award entitlements such as loadings and penalty rates. As a result, 152 employees, including 41 junior workers aged below 21 and 95 visa holders, were underpaid a total amount of $162,533. Many of the visa holders were international students. The underpaid staff worked at 10 Chatime outlets across Sydney in Bondi Junction, Chatswood, Wetherill Park and the CBD; and nine Chatime outlets across Melbourne, in Dandenong, Doncaster, Glen Waverley, Cheltenham and the CBD. In his judgment, Judge Nicholas Manousaridis rejected Chatime Australia’s submission that the contraventions should not fall into the category of being either “serious” or “substantial”, and found that the matter involved a large number of employees who were underpaid basic Award entitlements. “Penalties should be set to signal to persons who manage companies that they will be met with substantial penalties if, through their neglect, they permit companies they manage to contravene terms of an award or any other industrial laws or instruments that might apply.” An anti-abortion bill sponsored by two Coalition senators will stay on the Senate notice paper after seven crossbenchers sided with the Coalition and voted down a Greens motion to dump it. The Greens indicated earlier on Tuesday that the motion would be deferred until February but the party’s Senate leader, Larissa Waters, suddenly brought on the vote on Tuesday afternoon. Waters was asking the Senate to discharge the human rights (children born alive protection) bill, which has been on the notice paper for two years and is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic. If passed, the bill would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. The Greens decided to ask the Senate to discharge the bill after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election. The Greens had hoped to secure the numbers to remove the bill and put pressure on the Coalition on a sensitive issue which the major parties usually consider a matter of conscience. But the opposition leadership pushed back, arguing it would set a bad precedent to use a majority vote to discharge a private senators’ bill – and implying it could happen to others. The opposition Senate leader, Simon Birmingham, said he “would not and will not ever vote for this bill or any measures that restrict women’s reproductive rights”. But he said removing it would impede private senators’ rights and was a precedent that could be used against other bills. “Senators in particular should reflect on the precedent this motion sets that could see other bills discharged just because a majority opposed them,” Birmingham said. “Given this bill has been on the notice paper for almost two years, the decision of the Greens to pursue this at this time is clearly about politics, not the substantive issue.” The motion was lost, 30 votes to 28, with 18 senators not present. ACT independent senator David Pocock, two One Nation senators, former Liberal turned independent Gerard Rennick, United Australia party senator Ralph Babet and Tasmanian independents Jacqui Lambie and Tammy Tyrrell joined the Coalition in opposing the motion. Pocock and Tyrrell both spoke in the chamber, saying they opposed the bill itself but supported the principle of allowing a private senators’ bill to remain and be debated. Larissa Waters suggested the Coalition’s move in defeating the motion contradicted Dutton’s edict to his partyroom. “By threatening crossbenchers with retaliation if they supported a Greens move to protect women’s rights, the Liberals … kept an anti-abortion bill on the Senate notice paper,” Waters told Guardian Australia. “The Liberal game-playing has confirmed that Mr Dutton does not want to talk about abortion because it would reveal that his party wants to restrict women’s rights to make decisions about their own bodies.” The NSW government will refund $5.5m worth of fines that were issued under Covid-19 health measures and which disproportionately penalised people living in western and south-western Sydney. More than 23,000 penalty notices will be withdrawn and the refunds will include any total or partial payments on the fines. The government committed to withdraw and refund the fines after a legal campaign by the Redfern Legal Centre (RLC) and Maurice Blackburn who asserted that the fines were improperly issued and invalid. Maurice Blackburn valued the more than 23,000 fines, some of which had not been repaid, at approximately $15m. In a statement, from RLC and Maurice Blackburn, they said the announcement came after Maurice Blakcburn notified the government it would file a class action if Revenue NSW did not withdraw and refund the fines. The RLC said the fines, which were typically worth $1,000 to $5,000, were disproportionately issued to socioeconomically disadvantaged people living in western and south-western Sydney. RLC found that among those fined were Indigenous children, children with cognitive impairments, and children experiencing homelessness. In 2022, the NSW government withdrew 33,000 fines related to Covid-19 health measures after it lost a legal challenge by RLC. The court found the fines were invalid because they did not include sufficient information about the offence. On Tuesday, the department of customer service said the remaining 23,000 fines also lacked details “which may render them technically deficient and place their validity in doubt”. Samantha Lee, supervising solicitor at Redfern Legal Centre, said: This outcome is the result of a significant and lengthy effort by Redfern Legal Centre, a team of dedicated counsel and Maurice Blackburn. The impact of Covid fines on marginalised communities and on children – was disproportionate, unreasonable, and unjust. ‘Nitazenes are extremely potent’: two opioid overdoses in NSW Two people in NSW have been hospitalised with severe opioid overdoses, prompting health authorities to warn about the dangers of synthetic opioids in fake oxycodone. The two people suffered overdoses after taking what they believed to be oxycodone tablets described as yellow unmarked round tablets, sold as OxyContin 40 mg. However, NSW health says they contained nitazenes – extremely potent synthetic opioids which are more likely to stop breathing than other opioids. NSW Poisons Information Centre medical director, Dr Darren Roberts, said these drugs can be hundreds of times more potent than oxycodone and can cause severe overdose or death. He said: “Nitazenes are extremely potent and can vary widely in their strength.” “As they are illicit and unregulated, there is no way of knowing what type of nitazene is present or what dosage is being taken. The strength and contents can vary widely, even within the same batch.” NSW Health said nitazenes have been detected in vapes and in fake tablets, such as benzodiazepines, and in drugs thought to be heroin or MDMA. Roberts said it was strongly recommended that anyone who uses illicit drugs carry naloxone. Nitazenes can last longer in the body than oxycodone, heroin and naloxone, meaning higher and repeated doses of naloxone may be required as well as hospital treatment. Teens need better protection from sex offenders: report Teenagers working alongside adults in Australia need to be better protected from sex offenders, a report says. The report into retailers has outlined a plan it hopes will ensure teens are not exposed to workplace predators across the country, AAP reports. The ‘‘Safety Not Guaranteed’ report by the Shop Distributive and Allied Employees Association and non-for-profit McKell Institute has recommended law changes to better protect children. The report found more than 500,000 children aged 17 and under were working across Australia mostly in retail but the majority were not adequately protected by law. It said only South Australia provided proper safeguards, after the state government passed laws in March banning child sex offenders from working with kids. The report has recommended other states and territories follow suit. It has called for legislation to be amended to ban accused and convicted sex offenders from working alongside children. The report also called for bail conditions to be tightened for convicted or accused sex offenders and reforms made to offender registries. The report said requirements for adults working alongside children were not strict in Australia. “Most Australians would be surprised to learn that there are few requirements for adults working alongside children to get ‘working with children’ checks,” it said. “This has led to incidences where adults charged, or even convicted, with child sex offences are working alongside children in retail, fast food and hospitality settings.” The report recommended that adults across the nation working alongside children be required to access the checks, in which they are screened for suitability. All states and territories should also ensure eligibility for “working with children” checks be expanded so that businesses voluntarily seeking them do so without a cost increase to workers. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day’s news. Many thanks for joining me on today’s blog – we’re nearly at the halfway point of this final sitting week, with two more jam-packed days ahead. But there’s still more to come this evening, so I’ll handover to Mostafa Rachwani to continue bringing you the latest. Take care. Explainer on Victorian government’s overhauled anti-vilification laws Earlier today, Benita Kolovos brought us news the Victorian government had unveiled long-awaited legislation to overhaul the state’s anti-vilification laws. How will they change, and who will they protect? You can read her full explainer below: Gormon says Deloitte outlook ‘not government’s numbers’ Patrick Gorman was also asked to weigh in on the latest economic outlook from Deloitte – predicting a $33.5bn budget deficit for this financial year (see our earlier post). He answered that it’s “not the government’s numbers”: We understand that people will try and get the jump or guess what the numbers might be or in Deloitte’s case, modelling, but they are not our numbers. Gorman was asked whether the government has given up on increasing the tax rate on higher balanced superannuation accounts – as was promised a couple of budgets ago? Gorman said he couldn’t “tell you what decision the Senate will make over the next couple of days”. I wish I could. I wish we did not have a system where the opposition parties try to run things down until the last minute or the last hours of the Senate, but that is the system we have and we will see that play out on Wednesday and Thursday. But would you make it a number one item of debate on Wednesday morning? Gorman said “it remains part of our budget plan” but “we recognise the Australian people have given us a Senate that sometimes uses to prioritise things in different ways, and we have to work within that democratic system”. Labor MP welcomes passage of Help to Buy bill through senate The assistant minister to the PM, Patrick Gorman, is speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing about the Greens’ concession to help Labor pass its housing bill. Asked if there were more deals to be cut, with a raft of legislation yet to make it through the Senate, he argued that these bills “stand on their own merits”. Of course people are frustrated that it took the Greens in particular so long, so much political gameplay, so many interviews with yourself and others about how they were here and in there and all over the place, finally it is done. As Paul Karp reports, the Help to Buy scheme – which passed the senate this afternoon – allows the government to contribute 30% of the purchase price of a home or 40% for a new build for those who earn under the income thresholds of $90,000 for a single applicant, or $120,000 for a couple. The government share reduces the cost for the homebuyer, although it must be paid back upon sale. Temperatures climb towards 40C in parts of Sydney as power supplies remain tight Parts of Sydney have touched the 39C level forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology while sea breezes are so far keeping the CBD and other parts of the city’s east about 10C cooler. Daniel Westerman, head of the Australian Energy Market Operator, chose to give a media conference at Canberra airport just before 2pm (AEST), to reassure the public that electricity suppliers were sufficient. Aemo had acted early to bring on generation capacity that was “potentially available” and to restore transmission lines, he said. (The latter was mostly to ensure NSW can import a lot of electricity.) Authorities were working to ensure generation remained adequate over the coming days, he said. As it happened, Aemo had issued another lack of reserve level 3 forecast at about noon (AEDT), implying that there was the possibility of “interruptible loads” now for Thursday at about 3.30pm (AEDT). As with previous LOR3 alerts, the market answered Aemo’s call, and the alert was cancelled at 1.54pm (AEDT) just as Westerman was wrapping up his slightly chaotic media conference (as some questioners phoned in questions he struggled to hear). Still, expect conditions to remain “tight” and hopefully no more of those ageing power units will conk out over the next couple of days. Nationals MP continues to voice concern over social media age ban Nationals MP Keith Pitt has been speaking to Sky News about his concerns regarding Labor’s under-16 social media ban bill. Yesterday, he became the latest to voice hesitation about the bill, joining his colleague Matt Canavan, the Greens and other Senate crossbenchers in alarm at the speed by which the bill is likely to be passed this week. Speaking just now, Pitt told the program: If you can’t actually fine anyone for not taking action [until 2026], then what difference will it make to take a few weeks to look at this in detail – this is one of the rare occasions I agree with my colleagues in the Senate where this is something that should be looked at more … My job as a backbencher is to make sure that people are doing this right. It’s not simply to trundle along and agree with everything that’s put before me. His main argument was that teenagers will be able to work around the ban – along with wanting more time to scrutinise the legislation. Analysis on government’s under-16s social media ban bill In case you missed it amid question time this afternoon, Josh Taylor has written a fantastic piece of analysis on the under-16s social media ban bill – asking why Labor is so intent on rushing it through? You can have a read of that below: Watch: China’s ambassador to Australia urges closer military ties Earlier today, China’s ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian spoke to reporters in Canberra and suggested Australia should do more to improve military ties with the People’s Liberation Army. We covered his remarks earlier in the blog, and you can now watch some of his remarks below, thanks to our video team: Going back to the under-16s social media ban, opposition communications spokesperson, David Coleman, says the government has agreed to several amendments which will be seen in the Senate. We’ve asked Michelle Rowland’s office for comment but haven’t heard back yet. Coleman told the House of Representatives that the changes would be “significant improvements” to the bill. Firstly, the legislation will include a specific provision that nothing allows a social media to compel the provision of digital ID or government issued identity documents, such as passports, or drivers licenses. This is an important addition and further strengthens the privacy provisions in the legislation. Coleman said the second amendment was a clear power for the minister to specify steps which are not needed to be taken by social media companies to comply with the legislation – that is, the minister would be able to tell big tech what not to do in enforcing the age limit. With the use of identification documents now ruled out, supporters of the bill say platforms may look to biometric forms of age assurance, such as facial scanning, to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Coleman said: While the eSafety Commissioner will be responsible for formulating guidelines on what constitutes reasonable steps under the bill, the minister may direct that specific actions are not required in order for the platform to satisfy that reasonable steps test. This is also an important addition, as it allows the Minister to ensure that enforcement of the legislation is always appropriate and proportionate. With that, question time has wrapped up in the House of Representatives. Domestic violence payments The independent MP for Curtin, Kate Chaney, is asking about the crisis payment for women leaving domestic violence – she said conditions exclude half the women who apply, and the payment is only available if a woman can show she fits the “narrow criteria” within seven days of leaving. Will the government review the conditions? The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, responded: While legislation requires that that person has seven days from the traumatic event to lodge a claim for crisis payment, there’s flexibility to support people in this circumstance. Services Australia provides an additional 14 days after contact to lodge a claim if they have experienced family and domestic violence. Notwithstanding that, we know as a government too often perpetrators of family domestic violence can exploit and manipulate government systems to control, harass, or threaten a current or former partner. Rishworth said the government would continue to look at the systems “across the board” on this. Liberal MP Henry Pike has asked another question along the lines of – how can Australians afford another three years of Labor? (The opposition has been finishing most of their questions with this line today). The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded like he did with previous questions – by listing cost-of-living measures the government is taking, and criticising the opposition for voting against them. Because if things are free, apparently – according to the Liberal party philosophy – they’re not valued, which explains why you don’t support Medicare, and never have, why you don’t support public schools, and why you continue to just say what your against and not put anything forward constructively that will help. Just after Jim Chalmers wrapped up answering a dixer, the MP for Herbert Phillip Thompson was sent out under 94a. What is standing order 94a? You can have a read of this explainer for more information. Private health system accountability Independent MP Sophie Scamps has asked whether the government will support the call from the AMA for a private health system authority? She said her community is served by the only public-private partnership hospital in NSW, which recently terminated the contracts of private health insurers they believe are failing to adequately reimburse patients. The health minister, Mark Butler, said the sector had “suffered a price shock from Covid” amid other factors, “which impacts the business model of many hospitals and other things as well”. As a result, I asked the secretary of the department to conduct a health check on this sector – insurers, private hospital operators, [and] the AMA and patient groups were part of that. It was very constructive. I’ve published a version of that health check and asked the secretary to keep that forum going. It [will] discuss short-term options for reform of this sector soon, as well as long-term ideas that include the AMA idea, which they’ve been touting really for some time now, a different regulatory system. Question on food insecurity Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked the PM about growing rates of food insecurity. The minister for social services, Amanda Rishworth, answered by listing measures the government has taken, and said: We will keep looking at all the ways that we can support people with cost of living, whether there’s that’s through emergency relief, food relief but importantly, through the cost-of-living measures, including tax cuts to every single taxpayer – something those opposite were never going to do. PM says opposition’s figures on insolvency are wrong The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked about the rate of business insolvencies. Anthony Albanese said the figures put forward by Ley – that more than 25,000 businesses have gone bust since Labor took office – are wrong. The minutes of the RBA’s monetary policy meeting [on] 24 September, said this – “The cumulative level of insolvencies was still below the pre-pandemic trend”. Who was in government pre-pandemic? … Those opposite. Labor ‘looking more like Whitlam government every day’: Dutton The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was up next to ask how Australian families and businesses “can possibly afford another three years of Labor”. He pointed to changes to the Future Fund, and said the Albanese government is “looking more like the Whitlam government every day”. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded echoed earlier sentiments about the state of the economy when his government came to office, and the measures they have taken since. The fact is that the measures that we have introduced have all been opposed by those opposite … The difference between us and them is that they acknowledge people are under pressure, but want it to be worse. Albanese posed another question: how would any Australian have been better off under those opposite? They have no positive plans whatsoever, just reckless arrogance in their approach to the pressures that Australians are under. ‘They’re not’: Chris Bowen on why climate emissions are higher Greens MP Stephen Bates was next up to ask a question, asking the PM why climate emissions are higher under his government than when Scott Morrison went to office? The minister for climate change, Chris Bowen, responded that “they’re not”. That will be evident this week when we release the annual climate change statement, which is world’s best practice when it comes to accountability. Bowen also took aim at the opposition, saying: A government actually setting a clear policy agenda from the beginning, set by the Climate Change Act, supported by the safeguards reforms, supported by the new vehicle efficiency standards, supported by our capacity investment scheme, all of which has been done by this government – all of which has been opposed by the opposition, who want to stop all that while they wait for their nuclear fantasy to become a reality. Shadow treasurer asks question on latest Deloitte outlook The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question on the economy, pointing to the latest Deloitte outlook and changes to the Future Fund. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, responded by criticising the opposition’s economic track record: We have a plan for getting wages up. Increases, three of them, for people on the minimum wage. Remember back to the election campaign, Mr Speaker, when I took out that $1 coin and argued that a $1 coin, a $1 increase per hour … was something that we would support if the Fair Work Commission chose to do so. And those opposite said it would wreck the economy, the sky would fall in if that occurred. While taking a dixer on housing, the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, noted that Labor’s Help to Buy legislation had passed the Senate this afternoon. She said the government appreciates the support of those who voted in favour of the bill, “including the Australian Greens”. I’ve had a little bit of constructive criticism to offer the Greens in recent days, speaker, but let’s all agree, speaker, that at least the Greens are showing a modicum of interest in housing policy in this country. O’Neil said she had made “a number of attempts” to brief the shadow housing minister on “the policy offerings we’ve brought before this parliament”. It’s not that he can’t find the time to come to the briefings, speaker. He won’t even respond to our requests for a discussion. After a condolence motion for former Liberal minister John Hodges, question time has begun in the House of Representatives. First up is the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, asking about the latest financial outlook (from a Deloitte report, see earlier post). The prime minister said the government came to office “with a number of challenges that we were facing” – economic uncertainty, inflation and energy prices. He then listed a number of measures the government is taking, saying “they were all opposed by those opposite”. So certainly things, if they had’ve had their way, this reckless and arrogant opposition, things would have been worse. Just circling back to some comments Michael Sukkar made at the National Press Club, when asked if the Coalition would repeal Help to Buy if elected to government – noting this has just passed the senate. Sukkar backed repeal, and said: They’re terrible policies which is why we are in many respects, we’re unsurprised but dismayed that the Greens are now supporting it. On Build to Rent - the Greens have sold out ... they’ll vote with Labor to give preferential tax treatment to foreign corporates to own housing stock in this country for build to rent developments. We don’t think that the most beneficial tax arrangements for housing in this country should be the province of foreign fund managers ...As for the shared equity scheme, the fiddling while Rome burns, quite frankly, these schemes have been rejected by Australians and at a cost of $5.5bn - I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. Greens defer bid to dump Senate anti-abortion bill A Greens motion urging the Senate to discharge a controversial anti-abortion bill is being deferred until February, as the party focuses on negotiations with the government on a raft of stalled legislation in the final parliamentary week. Last week, Greens Senate leader Larissa Waters notified the Senate that she would move a motion today seeking to have the bill discharged. But Guardian Australia has been told the Greens have now opted to defer the motion until the parliament’s next sitting. The Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill is co-sponsored by Queensland Nationals senator Matt Canavan and South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic that would force medical practitioners to provide medical care to a baby born alive after a termination procedure. It has been on the Senate notice paper for two years. But after the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, urged federal Coalition members recently not to raise the sensitive issue of abortion or encourage public debate ahead of the next federal election, the Greens want the Senate to formally vote to remove the bill – something that would probably expose a split in the Coalition and possibly also Labor senators on what has traditionally been a conscience issue in the major parties. As expected, Labor’s housing bill has passed the Senate this afternoon, about 20 minutes ago. This comes after the Greens backed down on its concessions yesterday, and said it would help pass the legislation: Question time about to begin Question time is beginning in the House of Representatives in about five minutes. Grab a coffee, and get ready – we’ll bring you all the key moments here on the blog. Cash says Dreyfus’ actions raise questions about independence of INSLM office Continuing from our last post, the shadow attorney general Michaelia Cash has told Guardian Australia that Mark Dreyfus’ actions raised questions about the independence of the INSLM office: The Attorney-General has extremely serious questions to answer. Mr Blight has confirmed that this alleged “ambiguity” was raised by the attorney’s office, and at one point was raised by the Attorney himself. To be clear, the “ambiguity” in question was a direct criticism of Mr Dreyfus. What did the Attorney think would happen? Does he seriously expect Australians to believe that he spoke to Mr Blight, pointed out the ambiguity, but expected nothing to happen? The Attorney needs to explain how this is a proper use of his power as Attorney-General. Mr Blight’s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC, who wrote the report, has been crystal clear that his report didn’t need “clarification”. What Attorney Dreyfus has done through his conduct is call into question whether our independent national security legislation monitor is truly independent. He needs to explain himself immediately. Opposition demands attorney general explain private talks with security watchdog The opposition is demanding the attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, explain a private discussion he had with Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM) Jake Blight before Blight published a clarification to an old annual report that had criticised Dreyfus. As reported by Guardian Australia, Blight has confirmed that Dreyfus and one of his advisers separately raised concerns with him about what they argued was “ambiguity” in the watchdog agency’s 2022-23 annual report, which was produced by Blight’s predecessor, Grant Donaldson SC. Blight has said he was neither asked nor directed to publish a clarification but that he decided to do so of his own accord. The clarification appeared in the 2023-24 annual report, published last month. Donaldson’s annual report contained criticisms of the federal government for failing to produce evidence in 2020 that was material to a court application by convicted terrorist Abdul Nacer Benbrika opposing being subjected to a continuing detention order after his 20-year jail term ended in 2020. Donaldson discovered the evidence and made its existence public in 2022, prompting Benbrika to make another application – which ultimately succeeded. Donaldson’s annual report criticised the Department of Home Affairs for not providing the evidence to either Benbrika or the court in 2020 and the current attorney general, who inherited responsibility for the case after the 2022 federal election, for the fact that it was then only provided in full after a court order. It did not specifically mention the minister who had been responsible for home affairs at the time the evidence was first withheld, Peter Dutton. Donaldson said Dreyfus’s staff had raised “ambiguity” concerns with him before he finished his term as INSLM last year and that he had refused to change the report. We’ll bring you more on this in a moment. Greens won’t join race to ‘demonise migrants’ At the National Press Club, Max Chandler-Mather said the Greens wouldn’t participate in a “race to the bottom on who can demonise migrants more”, between the Liberals and Labor. Why is it every time there’s a crisis, that the rich and powerful in the major parties – backed by their big corporate donors – facilitate a debate in a race to the bottom in going after migrants? The Greens will not participate in that. We just won’t. The real solution to this is taking on those big corporations who are getting away with paying no tax, taking on those property investors and phasing out those tax handouts and getting back to a more fair and equitable system… He and Michael Sukkar just made their closing remarks, and the debate has wrapped up. Guardian asks Greens about their track record on housing supply Our own Paul Karp has asked about the Greens and Liberals track record on supply, and what commitment could they both give that at every level – federal, state and local – that their parties will be part of the solution and break their addiction to nimby votes? Max Chandler-Mather answered first, and said: I have been asked personally one time about what I thought about a social housing development in my electorate, and I wrote a letter supporting it. When we have written submissions on developments, our primary criticism is that a portion of that development is not being provided as social or affordable housing. Michael Sukkar responded next, and turned the lens on Labor instead: I would challenge you in one aspect – don’t give Labor state governments a leave pass for belatedly now trying to come up with solutions to a problem they created. He said many Australians living in the suburbs are very happy with some form of density, but “they shouldn’t be demonised for wanting to retain the essential character of the communities that they live in.” Max Chandler-Mather was asked why he hasn’t bought a home yet, and is still a renter, despite his earnings as an MP? He said he had a small, single-income family and gives up about $50,000 from his annual salary to fund a free meal program in his electorate: Because of that, giving up that money, and being on a single income and in an inner-city electorate with a very, very high median house price, it is actually sort of difficult at the moment to buy a house there. I want to be clear, though, I am not the one doing it tough – but I’m answering your question. Chandler-Mather says he doesn’t want to be a minister, prefers the crossbench Back at the National Press Club, the Greens’ housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, said he wouldn’t be defending Labor’s housing legislation – “and it is disappointing that the Labor housing minister isn’t here to defend them”. We’re not like the Liberals. We’re not just going to destroy, cut and block, and destroy any hope of actually fixing this housing crisis. We are trying to build public consensus for a large-scale action on this housing crisis. It has been our goal for the last few years, and indeed, for the entirety of the existence of the Greens. And I think that we’ve got some of the way there. Chandler-Mather was asked whether he would want to be a minister in a future minority government – noting Nick McKim was a minister in a Labor-Greens agreement in Tasmania. He responded: I think that personally, I would prefer to be on the crossbench and deciding on good pieces of legislation and pushing further after the next election. Dutton boosts Coalition MPs in final partyroom address Peter Dutton has told Coalition MPs that the Liberal and National parties are finishing the political year strongly, using his address to the final joint parties meeting for 2024 to rev them up ahead of an election year. Reminding them to focus on their electorates – citing the work of long-serving retiring MPs as an example – Dutton criticised the government’s priorities. The government is faltering and taking decisions that are making it even, even harder for families people believe that the country is heading in the wrong direction, but they also understand that if you get the economics right, you support families, and if you focus on what matters, that the country can get back on track. But you can only imagine what would happen under the chaos of a Greens Labor coalition. His deputy, Sussan Ley, urged MPs to maintain the “unity and discipline” over the summer, and determination to get things done, that they had shown in the past. The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, declared that the next few days “indeed, the next few months” would determine the election result and when people’s credit card bills came rolling in around February, they should be reminded the pressure they felt was homegrown and “it wasn’t Vladimir Putin who created that problem”. The meeting was dominated by a lengthy debate on the government’s legislation to introduce a minimum age for social media use. The electoral reform bill, which the Coalition is supporting, was not discussed. Shadow housing minister says Liberals ‘unashamedly oppose’ Labor’s housing measures A reporter asked Michael Sukkar if the Coalition would repeal the Help to Buy and Help to Rent bills? He argued “these schemes have been rejected by Australians”, and said: I assure you we can find many better things to do with that money to help Australians get into their own home rather than a shared equity scheme, which is not new thinking or innovative. You don’t give any credit to the Labor party for coming up with new ideas – just like the housing minister couldn’t show up today to explain herself and the Labor party position. They have no ideas, no new policies … and that’s why we unashamedly oppose both of those measures, and will not do what the Greens have done, which is go back on all of the arguments and critiques [they made]. Sukkar and Chandler-Mather on how they would address labour shortage A reporter asked both Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Mather how they plan to address the labour shortage – with the former wanting to slash migration, and the latter wanting to build a large amount of public housing. Chandler-Mather pointed to the Greens’ push for a government-owned developer, which he said would signal to the construction industry how many homes need to be built. You can plan how many construction workers we need in that area and that area. The federal government used to employ architects and town planners and project managers in a genuine federal Housing Department, which is what we’re planning to establish. And Sukkar, responding to the question, said “the truth is that we need to rebalance our migration program”. Yes, we need less migrants, fewer migration from the rorted levels we’re at. By no means is the Coalition suggesting that we won’t have a healthy migration program, but it won’t be the reckless migration we’ve seen in recent years. Sukkar said “you don’t improve housing in this country by bringing in more yoga or fitness instructors” and argued that in this financial year alone only nine bricklayers were brought in. Shadow housing minister: ‘We’ll build more homes than Labor’ Labor has said that it has a target to build 1.2m new homes by the end of the decade – will the Coalition recommit to this goal if re-elected? At the National Press Club, shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar said that “we’ll build more homes than Labor”. It’s almost industry consensus now that not only will Labor not meet their 1.2m homes … they won’t get close, they’ll miss it by more than 400,000 homes. Around 800,000 homes is what the industry expects will be built based on the current trajectory, and may I add, that trajectory is still getting worse. So it could even be worse than 800,000. Some Coalition members may vote against the under-16s social media ban when it is voted on in parliament, with some 20 opposition members debating the online legislation in a marathon partyroom meeting this morning. The opposition “overwhelmingly” backed the bill, according to a party room spokesperson, but it’s understood a small handful spoke against it. Guardian Australia revealed recently that Matt Canavan and Keith Pitt, the Queensland Nationals members, had strong reservations about privacy elements of the bill. The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, spoke strongly for the bill, praising the campaigning of communications spokesperson David Coleman for pushing the issue as far as it has gone. The party room spokesperson said Dutton had negotiated “concessions” on the legislation, including an amendment to the legislation that would ensure there is no compulsion for people to hand over any form of government ID to social media platforms to verify their age. That’s understood to include drivers licenses and passports. About 19 Coalition members spoke in favour of the bill, but “two or three” spoke against it. At least one told the meeting they would vote against the legislation, while two others reserved their right to potentially vote against it. Chandler-Mather criticises Liberals for focus on migration amid housing debate Max Chandler-Mather has accused the Liberals of bringing up migration in the housing debate to “distract” from the fact the “real winners” are large property investors and the banks. He told the National Press Club: Of course the Liberals bring up migrants. Of course they do, because it is such a useful tool for them to distract from the fact that the real winners out of the housing crisis – the ones really hurting people right now – are the large property investors and the bank, and the property industry who benefit to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. The Liberals were in power for nine years. What did they do? Give tax handouts to property investors, build less public housing than any government in Australian history since World War II, help to screw over renters. It is genuinely remarkable that the Liberals won’t take any responsibility for this housing crisis. It hardly gives me any confidence that they are going to be able to fix it. Shadow housing minister accuses Labor and Greens of being in a coalition The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has weighed in on the Greens’ capitulation to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy legislation, and said: The theatre of the Greens and Labor fighting in the parliament really betrays the truth, which is Labor and the Greens are in an unholy alliance – a Coalition. On housing, the government has repeatedly accused the Greens of working with the Coalition and Peter Dutton. Max Chandler-Mather addresses housing debate at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, has wrapped up his opening remarks, and now the Greens’ Max Chandler-Mather is up. He has told the National Press Club that “the barrier to fixing this housing crisis is not economic, it’s not technical – it’s political”. He argued Australia’s political system “has been corrupted by the power of the banking and property industry”, and said Labor and the Liberals “pursue policies that either push up house prices or give more money to property developers.” Chandler-Mather said today’s housing crisis can be linked to two changes in the 1990s – cuts to funding for public housing, and the introduction of capital gains tax by John Howard. Over the next 10 years, the Australian government will give property investors $176bn in tax handouts in the form of negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. The housing crisis we find ourselves in right now is enormous but we can’t keep doing the same thing and expecting a different result. He is outlining measures the Greens would push for, including: Phasing out tax handouts such as negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount, and using the money to create a government-owned property developer Develop new national tenancy standards, including long-term caps on rent increases A national renter’s protection authority to enforce the tenancy standards and issue fines to those who break the law Housing debate begins at National Press Club At the National Press Club in Canberra, the shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens’ housing and homelessness spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, are about to begin a debate. Club director Andrew Probyn told the crowd that the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, was also asked to appear but declined. Paul Karp flagged some details of what Sukkar will say, which you can read earlier in the blog here. We’ll bring you the key takeaways as the debate gets under way. Electricity strains ‘manageable’ but risks remain as mercury soars, Aemo says As we flagged last week, the arrival of sustained days of heat for eastern Australia (especially around Sydney) had authorities scrambling to make sure electricity supplies would suffice. The Australian Energy Market Operator has followed its usual procedure of sending out alerts and seeking a market response. What was unusual was the series of so-called level 3 lack of reserve notes for NSW, which implied the potential for blackouts if generators didn’t respond. (Cue some scary headlines.) Anyway, Aemo has issued a statement lately stating that “based on current forecast conditions”, they reckon reserves “are manageable” in NSW today despite the mercury climbing. (Parts of western Sydney are nudging 35C just now.) Still, Aemo doesn’t want to imply complacency: [Ongoing] heatwave conditions combined with significant generation outages in NSW tomorrow and Thursday remain a risk. Additional measures may be necessary if supply forecasts worsen due to unexpected generation or transmission outages, or if demand rises beyond current expectations. Nobody is being asked to reduce consumption – but for the sake of the planet (and our pockets) – why waste energy? Meanwhile, for Queensland “currently reserves are forecast to be manageable for tomorrow and Thursday”. Shorten said he thinks federal election is ‘winnable’ for Labor Bill Shorten also spoke about this morning’s caucus meeting, which will be his last – as he retired from politics next year to take up the role of vice chancellor at the University of Canberra. He told Sky News he has attended about 400 in his 17 years in politics. You know, they have on the wall pictures of all the former leaders. And I said, the only way that someone gets to have their picture on the wall is because of the faces in the room. And the Labor party, what it has, when … all the chips are down, is we have to learn to stick together. Shorten said he thinks the election is “winnable” but “it’s a contest.” What we think about when we get up in the morning as the government is ‘how do we help everyday Aussies?’. I think the opposition hasn’t done enough homework on their policy other than that sort of bizarre Soviet Union nuclear policy. Shorten lashes Greens over housing debacle Bill Shorten was also asked about the Greens’ backdown on its housing concessions – a rent freeze and negative gearing changes – to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy bill. The Greens’ leader, Adam Bandt, said earlier (see post) the party would wave Labor’s housing bills through and return to its fight at the next election. Speaking to Sky News, Shorten said he was pleased the bill was passed with a bit of “momentum” during the last week of parliament this year. The Greens have really, in my opinion, lost the plot. They have just been oppositionalist, and they’ve made the perfect the enemy of the good. I think the Greens think that, if they can sabotage Labor, then they can harvest our vote and say, ‘we should be the only really fair dinkum people because we’re so pure’. He argued the Greens’ “opposition mentality” was “turning people off”. Shorten says path to make NDIS long-term is ‘making sure we’re paying for outcomes’ The NDIS minister, Bill Shorten, has been speaking to Sky News about the NDIS. Speaking about art and music therapy funded through the scheme, he said “we are asking for some outcome for the dollars”. The path to making the scheme long term is to make sure that we’re paying for outcomes … What we want to do is focus on the participant. So this is a classic example. I like music therapy, I’ve seen it work where it demonstrates … it’s maintaining or improving highly disabled people’s functional capability. Great, keep charging. But if it’s something more as an activity, you can still charge at $68 bucks an hour, and if you’re getting four people in your class doing music or doing painting, $193 bucks, which is, I think, reasonable. Queensland opposition leader makes impassioned plea to government over truth-telling inquiry The Queensland opposition leader, Steven Miles, has made an impassioned plea to the government not to cancel the state’s Indigenous truth-telling inquiry. Most of the Labor frontbench attended a rally outside parliament, for the first sitting day of the new government. Miles said the government was “refusing to listen” by ending the inquiry. I think that is a real shame. But the commitment I make to you, though, is that if you succeed, if you get your meeting, if you change his mind, if the truth-telling inquiry continues, then there will be nothing but praise from us. We will not criticise him [Crisafulli]. In fact, we will welcome it, because the truth is more important than politics and more important than point-scoring. The shadow minister for Closing the Gap and reconciliation, Leanne Enoch, also spoke at the rally and said: There is nothing to be afraid of in telling the truth. What is there to be afraid of? The data, the history, the evidence? There’s nothing to be afraid of. Truth-telling has happened all over the world, all over the world. Why can’t it happen here? Why can’t it happen here? The deputy premier, Jarrod Bleijie, dismissed the protests this morning: There might be 150 protesters, but 5 million Queenslanders passed a vote on the 26th of October for the government to scrap [the path to a] treaty, and we have a mandate, and that’s what we’re going to do. He said the government could introduce repeal legislation as early as this week. LinkedIn tells parliamentary committee it is not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use it If you’re a social media platform trying to avoid having to verify the ages of your users, you might consider trying what LinkedIn has told a parliamentary committee: we’re not interesting enough for teenagers to want to use us. A few people on social media noticed a couple of months ago that one of the campaigns calling for the ban for under-16s had included the LinkedIn logo among the usual suspects of social media sites as an odd addition. LinkedIn has now told the parliament that it is definitely not a site teenagers want to use as it is “entirely professional” and “not popular with minors”. Additionally, LinkedIn simply does not have content interesting and appealing to minors. As noted above, it is entirely professionally focused, providing members the ability to connect and engage on topics relevant to the world of work. Unsurprisingly, therefore, LinkedIn does not direct or market any of its products or features toward minors – including the 16 and 17-year-olds that are technically permitted on the platform – through content, design, marketing, or advertising. Human Rights Law Centre says under-16 social media ban bill raises constitutional concerns The Australian Human Rights Law Centre has said the bill to ban social media for under-16s raises constitutional concerns. In a submission, the centre says while not having sufficient time to fully consider the potential constitutional implications, “on its face, the bill burdens the implied freedom of political communication protected by the Australian constitution.” It imposes a blanket prohibition on those under 16 from accessing various social media platforms. In the modern era, social media platforms are one of the primary tools for political communication. It is likely to also burden the ability of all people in Australia to communicate, by potentially requiring any user of a social media platform to undertake age verification. Those over 16 may have legitimate reasons for being concerned about consenting to age verification. There are real questions about whether such a burden is proportionate to the purpose of protecting children from online harm. We would encourage the committee to seek further input regarding the constitutional validity of the Bill. The centre is one of many of the submissions to the inquiry recommending against the bill being passed in its current form. Elon Musk’s X also yesterday said there were questions around the lawfulness of the bill. More information on Victorian anti-vilification bill Just circling back to the earlier news that Victorian Labor would introduce an anti-vilification bill to the state parliament today: The state attorney general Jaclyn Symes says the bill retains current exceptions in the law that protect activities done for genuine religious, academic, artistic, public interest or scientific reasons. It also protects people “genuine and legitimate religious activities, such as worshipping, practising, proselytising and teaching religion”. She said: We want to make it clear that what you believe … what you what your religion stands for, is unaffected by this bill. It can’t be used as a cloak for unabated abuse. But in relation to what people believe, what they talk about, what they teach. Religion is important. Your ability to practice your religion free of hate is protected in this bill. The bill also introduces a new “political expression” defence for the criminal incitement offence, to protect political communication. Greens still negotiating with government over Nature Positive environmental legislation On the issue of legislation still stalled in the Senate, and as the clock is ticking on the end of the parliamentary year, the Greens are still negotiating with the government over its Nature Positive environmental legislation after dropping their demand that climate impact be included among the assessments for development projects. The Greens’ environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, had talks with minister Tanya Plibersek yesterday but they have not yet reached a compromise. It is likely there will be further talks today as the government seeks to clear its legislative logjam. Australia and China have ‘interdependent’ economies: Chinese ambassador Back at his press conference, the Chinese ambassador to Australia Xiao Qian has described the economies of each country as “interdependent”. He said: We are two big economies. We are so much – let me use the word – interdependent. I don’t think it’s a negative word. The Chinese and Australian economies are strongly connected with each other. Our two economies are interwoven with each other. In a certain sense … we are interdependent with each other. China is the major importer from Australia, and Australia relies on China as its biggest market. And no other country can single-handedly take the place of China in this respect. And we do not see any other country can take the place of Australia. So we have confidence that, as we manage our relationship, we can have a mutually beneficial relationship. Labor has held its last caucus meeting for the parliamentary year. Anthony Albanese thanked a number of MPs and senators: Michelle Ananda-Rajah, whose seat of Higgins is being abolished but is contesting the Senate at the number 3 spot; senator Anne Urquhart, who is contesting the lower house seat of Braddon; Brian Mitchell, who stood aside to let former Tasmanian opposition leader Rebecca White run in Lyons; and Catryna Bilyk, who is retiring. Albanese noted the Greens had changed their position on Labor’s housing bills, saying their party had “folded in on itself” and this is “hopefully the first of many” bills to be passed this week. He took aim at Peter Dutton, for opposing government bills to prevent privatisation of the NBN, introduce a power to cap student numbers, and extend free Tafe. The prime minister said he would leave “nothing on the field” when it came to ensuring Labor stayed in majority government after the next election. On the social media age ban, communications minister Michelle Rowland said it was important to know that social media companies cannot compel people to hand over their ID. She noted while it is good that opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is on board it was concerning that their party room was split. A long list of legislation was approved: on authorising surcharges charged by commonwealth entities; the Future Made in Australia production tax credits; and the migration prohibited items bill. Chinese ambassador: ‘No reason for us to compromise our respective national interests’ Does Xiao Qian have any concerns that Donald Trump’s election in the US will alter or undermine the stabilised Australia-China relationship? He responded that “there is no reason for us to compromise our respective national interests for the sake of a third party.” We are responsible for our own people, the Australian government is responsible for Australian people. We have common ground and this has been the foundation for a good relationship over the decades, bringing so many benefits to our two countries and peoples and there are reasons to responsibly manage our relationship bilaterally so our people can benefit. On the US, as he mentioned a moment ago, the ambassador said “we are still in a transition period … so perhaps we need to be a little patient until the new administration comes into office … to see what bilaterally we can do between China and the US”. Ambassador says China respects ‘the choice of the American people’ Xiao Qian was asked about the incoming Donald Trump administration, and how this may impact trade. He said China “respect[s] the choice of the American people”, and the relationship between China and the US “is now in transition”, with Biden and Xi meting on the sidelines of Apec. Bilaterally, as ambassador in Australia, what I can say at this moment is I expect China and the United States to engage with each other to talk about each other’s policies on how to manage our relationship … at the proper time for them when the new administration comes into office in January. Asked about the Australia-China relationship, Xiao Qian said “we are in a very good shape – also at a very critical period of time”. We experienced a difficult time for several years until two years ago and since then we have been successfully changing that situation. The year of 2022 was a year of stabilisation. President Xi [Jinping] met with prime minister Anthony Albanese, they agreed to define the relationship … And the year of 2023 was a year of immense improvement, a lot of bilateral meetings … dialogues and consultations. That year was highlighted by prime minister Albanese’s visit to China. He said that 2024 has been a year of “consolidation” and “symbolised a complete turnaround of the relationship”. With efforts from both sides we have successfully turned around the relationship through the two years … Looking forward into the future, we are expecting – at least I am expecting – a move beyond stabilisation, moving further into development because we have so many areas that we share, contributing to the fundamental interests of our two countries. Chinese ambassador calls for Australia to support ‘One China’ policy The Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has been speaking to reporters at the Chinese embassy in Canberra. There is only one China, and Taiwan is a province of China … I hope the Australian side would respect China’s sovereignty and practice its commitment of the One China policy in words and deeds, and to support openly the peaceful reunification of China. Rabbi welcomes new anti-vilification laws in Victoria Rabbi Gabi Kaltmann has welcomed the laws, describing today as a “great day for all Victorians”. It doesn’t matter whether you wear a kippa or a hijab, if someone vilifies you, if someone wants to go after you, your faith, your background, your belief, your sexuality, the chances are that they will be charged and go to jail or be heavily fined. We all become safer. Sadly, what we have seen on the streets the CBD and around Victoria is people feeling emboldened lately to go after minority groups to go after Jews, to go after people from the Islamic community, members of the LGBTQI+ community, people with a disability – they feel that they can get away with vilifying bigotry, racism, all types of phobias. Today the Allan government says enough is enough. He is urging other religious leaders to support the reforms, and said: There’s been a little bit of chatter about the religious community. I’m an orthodox rabbi. I teach the Hebrew Bible scripture. I know the different nuances within it, but I also know that as a religious person, someone with fundamental beliefs, that we are all equal in the eyes of God. We all created in the image of God, and that means honouring, respecting people, of people, religion, beliefs, sexualities and the like. The Victorian attorney general, Jaclyn Symes, says the bill has been years in the making, and that she’s undergone significant consultation with the community over two years: These laws are for the Muslim woman who told me she was scared to get on public transport because she was wearing hijab … These laws are for the parents of Jewish kids, who are not allowed to come into the CBD anymore because they are scared that when they wearing their uniform or they have a Star of David necklace or a kippa on, because their parents are scared they attacked because of the rising antisemitism. These laws for the young man who told me, because he’s queer, he has to take time out from school because he’s viciously bullied because of who he is and what he looks like. The Victorian premier, Jacinta Allan, is announcing new anti-vilification and social cohesion laws that will be introduced to parliament today. There are plenty of details in the bill, but the main element will be to expand the state’s existing legal protections against vilification – which currently only cover race and religion – to cover disability, gender identity, sex and sexual orientation. It also protects people with a personal association with a person who has a protected attribute, such as being the parent of a disabled child. The bill will also create two criminal offences to be contained in the Crimes Act, to respond to serious vilification: It will be an offence to incite hatred, serious contempt, revulsion or severe ridicule against another person or group based on their protected attribute. It will be an offence to threaten physical harm or property damage against a person or a group based on their protected attribute. They will apply when incitement or threats occur in Victoria in any context – private, public or online. Party room meetings taking place Party room meetings have been taking place this morning in Parliament House. They are held every Tuesday during sitting weeks, and with so much legislation left to address and only three sitting days left, they could prove quite important. There’s an off-the-record briefing after each party room meeting, and my colleagues here in Canberra will bring us the key takeaways as we learn more. Circling back to news that the Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight: O’Brien is holding a press conference at state parliament after being selected as Victoria Nationals leader, saying the party would retain “our laser-like focus on the interests of rural and regional Victoria going forward.” Particularly at the moment when we’ve got a terrible government that is very city centric and focused on the urban areas, at the expense of rural and regional Victoria. After the 2022 election, O’Brien said his party should review its agreement with the Liberals. But today, he said the Coalition was strong: The Coalition remains very strong and will continue to remain very strong under my leadership. John Pesutto is doing a fantastic job in turning around the fortunes of the opposition and making sure that come 2026 that Victorians will have a strong alternative to the current terrible Labor government. And I’m very pleased and very strongly committed to ensuring that that Coalition continues to ensure that we get rid of this very bad Labor government. Asked what would happen to the agreement if the Liberals decide to dump Pesutto as Liberal leader, O’Brien dismissed the question as a hypothetical. He confirmed his predecessor, Peter Walsh, will step down from his shadow portfolio of Indigenous affairs but said the party’s position on treaty wouldn’t change. O’Brien said there would be a shuffle of portfolios shortly, with upper house MP Melina Bath to be elevated to shadow cabinet. It’s just the first sitting day of Queensland’s new Liberal National government. But as new MPs are sworn in inside the parliament building, hundreds of protestors have rallied outside. Signs demand the government abandon its plans to repeal a plan to negotiate a treaty with Indigenous Queenslanders and end an inquiry into colonialism. One sign reads: What are you afraid of? The truth? Most of the frontbench of the Labor opposition is attending, including opposition leader Steven Miles. Michael Sukkar and Max Chandler-Green to debate housing at National Press Club The shadow housing minister, Michael Sukkar, and the Greens spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, will debate at the National Press Club today. And it might actually be a debate now the Greens have decided to pass Labor’s housing bills (which the Coalition oppose). In an advance copy of Sukkar’s speech, the shadow minister is long on the problems in the housing market but a bit shorter on the solutions. On the problems, he says: First home buyer loans have plummeted from 171,218 in 2020–21 under the Coalition to just 108,599 in 2022–23. Home completions dropped to 177,185 last year—40,000 fewer than the 216,707 under the Coalition in 2016–17. Approvals for new homes have also crashed, falling to 167,287 over the past year, compared to 233,247 when the Coalition was in government. Meanwhile, national median rents have skyrocketed by 23%, reaching $632 per week from $512 in May 2022. Labor’s promise to build 1.2m homes over five years will never see the light of day, with industry experts predicting a shortfall of over 400,000 homes. On solutions, Sukkar promises: a “a comprehensive package” to tackle barriers to getting a loan to “make homeownership more achievable for all Australians”; a $5bn fund for enabling infrastructure; and a freeze on changes to the national construction code. He will conclude: Australians can continue to expect a Coalition government will be singularly focussed on home ownership. We are the only party that still believes in the Australian Dream, which is why the individual, not the institution, is the centre of our focus. We are the only party fighting for the Dream because home ownership has always been a Liberal value and something Labor has never signed up to. Australians deserve action, not spin, and housing - without a doubt - will be a defining issue at the next election. ‘Silent majority’ of Australian farmers found to support renewable energy transition Seventy per cent of regional Australians in renewable energy zones support the development of renewable energy projects on local farmland, a new survey has found. The survey, conducted for lobby group Farmers for Climate Action, found that support for renewable energy developments increased to 73% for people connected to the farming industry, but was conditional on concerns around consultation, project design and decommissioning being met. Just 17% of respondents said they opposed renewable energy developments, with 8% strongly opposed. For more details on the survey, you can read our full report below: Human Rights Commission to launch its anti-racism framework today This evening, the Australian Human Rights Commission will launch what it’s calling “the most comprehensive plan ever for addressing racism” in Australia. The anti-racism framework will “provide a roadmap for governments, business and community organisations to eliminate racism in Australia in all its forms”, it said in a statement. The framework has been developed with funding from the Australian government, and will be launched by Race Discrimination Commissioner Giridharan Sivaraman in Western Sydney this evening. University vice-chancellors face pay scrutiny The Australian is reporting that university vice-chancellors could have their pay pegged to other public servants’. That would no doubt be music to the ears of struggling students and the National Tertiary Education Union, but sadly the effect of upcoming governance reforms might have been slightly overstated. In April, education ministers agreed to set up an expert governance council for universities. One of its 10 priorities is to: Demonstrate and maintain a rigorous and transparent process for developing remuneration policies and settings for senior university staff, with consideration given to comparable scale and complexity public sector entities, and ensure remuneration policies and packages are publicly reported. As far as we can tell this might mean that there is more scrutiny on pay, but as long as universities have policies, consider the relativity of pay and are transparent in the way pay is set, they are largely free to continue giving generous remuneration. Nevertheless, perhaps modest pay could catch on. After all, the Western Sydney University vice-chancellor George Williams took a 20-25% pay cut relative to his predecessor and government services minister, Bill Shorten, has asked to be paid less than $1m when he starts his new gig at the University of Canberra. Victorian gaming minister outlines changes to state’s poker machine rules The Victorian gaming minister, Melissa Horne, has just run through the changes she will be introducing to parliament today to set up mandatory carded play on poker machines. Speaking outside parliament, she said $3bn was lost by Victorians every year through poker machines: But at the same time, we’ve got less than 10% of the population playing poker machines. This is less people than ever before but they’re losing more than ever before. And where people are losing the most money is in our lowest socio economic areas. So there’s something wrong. Horne said carded play will begin with a pilot at 40 pubs and clubs across the state in the middle of next year, before it is rolled out in 2026. She says it will become mandatory across all venues by 2027. So next year, it’s about doing the pilot and then evaluating the technology. Because unlike Crown casino, which is a single venue that’s got the same technology, we’ve got more than 500 different venues across the state, and the technology varies from machine to machine. We’re making sure that we get that technology piece right so that it’s easy for people to sign up to – that’s really important. But it’s the pilot next year then over 2026 is rolling out the card at play then this mandatory by 2027 which lines up with the new monitoring licence. The Australian Human Rights Commission has said the bill to ban under-16s from social media should not pass in its current form. The commission said while there are online harms and social media can have a negative impact, it provides opportunities for children and young people to access criticall potentially life-saving information and to share ideas and opinions. Social media also offers children and young people opportunities for inclusion and participation that are particularly important for children and young people from marginalised, vulnerable or remote communities, including children with complex needs and disability. The ban would have unintended consequences and negative human rights impacts, the commission said, not just for children and young people but the broader Australian community. Given the importance of this issue, the risks around negatively impacting children and young people’s rights and the unreasonable timeframes for analysing and commenting on the bill, the bill should not be passed in its current form. SQM Research has released its annual housing update that says Sydney and Melbourne housing prices are likely to continue to record moderate price falls of between -1% and -5%. The base forecast for average national dwelling prices is expected to rise between +1% to +4%. Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide and Darwin are expected to outperform the national housing market, it found, with Perth forecast to record the fastest dwelling price rises of between 14% to 19%. Meanwhile, Canberra is due to record the largest falls in dwelling prices of between -6% to -2%. SQM Research is also forecasting an interest rate cut between 0.25% and 0.50% over mid 2025 – which it says would “immediately stimulate homebuyer demand across the country [and] limit the year-on-year dwelling prices falls recorded for our two largest capital cities.” Louis Christopher, the managing director of SQM Research, said: To be sure, our two largest capital cities, along with Canberra and Hobart will start 2025 off in the red. Indeed, we are currently recording dwelling price falls in each of these cities … However, once interest rate cuts do occur, we are expecting a speedy bounce in demand for Sydney and Melbourne in particular, which both are still experiencing underlying housing shortage relative to the strong population growth rates … However, if I am wrong and rate cuts do not occur in 2025, it is unlikely a recovery will occur in Sydney and Melbourne at any time next year. Previous coverage on the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women There’s been a fair bit of talk this morning about the government’s response to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women. Our Indigenous affairs editor, Lorena Allam, has covered this inquiry extensively over the past three years. In August, when the inquiry’s report was handed down, she spoke with the Full Story podcast about the need for reform: And you can have a read of all our previous articles on this topic here. The sports minister, Anika Wells, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning about gambling reform. (You can read her earlier comments to ABC RN about this, here). Wells was asked why the government has acted so quickly on the under-16 social media ban, but not on gambling reform? She responded: The social media ban is about trying to protect kids as quickly as we can, and also to give parents the tools to empower them in conversations. It’s a lot easier to say to your kids, ‘The government has said that they can’t guarantee you’re safe online, that’s why you and your friends are not allowed to go on the platforms anymore.’ Gambling advertising has financial impacts for professional codes, national sporting organisations, impacts to us with respect to sporting integrity on the world stage and what we do on the world stage. She was asked: doesn’t gambling have just as many consequences for young people and their mental health when they get caught up in these addictions? Wells responded by pointing to action the government has already taken. NT authorities need to take domestic violence ‘more seriously’, Nampijinpa Price says The shadow minister for Indigenous Australians, Jacinta Nampijinpa Price, spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier about the NT coroner’s inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women. Asked for her reflections on what the coroner found, Price told the program: There has been a desensitisation from the coroner towards the rates of domestic and family violence that we certainly experience in the Northern Territory, and this has occurred over some time now. I also feel as though there is an attitude in … dealing with family violence and interpersonal violence in Indigenous communities that it is in some way, you know, taboo to have an open and honest conversation about the fact that we experience the high rates, so as not to demonise our men. Price argued there was a “need for our authorities and police force to tackle it more seriously”, and that calls to remove police from communities wasn’t helpful. I have faith in the Country Liberal party government to be able to deliver on those recommendations, and with that funding that’s available. The Victorian Nationals have a new leader in Gippsland South MP Danny O’Brien, after Peter Walsh stepped down overnight. The party met this morning to vote O’Brien in as leader, with Lowan MP Emma Kealy to remain deputy leader. O’Brien said in a statement following the vote: It is the greatest honour to have been elected as leader of The Nationals. For over 100 years, The Nationals have served the interests of rural and regional Victoria. That will not change. It remains our singular focus as the only party solely dedicated to serving the interests of the 25% of the population who live outside the metropolitan area. Walsh had been in the leadership role for a decade and it remains unclear whether he will stick around on the backbench. The Greens’ housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather spoke with ABC RN earlier, about the party’s backdown on its concessions on the Help to Buy legislation. He argued the Greens were “really close” to achieving its concessions around a rent freeze and negative gearing changes, and that the government “were actively considering it”. It is bitterly disappointing that Labor, in the end, blinked and didn’t decide to come to that policy. But I haven’t lost hope, because I think we can go to the next election with those policies, and I think we can push Labor after that next election. Is this an act of electoral self-preservation? Chandler-Mather disagreed, and echoed comments from party leader Adam Bandt earlier that “it comes a point where you realise you’ve pushed as hard as you can.” I would point out that we have now passed every single bit of Labor’s housing legislation this term of parliament. We have tried to negotiate and secure good outcomes. Chandler-Mather is due to speak at the National Press Club in Canberra today, alongside shadow housing minister Michael Sukkar. TikTok has warned the bill to ban under 16s from social media is tantamount to requiring every Australian to have a “licence to be online” because every person using social media in Australia will need to have their age assured. The company’s director of public policy in Australia, Ella Woods-Joyce, pointed to comments made by the communications department in Senate estimates earlier this month confirming that “everybody will have to go through an age verification process”. As the government’s admissions in Budget Estimates make clear, age-restricted social media platforms will need to undertake age assurance for each and every Australian user in order to remove age-restricted users from their services. This effectively creates a mechanism whereby Australians need a ‘licence to be online’. Woods-Joyce said there are many questions about the trial of the age assurance technology, which won’t be completed before the government pushes to pass the bill. Given the impact of mandating that all Australians who wish to use social media platforms be subject to such an age assurance system, we urge Parliament to consider the broader implications of legislating such an outcome without knowing any details of the system itself. We’re getting more submissions to the one-day inquiry on the bill, up to 93 out of the more than 15,000 submissions now public. You can read more of the submissions below. Rishworth says Coalition opposition to social media ban ‘all about politics’ The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, has taken aim at those in the opposition speaking against the under-16s social media ban. Earlier in the blog, we brought you her comments that this was a leadership test for Peter Dutton, as people in the party ‘defy’ him. Speaking at a doorstop at Parliament House, Rishworth was asked whether the government will allow amendments if the Coalition moves that passports and licenses can’t be requested for ID. She responded: Of course, we want to work across the board to make sure that there is strong privacy protections in place. But quite frankly, this seems to me like this is all about politics and about negativity. Now I shouldn’t have been surprised. This is not the first time that Peter Dutton has said he supports something and then has decided to destroy. The Labor party is trying to build, while he has become a blocker. So I shouldn’t be surprised that he says he 100% supports something, wants to see it delivered, and then decides to block it and play politics with it. The leader of the Greens, Adam Bandt, spoke to ABC News Breakfast earlier about Labor’s housing legislation and said “there comes a point where you’ve pushed as hard as you can”. He was asked whether the Greens’ backdown on its concessions around rent freezes and negative gearing was “humiliating”, and responded: We tried really hard to get Labor to act on soaring rent increases and unfair tax handouts that are tilting the playing field against first-home buyers, but we couldn’t get there this time. Bandt argued that the Greens “led the charge” on the stage-three tax cuts and were “hopeful” they could get the government to shift on key housing measures: We got close. The government was costing changes to negative gearing and they decided to back down at the last minute, and that’s disappointing. But, look, there comes a point where you realise you’ve pushed as hard as you can. The government’s made its decision about defending the status quo. What we’ll now do is wave the bills through, and take this challenge up to the next election … I’m hopeful that, in the next parliament, if we keep Peter Dutton out, we can push the government to make some much-needed reforms. Albanese government announces panel members for review of national electricity market As noted in an earlier post, the electricity grid faces a couple of days of strains in New South Wales and Queensland as power demand picks up along with temperatures. (About 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plant capacity is offline for maintenance too, which isn’t helping.) Anyway, the Albanese government is looking a bit over the horizon, announcing the panel members for a post-2030 review of the national electricity market (basically all of Australia save the NT and WA grids). The review will be chaired by Tim Nelson, a former AGL Energy expert. He’ll be joined by Paula Conboy, a former chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, Ava Hancock, who helped designs NSW’s renewable energy roadmap, and Phil Hirschhorn, who was a senior partner at Boston Consulting Group. The terms of reference of the review will be key but the details are apparently scant on that front. The federal and state energy ministers may fill in some of the blanks when they meet (some in person, some virtually) for their final gathering of 2024 at the end of next week. The panel will examine the wholesale market settings “to ensure the market promotes investment in firmed renewable energy generation and storage capacity into the 2030s and beyond”, the office of energy minister Chris Bowen said. This is vital as electricity demand grows and ageing coal fired power stations exit the system. The results of the review are likely to land after next year’s federal election – let’s see if Bowen will lead the charge of implementing its recommendations. McCarthy calls for change in how media reports on First Nation deaths On the media’s role in covering the deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, Malarndirri McCarthy said the Senate inquiry heard that “First Nations families felt they weren’t believed, felt they weren’t heard, and felt that they were completely ignored”. This must change. I’ve certainly written to the Australian Press Council. I’ll be calling on fellow senators to assist me with media across the country. There has to be a change in the culture of the media, in the reporting, in the way it’s reported. Government notes ‘large number’ of recommendations from inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women Going back to the Senate inquiry into missing and murdered Indigenous women – which the government responded to late last night – Malarndirri McCarthy told the program the government had “noted a large number of the recommendations”. What I’ll continue to do is meet with those Indigenous affairs ministers, as I’ve done recently, to ensure that we continue to keep working in this space. McCarthy said they had advertised for a Children’s Commissioner for First Nations youth and children, and “we hope to have that up and running in January.” Host Bridget Brennan said she had heard responses on two recommendations, but the government had “noted” eight others – what does it mean, will the government be looking at enacting them? McCarthy responded: For example, when we look at the jurisdictions around police – well, of course that will be up to the attorney general to work at the state level with the police jurisdictions. It will be up to each of those jurisdictions to then follow through. We can’t enforce it. But we can make sure we have those conversations. So it doesn’t mean we don’t agree, is what I’m saying. McCarthy urges NT government to act after inquest into four Indigenous deaths Yesterday, the Northern Territory government has been told it must overhaul its response to family violence to stop women and children being killed. As Nino Bucci reported, the NT coroner yesterday handed down inquest findings into the deaths of four Aboriginal women, making 35 recommendations: The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss this, and said it was an “important moment” for the NT and Australia to “realise that this is a national scourge that we have across our country.” She called on the NT government to “immediately” release funding to address the recommendations. This is too critical. We know that, from a federal perspective, that there was a requirement to assist the family and domestic violence sector in the Northern Territory. And I urge the Northern Territory government to do that immediately. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Malarndirri McCarthy, was on ABC RN earlier to discuss the rates of missing and murdered Indigenous women – after the government handed down its response to the Senate inquiry yesterday. McCarthy labelled the findings “horrific” – with Indigenous women making up 16% of Australia’s murder victims, while being just 2-3% of the adult population. There is something in the system in Australia that seems to just go, ‘that’s OK’, you know, but it’s not OK. It’s not OK … People who work in the family and domestic violence sector … break down because they feel that the system isn’t changing. And I do believe that the work of this Senate inquiry has certainly brought it to the forefront for the Australian parliament, to the point where the Australian prime minister brought all the premiers and chief ministers together to say enough … at the national level. McCarthy said there would “always be an expectation for more to be done”, and that state and territory’s will be tasked to take things back to their cabinets to work on. Sports minister on gambling ad reform: government ‘remains committed’ to all 31 recommendations Labor’s plans for gambling ad reform has been delayed until next year – despite commitments made from the minister there would be a response by Christmas. Josh Butler had more on the timeline of this in yesterday’s blog, here. The aged care and sports minister, Anika Wells, was asked about this on ABC RN earlier, and said the government “remain[ed] committed” to working through the 31 recommendations of the inquiry. Right now, we’re working through 31 recommendations with all of the different stakeholders in this space … As a sport minister who always tries to be athlete-led, there are athletes who are being targeted by the rise of gambling and the proliferation of gambling advertising, not just in professional clothes now, but in the junior leagues we’ve seen those stories come out. So it is something that we’re working through … These are complex but important reforms, and I look forward to continuing to work on them. Wells was asked about the role lobbyists are playing in trying to stop reform – but she said “I wouldn’t characterise it that way at all.” I think, and if you look at the public remarks that codes have made along this journey, they agree that something needs to be done. It’s about finding something that’s workable, that everybody can live with, and that won’t impact the financial models … Peter V’landys absolutely is one of the players in this area, but there’s lots more, and we’ve got to work through the nuances and concerns of all of them, and that’s why we’re going to continue to do that. On the under-16s social media ban, we’ve now got at least three Nationals – Keith Pitt, Matt Canavan and now Bridget McKenzie – and Liberal MP Garth Hamilton publicly voicing concerns over the rushed nature of the bill and potential privacy or access issues for all Australians. The Coalition partyroom is meeting this morning, where the ban is expected to be a hot topic of conversation. But Liberal senator Andrew Bragg said at a brief press gallery doorstop that he was in favour of the ban broadly, and indicated most of the Coalition still backed it: I think the process is troubling, and there are issues here, but ultimately, we think that this is a proportionate approach to what is a very serious issue in the community. This is something that Peter [Dutton] has given very lengthy comments on the record about, and that is our position. The report of the lightning-quick inquiry, which only held a short three-hour hearing, will be released this afternoon. We hear there may be more than a few amendments to the bill proposed. However even critics of the bill are expecting the Coalition will ultimately back the ban. Watch this space. Hot days to strain eastern Australia’s power grid for next few days The slow-moving heatwave across southern and south-eastern Australia will nudge temperatures in Sydney’s west towards 40C today and tomorrow. Sydney’s eastern suburbs will be spared the worst, though, with sea breezes keeping the mercury to temperatures in the low 30s for the next three days. Most of eastern New South Wales will endure low- to severe-intensity heatwave conditions today. NSW’s power grid faces the most strain, although Queensland too will have periods when reserves will be relatively tight. (That is, better not have any unplanned outages at the ageing coal-fired power plants ... or any generators for that matter.) The Australian Energy Market Operator this morning cancelled the latest of its so-called lack of reserve level 3 alerts (this one for Wednesday), which imply blackouts unless the market responds. (The market usually responds.) Still, wholesale power prices will near their maximum levels in NSW later today on present Aemo forecasts: A couple of nervous days ahead for our power authorities. And if you’re feeling the heat, drink lots of water, find a cool place and look out for your neighbours to ensure they’re doing OK too. Canavan says he is drafting amendments to under-16 social media bill Despite his pushback to the under-16s social media ban bill, Matt Canavan told ABC RN he hadn’t made his mind up yet on whether he would support the legislation. I’m going to obviously talk to my colleagues in the party room this morning. I am in the process of drafting a number of amendments to the bill, and I’ll have more to say about that in the committee’s report, which will be tabled today. I’ll just keep watching and listening to the debate, but I certainly think the bill needs major changes, and regardless of the changes, I remain unimpressed with this condensed timeframe to analyse the bill. Canavan said there was “widespread support” for legislation like this, and “I don’t think that support is going to somehow disappear over the summer break”. We can I think just pause here, come back and do this properly. Canavan concerned about digital ID for age assurance: ‘All we’ve got is the minister’s word’ The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has said a digital ID framework would not be used for age assurance – does this response alleviate Matt Canavan’s privacy concerns? Canavan argued there was nothing to stop the future use of digital identity to maintain social media accounts: So all we’ve got is the minister’s word, which, as I say, doesn’t mean anything. She might not be the minister within a year – who knows? So why not, if the minister is is being legitimate here … why not just change the act, change the bill to rule it out? He again took aim at the rushed process, saying senators hadn’t “been able to get across some important submissions” and that it would have been good to have social media companies themselves front the inquiry: We only had time yesterday to hear from their industry representative body but many colleagues of mine – including those who support the bill – are frustrated that the industry group could not answer their questions because their questions went to the particular behaviours of the likes of X or Meta … The bill doesn’t even come into effect until 2026, next year. So why not take a breath, extend the inquiry [and] allow us to get across these 15,000 submissions. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan is speaking with ABC RN about the government’s under-16 social media ban. He’s been an outspoken critic against the bill, and told the program “it’s just not acceptable” how rushed it has been. I completely understand the need [to address] significant harms done to young children from the overuse and abuse of social media, but given [that a bill of this kind is] unprecedented it’s just not acceptable to the public. He said the hurried inquiry into the bill received 15,000 submissions and the committee would report today. It’s very important to let people know this … won’t just affect the use of social media for people under 16, because once you have to try and verify someone’s age under 16 you’re going to have to verify everyone’s age to check their age. And so there’s huge privacy, free speech implications of this legislation. O’Neil says government doing ‘everything we can’ to ease economic pressures Asked about the latest economic outlook, Clare O’Neil said she wasn’t denying how tough it is for Australians, and said: You’re seeing the same problems with the economies in the US and all over the world. She pointed to tax cuts and energy bill relief: I’m not saying any of these things completely take the pain away, but I want people to know that government is on your side. We’re doing everything we can to try to relieve those [real] pressures that you’re feeling. Rent freeze and negative gearing changes ‘dead in the water’, O’Neil says The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, just spoke with the Today show about Labor’s housing bills – and the Greens’ decision to back its Help to Buy bill after failing to win its concessions. O’Neil said that the Greens’ calls for a rent freeze and negative gearing changes are “absolutely dead in the water, because they were never good ideas to begin with”. We have sought to be really constructive in this parliament, but it turns out you’ve got to push pretty hard to get your housing initiatives through. O’Neil said the bill was “not a silver bullet” but it was “never meant to be”, but warned people against “the snake oil salesmen in this housing debate who are pretending that there’s one thing we can do to fix the whole problem”. The truth is, we’ve had a generations-in-the-making housing crisis in our country that’s been building for more than 30 years, and it requires our government to do lots of things differently. We’re trying to build many more homes in our country, we’re trying to get a better deal for renters, and we’re trying to get more Australians into homeownership. It’s a big, complex program and it’s going to take some time. But I really want your viewers at home to know that we understand that Australians are in real housing distress at the moment, and our government is stepping up and taking action. ‘We can do better than that’: Zoe Daniel on Labor’s social media ban bill Zoe Daniel argued that the problem with Labor’s social media is that “you’re basically letting the platforms off the hook”. [We need to] get the platforms to take responsibility for what is in their environment – and actually, it would make an age ban redundant if we were to put in this kind of safety by design, and a duty of care and hold the platforms accountable for what’s happening in their spaces. You wouldn’t actually need an age ban. Daniel said she had spoken with communications minister Michelle Rowland about the issue, and the government has flagged it would “go down the track of a duty of care eventually”. The independent MP said she “understood” why the government was pursuing the age ban “because it is a lever to pull now and it makes parents feel better”, but argued it “actually makes zero difference to what is happening on the platforms”. The onus and the responsibility remains on the parents and the kids, and I think that we can do better than that. The independent MP Zoe Daniel was on ABC News Breakfast earlier to discuss her alternative to the under-16 social media ban, which she introduced as a private member’s bill yesterday. Daniel said her bill would implement an overarching statutory duty of care on social media companies “that goes to safety by design – but that in and of itself is not enough”. What you need to make that work is the companies to assess the risks, mitigate the risks, be transparent about how they’re doing that. The bill builds in penalties so if the companies do not comply, they could be fined up to 10% of global revenue. Also, their onshore executives could be held accountable for that … and the bill also has a provision to enable users to have control over the algorithm, as exists overseas, particularly in the EU … The final provision is that when you enter a social media platform for the first time, your default privacy position is defaulted to the strongest possible settings. McKenzie cites privacy concerns over under-16s social media age ban bill Also on the program, Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie weighed in on the under-16s social media ban and said “we are very concerned about digital ID laws”. [There are] obviously privacy concerns, and given the government’s had to pull their misinformation [and] disinformation – or their censoring the Australian public – bill from the Senate this week, we want to make sure we get strong, robust laws that don’t damage the [right to] privacy and make compulsory Australians having to have digital IDs. Nationals senator Matt Canavan has also spoken out against the bill, citing privacy concerns. But yesterday, Nationals leader David Littleproud said there was “conflation and confusion” about the bill, and that it was “dangerous to conflate” it with digital ID. You can read his full comments in yesterday’s blog. Amanda Rishworth was also asked about Labor’s under-16 social media age ban and whether the government was rushing this. The social services minister denied this and said the government has bipartisan support – or so they thought: Well, I thought there was bipartisan support … I mean, just a couple of weeks ago, Peter Dutton said he would facilitate this important piece of legislation and support the government. And now we see our senators defying him, I guess. So this is a test for Peter Dutton about his leadership. Labor’s social media age ban is likely to pass, following a rapid three-day inquiry with just one day to make submissions, and the Coalition claiming credit for having suggested it first. However, conservative opposition to the bill has been growing in the lead up to the lower house vote: Rishworth defends government economic decisions amid latest outlook The social services minister, Amanda Rishworth, just spoke with the Today show where she defended the government’s handling of the economy amid the latest outlook: We inherited a pretty big economic mess from the Liberal and National party when we came to government, we had inflation with a six in front of it. We inherited a policy from the Liberal party that was deliberately keeping wages low. Listing measures the government has taken, Rishworth pointed to lowering inflation, wages growth, cost of living measures and the stage three tax cuts. She went on to say: The alternative would have been if Peter Dutton was in in the prime minister chair. He’s opposed every single one of these measures and we would be in a real recession right now if he had got his way on so many policy issues. The Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie was also on the program and argued “Australians are feeling poorer because they actually are poorer under Albanese”. She took aim at government spending, and said this was why “in comparable nations, our numbers are in the toilet comparatively”. Queensland premier David Crisafulli begins first sitting week as premier Queensland’s new premier, David Crisafulli, will be only the second member of the modern Menzies Liberal party to sit in the top chair when he begins his first sitting week today. The “conservative, uniquely agrarian state” has been governed by Labor or Country National premiers for all but 1,000 days since 1860 but now it’s Crisafulli’s turn to show he can deliver on his promises to slash crime. Read our analysis of what lies in store: Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties. Thanks to Martin for kicking things off for us. We’re in the home stretch, with just three days left in the final sitting week of the year. You’ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers, capturing all the action. Let’s get into it. More on that Deloitte report from AAP: ‘The time will come for changes to tax’ The economists were hopeful inflation would keep a lid on election spending sprees, as cost-of-living support eases pain but injects money into the economy – adding to the problem it’s trying to solve. The treasurer has already been managing expectations before the midyear budget update next month. In a speech, Jim Chalmers warned windfalls would be nought but a “sliver” of upgrades clocked in the past few years. Higher commodity prices and a higher tax take from migration and bracket creep have helped the federal government deliver the first two back-to-back surpluses in almost two decades. DAE partner and report co-author Cathryn Lee said the government still deserved credit for banking most of the revenue rather than spending it, especially during a cost-of-living crunch when the community has been calling for support. Yet she said both major political parties had broadly failed to embark on the structural budget repair needed over the past two decades. The time will come for changes to tax. It must. Australia is waving goodbye to budget surpluses and returning abruptly to deficit, facing a $49bn deterioration in the bottom line in forecasts from leading economists, AAP reports. The $15.8bn surplus logged in the last financial year to Deloitte Access Economics’ prediction of a $33.5bn deficit in 2024/25 would amount to largest nominal contraction in the underlying cash balance on record, outside the pandemic. The forecast would also represent a $5.2bn mark down from Treasury predictions made in the May budget. DAE partner and report co-author Stephen Smith said: Worryingly, there is little to suggest that the situation will right itself in the years to come. As well as the well-documented pressures on the public purse from an ageing population, Smith warned global developments – including China’s economic slowdown and Donald Trump’s return to the White House – did not bode well for Australia’s budget position. Should substantial tariffs be slapped on imports into the United States, including at rates of up to 60% of goods from China, Australia’s budget will not be immune given its reliance on commodity prices via company tax receipts. Tensions high outside Melbourne synagogue Tensions ran high outside a synagogue in Melbourne last night as pro-Israel supporters gathered to counter a pro-Palestine protest despite the rally being cancelled, AAP reports. A number of pro-Israel demonstrators rallied outside a popular synagogue even after the planned pro-Palestine protest was formally called off at the 11th hour as organisers cited safety concerns. Despite the cancellation, there was a visible police presence near the synagogue in Caulfield North, in Melbourne’s south-east, where a sea of Israeli flags far outnumbered the Palestinian flags. Specialist police encircled a small group of pro-Palestine supporters in an attempt to keep them from the larger pro-Israel group. The planned demonstration was in response to a planned talk organised by the Australia/Israel and Jewish Affairs Council that includes former Israeli justice minister Ayelet Shaked, whose visa into Australia was reportedly rejected. It also comes as Australia’s Palestinian community demands answers after a dentistry student was struck by shrapnel in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Here’s our story: Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the top overnight stories and then it will be my colleague Emily Wind to take you through the bulk of the day in Canberra and beyond. Our top story this morning surrounds Labor’s resolve to force the big tech companies to enforce its proposed ban on under-16s’ use of social media after the Silicon Valley heavyweights pushed back against the legislation. Meta said the bill is “inconsistent and ineffective” and that it should be delayed until there is more time to develop age verification technology. The big moment yesterday was the Greens’ acquiescence to the government’s housing bill – a harsh lesson in realpolitik handed to Adam Bandt and Max Chandler-Mather by the prime minister. Tensions were running high on the streets of a Melbourne suburb last night as pro-Israel demonstrators rallied after the threat of a pro-Palestine protest outside a synagogue. More on that soon. And more soon on a report from Deloitte that forecasts the government faces a huge budget deficit, running into the tens of billions."

          "bodyText": "After a memorable weekend of Grade One steeplechasing in both Britain and Ireland, the Cheltenham Gold Cup has a new favourite in Fact To File, and the possibility that there will be a British-trained winner of jumping’s showpiece event in 2025 – or in the 2020s, full stop – seems increasingly remote. If courage alone were enough to win a Gold Cup, then both Royale Pagaille and Grey Dawning, the one-two in Saturday’s Betfair Chase at Haydock, would go to the festival in March as obvious candidates. Their see-sawing, slow-motion battle over the final two fences at Haydock was a compelling spectacle for the packed stands, and a much-needed boost for fans and professionals alike after the miserable scenes at Cheltenham six days earlier. However, a Gold Cup winner needs much more than a never-say-die attitude, Royale Pagaille has yet to reach the frame in three previous attempts and Grey Dawning, though he remains a 16-1 shot for the chasing championship, still has a great deal to prove. To be fair to Dan Skelton’s seven-year-old, he might well have won on Saturday but for a slight, and understandable, mistake at the last, and his next race, which will probably be delayed until late January or early February to give him time to recover from Saturday’s effort, will tell us much more. He already looks like the best staying chaser in a British stable. These days, though, that is akin to being the standout side in the Championship, and the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown on Sunday was a reminder of what is in store when he tries to mix it with the best that Ireland has to offer. Fact To File and Spillane’s Tower swept past Galopin Des Champs, the winner of the last two Gold Cups, at the last and Fact To File then showed impressive determination to hold off the runner-up’s sustained challenge to the line. It was a two-and-a-half mile race on Sunday and Galopin Des Champs remains a very solid 4-1 second favourite to win a third Gold Cup in March. But Fact To File, like Grey Dawning at Haydock, was a Grade One-winning novice making his first start in open company, and is only likely to improve on Sunday’s level of form. Ireland’s staying chase division is, quite simply, operating at an entirely different level to its British counterpart, and the gulf in quality is also apparent in the field for the Coral Gold Cup – the Hennessy, as was – at Newbury on Saturday. For many punters, this is the most eagerly anticipated race in the first half of the jumps season, and possibly in the entire five-month run-up to the festival meeting at Cheltenham. Sixteen runners stood their ground for the latest running this weekend – the 68th in all – at the five-day stage on Monday, and around seven minutes of compelling drama is all but guaranteed before one of them joins Arkle, Mill House, Burrough Hill Lad, Denman and many more of steeplechasing’s greatest names on the roll of honour. It is only eight years since Native River won the 60th and last running of this race as the Hennessy Gold Cup, and he was also the most recent winner to add a Cheltenham Gold Cup to his CV later in his career. Like Bobs Worth, who won both races in 2012-13 season, he was a highly promising second-season chaser who got into the race on a workable mark and his ability did the rest. But there is no obvious sign of a successor in Saturday’s field. Colonel Harry, the likely favourite, is a seven-year-old second-season chaser and has fine prospects of giving Jamie Snowden a second successive win in the race, but finished a long way behind the winner in two starts in Grade One events in the spring. The days when the winner of Saturday’s big race at Newbury would get a quote – and potentially quite a short quote – for the Gold Cup are seemingly gone, for the foreseeable future at least. The last Saturday in November will remain an important, almost spiritual date, for many fans, but like the Betfair Chase last weekend, this will be a race to celebrate and savour in the here and now without worrying unduly about its long-term significance."

          "bodyText": "Here’s Geoff’s report from Perth: India were always going to win today, it was just a matter of how and when. Usman Khawaja went early to Mohammed Siraj to leave Australia in disarray at 17 for 4. Steve Smith scrapped for an hour and a half without hitting a boundary before Siraj had him caught behind just before lunch. Travis Head decided attack was the best form of defence, hitting a rousing 89 from 101 balls before falling to the inevitable Jasprit Bumrah. Mitch Marsh (47) and Alex Carey (37) also played nicely but it was an exercise in futilty. The emphatic nature of India’s victory was summed up by the final wicket, a delicious slower ball from Harshit Rana that bowled Carey neck and crop. Geoff’s report will be on the site later but that’s all for our live coverage of a memorable first Test. See you in Adelaide. We were put under pressure in the first innings and I’m really proud of the way the team responded. [On choosing to bat first] I played here in 2018 so I remember that the wicket here can be soft and then get quicker and quicker. This wicket was a little less spicy than the last one. We were really well prepared so I told everyone to have faith in their ability because we have the opportunity to do something special. We can’t ask for anything else from Jaiswal. He’d has a great start to his Test career and I think that was his best innings so far. He’s an attacking batsman by nature but he left the ball really well and batted long. I didn’t see Virat out of form at all. Sometimes you play on challenging wickets and it’s difficult to tell whether a batsmen is in form or not, but he’s looked really good in the nets. Hopefully he can go from strength to strength. Fairly disappointing. We thought our prep was really good. It’s just one of these games where not much went right so there’s a fair bit to look at nbefore next week. After a loss you always want get back on the horse but we’ll have a couple of days’ rest and then prepare for Adelaide. We didn’t really give ourserlves a chance with a few different facets. If we’d got through that period late on day one, maybe the game looks different on day two. Obviously a couple of big partnerships when were bowling. There are a few areas we’ve got to clean up. There’s a lot of experience [in the top six]. This summer there’s a sample size of one – I’m sure there’ll be plenty of conversations between us and plenty of work in the nets. Travis Head and Virat Kohli embrace on the outfield. Kohli looks quite emotional, presumably while reflecting on his century yesterday. Marnus Labuschagne and Ravichandran Ashwin are also having a chat, likewise KL Rahul and Nathan Lyon. They play ferociously hard but get on well off the field. “I’m still trying to work out India,” says Phil Withall. “Eased past Bangladesh, totally outdone by New Zealand and now this, a simply magnificent performance in Perth. They certainly have the quality; now it’s time to find the consistency. Looking forward to the rest of an intriguing series.” The next BCCI executive to request a raging turner for a home Test should be sacked on the spot. India are so much better when they play on good pitches. WICKET! Australia 238 all out (Carey b Rana 38) That’s a beautiful way to finish the job. Rana hits Carey in the ribs with a bumper that doesn’t get up, then bowls him with a gorgeous slower ball. It completes a stunning victory for India, who were written off by many before the game after their 3-0 defeat at home to New Zealand. They were without their captain, their No3, their wristspinner and their second best fast bowler. They chose to leave out two spinners with a combined total of 855 Test wickets and nearly 7000 Test runs. Their XI included four players with only four caps between them – and they thrashed Australia’s best XI, give or take, on the bounciest pitch in the country. It’s India’s fifth Test win in Australia since 2018; before that they had managed only five in 70 years. They are making a mockery of one the toughest challenges in cricket, often with a below-strength team. The stars were the remarkable pair of Yashasvi Jaiswal (0 and 161) and Jasprit Bumrah (8 for 62 in the match). But all 11 players contributed with bat, ball or in the field. In the circumstances, it’s a win for the ages. 58th over: Australia 236-9 (Carey 34, Hazlewood 4) 57th over: Australia 235-9 (Carey 33, Hazlewood 4) Carey nods respectfully after swaying away from a sharp bumper by Rana. That was beautifully played, actually, as it heading straight for his grille until he snapped his head back at the last second. Carey punches a single off the penultimate delivery in an attempt to keep the strike. Rana bowls a no-ball and then thumps Hazlewood on the back of the head with a bouncer. That sounded nasty but Hazlewood stayed on his feet and seems okay. There’s a break in play while he is checked for concussion. 56th over: Australia 233-9 (Carey 32, Hazlewood 4) Josh Hazlewood, who doesn’t deserve to suffer such a heavy defeat after a majestic bowling performance, drives his second ball jauntily for four. His third spits extravagantly to beat the edge, probably the most Washington has turned a delivery in this game. 55th over: Australia 229-9 (Carey 32, Hazlewood 0) Carey almost runs himself out trying to get back on strike. Personally I’d say he’s earned a bit of red ink, especially as he needs to get that average up to something more befitting his ability. It currently sits at 32.37. Carey is not out. Too high, next! India review for LBW against Carey! The bowler Rana likes it; it looks high to me. It was a cracking delivery though, which straightened sharply off the seam to beat Carey’s defensive stroke. 54th over: Australia 227-9 (Carey 30, Hazlewood 0) Lyon propped forward defensively, playing for turn. There was none and the ball zipped on to hit the off stump. “I always remember reading that an England touring team were asked to tick their Visa cards with the purpose of their visit whilst on a flight to Australia,” says Tom Kidd. “They all ticked ‘leisure’, Geoffrey Boycott ticked ‘business’. Think it was a Michael Parkinson book on his favourite cricketers.” Bowled ‘im! Nathan Lyon goes second ball for nought, cleaned up by a ball that skids straight past his defensive stroke. India are nearly there. The players go off for tea after that wicket with a couple of balls left in Washington’s over. India are two wickets away from a quite stunning victory. A brilliant catch from Dhruv Jurel at short leg! Starc turned the ball firmly into the leg side, where Jurel threw up his right hand to take a blinding reaction catch. India can do nothing wrong. “Arrived in Brisbane last night en route to Christchurch for the England game this week,” writes ShowbizGuru. ‘Purpose of visit?’ asked the immigration chap. ‘Transiting through for the cricket. In New Zealand. Sorry to mention cricket,’ I replied. “To be fair he managed to laugh. ‘On your way mate.’.” That reminds me of Alec Stewart when he was England captain in 1998-99. On his immigration card, under ‘Purpose of Visit’, he wrote: ‘To win back the Ashes.’ 53rd over: Australia 224-7 (Carey 27, Starc 12) Harshit Rana replaces Siraj and is slammed through extra cover for three by Carey. It would have been four but for the painfully slow outfield. Rana looks really promising, an aggressive hustler who hits the pitch like he wants to hurt it, although apparently his pace has been down in this innings. “Looks like he’s feeling the pinch to me,” says Mike Hussey on commentary. 52nd over: Australia 218-7 (Carey 24, Starc 9) Carey laps Washington for a couple. He looks completely at peace with his game right now. Every attacking stroke has been clean and decisive. Washington’s ends over with an LBW appeal when the ball skids on to hit Carey’s pad Missing leg. 51st over: Australia 216-7 (Carey 22, Starc 9) Batting looks relatively comfortably against the old ball, at least when Bumrah isn’t bowling. There’s some occasional uneven bounce but very little sideways movement, so Siraj tries a zippy bouncer that Pant helps over the bar for a bye. He did well to take the pace off it and save three runs. Carey ends the over with a classy cover drive for three more. Just over ten minutes until the tea break. 50th over: Australia 211-7 (Carey 19, Starc 9) Washington Sundar replaces Reddy, who bowled a threatening spell of 4-0-21-1. I thought this game might end quickly after the wicket of Marsh but Starc is playing with almost exaggerated care. He’s faced 135 balls in this game, the second highest of his Test career behind that match in Mohali when he scored 99. “I just love this Indian bowling line-up,” writes Bill Hargreaves. “Some healthy batsmen, too. Any predictions for what will happen next in the series?” Given the number of surprise victories in the last two months – Bangladesh in Pakistan, New Zealand in India, Pakistan v England – I’d like to proudly announce that I haven’t a clue. 49th over: Australia 210-7 (Carey 19, Starc 8) The second Test in Adelaide begins a week Friday. Hard to see Australia making any changes to the XI, though they will be concerned about the form of Marnus Labuschagne in particular. The commentators are discussing whether he should go and play club cricket next weekend to enjoy a change of scene and hopefully score some runs. Carey clips Siraj through midwicket for two more. How does he average only 32 in Tests? To my admittedly inexpert eye, he looks a class act. 48th over: Australia 205-7 (Carey 16, Starc 6) Carey takes Australia past 200 with a beautifully placed pull stroke for four off Reddy. Despite this battering, Australia’s middle order looks fairly healthy; the concern, individually and collectively, is the top four. “I live in Malta and left last Wednesday to come to a ‘celebration of life’ party for the wife of a friend (Yvonne Buller if you could give dearest Yvonne a shout),” writes Steve Ditchburn. “Not exactly the best weekend to be in Torquay!! Left Malta it was 24 degrees, arrived in London Wednesday morning and it was 6 and then Thursday 4. Got a lift down to Torquay Friday and came back yesterday. Back to Malta today! Whoopee.” On the plus side, you avoided the worst of Storm Bert. My feet are still wet from yesterday morning. 47th over: Australia 197-7 (Carey 9, Starc 5) Carey takes a tight single to mid-on off Siraj. He would been home but Rana’s throw missed anyway. Later in the over he times a short-arm pull for four; he’s one of the few Australian batters who looks in good nick. 46th over: Australia 189-7 (Carey 4, Starc 4) Starc fences at Reddy and is beaten. The speedgun says 127 kmh but he looks sharper than that. Reddy oversteps, his third no-ball in as many overs. That’s about all he’s done wrong in this spell. 45th over: Australia 183-7 (Carey 3, Starc 0) Siraj replaces Bumrah, who is saving his legs for the rest of the series. You’d expect a quick kill from here. Starc, who batted very watchfully in the first innings, starts in a similar fahsion by leaving as many deliveries as possible from Siraj. 44th over: Australia 182-7 (Carey 2, Starc 0) Including this game five of Australia’s last six home defeats have been against India. Replays confirm that Marsh was undone by some low bounce. Nitish Kumar Reddy gets his first Test wicket! Marsh, who played two or three false strokes in the previous over, drags an attempted cut back onto the stumps. I think it kept a bit low but Reddy deserves that wicket after starting his spell with ferocious purpose. Marsh goes for a hard-hitting 47. 43rd over: Australia 179-6 (Marsh 46, Carey 1) Marsh softens the hands to ensure a thick edge off Bumrah falls well short of gully. The ball bounces past the fielder and away for four, then he square drives the next delivery for three more. He loves batting in Perth and has scored just under 22 per cent of his Test runs at the Waca and the Optus Stadium. Time for drinks. 42nd over: Australia 172-6 (Marsh 39, Carey 1) Nitish Kumar Reddy replaces Washington Sundar. His first ball pops nastily from a length to beat Marsh’s defensive push. It was only 125kph but it really spat off the pitch. The commentators are comparing Reddy’s run-up and action to Dennis Lillee. “Get the long hair, the yellow headband, shirt buttoned down, few words to the batsman…” says Ravi Shastri. His pace is nowhere near Lillee’s but he’s causing problems. Marsh gets a thick inside-edge, then Carey fences outside off and is beaten. That’s an outstanding first over. 41st over: Australia 168-6 (Marsh 36, Carey 0) Bumrah has never taken a ten-for in Tests, which is hard to fathom. He’s two away here, almost one when an inside-edge from Marsh misses the stumps. “When I read ‘Head down on one knee…’ (37th over) my thoughts went to Ann Boleyn with her head tucked underneath her arm,” writes Tom Lewis. “Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.” Well, the great West Indies side used to say ‘cut off the head and the body will follow’ when they targeted the opposition captain. And Pat Cummins hasn’t had his finest game. 40th over: Australia 166-6 (Marsh 36, Carey 0) Head drags an inelegant but effective sweep round the corner for four. 39th over: Australia 161-6 (Marsh 31, Carey 0) Bumrah has 3 for 33 in the innings and 8 for 63 in the match. Never mind superlatives; we’re running out of words full stop to describe his greatness. That was a brilliant, typical fearless innings from Head: 89 from 101 balls. India’s captain turns to his go-to bowler: himself. And he strikes immediately to deny Travis Head a century! It was a fine delivery, just back of a length and straightening off the seam. Head launched into a back-foot drive but was fractionally late on the shot and snicked it through to Rishabh Pant. Bumrah clenches his fist and screams with delight in Head’s general direction. It’s old news, but it bears repeating: Jasprit Bumrah is a bona fide genius. 38th over: Australia 154-5 (Head 87, Marsh 31) Cheers Geoff, hello everyone. Time will tell whether this partnership means everything or nothing in the context of the series, but it never hurts to put credit in the bank – even when you’re heading for a huge defeat. Head slashes Washington for two and then one to bring the partnership up to 75 from only 82 balls. Defiance comes in many forms. 37th over: Australia 151-5 (Head 84, Marsh 31) That is a rude cricket shot. Head down on one knee, proposing to wallop Harshit Rana through the covers. Angled bat, huge swing, leathered. He’s so audacious, yet somehow makes it work. Goes again later in the over, off the back foot this time and slapped down the ground, hauled in to keep the scoring to three. So that’s 383 to win, 16 runs for a Head century, and a bit more cheer for Australian supporters who would have started the day very glumly. I’m off for today and for this Test, please be nice to Rob Smyth, and whatever happens here I’ll see you in Adelaide. 36th over: Australia 141-5 (Head 76, Marsh 30) Sundar bowling away, three singles, they’re very comfortable against him still. 35th over: Australia 139-5 (Head 74, Marsh 29) The partnership went to 56 in that last over, by the by. The runs keep coming, singles here and there, Head cutting two to deep point. The field is less extreme than it was for Head facing fast bowling before lunch. Slip, gully, deep third, deep backward, cover, mid off mid on, deep square, long leg. Rana bowls him a good short ball though, a perfume variety, Head swaying back. Later he dabs to deep third, the position where he was caught in both innings during the India Test here in 2018. 34th over: Australia 135-5 (Head 71, Marsh 28) The lead has come down quickly, but it’s still… 407. Just that. Marsh pushes a run square from the spinner, Head plays into the ground and past his stumps! Whoops. Into the ground, over the bails. Gets him a run, and gets Marsh the chance to lamp six over long off. Bosh. 399 to win. 31 runs in four overs since lunch. 33rd over: Australia 126-5 (Head 70, Marsh 20) Rana trying the short ball approach again, but Head pulls a single, then Marsh crashes a pull and is dropped! Similar to the last big shot, similar cannon sound off the bat, but doesn’t get the elevation, and with hands above his hand, Padikkal at midwicket fingertips it up in the air and away towards long on for a couple. Marsh isn’t concerned, seeing a fuller length very next ball and crashing it through cover for four! Then a dodgy single, and again Padikkal can’t effect a dismissal, where a direct hit from midwicket would have got Marsh. Huge smile on Mitch’s face at the end of the over 32nd over: Australia 118-5 (Head 69, Marsh 13) Mighty appeal from Washington Sundar, slanting a straight ball in at Head’s pad, but maybe outside the line. No review in the end. The Australians settle into one-day rhythm, working four singles before Head slaps a fifth down the ground with power. 31st over: Australia 113-5 (Head 66, Marsh 11) Straight after lunch, and Head is straight back into it. A clip for two, a steer for one. Turns over the strike, and now Marsh is into it! Six! Harshit Rana drops short, Marsh drops the hammer. Into the stands, that wide stance he has where his weight doesn’t even have to shift that far back to clear the very long square boundary. Second session, on we go. Not too bad a session for Australia, you’d have to say, losing two wickets in the session. That’s compared to their previous batting sessions, which have… uh… all been bad. People will tell you the Smith one was big, but he’s never made a fourth-innings ton, made precious few fifties, and averages about 30. So he wasn’t likely the player to take Australia through the day and into tomorrow. Khawaja more likely was, but he played a bad shot early. Head has been entertaining and made it look easy, as he does when he’s on, and Marsh might yet do the same in the second session. We’ll see. Back with you in a bit. 30th over: Australia 104-5 (Head 63, Marsh 5) Last over before lunch. Marsh is crouching forward to defend, normal field for him. Two slips, gully, point now, so he makes use of the cover gap with a drive for two. Bumrah bowling in the high 130s as far as kilometres go. If you want miles you can ask at a museum. Another noey from Bumrah, that’s his fourth overstep. But Marsh blocks out the rebowl, and we’re done for the session. 29th over: Australia 101-5 (Head 63, Marsh 3) Siraj is flapping his arms again, trying the albatross take-off, as he goes past Marsh’s edge with a ball that keeps low. There’s that bounce problem that will only keep getting worse. The wickets are coming, surely. But the Aussies are scrapping through it, for now. Head got of strike first ball, nudging away. He’s done that so easily compared to everyone else. Marsh though does get off the mark with a sliced drive behind point for three. Back to the bouncer field for Head. One slip now, Kohli standing at about one and a half. Deep backward, deep third, fine leg, short backward, deep square, halfway back at midwicket, mid on, mid off. But Siraj is outside leg stump, and Head can tickle that finer of the fine leg for four. That’s funny. 28th over: Australia 93-5 (Head 58, Marsh 0) Bumrah continues, and Head hasn’t had too many problems with him. Starts with a couple of runs flicked through leg, then plays an audacious little late steer with a horizontal bat, just touching the ball towards deep third. They have two fielders back for that, one fine and one square, and he puts it between them for two more. Bumrah pushes back a fly slip, then changes his mind and brings Rahul back into the cordon. So, two slips, two variations on dee third, plus a fine leg and a deep square. Set up for the short ball, but Bumrah bowls full. Head can’t beat midwicket. That fielder, with mid off and mid on, are the only ones set for the fuller ball. Lots of space through cover, and Head goes there but only for one. And abruptly it’s different for Marsh facing, a horrible lifter that he fends into a gap on the leg side. Still yet to score. 27th over: Australia 88-5 (Head 53, Marsh 0) Fifty up, and in good time too. Style points like Jaiswal, too, as he lifts a Siraj short ball over the keeper’s head for four! Follows it with three through midwicket. Nobody else has hit a four yet in this innings. Marsh isn’t trying yet, though surely he will before long. 26th over: Australia 81-5 (Head 46, Marsh 0) Bumrah comes on, sensing the moment. Break this last top-six partnership (even if it’s for the sixth wicket), get into the keeper and remaining bowlers. Head takes a run to leg. Cordon waiting for the right-handed Marsh. Nasty from Bumrah, in at the gloves. Then past the edge, Marsh forcing his hands at that ball. Overstep from Bumrah. Doesn’t matter, give him another shot at the batter. Rising at the body again! Hits him. Marsh responds as he does to most things, with a smile. Leaves the next ball, defends the last. 25th over: Australia 79-5 (Head 45, Marsh 0) Well, the surface had seemed to be easing with a halfway older ball. Three slips and a gully for Marsh, Bumrah has dispensed with the point he had for Smith. Cover, mid off, mid on, midwicket, long leg – very conventional. Marsh blots out the last two balls. Against the run of play! The partnership to 62, the deficit down to 454, but Siraj makes the difference. A fuller length, a little extra bounce perhaps, Smith trying to cover his pads, edges wide of the keeper and Pant takes it brilliantly diving in front of first slip. Massive for India. Smith has a poor fourth-innings record across his whole career, and it continues today. 24th over: Australia 78-4 (Smith 17, Head 44) Sundar continues, Head goes back and cuts, but they have a deep cover sweeper so he only gets one run. Sundar probably happy to have him off strike. A bit of lift for Sundar, Smith has to defuse a ball that jumps from outside off stump. Then walks at the spinner to block the next to midwicket. Still no appreciable turn for Washington Sundar, if he gets wickets today it’ll have to be with flight or bounce. 23rd over: Australia 77-4 (Smith 17, Head 43) Siraj back, and Head smashes him first ball too! Flays it square of the wicket. Then drives one, and hands over the strike. Smith defends the rest. 22nd over: Australia 72-4 (Smith 17, Head 38) Not far from short leg as Smith works Sundar behind square. Head cuts a run through point. 21st over: Australia 70-4 (Smith 16, Head 37) Schhhhmmmacked! Travis Head is raring to go no. Leans back and slams the first ball of Rana’s over through cover for four. Even that power and timing sees the ball slow up inside the rope, but it does make it. He tries angling a drive square next ball, but plays under the bounce. A solid drive third ball, past mid off for two. Then Rana has had enough, top bouncer, nasty and Head fends it away, but the pace takes it over the cordon for two runs. Next, another square drive, this one connecting for two more. So that’s three twos in a row, after the four, and Rana’s closing ball is a wild bouncer and an overstep, so that’s one more to the total. Short down the leg side to finish, and Head can’t connect with a glance. 11 from the over. 20th over: Australia 59-4 (Smith 16, Head 27) Washington round the wicket to Head, too short, cut for a couple in that muscular, heaving Head fashion, heaving at the shot so it goes through cover rather than backward point. Now then, perfect sweep shot! Powerfully struck, along the ground, out through backward square. Fourrrr. Then goes back and cuts behind point for one. He’s liking the non-spinning spin, and he does like making runs against India. 19th over: Australia 52-4 (Smith 16, Head 20) Ric Finlay on the ABC doing the stats on Smith’s last 18 months in terms of modes of dismissal: leg before wicket is substantially up, but bowled is down, and the combination is about even. Read into that what you will. Rana is still targeting the pads, but not every ball, and Smith in between defensive efforts manages to drive two through cover point. 18th over: Australia 50-4 (Smith 14, Head 20) Washington after drinks, uneventful again. A single and a leg bye to raise the Australian 50. Small wins. “Hope you have remote access to enable the Snooze button on Rob Smyth’s alarm, he can likely sleep in today,” writes James Cahill. Well, Smith and Head are threatening to make him wake up in the cold early northern hemisphere morning. 17th over: Australia 48-4 (Smith 13, Head 20) India lose a review! Smith is smashed on the pad again, angling in at the stumps. Rana is turned down, and the review is missing the umpire’s call designation by a whisker, green light on impact. So a review down, but it’s another missed flick from Smith, who commits himself to keeping out the next few balls, then does connect with a flick through wide mid on for a run. Head takes another easily to square leg. Andrew Benton writes in. “I’m sure this test is just a blip for Australia, they’ll be back. No team with a series against Australia in the next year or two should be feeling smug, in fact they should be watching warily for the response next test. But India are just amazing.” Drinks. 16th over: Australia 46-4 (Smith 12, Head 19) Spin time, Washington Sundar with his offies. Pretty quick, pretty flat, pretty innocuous first over. 15th over: Australia 45-4 (Smith 11, Head 19) Scorched through cover again by Head! The last one was on the bounce, that one might have been airborne, but it has the pace and the direction to again reach the fence. Rana follows up with a beauty that beats the outside edge. This is fun cricket. Paul Moody writes in. Any relation to Long Tom, who’s on ABC radio this week? “Gosh this is so exciting. Imagine if Oz were 6 or 7 down at the end of play today. I’m following by your words, but will go to Southern Cross in Kampot to watch a bit too.” I’ve deduced that this means a bar in Cambodia. Have a cold Angkor for me. 14th over: Australia 38-4 (Smith 10, Head 13) Bumrah is back. That was quick. Replacing Siraj, changing ends from the end where he took those wickets last night. And Head drives him through the covers! Into the ground and bouncing away past Washington the fielder, but smashed hard enough that this one does, finally, make the boundary. The first of the innings! Narshan emails in. “Anyone ever seen a slower outfield in Australia? More grass than in Pattaya!” You’re right, I can’t recall one slower. Bumrah bowls a no-ball with his sixth, and has to re-deliver it. No run. 13th over: Australia 33-4 (Smith 10, Head 9) Runs still coming, Head drives one, Smith glides a couple using Rana’s pace. Then a shot that might make Smith feel better, his old faithful flick through the leg side, timed nicely and speeding away for two runs. That’s the shot that has been deserting him the last few years as he’s been lbw more and more often. No comfort from the following ball though, short and into his stomach! Smashes into the solar plexus. That’s hurt Smith. He’s down on the ground, rocking on his back, taking a minute to catch his breath. Badly winded. That’s uncomfortable, but he gets back to his feet eventually to see out the over. 12th over: Australia 28-4 (Smith 6, Head 8) Four for Head, but all run! He thrashes Siraj square, everyone expects it to reach the rope, but the slow outfield here sees it pull up short. That gives the batters time to get back. Next ball, nearly gets him, around the wicket angling in, Head thrashes at it, big inside edge into his knee, almost back onto the stumps. Siraj is rolling around on the ground in frustration. Following that, he’s so pumped up that he demands, insists on an lbw dismissal when he crashes into Head’s pad next ball. The ball looks like it’s heading past the leg stump. Siraj though is heading for the slip cordon. He just takes off in a celebrappeal, ignores the umpire entirely and is throwing high fives with his fielders. Meanwhile, Head is standing there looking bemused, as is the umpire. Not out. India have to review after that malarkey, and they think the ball has straightened, which it has but not enough. Umpire’s call, possibly grazing the leg stump. Head gets off strike cutting a single. 11th over: Australia 23-4 (Smith 6, Head 3) Bumrah is off. Surprisingly early, but he’s captain, and he asks Harshit Rana to come on and fire it down. He does, fires it down the leg side in terms of angle, though Smith’s pad gets in the way. The appeal is turned down. No run from the over. 10th over: Australia 23-4 (Smith 6, Head 3) This is top bowling from Siraj. Gets a ball to cut back in, Smith has to jab at it to keep it out. Then one holding the line, past the outside edge. Smith is happy to pull, taking a single. 9th over: Australia 22-4 (Smith 5, Head 3) Smith goes off to side against Bumrah here, dropping a run towards cover, before Head clips two through square leg. Odd that the runs are coming from Bumrah, and not the other end. Good from Australia to look to score against him though, carefully, rather than panicking and treating him like he’s impossible to face. Bumrah is around the wicket to Head, in at the stumps and the pads, with a short midwicket in place. He wants Head to fall over to the off side, flicking a catch there. 8th over: Australia 19-4 (Smith 4, Head 1) A maiden for Siraj, bowling to Head, who is playing just about everything to the leg side, hopping about a bit just to keep the ball out. 7th over: Australia 19-4 (Smith 4, Head 1) A couple of singles from the Bumrah over, both batters nudging to the leg side, keeping out the threat. 6th over: Australia 17-4 (Smith 3, Head 0) Travis Head to the middle. How does he play it? Australia with counter-attackers at 5 and 6, having just lost their premier long-innings merchant for a very short innings. Ohh, Usman Khawaja. What is that. Do you need to be taking on the short ball second over of the day, with the new ball that bounces more? He says he does. Pull shot, top edge straight up, and Pant trots back to catch it. Poor, poor dismissal. 5th over: Australia 17-3 (Khawaja 4, Smith 3) Hit on the pad first ball! Bumrah goes up! All the Indians go up! But it’s a no ball. The umpire wasn’t into it anyway, too high. Smith survives, then thrives, with a nice cover drive for three. That’s confident. Khawaja tucks a run around the corner, moving across to the off side. Runs from Bumrah? Huh. Here we go… Interesting little bit from Alex Carey on SEN radio this morning, saying that the main thing the remaining batters had to do was look at this as an opportunity to make runs rather than worrying about the result. Have as long a session in the middle as possible for the sake of their own games, knowing that can be beneficial for the remaining matches. Seems sensible, even if it’s not the flag-waving, save-the-day talk that some would favour. So it will be Usman Khawaja to resume in quarter of an hour or so, having scored 3 from 9 balls, along with Steve Smith who will be on a king pair. Got out first ball in the first innings. After that, Head, Marsh, Carey, and three of the four bowlers, with Cummins already done. There’s always so much attention on Virat Kohli. It feels as though Australian cricket is almost as obsessed with him as Indian cricket. Well, here’s yesterday’s century report, with a fair bit of Yashasvi Jaiswal too. Good morning from Perth, good day or afternoon or evening or witching hours wherever else in the world you may be. It’s sunny, it’s wildly windy, and it’s not going to get too hot today, and India will be bowling for victory with everything stacked on their side. Here’s the equation. Australia are 522 runs behind. Three wickets down. And they have two full days to try to survive on a wicket that has already started demonstrating the erratic bounce associated with this Perth Stadium pitch on days four and five. Buckley’s and none. Yes, that margin was 522, five hundred and twenty two. That’s after Jaiswal and Kohli made centuries yesterday while some teammates batted and then clattered around them. Australia, done in, then lost three wickets by stumps: first the makeshift opener McSweeney, then the captain Cummins trying to protect his first drop Labuschagne, then Labuschagne himself. Things have gone very badly indeed in that Australian side since they bowled out India for 150 on day one. India, meanwhile, can go into a five-Test series one-up, unless something truly bizarre happens. What’s in it for Australia? Try to get some good time in the middle against India’s bowlers, figure out a method against Bumrah, make the opposition toil and hurt for their win. That’s about it. The recriminations will come later, but they may be tempered or intensified by the manner in which today plays out. Let’s see."

          "headline": "Musk argues social media bill may not be lawful – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "That’s it for today, thanks for reading. Here are the main stories: The deputy prime minister’s chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, is suing her boss and the government after it failed to resolve the employment stalemate that has seen her locked out of her office since May. The independent senator David Pocock called Labor “gutless” for delaying gambling ad reform. A recovering gambling addict who testified before a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm also criticised the government’s decision to delay advertising reforms. At the short hearing on the federal government’s social media ban bill, mental health groups and experts were asked whether the good outweighs the ban on social media for under-16s. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, made a speech in the House of Representatives calling for the parliament to give “unanimous” support to his government’s bid to ban under-16s from social media, saying world leaders were “applauding” the push. The government also said its digital ID won’t be used to assure ages on social media, but when pressed could not point out in the under-16s ban legislation where it was specifically prohibited. Elon Musk’s X warned the bill to ban under-16s from social media may not be lawful, and the company is reserving its legal rights. Julie Inman Grant, the Safety Commissioner said it was her role to “enforce the laws”, not endorse, and the under-16 social media age ban was a matter for the parliament. The Greens said they would wave through Labor’s housing plan so they can “focus on campaigning for renters and against Peter Dutton at the next election”. The expected power crunch has shifted to Thursday as a heatwave lingers over eastern Australia. The NSW Council of Civil Liberties says an “extraordinary” number of people were arrested at the Riding Tide climate protest in Newcastle yesterday, because of “draconian anti-protest laws” in the state. A man has been charged after cars and buildings were damaged or vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney’s east last week. Mayors of the areas home to Sydney’s supersized housing precincts have been left “blindsided” after the NSW government announcing major zoning changes without first telling them. Six precincts were up for consideration and all had at least 1,000 additional homes added to their expected housing density in new zoning announced on Monday – except for the Kellyville and Bella Vista area, which had its total cut by three-quarters. The premier, Chris Minns, told reporters he thought that was a “reasonable compromise”: The number of new homes being built in the Blacktown local government area is massive, far, far higher than Macquarie Park and Hornsby. The mayor of Blacktown, Brad Bunting, said the decision was “a win for common sense” and praised the government’s decision. However, that precinct also reaches into the Hills shire, where the mayor, Michelle Byrne, was unhappy to have learned about the rezoning via morning media reports: It’s disappointing that the minister has steamrolled council with this announcement. There are a lot of issues with this half-baked proposal that need to be addressed. Byrne said the finalised proposal had wiped housing growth from Blacktown and put all of the increase into the Hills. The City of Ryde initially issued a statement thanking the government for its consultative approach but in a subsequent statement said staff had been “blindsided by today’s announcement” and had found “major discrepancies” between the government’s announcement and departmental master-planning documents. The North Sydney mayor, Zoë Baker, also said she had not been notified ahead of the announcement for the Crows Nest precinct, slamming the ruled 3% minimum for affordable housing as “wholly inadequate”, while a Hornsby shire council spokesperson said the new development plan included a number of changes made without consulting the council. Queensland police are investigating the death of a child in Innisfail this afternoon. Officers responded to reports of a child found unresponsive in a vehicle about 1pm. Upon arrival, emergency services provided medical assistance, however the child was declared deceased. Investigations are continuing, and a report will be prepared for the coroner. Man dies at swimming hole in Royal national park A man has died after being pulled unresponsive from a swimming hole in the Royal national park in NSW. Emergency services were called to Winifred Falls at about 2.35pm after reports of a drowning. Officers attached to Sutherland shire police area command attended alongside NSW ambulance paramedics and found a man had been pulled from the water. The man was treated at the scene by paramedics, but he could not be revived. The man, who is yet to be formally identified, is believed to be aged in his 20s. Police established a crime scene and commenced inquiries into the circumstances surrounding the man’s death. Liberal MP apologises for staffer filming in ministerial wing of Parliament House The Liberal MP Tony Pasin has apologised for a staff member filming in the corridor of Parliament House’s ministerial wing, saying “unbeknownst to me” his employee filmed inside the infrastructure minister Catherine King’s office. King made claims of “discourtesy” from Pasin in an interaction last week, where she alleged filming inside her office when Pasin and a staffer attended for a “drop-in” session. Pasin was not in parliament on Thursday but a spokesperson said in a statement last week he “denies the accusations levelled against him by minister King”. On Monday, the House of Representatives speaker, Milton Dick, said he had considered the matter but would not be referring it to the privileges committee. Pasin told the chamber that a new staff member of his had filmed him around Parliament House, “including in the ministerial corridor”. The MP conceded the filming was done “in error” but were “in no way covert”. “I acknowledge the error. I note that I apologised to you, and through you to all occupants of this building. I have re-familiarised myself with the rules for media-related activities,” Pasin said. But Pasin went on to deny that he filmed in King’s ministerial suite, or that he downloaded the footage to a laptop. He maintained that, “unbeknownst to me”, his staffer continued filming as he entered King’s office. “On returning to my office, and having been made aware of that footage, the member of my staff was directed to delete it,” Pasin said. “I have apologised to Minister King. Filming in her suite should not have occurred, and I accept responsibility for my staff member’s error.” King gave a short statement in response, saying “Australians do expect and deserve to see parliamentarians conduct themselves in a manner befitting this place. That goes to respect for each other.” As we flagged last week – and updated here today – eastern Australia will face a pretty warm end to spring, with temperatures soaring. A few days ago, the forecasts had pointed to relief coming to eastern New South Wales at least by Wednesday. That looks more likely to be Friday, as the heatwave stalls a bit over the region. Penrith, in Sydney’s west, can expect tops of 39C and 40C on Tuesday and Wednesday, with each daily update nudging the forecast higher it seems. Sea breezes should keep Sydney’s CBD to maximums of 31C and 33C for those two days, the Bureau of Meteorology said. The mercury on Thursday, though, will still be nudging 30C in Sydney and 33C in Penrith. One consequence is that the power grid will be strained for a bit longer, particularly in NSW, although Queensland will be hoping its generators don’t have any unplanned outages. The Australian Energy Market Operator had been forecasting the potential for blackouts on Wednesday afternoon in NSW, dubbed a lack of reserve level 3. That forecast was cancelled a little while ago, only for an LOR to be issued for Thursday afternoon. Now, it’s likely the market will respond (that’s the point of these alerts), but moving target, from Tuesday to Thursday, is a reminder of the limited spare generation capacity there is in the grid. Some will say “net zero policies are to blame”. The fact that about 6 gigawatts of coal-fired power plants are facing planned or unplanned maintenance this week in eastern Australia seems to be the real culprit. An Australian injured in a West Bank shooting has called for an investigation into the incident. Watch the video here: Ranem Abu Izneid was studying in her room on 15 November at Al-Quds University in Abu Dis, in the West Bank east of Jerusalem, when she was hit by shrapnel after Israeli forces allegedly fired live rounds in her direction. The shrapnel caused severe injuries to her right eye, neck and chest. “I want a transparent, full investigation on the situation,” the Australian citizen says. “I’m grateful for the help that I got from the Australian embassies, but it’s not enough.” The Greens have released a statement saying they have waved through Labor’s housing plan so they can “focus on campaigning for renters and against Peter Dutton at the next election”. They said renters should grant them the balance of power at the next election if they “want to end tax handouts for property investors and an end to unlimited rent increases”. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, said the party had “pushed as far” as it could: There comes a point where you’ve pushed as far as you can. We tried hard to get Labor to shift on soaring rents and negative gearing, but we couldn’t get there this time. We’ll wave the housing bills through and take the fight to the next election, where we’ll keep Peter Dutton out and then push Labor to act on unlimited rent rises and tax handouts to wealthy property investors. Good afternoon, Mostafa Rachwani with you for the rest of the day’s news. Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I’ll hand over to Mostafa Rachwani to take you through the rest of today’s news. The Greens are expected to give a press conference any minute now on their decision to help pass Labor’s Help to Buy bill – stay tuned for all the details. ‘We have to stamp out racism,’ Thorpe says The independent senator Lidia Thorpe was also on Afternoon Briefing just now, discussing the racism inquiry she is moving in the Senate alongside the Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi. Thorpe said she had experienced racism in the workplace, and the Senate chamber, and “procedures do not know how to deal with the racism in the chamber”. Asked if there were any prime offenders, Thorpe said: “Absolutely, there’s quite a few.” If it was any other workplace, this [wouldn’t] be acceptable. We want the Senate through the vote we’ll see this afternoon – and hopefully Labor does support this – if they want to change the behaviours in the Senate, it needs to be fair for everybody … I think that everyone needs to be held accountable for any racist slur in this workplace, whether it be this place or any other. We have to stamp out racism. It’s a sickness. It makes people sick. And we are only complicit and we’ll only continue to have a divided country if we don’t deal with racism, and we have to stamp it out at all levels. King expects critical minerals collaboration with US to continue under Trump Just earlier, the resources minister, Madeleine King, was on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing, asked about the future of critical minerals under a second Trump presidency. She said the work done on critical minerals has been “extensive” – and that Australia’s geology is “irrefutable”. The other thing to remember is the work between Australia and the US on critical minerals began under the former Trump administration … It started with Donald Trump, it continued under President Joe Biden and I expect it to continue under the new Trump administration. If we can speak to the new US administration about how it affects other parts of our economy, well, we’ll do that as it comes. Karen Andrews makes valedictory speech In parliament, the LNP MP Karen Andrews has been giving her valedictory speech. She was first elected to the lower house in 2010 and served as a cabinet member from 2018 to 2022. In April last year, Andrews quit the shadow frontbench and announced she would retire at the next election. This afternoon, she has told the parliament: As I leave parliament, I do so with a deep sense of pride in what has been accomplished and with enormous gratitude for the opportunity to serve. The work that we do in this place matters, it matters a lot, and the impact that we have on the lives of Australians is something that I have always taken seriously and will never, ever forget. Andrews says that when was appointed to cabinet, she “became the first female federal cabinet minister from Queensland”. Earlier this afternoon, the Labor MP Brian Mitchell gave his valedictory speech. Also expected to deliver their valedictory speeches this afternoon are the Liberal MP Gavin Pearce, Nationals MP David Gillespie and LNP MP Warren Entsch. The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, and housing spokesperson, Max Chandler-Mather, have called a press conference for 4.30pm. Guardian Australia understands the Greens will announce they have decided to help the government pass its Help to Buy bill establishing a federal shared equity scheme. The scheme allows the government to contribute 30% of the purchase price of a home for those who earn under the income threshold, or 40% for a new-build – reducing the cost for the homebuyer. This follows months of Labor refusing to negotiate with the Greens. On one view, the minor party’s decision rewards the Albanese government’s take it or leave it approach. On another view, it avoids walking into Labor’s trap of painting the Greens as blockers. Last Friday the Greens substantially reduced their demands, abandoning calls to reform negative gearing and capital gains tax in favour of calling for an extra 25,000 social and affordable homes. The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, refused. It appears the Greens have blinked. Heatwave breaks a few records across the country’s south-east, BoM says Energy authorities, as we’ve noted in today’s article and on this fine blog, face a nervous couple of days in NSW and Queensland as searing temperatures look set to strain the power grid. We’ll keep an eye on temperature records (can’t be many times Penrith in western Sydney has had seven days in a row above 30C in November, as is forecast) but the present heatwave already has the Bureau of Meteorology dusting off a few records. Coonawarra in south-east South Australia had a November maximum temperature record (40 years of records), with its 37.9C on Friday pipping the previous high by 0.1C. Essendon airport, meanwhile, clocked up two days (37.1C and 37.5C) on Friday and Saturday, the first time that site had two November days in a row above 37C. (It’s got 54 years of records.) More generally, Melbourne had its first back-to-back November days above 35C since 2009, BoM said. Mount Gambier in south-east South Australia was among the sites to set their highest minimum November temperatures, with 23.4C on Saturday eclipsing a previous high-low (so to speak) of 22.7C. That site has 80 years of records. Ballarat aerodrome, with 67 years of records, similarly set a record high minimum for November with 22.9C, about 0.8C above the previous high. Behind the heatwave, meanwhile, came some heavy falls. A BoM spokesperson said: A number of stations stretching from central South Australia to north-west Victoria had their wettest two-day rainfall total in November for at least 10 years. Bob Katter marks half-century as a politician A missile shield across northern Australia and training school kids in how to use rifles are just a couple of Bob Katter’s policy ideas that may never see the light of day. As AAP reports, the renegade veteran MP is celebrating 50 consecutive years in public office. He spent 20 years as a Queensland state MP before serving the past three decades in federal parliament as the MP for the regional electorate of Kennedy. Katter spent six years at university without a degree, was expelled twice from one school, remained qualified to move from a sergeant to an officer in the army reserves for 10 years without doing so and was the longest-serving Queensland parliament backbencher. He thanked his wife, Suzie, who attended a ceremony at federal parliament today, alongside his five children and several grandchildren. Anthony Albanese and the speaker, Milton Dick, gifted the Queensland MP a book of all his speeches from parliament. Katter’s father was also the member for Kennedy between 1966 and 1990, while his son Robbie was first elected to the Queensland state parliament in 2012. Question time concludes With that, question time has wrapped up for today. PM asked why the blanket ban on gambling ads has been abandoned The independent MP Allegra Spender has asked why the government has abandoned its promise to put a ban on gambling advertisements? The prime minister responds that “we have done more in two years to tackle gambling harms than any other government since federation”. We have also made it very clear that the status quo is untenable, but we continue to engage with stakeholders on our response to what is an important issue. Anthony Albanese instead points to a number of measures the government has taken – including mandatory customer ID verification for online wagering, banning the use of credit cards for online wagering, taglines in gambling advertising, funding for specialist financial counselling and nationally consistent staff training. Digital ID framework will not be used for age assurance, Rowland says Back at question time, the communications minister, Michelle Rowland, takes a dixer on the under-16s social media ban bill, and says: We have made clear the digital ID framework is not in scope and would not be used for age assurance. The government is also providing additional resources to the information commissioner to ensure that it is equipped to oversee this legislation when it comes to privacy. Elon Musk’s X has warned the bill to ban under-16s from social media may not be lawful, and the company is reserving its legal rights. In a written submission to the one-day inquiry on the bill, X said: We have serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill, including its compatibility with other regulations and laws, including international human rights treaties to which Australia is a signatory. The social media platform, which has already had successful legal tussles with the eSafety commissioner in recent years, said while it was examining age assurance options for X, the bill would have negative impacts on the rights of children and young people, and would also not be effective. The bill is vague and lacks fundamental definitions which are necessary to provide certainty and clarity to those providers that it seeks to regulate, especially alarming in the context that the Bill is setting up a punitive regime. Musk last week posted on X that the bill was a “backdoor” to control all Australians’ access to the internet. Snapchat’s parent company, Snap, said the bill wasn’t backed by experts: Many experts have highlighted the significant unintended consequences of this legislation, notably that it could deny young people access to valuable mental health and wellbeing resources, while potentially driving them toward less regulated and more dangerous online spaces than the mainstream, highly regulated platforms covered by the bill. Guardian Australia understands the committee received more than 15,000 submissions in the one day the committee was accepting submissions. So far just 73 have been published online. ‘I hope that the member for Sturt has apologised to his constituents for voting against energy relief,’ PM says The Liberal MP James Stevens has asked a question about increasing energy prices. Anthony Albanese responds that the “question for the member for Sturt, is why [he] voted against energy price relief not once, but twice”. I hope that the member for Sturt has apologised to his constituents for voting against the energy relief scheme … Your party policy is to invest unknown billions of their taxpayer dollars in publicly owned nuclear reactors sometime in the 2040s, and between [then], there is no plan whatsoever to secure security of energy supply. Labor ‘tinkering around the edges’ on online gambling ban, Hanson-Young says The Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has accused the Labor government of “tinkering around the edges” almost 18 months after a parliamentary report recommended a complete ban on online gambling. Yesterday, Labor revealed it would not release its online gambling legislation, with Penny Wong telling Senate question time the government has a “very full agenda” and is focusing on legislation it can pass. Hanson-Young then asks: Will the government rule out taking donations or having more dinners, lunches, birthday celebrations with the gambling lobby before you act on banning the ads? Wong looks confused. The Senate president, Sue Lines, jumps in to confirm the question does not fall into Wong’s ministerial responsibility. Wong gives it a shot anyway: I don’t know who is having birthday celebrations, but I don’t think people having birthday celebrations with lobbyists would be anyone’s idea of fun, to be honest with you … What I would say is in relation to donations, Senator Farrell has worked tirelessly across the parliament on this, and I would invite Senator Hanson-Young to support the legislation in the parliament which deals with donations. Officials working with families to bring Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles home, PM says The independent MP for Goldstein, Zoe Daniel, has asked a question about the death of Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles – and what the government is doing to help the families in bringing their bodies home. The prime minister says Australians are “devastated” at the “tragic loss of these two young women”. I know all Australians think of their families at this moment who are facing the grief which is every parent’s nightmare. There is no crueller arithmetic than adding up the years not lived, the potential not fulfilled, the dreams not lived or that might have been. My government continues to support Holly and Bianca’s families, just as we continue our efforts with local authorities on investigations into this tragedy. Officials are working closely with Bianca and Holly’s family to bring them home. He says Australian officials in Laos and Thailand are working closely with local authorities, including an offer of assistance from the Australian federal police. Our officials have also brought together representatives from other countries who [have] citizens impacted … We want to work with other governments based upon this experience to see whether any action can be taken. Cop29 agreements have zero cost, Bowen says The shadow climate minister, Ted O’Brien, has asked the PM how much taxpayer money the government has committed to spend on agreements arising from Cop29. Chris Bowen gets up to respond, and answers: “Zero.” Last week, the government was requested by other governments to enter into certain agreements and arrangements, which we did agree to. We joined, for example, the global energy and storage pledge, which is a very good thing to do. We joined the call to action for no new coal at the request of and suggestion of the United Kingdom government, and we signed the Australia-UK climate and energy partnership … We work with governments across the board on renewable energy, agreements those opposite could not [sign and] enter into, and the member for Fairfax implies there was a cost – there was zero cost. Coalition ‘delivers nothing but slogans’ on energy prices, Bowen says The Liberal MP Melissa McIntosh has asked how small businesses are “meant to survive under this energy and cost-of-living crisis”? The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, responds that the government has delivered two rounds of energy bill relief “opposed by those opposite”. We’re getting on with the job of practical projects to small businesses, as well as [the] energy bill relief we deliver, while the opposition delivers nothing but slogans. Coalition ‘wants to press the pause button’ on renewables, PM says The Nationals MP Sam Birrell has asked about a promised $275 reduction in power bills, and says the government has broken a promise by not delivering on this. Anthony Albanese says the government is delivering on its commitment to renewable energy – and “we know that those opposite want to have a debate about our plan for renewables firmed by gas [compared] with their plan for, I don’t know what, between now and the 2040s when nuclear will come in”. When we’re talking about a plan to go forward as the world, that plan is being driven by renewables and the shift that’s happening with the transition to clean energy, that is what is happening … The United States added 39 gigawatts of new renewables last year and no nuclear. And last year, China added 217 gigawatts of new renewables and only one gigawatt of new nuclear. The reason why the world is transitioning to clean energy is because they understand not only is that good for the environment, it is also good for their economies, and that is why Australia is a part of that global transition that is occurring. Those opposite wants to press the pause button … ‘Quite outrageous’: claims shoppers charged more for unpacked fruit and vegetables than for plastic-wrapped produce The independent MP Monique Ryan has asked the environment minister about claims supermarkets have been found charging more for unpacked fruit and vegetables than for plastic-wrapped produce. How is the government holding supermarkets to account for this? Tanya Plibersek responds that it is “quite outrageous that the supermarkets are actually making it more expensive for families to do the right thing when they’re doing their shopping”. Bananas come in their own packaging, and oranges, in their own packaging, they do not need to be wrapped in plastic as well. Plibersek says the supermarkets have been too slow to reinitiate the collection of soft plastics as well. We’re also … working with state and territory governments on packaging regulation. We need to create less of this waste in the first place. We need to make sure we’re making demands on packaging makers, like upping the level of recycled content and packaging, reducing unnecessary packaging, getting rid of those particularly bad additives. The minister points to the plastics treaty being negotiated in South Korea at the moment, and says talks are in their final stages. Australia has been advocating very strongly for an ambitious treaty that restricts the production of new plastic and focuses much more on recycling the plastic that we’ve already got in circulation globally. We are absolutely determined to reduce the amount of plastic being used. The manager of opposition business, Paul Fletcher, has asked how the public can take the government seriously on climate change when emissions have gone up? The climate change and energy minister, Chris Bowen, takes aim at the opposition for “presid[ing] over 10 years of denial and delay [and not telling] the Australian people what [its] 2030 target is [and saying] we should rely more on coal and gas while we wait decades for nuclear to come forward”. As the prime minister has foreshadowed, this week we will release the annual climate change statement in accordance with the act. That is the best practice in terms of transparency and accountability when it comes to emission reductions. I will release the Climate Change Authority annual progress report, which I have received, and will table in the house … I look forward to the opposition’s detailed policy response, which will outline – no doubt – full costings of their nuclear plan, no doubt, the emissions impact of their nuclear plan … Coalition quizzes Labor’s future plans on misinformation bill Over in the Senate, Coalition senators are pressing the federal government over whether it plans to revive the recently dumped mis- and disinformation bill after the next election. The Senate’s government leader, Penny Wong, is asked by the Nationals senator Bridget McKenzie whether Labor would count on support from the Greens to pass it in the future. Wong says she is advised Labor will not be proceeding with the bill due to a lack of support in the upper house and has no plans to reintroduce it. McKenzie then asks: Given the Albanese Labor government can’t, or won’t, say whether it will pursue this bill again or if it would do a deal with the Greens following the next election, how [are] the thousands of Australians who oppose this bill meant to think anything other than it being a delaying tactic by Labor rather than a genuine withdrawal? Wong responds: There has been more misinformation … you are desperate for a scare campaign, aren’t you? You don’t want to listen to what I have to say. But what I would say to you, Senator McKenzie, is there is an issue … disinformation and misinformation in our democracy, and those of us who care about democratic institutions, including the few on [the opposition side] who do care about democratic institutions, should work with the government working out how we protect our democracy against disinformation and misinformation. That would be the responsible thing to do. Sussan Ley questions government’s 2035 emissions reduction target The acting opposition leader, Sussan Ley, gets up to ask the first question, on emissions reduction targets. She asks why the government is keeping its 2035 target a secret? Anthony Albanese says that when the target of 43% by 2030 was passed, one provision was that the Climate Change Authority needed to provide advice on future targets. That is the law … For those opposite, who do not have a 2030 target, to actually stand up and say what is your target for 2035? That is after 2030, it is just extraordinary … We are on track to achieving the targets we have established. The O’Connor MP Rick Wilson is sent out under 94a, just minutes into question time. The PM is back on his feet and goes on to say: “The short answer is I’m complying with the law.” Those opposite don’t have a target for 2030, opposed net zero by 2050, and have a nuclear plan sometime in the 2040s, and no idea how you keep the reliability of energy supply in the meantime. None. No idea, no costing, no plan. The speaker, Milton Dick, says that Parliament House will be illuminated in orange at 7.30pm tonight to mark 16 days of activism against gender-based violence. Ley marks International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women The acting opposition leader, Sussan Ley, is also saying a few words to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. She speaks of Isla Bell, and says: [She] was just 19 and had her whole life ahead of her. It is alleged that she was bashed to death in an apartment in Melbourne. Her body was [allegedly] loaded into a fridge and moved several times before being dumped. On the day that [she] should have been celebrating her 20th birthday, Isla Bell’s body was [allegedly] being hidden from view by men seeking to hide their crimes. The sad fact is that these events, the killing of women and girls, has been a constant presence for as long as I can remember. Countless women and girls have been killed, attacked and coerced and manipulated … Women should feel safe everywhere, always. They should feel safe in their homes and where matters of domestic violence arise, they should feel safe and supported in their decision-making, including when leaving a violent relationship. Question time has begun in the House of Representatives, where the deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, is representing Peter Dutton – who is absent today for family reasons. Anthony Albanese has begun by marking the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women: We think of every woman robbed of the future she had every right to live, every death is its own universe of devastation. We think of all who live or grow up in the shadow of violence. We think of those who live with abuse, with fear, and we think of all the First Nations women and children who have been murdered or disappeared. This is a stain upon the soul of our nation [that] cannot stand … We all feel anger [at] all stories we read on the page. But rather than let this overwhelm us, we must be energised to keep acting and working to change. The prime minister says that the “fear of violence should not be a normal nor accepted part of womanhood”. Labor’s three migration bills, explained The Albanese government has a trio of migration bills before parliament to facilitate the removal of non-citizens from Australia, including paying third countries to take them and creating powers to confiscate mobile phones in detention. The bills are listed to be debated on Wednesday and Guardian Australia understands that the Coalition and Labor are closing in on a deal to pass all three. What is in them, and what new powers would the government gain? You can read the full explainer below: Question time to begin shortly Today seems to have just flown by – it’s nearly 2pm, which means question time in the House of Representatives is due to begin in about 10 minutes. Grab a coffee, and get ready – we’ll bring you all the key developments as they happen. Russian ambassador claims Russian media more liberal than Australia’s The Russian ambassador, Alexey Pavlovsky, was on ABC radio earlier this morning, where he made a number of eyebrow-raising claims, including that Russian media was more liberal than Australia’s. The Moscow envoy told the ABC Radio National host Steve Cannane that responsibility for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine lay “squarely on the west”. On credible claims of torture by Russians on Ukrainians in detention found by the UN, Pavlovsky said it was “propaganda” and claimed, without evidence, the UN’s reports were “biased”. Asked whether he believed Russian forces were torturing Ukrainians in occupied territory, Pavlovsky said he didn’t “accept it as a yes or no question”. I don’t accept it, because reality is much more complicated than the ABC wants to make it. Cannane said Pavlovsky couldn’t spread “false information” about the Russian military without being charged with criminal offences under Russian law. The ambassador added Russia was “much more liberal” than Australia, referencing Labor’s recent dumping of the mis- and disinformation bill. Pavlovsky said: The world needs responsible and reasonable politicians. Unfortunately, Australian politicians do not qualify. Read more from our colleagues in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv: Greens and Labor both accuse each other of working with Dutton on housing The Greens leader, Adam Bandt, gave a doorstop this morning about housing legislation, after the government rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy legislation (see earlier post). According to a transcript from his office, Bandt argued that Labor is “more interested in picking a fight with the Greens than working with us to tackle the rental and housing crisis”. Going into the final week of parliament, Labor’s approach is to pick a fight with the Greens and do deals with Peter Dutton. That is very distressing. Labor has also been accusing the Greens of working with Dutton over housing. Bandt argued that for Labor, it is “their way or the highway”. We put forward some food faith proposals to the government. Our proposals were based on the government’s own model. We’ll have a look now at what to do about the legislation when it comes up tomorrow, but what’s clear is that Labor has given up on the millions of renters who are struggling with soaring rent increases. Claim and counterclaim on 25,000 extra social and affordable housing units Labor is sticking by the housing minister Clare O’Neil’s claim that directing the Housing Australia Future Fund to invest in 25,000 social and affordable homes would be unlawful. The basis for that claim is that the Greens’ demand was to fund providers of a particular 25,000 units that had applied to the Haff in an earlier round. On that view, it is no answer for the Greens to note a general ability to set the Haff’s strategy and direction. Tink targets Labor for phone ban in detention The independent MP Kylea Tink has also detected some slippage on the Labor side when it comes to banning phones in detention. In a statement she just sent out, Tink noted that in 2020 Labor’s Andrew Giles said there was “no justification for blanket prohibitions”, while Josh Burns said Peter Dutton’s 2020 bill was “not about a proportionate response from government but about cruelty and politics”. Tink said: What has changed, other than Labor running scared of Peter Dutton? While Labor has been inching closer to the Coalition on immigration policy, they are no longer trying to hide the fact that their immigration policies are a ‘cut and paste’ of Peter Dutton’s. Mobile phones are a lifeline for people in immigration detention helping them to communicate with family, friends and the outside world. This is an attempt by Labor to silence a Peter Dutton scare campaign on immigration while silencing any criticism from detainees – preventing them from speaking to journalists, or advocates. Although, given Dan Tehan has said the Coalition supports the bill, it will pass easily – no need to convince the crossbench now. What’s stopping children from using VPNs to bypass social media age ban? The communications department has hinted at lawsuits against tech companies if teen users are using virtual private network connections to bypass the age assurance law by making their connection to the platform appear to be coming from outside Australia, where the age assurance requirement would not apply. The LNP senator Matt Canavan asks the social media inquiry: Will kids just be able to use a VPN? What’s stopping someone just using a VPN? Department first assistant secretary for digital platforms, Sarah Vandenbroek, says: Well, that comes back to questions of extraterritoriality and ensuring that the [eSafety] commissioner continues to be supported in any litigation that’s undertaken. The department deputy secretary, James Chisholm, says platforms would also be expected to check against information on the platform, such as if a user purporting to be outside Australia is posting photos from Bondi beach. The shadow immigration minister, Dan Tehan, has revealed the Coalition will support Labor’s bill creating powers to confiscate drugs and mobile phones in detention. The phone ban bill, along with the migration amendment bill and Labor’s first deportation bill are all listed for debate on Wednesday. Guardian Australia understands that the parties are close to a deal on all three. But Tehan said the Coalition would support the phone ban bill without amendment. In his remarks, he targeted Andrew Giles, Peter Khalil and Josh Burns for comments they made in 2020 opposing a similar bill proposed by the Coalition, such as Giles describing it as a solution in search of a problem. However, Labor’s bill has greater safeguards including requiring immigration detainees be given alternative means of communication if their phones are confiscated. It’s a good development that the Coalition hasn’t tried to toughen this up in a way that makes the law vulnerable to challenge – as occurred on the ankle bracelet and curfew visa conditions. More context on claim Greens’ proposed housing concession ‘unlawful’ Earlier this morning, the housing minister, Clare O’Neil, said that the Greens’ proposed concessions on the Help to Buy bill (which the government didn’t agree to) were “nonsense” and “unlawful”. She argued that one of the Greens’ proposals would have required her to direct Housing Australia to fund homes it has decided not to fund, “and that is against the law”. For a bit more context on those claims: While the minister cannot direct Housing Australia on particular projects, the minister can give direction about strategy and policy – including undertaking further funding rounds. The Greens’ proposal was for the government to provide additional funding to Housing Australia to unlock more social and affordable homes. Forrest calls for ‘plastic tax’ as global treaty to end plastic pollution negotiated The Australian businessman Andrew Forrest has called for a “plastic tax” as more than 175 countries – including Australia – negotiate a legally binding global treaty to end plastic pollution in Busan, South Korea. A “polymer premium” applied as a small price per tonne on plastic production could be used to fund waste management and further research as well as cleaning up past pollution, Forrest wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald. Environmental group WWF Australia said the treaty was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to create a global solution to the worsening crisis, with plastic pollution expected to triple by 2040. Kate Noble, the WWF plastic policy manager, said: Plastic pollution is a global scourge but its impact across Oceania – a large continent that is predominantly oceans, and home to some of the world’s most incredible biodiversity and pristine marine environments – is particularly horrific. WWF has urged governments to include explicit text in the treaty to ban and phase out the most harmful plastic products, mandatory product design requirements to ensure remaining products are safe and easy to reuse and recycle, and funding and mechanisms for strengthening the treaty over time. Negotiations conclude on 1 December. The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has made a speech in the House of Representatives calling for the parliament to give “unanimous” support to his government’s bid to ban under-16s from social media, after Guardian Australia this morning reported a simmering concern among some Coalition MPs about the rushed legislation. The Nationals MP Keith Pitt and some colleagues are raising issues about the fact children can work at age 14, but wouldn’t be able to go on Facebook until 16 – as well as concerns about the legislation being rammed through parliament within a week with only a token Senate inquiry. The Nine newspapers also reported the Liberal MP Garth Hamilton had voiced concerns. In an address to the house just now, Albanese claimed world leaders in North America, Europe and New Zealand had recently told him “they are all looking at what we are doing, and they are applauding what we are doing in showing leadership in this area”. Defending the decision to set the age limit at 16, Albanese said the restriction was in place because “as we develop and mature, we’re better at spotting the fakes and the dangers”. We build up the mental resilience to ignore the worst of the nastiness. We learn the difference between online followers and true and real friends, we learn not to measure ourselves and our lives against impossible standards or a fake image of perfection. If children don’t have that chance to learn, if they don’t have the grounding of real experiences and real friendships to support, if they fall into the vortex of thinking what happens online is all that matters, then we know the consequences can be devastating. The PM went on to say his bill was “worthy of the unanimous support of this parliament”. NSW’s forecast power shortfall reduced but conditions remain ‘tight’ Earlier this morning, we noted that the Australian Energy Market Operator had issued an alert for a pretty big potential supply gap in NSW on Wednesday afternoon, and it was seeking a response from the market. Well, it has received some of that desired response. So instead of 1700 megawatts (about the size of the now closed Liddell power station when it was having a good day), the forecast supply gap has been cut to 351MW. And instead of an eight-hour stint when supply might not meet demand (aka “blackouts”), the period has shrunk to five hours from 4pm (Aedt) to 9pm. Aemo said in a statement: High temperatures and strong electricity demand, combined with some generation outages, are causing tight electricity supply forecasts in New South Wales tomorrow and Wednesday afternoon. “Aemo has alerted the energy industry and is working with power station operators and transmission businesses to boost electricity availability,” adding that if the market’s response is inadequate, it will take “actions” to ensure supply. And, as we noted, Queensland also faces “tight electricity reserves” on Wednesday afternoon. Hopefully they don’t get tighter too. NSW holding off any official call for power use reduction as mercury climbs As noted in an earlier post, the electricity grid in parts of eastern Australia faces strains this week as a low- to severe-intensity heatwave sweeps eastwards. NSW’s energy minister Penny Sharpe told a media conference in Sydney (mostly about the fire dangers of lithium batteries) that the “first thing” is for people to take care of themselves in the coming heat. (Parts of western Sydney are expected to reach 38C-39C tops tomorrow and Wednesday.) You should drink water, you should check in on neighbors, and you should think about whether you need to walk out in the middle of the day in the beating hot sun. Sharpe, though, said the Australian Energy Market Operator was making the call on strains to the power grid although “we’re obviously keeping a close eye on it”. While not giving “any official advice at this point,” the minister said people consider “on really hot days” whether every single light needed to be in the house or whether air conditioner really needed to be set at 19C say. There are some big gaps for Aemo to fill, though, so we’ll be watching closely too. Meanwhile, fire danger risks in NSW will be elevated in some regions early this week as the mercury climbs. The likelihood of light winds and the fact the landscape hasn’t dried out - yet - will spare the state more severe fire conditions this time around. Mis- and disinformation bill withdrawn in the Senate Just earlier this morning, the government’s mis- and disinformation bill was officially withdrawn in the Senate. The opposition leader Peter Dutton welcomed the move in a post to X, saying this is “a win for free speech for our democracy”. He also called on Labor to “rule out bringing this legislation back, now or after the next election.” Nationals senator Matt Canavan wrote that it was “the most anti-democratic law ever introduced to the Australian parliament.” Greens senator David Shoebridge also wrote on X that it was a good outcome: Good outcome. Now do the social media age ban. A man has been charged after cars and buildings were damaged or vandalised with anti-Israel graffiti in Sydney’s east last week. Just after midnight on Thursday, emergency services responded to reports of a vehicle on fire on Wellington Street in Woollahra. This vehicle and a further nine vehicles parked along Wellington Street, Tara Street, Fullerton Street and Ocean Street were also allegedly graffitied. Another vehicle allegedly received minor damage as a result of the fire. Police estimate the total value of the damage to be in excess of $70,000. Three buildings on Ocean Street and Fullerton Street were also allegedly graffitied. At this time, the total estimated value of the damage is between $20,000 to $30,000. Following an investigation under Strike Force Mylor, a 20-year-old man from Mascot was arrested at around 3:50am this morning at Sydney airport. He was taken to Mascot police station and charged with 21 offences: Fourteen counts of destroying or damaging property. Three counts of entering a building or land with intent to commit an indictable offence. One count of destroying property in company using fire to the value of more than $5,000. One count of destroying property in company using fire to the value of less than $2,000. One count of having a blackened or disguised face with the intent to commit an indictable offence. One count of behaving in an offensive manner in or near a public place or school. He was refused bail and is due to appear in the Downing Centre local court today. Hanson-Young: ‘You’re asking us to ram through a piece of legislation without any evidence’ A theme of hearing on the proposed under-16s social media ban is around the short timeframe the government is expecting the Senate to review the bill. Today’s hearing is just three hours long and is the only examination of the legislation. The comms department’s deputy secretary James Chisholm was asked by the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young why the government had not released the review into the Online Safety Act given it goes to many of the issues that the age ban bill aims to address. Chisholm said the timing of the release was a matter for the minister. Hanson-Young said: This is why this is such a joke. A piece of legislation is being rammed through that relates directly to the issues that were raised in this review.... You’ve just said a whole lot of recommendations. It’s been kept secret from the public, secret from the Senate, and you’re asking us to ram through a piece of legislation without any evidence. The federal government has said its digital ID won’t be used to assure ages on social media, but when pressed could not point out in the under-16s ban legislation where it was specifically prohibited. The infrastructure department’s first assistant secretary for digital platforms Sarah Vandenbroek said: I know there have been questions raised in a few areas about whether there’s any linkage here to the government’s digital ID system. And to be clear, there is no linkage. That is not the intention. The trial will look at the different methodologies and assess not just their accuracy, but also their security and privacy settings to see which of those technologies might be considered a reasonable step. But when asked by Nationals senator Matt Canavan about where specifically the legislation rules it out, the department indicated there was no specific exclusion in the bill. Canavan: Can you point me to the bid in the legislation which restricts the eSafety commissioner from designating digital ID as a means of age verification ... Once it goes through the Senate, that’s it. I don’t get to touch it again. Is there anything in the law that says that? Department deputy secretary James Chisholm: Nothing in this law that says that. The NSW Council of Civil Liberties says an “extraordinary” number of people were arrested at the Riding Tide climate protest in Newcastle yesterday, because of “draconian anti-protest laws” in the state. Almost 200 people were arrested yesterday after pausing activity at the Newcastle port, the world’s biggest coal port. In a statement, the council president, Timothy Roberts, said the NSW government’s “efforts to stop protests and criminalise and demonise protesters at all costs should be of deep concern to all”. Where to deploy police resources is a decision for the NSW government and the police. They have chosen to use these resources against peaceful protesters in defence of the fossil fuel industry. Paddling a kayak in the Port of Newcastle is not an offence, people do it every day safely without hundreds of police officers. A decision was made to protect the safe passage of the vessels over the protection of people exercising their democratic rights to protest. We are living in extraordinary times. Our democracy will not irrevocably be damaged in one foul swoop – it will be a slow bleed, a death by a thousand tranches of repressive legislation, and by thousands of arrests of people standing up in defence of their civil liberties. Watch: More from the under-16s social media ban inquiry Here’s another video from the inquiry this morning into the bill to ban under-16s from social media. Questions over which platforms will be included in social media ban for children The digital industry group Digi says it is a “serious flaw” in the under-16s social media ban bill that it’s not clear which platforms it will apply to, including YouTube. The detail over which platforms are covered is determined by the minister through legislative instrument, and allows a lot of discretion over what is included and what is not. Digi’s policy director Dr Jennifery Duxbury said this was a serious flaw in the bill: The bill doesn’t make it clear who is in or out of scope. And that’s, you know, to us, that is a really serious flaw in the bill, but it is absolutely unclear who is in or out, and we don’t know what criteria will be used to determine these exemptions. The explanatory memorandum suggests that some services will be out of scope, but that will occur until a future date, and that date is unknown. Platforms can’t provide teens mental health support, inquiry told Here’s a video from the inquiry into the under-16s social media age ban this morning: Industry group cops heat at inquiry in absence of social media platforms Meta, TikTok, X and other platforms are not at the inquiry on the social media ban for under-16s today, so industry group Digi is copping the heat from politicians on their behalf. Here’s a flavour of that today. Liberal senator Sarah Henderson: Grieving families such as Matt and Kelly Howard, whose daughter Charlotte took her own life, and Rob Evans, whose daughter Liv was only 15 when she died, have been campaigning for social media age limits. Can you please explain to those parents and to other parents who’ve lost their children why you are right and they are wrong? Digi managing director Sunita Bose: These are absolutely tragic events, and as a parent of two myself, I cannot imagine anything worse. We must remain focused on how we protect young people online without cutting them off from the connection and the mental health support that previous witnesses have discussed today, we do this by teaching young people how to safely navigate online spaces, how to seek help. One of the risks we’re concerned about is that while the mainstream digital platforms are far from perfect, we have to remember that these are the services that do have safety guard rails. They do work with the eSafety Commissioner, and in young people’s determination to get online and to connect with others, there is a risk that they will go to darker, less safe, less regulated online spaces where they won’t be able to seek that help, and they may be unwilling to share with a parent that they’ve done so. The deputy prime minister’s chief of staff, Jo Tarnawsky, is suing her boss and the government, after it failed to resolve the employment stalemate that has seen her locked out of her office since May. Tarnawsky has filed a claim for adverse action under the Fair Work Act, naming the Commonwealth, her boss Richard Marles and the prime minister’s chief of staff Tim Gartrell as respondents. The claim alleges victimisation for having complained about bullying. Tarnawsky has said the alleged bullying did not involve Marles himself. Tarnawsky is alleging that Gartrell was involved in the commonwealth’s contraventions. She is not alleging Gartrell was involved in bullying. Making a statement at Parliament House this morning, six weeks after she went public about her employment situation, Tarnawsky said “good exits” from senior jobs in politics “are possible”. It should not be unreasonable for any of us to expect to depart with dignity, to walk away better from our time working in this building. Last month, Guardian Australia revealed Tarnawsky had not had direct contact with Marles since May, after she raised allegations with him about bullying within his office and he told her to find another job. Marles told parliament in October that Tarnawsky was “a wonderful person”, he felt “deeply sad” about the situation but because of legal processes, he could not comment further. Those processes were formalised today though Tarnawsky’s court action. Tarnawsky’s lawyer, Marque Lawyers managing partner Michael Bradley, said Tarnawsky would be seeking compensation. He alleged she was “punished … in a state of limbo, frozen out for more than 200 days now”. A recovering gambling addict who testified before a parliamentary inquiry into gambling harm has also criticised the government’s decision to delay advertising reforms. Mark Kempster has banned himself for being directly contacted by bookies, but over the last two years, some have still encouraged him to return to gambling. He now works with the Alliance for Gambling Reform: It’s been 20 months since I gave evidence to this inquiry. The Albanese government has had that entire time to try and regulate a completely broken, predatory industry that is ruining Australians every day. It’s unfathomable this has now been delayed again. Every week I get messages and calls from people falling into addiction and every one of them feels utterly trapped by the industry. They all feel they can not get away from the advertising of online gambling. Kempster has called on the government to honour the legacy of the late Labor MP, Peta Murphy, who led a bipartisan parliamentary inquiry that recommended a total ban. Murphy died in late 2023. Peta Murphy provided the government with an overwhelming comprehensive guide on how to help and protect people like me. Yet her party is doing everything they can to dismiss her legacy by continually kicking the can down the road. Earlier (see post), Nationals leader David Littleproud said it was “dangerous to conflate digital ID” with the under-16s social media ban. But Nationals senator Matt Canavan has argued in a post to X that there is “not an OUTRIGHT ban on social media companies retaining the information they collect to verify your age” in the bill. He wrote: Keep in mind, ALL users will have to verify the age even though the ban only applies to children under 16. But as long as they have your “consent”, they can use your identity docs for other purposes or even to disclose to others. There are some constraints, the consent must be voluntary, informed, current, specific and unambiguous. But this could possibly be just a checkbox that many will not understand the implications of. Inquiry hears that children will work around social media ban, as concerns raised about age assurance and privacy The committee examining the under-16s social media ban bill has heard that children will work around the ban, and it will mean every Australian will have to have their age checked. Project Rockit CEO Lucy Thomas said requiring age assurance for all Australians raises privacy concerns. Nationals senator Matt Canavan warned that age assurance could potentially push older people off social media if forced to grapple with age assurance technology. Sunita Bose, managing director of Digi – the industry group for the platforms including Meta and Snapchat, said the assurance process would affect everyone: To verifiably know whether someone is 14 or 40, young people and adults alike will need to take regular actions like providing an ID, an image of their face, or link to myGovID. The community needs to be consulted on their willingness to provide more personal information every time they use one of these services. Thorpe and Faruqi to ask Senate to investigate alleged racism and sexism in parliament Overnight, Josh Butler reported exclusively that Lidia Thorpe and Mehreen Faruqi will ask the Senate’s procedure committee to investigate racism and sexism in federal parliament – raising concerns about “white privilege” and how women of colour are treated in politics. Thorpe and Faruqi are expected to give a press conference on this at 11am AEDT – we’ll bring you the latest on this shortly. In the meantime, you can read Josh’s story in full below: Project Rockit CEO Lucy Thomas has been using her time in the under-16s social media ban hearing to read out quotes from young people given they are “not in the room” to speak about the impact the ban will have on young people. Some of those include: Reece from Tamworth: Social media has helped me figure out and become comfortable with my sense of self. There is a large community that is able to connect me with people all over the world living in a regional area. It’s difficult to find people dealing with the same personal developments and social media really helped. Lamisa from Western Sydney University: Social media has given me creators who are people of colour, and I think it has really allowed me to learn that I don’t have to justify my existence, that I’m allowed to have an opinion, and that I’m allowed to have a voice about who I am. Nationals leader on Newcastle protests: ‘I actually think we should just ignore them’ Speaking to Sky News, David Littleproud also weighed in on the Rising Tide protests in Newcastle and said “everyone has to be angry these days and have a cause”. I get it, but there’s a way to do it … Do they really think that that’s wise to go and put themselves in harm’s way, in front of a tanker and think that … makes a point? I actually think we should just ignore them … Littleproud said he understood “we’re all moving towards that [energy] transition” but argued “you can’t destroy [the] economy on that journey”. The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, spoke with Sky News just a moment ago about the under-16s social media age limit bill. As Josh Butler flagged earlier, several Nationals MPs have raised concerns about the bill, and as the Nine papers report, there is a growing pushback inside the Liberal party too. Asked about this pushback, Littleproud said there is “conflation and confusion” on what the bill is about: This isn’t around digital identification … and this isn’t about trying to hand over people’s personal identity and their forms – their driver’s license, their passports … I think there’s some elements that have tried to criticise that to whip up hysteria in the community, when the reality is that’s not that at all. Littleproud pointed to TiKTok as an example, and said it has the technology to ban users that are too young without needing to obtain ID. I think you’ll find that we’re having further discussions and negotiations with the government, and the principle still comes back to protecting young children, and protecting young girls who are the subject of abuse and offence … It’s not a perfect fix, but it’s another tool that that parents can have. And I just think it’s dangerous to conflate digital ID, we didn’t support that. Resources minister says Greens and Coalition are ‘populist, vote-grabbing’ The resources minister, Madeleine King, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning about the critical minerals production tax incentive bill, due to be put to parliament today – it doesn’t have majority support, so why put it forward? She said it’s about putting forward the position of government and industry, and “if Peter Dutton and the Coalition choose not to support the resources sector, well people should know about that.” The important thing about this incentive is that it drives further investment into an emerging industry that does face a lot of challenges from international markets. So people, whether it be the Greens, the independents, but particularly the Coalition – who really should know better – need to step up and [give broad] support. As the West Australian reports, the incentive would refund 10% of the processing and refining costs for projects that start between 2027/28 and 2039/40 – for up to 10 years per project – plus tax credits of $2 per kg made available for the production of renewable hydrogen from 2027/28. The minister also took aim at the Greens and Coalition amid the final sitting week, labelling them “populist, vote-grabbing parties”. We’re trying to do the right thing for the Australian community, whereas they want to block this to be able to put out another TikTok … It’s absolutely disgraceful. At the kick off of the short hearing on the federal government’s social media ban bill, mental health groups and experts were asked whether the good outweighs the ban on social media for under-16s. Dr Danielle Einstein said no: I do not see any benefits for mental health from social media. I’ve looked really hard at the evidence. And even if there, if there were to be some, I think they are far outweighed by their disadvantage. But for mental health, I do not see any benefits. Headspace’s head of clinical leadership, Nicola Palfrey, warned of the risk of the ban: The thing that headspace is concerned about with the social media ban is what we do from young people, and research does indicate is that there’s help seeking that goes online. There’s seeking out of information with regards to mental health and wellbeing, and definitely with regards to connection, particularly for those young people that there may be risk of being disenfranchised, so remote rural communities belonging to minority groups and so forth, so places where they find connection online that otherwise they can’t find in real life. Project RockIt’s CEO, Lucy Thomas, said there were risks and harms online but said any ban should be approached carefully, otherwise “we risk dialling back young people’s rights and pushing them into more isolated and less supported spaces online”. The Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce also spoke with Sunrise about the Rising Tide protest, taking aim at the protesters and labelling them “selfish”: Look around your house. Your television, watch, clothes, car, fuel in the car – comes from overseas. Somebody somewhere has been putting something on the boat and sending it in the other direction … That dear folks is things such as coal, gas, iron ore, wool, wheat, cotton – a lot of the evil things you don’t like. What these people are doing is going out in the harbour [and saying] I want Australia to be poor. They never suggest what pensions they would [want] removed or schools they don’t want built. They go out and say I want Australia to be poor because I have a selfish desire I can inflict on you … without accepting the consequences financially of what that means. Plibersek questioned on coal approvals and Newcastle protest The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, spoke with Sunrise earlier about the number of coal mine developments or extensions approved under her watch, Responding, Plibersek, said: Well, I’ve approved 10 times more renewable energy projects than coal projects – 65 renewable energy projects. I’m the first environment minister to stop a coalmine, because of the impact it could have had on water going on to the Great Barrier Reef … She turned to the Rising Tide protests in Newcastle, and said: Of course, in Australia you have a right to peacefully and safely express your view. But if you’re breaking the law, if you’re endangering others, if you’re diverting police resources, then I think you need to face the consequences of that … O’Neil says government supporting families of Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, also spoke with ABC News Breakfast this morning and was asked about the Australian teenagers Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, who are among six tourists who have died from a suspected methanol poisoning event in Laos. Asked how the government would be supporting both families, O’Neil said: This is an unmitigated tragedy and I’m a parent – it’s a rite of passage for young people to travel throughout Asia and have fun, and it’s just heartbreaking what’s happened here. I really want to extend my condolences to that family. Dfat is working with the two families here and I know we’ll be doing everything we can as a government to support them both in the grieving that they need to do here, and in the work that they’re trying to do to get some of the problems they see that have occurred overseas addressed. O’Neil said the government has “undertaken education campaigns around methanol poisoning” and would continue to “work with the families to see what we can do”. Australia urged to do more on climate crisis as activists rue trillion-dollar Cop29 funding gap Here’s the latest from Adam Morton this morning, who is in Baku for Cop29: The Australian government has been urged to “step up” and do more to address the climate crisis, after it played a role in a contentious deal on global finance to help poor countries deal with the problem. You can read the full story below: Eastern Australia heatwave could strain power grid The early-season heatwave that began searing southern Australia late last week is making its way east, as forecast a few days ago. Inland parts of Sydney, for instance, are in the midst of a week of days with temperatures reaching the 30C. Penrith is expected to reach 38C tomorrow and 39C on Wednesday as the heat peaks. It looks like the power grid will be strained as air conditioners are switched on and stay on. The crunch, for NSW at least, has shifted back to Wednesday from Tuesday. The Australian Energy Market Operator has forecast a so-called level 3 lack of reserve for the state over a considerable period on Wednesday, from 12.30pm Aedt to 8.30pm. “The maximum load (other than interruptible loads) forecast to be interrupted is 1731 megawatts” at 3.30pm, local time, it said. Aemo is seeking a market response. Aemo can intervene if the market doesn’t respond, but it hasn’t set the time for an intervention. It may need to order generators to switch (assuming they can) or seek big power users (eg Tomago aluminium smelter) to switch off. Queensland, as it happens, is also facing some lower level (2) lack of reserve forecasts for stints of Wednesday afternoon. Those alerts from Aemo suggest the northern state won’t have much electricity spare (if any) to sending to its southern neighbour. Growing pushback within Liberal party to social media ban, Nine newspapers report As we reported earlier, several Nationals MPs have raised concerns about the under-16s social media ban, citing potential unintended consequences and the lack of a proper Senate inquiry into the world-first legislation. The Nine newspapers have also reported a growing pushback inside the Liberal party too. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan, one of the first Coalition MPs to raise public issue with the bill, said the “inquiry” into the bill – lasting just a few hours today – was a “joke.” He wrote on X this morning: The ban on social media for under 16s is subject to just a 5 day senate inquiry. It’s a bad joke but I will be at the 3 hour senate hearing this morning from 9am. The hearing will feature witnesses including youth mental health advocates, the Digi group representing tech companies, and officials from the communications department. It begins at 9am and we’ll bring you more when it kicks off. Lambie says fast-tracked Senate inquiry on social media age ban is ‘shameful’ Jacqui Lambie also weighed in on the under-16 social media ban, and described the fast-tracked Senate inquiry as “shameful”. There is a Senate inquiry on that this morning, which is shameful in itself. I mean the bloody thing doesn’t start for 12 months, and yet they’re trying to ram something else down our throats instead of getting it right. So I will be sitting in that inquiry this morning, I’ll be very interested to see the unintended consequences that are coming out of that. Lambie said it was “really quite difficult up here at the moment between the Greens and the Coalition, to be brutally honest with you”. ‘Yes, we’re going to support you. And then a day beforehand says, no, we’re not [going to support you] on certain things.’ I mean, it’s getting beyond the point of ridiculous. I don’t know whether we’ll sit again either in the new year, so if the Coalition and the Greens want to go [away] empty handed and go, ‘well, actually we could have supported this, but we didn’t’ just to make things difficult, then good luck with their votes. Lambie says Senate a ‘mess’ this week Senator Jacqui Lambie says that it is a “mess” in the Senate, as the final sitting week of parliament begins. She spoke on the Today Show earlier, and said: [The government has] just got a list of stuff, you’ve got no idea really what they’re going to list each day. It’s an absolute mess up in the Senate, to be honest with you. But I will say one thing – we need that housing deal ticked off because people need roofs over their heads. So if anything, can they please get that done? Last week, Labor said it was looking at gambling ad response this year Just quickly circling back to Clare O’Neil on RN talking about gambling advertising and the government’s long-awaited response to the Peta Murphy report – she said the government’s plans to tackle gambling ads would come “early next year”. It’s worth recalling that just days ago, communications minister Michelle Rowland – in whose patch the gambling rules sit – said the government was looking at a response this year. What a difference a week makes. Yesterday the lines out of the government were only that the legislation wouldn’t arrive this week. Of course, this is the final sitting week of the year, so no legislation this week means no legislation being introduced into parliament this year – but the government could detail its legislation in a press conference or media release outside of parliament. Rowland unveiled the broad details of the under-16s social media ban, for instance, in a press conference with Anthony Albanese when parliament was not sitting. On ABC Afternoon Briefing on 19 November, last Tuesday, host Greg Jennett asked Rowland: Time is, of course, running out this year. Michelle Rowland, you’ve got this bill to negotiate, social media ban for teens and the outstanding online gambling advertising restrictions. You did promise a, quote, comprehensive response this year. Will that be done by legislation this calendar year? Rowland responded: We are aiming to have it done this year. Jennett went on to ask if it would be legislation, as opposed to codes of practice. Rowland responded: Well, we’ll take advice on that, but the government has made no decisions in this regard. We’ve been consulting widely and it is our intention to reach a conclusion on that as expeditiously as possible. Obviously, this is an area that has been of high concern, but we do want to make sure our response is comprehensive and robust and we get it right. Will Greens block housing bills in the Senate this week? If it comes down to it, are the Greens willing to block these bills in the Senate this week? Larissa Waters said: Well, we’ll now have those discussions about what we should do and what will best help renters and people who are trying to get a roof over their heads. But we’re just extraordinarily disappointed that the prime minister seems to have dug his heels in and won’t help people in the way that they need helping. Greens senator Larissa Waters spoke with ABC News Breakfast earlier, asked about the government’s decision to reject the Greens’ compromises on housing (as Josh Butler flagged earlier). She said that the government has shut the Greens down “at every opportunity”, saying: We came back what we thought was a really moderate offer which would still help about 60,000 people by just funding an additional 25,000 homes, and I’m incredulous that overnight we had the government say that they won’t even do that … I think renters and people who are trying to [buy] their own home will be astounded that it seems like the prime minister’s ego is getting in the way of people having the homes that they need. I can’t quite understand the psychology there. Pocock says Labor’s housing bills are ‘important pieces of the puzzle’ Moving to housing, David Pocock was asked if the Greens should be supporting the government’s legislation. He said most Australians would support what the Greens are proposing in principle – more housing being delivered. But he says the bills are “important pieces of the puzzle”. In a housing crisis, I think we have two bills that are not going to solve everything but are important pieces of the puzzle … These are really good steps forward. And so if the government’s willing to amend the legislation, I think it’s a real goal. Pocock on social media ban: ‘I really support this in principal … but this seems like policy on the run’ On the under-16 social media age ban, David Pocock is still undecided on whether he will support the bill. What more does he need to know? He told ABC RN: I’m keen to see how they propose it’s actually going to work. Again, I really support this in principle. This is something that we have to confront as a society … But this seems like policy on the run … This is a big problem, but we actually need an ecosystem approach. We need a ban to go hand-in-hand with the digital duty of care … And what I’ve seen in the misinformation and disinformation bill, which has now been been shelved, is an unwillingness to actually tackle some of the root causes of social media harm, and that is around the algorithm, where these big social media companies don’t want us to know how they’re actually running their businesses. Asked about the three-day inquiry, and whether you can adequately look into these issues in such a short amount of time, Pocock said: “No, I don’t think you can”. The usual process is that the questions you don’t get to ask, you then put on notice. It’s pretty hard seeing how you get questions back on notice if the committee’s meant to report tomorrow. The independent senator David Pocock says it is “gutless” the government hasn’t brought forward legislative gambling ad changes this year. Asked if it was reasonable that the legislation is too complex to complete this year, he responded: “No, it’s not.” He told ABC RN: This is absolutely gutless from the Albanese government, and it’s a huge win for Peter V’landys and the gambling industry, that really betrays Peta Murphy and and her legacy. As you put to the housing minister, the recommendations were very clear. The work had been done in that report. We know partial bans don’t work. That’s why they were they were advocating for a phased-in ban over three years, and the government seems to have bolted under pressure from the gambling companies and from free TV. Is it really about pressure from lobbying groups? Pocock responded: Well, you just have to look at what’s happening in the parliament in these last two sitting weeks. 400 pages of electoral reform … they’re going to be rammed through both houses of Parliament by the major parties … At the same time, the social media ban, which I really support in in principle, but there’s been no scrutiny of this. They’re willing to have a sham three day Senate committee hearing and just get it through and be able to point to it and say, ‘Well, this is the silver bullet that’s going to solve everything’. So I don’t accept it all … I think both major parties need to be asking themselves on this: who do they actually work for? Who are they sent to this building to work for? O’Neil on the surviving Bali Nine inmates Moving to other news, Clare O’Neil was asked about reports that negotiations between Australia and Indonesia are ongoing regarding the surviving Bali Nine members being repatriated to Australia. O’Neil said she doesn’t have any further information on the negotiations: What I do know is that the prime minister has made a request, as many previous prime ministers have made, that mercy be shown to these young Australians. They committed a horrible crime, a crime that hurt lots of people, and no one should lose sight of that. But [they’ve] now spent 20 years in Indonesian jails, two of them have already paid with their life. So I think it’s absolutely appropriate that the prime minister do as previous prime ministers have done, and advocate for those people who are Australian citizens who are stuck overseas. Does the delay on gambling ad restrictions have anything to do with the demands of lobbyists? Clare O’Neil said it wasn’t about lobbying, but “about making sure that we get this right”. And the minister has pointed to previous attempts to scale back gambling advertising that have actually resulted in more gambling advertising. This is a delicate area, and we’ve got to get the balance right, and that’s what the minister is seeking to do. Gambling ad legislation expected ‘early next year’: O’Neil The government is not planning to introduce legislation around gambling ad restrictions this year, despite previous commitments. Clare O’Neil was asked about this – and why the government can pull legislation together on social media so quickly, but not this, despite the report being handed down nearly 18 months ago – and responded: These complicated matters, they just are. You know, if this was a really simple problem to fix, then it would have been fixed a long time ago. I would say our government deserves credit for stepping up and saying we’re going to take action on this, and the minister [Michelle Rowland] is doing what is appropriate, which is diligently working through what the proposals will look like. O’Neil said the government is “fiercely committed to making sure that this occurs”. The minister is working with people, experts, stakeholders, others who will be affected by this legislation, and the government has said will come forward with … proposals early next year. O’Neil asked if government has failed to find workable solution on housing Q: You’re blaming the Greens for blocking progress on housing, but isn’t this a failure on the government’s part to find a workable solution? You don’t have the majority in the Senate, isn’t getting their approval or the approval of the Coalition part of your job in delivering more houses? Housing minister Clare O’Neil said the government had “tried to work with parties around the parliament to address these issues” – and again accused the Greens of “consistently coming in to back in Peter Dutton’s approach on these things”. O’Neil said the time of negotiation and conversations was six months ago, saying: The Greens are going to go to the next election either as an ineffective party of protests that has blocked and delayed action on things they say are important to them, or a party that lets the government get on with addressing the housing needs of Australia. The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, is speaking with ABC RN about the housing legislation due to go before the parliament this week. She said the Help to Buy scheme would come before the Senate tomorrow, and its second housing bill “a little bit later in the week.” Asked about the Greens’ proposed concessions, which the government didn’t agree to, O’Neil accused the Greens of working with Peter Dutton to “block and delay everything that our government has tried to do on housing”. It is a consistent approach of the Greens … It was yet another political stunt. O’Neil said the government “seriously” looked at the Greens’ proposal and got advice from treasury, but described the proposals as “nonsense” and “unlawful”. One of the proposals put forward would have required me as minister to direct Housing Australia to fund homes that Housing Australia has … looked at and decided not to fund, and that is against the law. That is against the Housing Australia Act. So this is just one of a whole range of serious problems with what was put forward. Is the eSafety commissioner concerned about role of Musk in Trump administration? Julie Inman Grant was also asked about the role that X owner Elon Musk is going to play in the incoming Trump administration? She responded: Well, my job is not to be concerned with what Elon Musk is doing, unless he is hurting the safety of Australians, and that is why we will continue to regulate without fear or favour and to make sure that we’re safeguarding Australians online safety, and that has always been my focus. Julie Inman Grant, the eSafety Commissioner, says it is her role to “enforce the laws”, not endorse, and that the under-16 social media age ban was a matter for the parliament. She was asked about the legislation while speaking to ABC RN earlier this morning, and said: There’s an inquiry happening today, and what I have continued to say is that it’s really, really important that any bill like this is nationally consistent, and that this is just one piece of an interlocking set of provisions – including the digital duty of care that minister [Michelle] Rowland has announced – and the education, digital literacy work that we’ve been doing for years. So all of these need to work in tandem together, and we’ll see what the outcomes of the inquiry are. And of course, we will enforce and carry out what the will of the parliament is. She said it had been an “important national debate”, particularly around the “addictive design features” of social media platforms, and “we understand the ideas behind this”. We also need to make sure that particularly vulnerable and marginalised kids still have a way to connect and to create and explore. So whatever we do, when we implement what will become the law, we’ll try to do this in a way that is really protective of the range of children’s rights, including their ability to communicate and express themselves online. More on the NSW housing announcement: larger proposals to get fast-tracked Continuing from our last post: the rezoning will come into effect on Wednesday and development applications will then be able to be lodged to build new homes. Proposals that are more than $60m will get fast-tracked. The government also has a 3% affordable housing rate for all new developments across the eight stations, though it is higher in some areas. In a statement, Paul Scully said: The finalisation of the TOD Accelerated Precincts means development applications can be submitted and assessed, so that housing construction can start as quickly as possible. Elements of the planning pathway have been streamlined for the assessment of proposals in these locations, which will allow for greater speed without compromising the quality of the assessment or the final result. We made an election commitment to rebalance Sydney’s housing growth around existing transport infrastructure and today we’re delivering the blueprint for those homes. More than 58,000 homes will be built on land around eight train stations across Sydney, according to the New South Wales government, who will today release their master plans for the precincts. Last year, the government announced the rezoning of land within 1.2kms of stations at Bankstown, Bays West, Bella Vista, Crows Nest, Homebush, Hornsby, Kellyville and Macquarie Park, as part of their signature housing policy, called the Transport Oriented Development Program. The program also includes $520m to improve community infrastructure in the areas. Following a six-week consultation period, the planning minister, Paul Scully, will today announce the final plans for each area. He said the rezoning will allow for: 18,000 homes for Homebush, accompanied by new open spaces and active transport links. 6,000 homes in Hornsby plus a new library, community and culture centre and road, walking and cycling upgrades. There are also plans to increase the local tree canopy by “up to 50%”. 4,600 homes in Bella Vista and Kellyville, with new playing fields and active transport links to be created. 14,000 homes in Bankstown, with plans to “encourage the delivery of a new bus interchange” near the shopping centre. 9,600 homes in Macquarie Park, to be accompanied by the creation of 14 hectares of “new and improved parks, plazas and open spaces”. Some 3.15m square metres of commercial floor space will also be opened up, which the government says provides capacity for about 100,000 jobs. 5,900 homes in Crows Nest and new road and public open space upgrades and increased tree canopy. The government has rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the Help to Buy housing bill, continuing the long-running stand-off into the parliament’s final week for 2024. Government sources said the Greens’ demands would be variously unlawful, unhelpful or require spending Labor saw as wasteful. The government is now challenging the Greens to back the Help to Buy bill anyway, still not budging on any demands – with a final vote in the Senate scheduled for tomorrow. Clare O’Neill has today said: This continuous charade from the Greens has to stop. You get the distinct impression the Greens want Australians to continue to be in housing distress, so Adam Bandt can try to harvest those grievances into votes. It’s the crassest form of politics there is, straight out of the Peter Dutton playbook. After initially demanding changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax, among other requests, the Greens last week backed down and gave a revised list of compromises for their support. They included the government funding more homes under the Housing Australia Future Fund within the next year, increasing the number of affordable tenancies under the Build to Rent legislation, and altering settings around Help To Buy. Greens housing spokesperson Max Chandler-Mather said yesterday: The Greens are offering Labor an opportunity to announce the construction of 25,000 social and affordable homes, helping over 60,000 people into affordable homes in the middle of a housing crisis, why on earth would Labor block that? But the government has rejected the updated offer, claiming the Greens’ ideas won’t work and that they would go against legislation banning the minister from making specific funding decisions. The employment minister, Murray Watt, a senior government voice in the Senate, said yesterday that passing Help to Buy was the government’s biggest priority this week. O’Neil said: Consistently throughout this Parliament, the Greens have blocked and delayed action on the housing crisis, looking for every excuse to vote down legislation which is clearly good for the country. The Build to Rent saga continues ahead of the vote coming this week. It remains to be seen how the Greens will vote. Good morning and welcome back to the Australian politics live blog, as we begin the final sitting week of the year. There is a raft of legislation the government is still hoping to pass, with MPs and senators not due to return until February – and possibly not until the other side of an election if Anthony Albanese calls one in late January. So, can Labor pass its legislative agenda? Paul Karp has written this analysis, a must-read for the week ahead. On the Help to Buy housing bill, the government has rejected the Greens’ latest compromise offer to pass the legislation, continuing the long-running stand-off. Josh Butler will have all the details in a moment. The under-16 social media age ban – likely to pass with the backing of the opposition – remains the topic of much discussion after the three-day inquiry only opened submissions for a single day. The eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant spoke with ABC RN earlier and said it was her role to “enforce the laws”, not endorse, and that it was a matter for the parliament. We’ll bring you more of her comments in a moment. And in New South Wales politics, more than 58,000 homes will be built on land around eight Sydney train stations, with the state government expected to release their master plans for the precincts today. I’m Emily Wind and I’ll be taking you through our rolling coverage today. You’ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler, Sarah Basford Canales and Mike Bowers. Let’s get started."

          "bodyText": "“Everything I learn is interesting,” says Vasillis Panayiotaropoulos. “Being here opens the mind.” It’s 7.45pm. The bell has rung in another class and the world of classical Greece beckons for the pensioner who has neatly laid out his pencil case and textbooks on a tiny wooden desk. In his dark suit and polished loafers, Panayiotaropoulos not only cuts a dapper figure in a room whose back wall is spray-painted with graffiti but is by far the oldest pupil attending the second night school of central Athens. At least half of his fellow students are the age of his grandchildren. Nearly 70 years have passed since the bespectacled octogenarian last attended school. “I left at the age of 12 to help my father in the fields,” he says recalling his childhood in a village in the Peloponnese. “But in my mind and soul I’ve always had a yearning to go back. It’s a desire that’s never gone away.” When he turned 80, the former taverna owner told his wife, Maria, a retired seamstress, he was finally going to act on that desire. After almost five decades working as a chef and running his business (“a hard job, a hard life”) in the Greek capital, he walked through the iron gates of the second night school last year. Today he is enrolled in a class that a 15-year-old would usually attend, a thought that makes his face crease into a smile before he breaks into a chuckle. “Ah, to be 15 again,” he says. “I’ve always had this dream to be filled with knowledge but never thought the day would come when I would actually live it.” Panayiotaropoulos’s life-changing decision went viral when as the flag-bearer leading a school parade to mark last month’s Oxi Day anniversary – commemorating Greece’s decision to resist Italian forces and enter the second world war on the side of the allies – he was filmed proudly marching past the Greek parliament. Government officials gathered under a canopy in front of the sandstone building appeared to do a double take as the white-haired pensioner, flanked by two mature female students, marched by. “He was given the honour of carrying the flag because he was the best student in the class,” says Evangelia Pateraki, the school’s headteacher. “He’s extremely diligent and he offers so much to other students. It’s very moving to see people who have not had the same opportunity, who have had to work, come back to school. And it’s also been a lesson. I went and studied abroad, my children went to university and got good jobs. You take these things for granted until you meet those who have not had such possibilities.” In a nation whose population is projected to shrink drastically over the next quarter of a century, the retiree’s decision carries a certain resonance. By 2050, about 35% of the population of Greece will be above the age of 65, according to Eurostat. “In societies like ours where life expectancy is on the rise, it sends a message to people of a similar age that in life it’s never too late,” says Dr Pavlos Baltas, a demographer at the National Centre for Social Research. “But it also helps those of a younger age confront ageism.” The time, he said, had come to redefine “artificial markers” that delineate the ageing process. “The definition of 65 as the starting point of old age is very artificial and we should be rethinking it,” he says. “After all, 65 is the new 75 at a time when we are all living longer.” Greece records an average 70,000 births a year but the annual death rate, at an estimated 140,000, is double that. Declining fertility rates are such that, as in Italy, schools in remote areas of the country have been forced to close for lack of pupils. The father of two daughters who both went to university, Panayiotaropoulos says he “can’t wait” to become a secondary school graduate in June. “My favourite lessons are ancient Greek language and maths,” he says. “There are things, facts that have been a bit jumbled in my mind. For example, I wasn’t sure, before, when the Byzantine empire began or ended. It’s so wonderful to have answers.” Greece’s centre-right government says it is determined to reinforce night schools at a time when elsewhere in Europe they have almost ceased to exist. The country’s demographic problem has been described as “a ticking timebomb” by the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis. “We’re focusing on the needs and requirements of students who graduate from them, as well as teaching staff,” deputy education minister Zetta Makri tells the Guardian. “It’s truly commendable when any adult, at any age, decides to return to a school desk … these dreams, effort and faith deserve every support.” But Panayiotaropoulos, who like so many of his generation in the poverty-stricken 1950s abandoned life in the countryside for the city, neither wants to be seen as a model pupil or as an example to be copied. “The truth is I was always curious and I always loved to read,” he says. “And cafe culture wasn’t for me. But if you want to write that dreams don’t end, that even at my age they can come true, I’ll be fine with that.”"

          "bodyText": "Good morning. Cop29 in Baku finally finished at 5.31am local time yesterday, more than 35 hours after it was due to conclude – and the extra time did not lead to a triumphant outcome. On the biggest issue under discussion, the transfer of climate finance from the developed to the developing world, the headline figure in the agreement was $1.3tn (£1tn) by 2035. But that masked much smaller commitments in direct finance, mostly in the form of grants and low-interest loans, which amounted to only $300bn. Nor is the outcome an injustice whose impact is limited to the global South, of course: if the money isn’t there to support a green energy transition in developing economies, temperatures will rise all over the world. Last night, as negotiators flew home from Azerbaijan, there was clear consensus among developing nations: “$300bn by 2035 is a joke,” one Nigerian delegate said. “We do not accept this.” But with limited leverage to force any change and the Azeri presidency’s gavel down on the deal, it is not obvious what other option there might be, at least for now. Inadequate though the deal is, nothing at a Cop summit is ever final. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s environment editor Fiona Harvey in Baku, is about the significant reasons to view this summit as a failure – and the small seeds of hope that remain. Here are the headlines. Five big stories UK weather | Storm Bert is expected to cause further disruption on Monday after torrential downpours caused “devastating” flooding over the weekend and a major incident in Wales. At least five people have died in England and Wales since the storm hit. Economy | A defiant Rachel Reeves will rebuke critics of her tax-raising budget on Monday, telling disgruntled business leaders at the Confederation of British Industry that they have offered “no alternatives”. CBI director-general Rain Newton-Smith will meanwhile accuse Reeves of jeopardising economic growth, saying: “Tax rises like this must never again be simply done to business.” Britons detained abroad | Families of prominent British prisoners detained abroad have urged the foreign secretary to deliver on pledges to help secure their release with signs of growing resistance from diplomats. There are fears that they are resisting a plan to appoint a special envoy on those detained abroad without a fair trial lest it affect trade deals. Middle East | A Guardian investigation has found that Israel used a US munition to target and kill three journalists and wound three more in a 25 October attack in south Lebanon which legal experts have called a potential war crime. Europe | A little-known, far-right populist took the lead in Romania’s presidential election on Sunday, and will probably face leftist prime minister Marcel Ciolacu in a runoff in two weeks, an outcome that has rocked the country’s political landscape. Calin Georgescu led the polls with about 22% of the vote after nearly 93% of votes were counted. In depth: Why $300bn isn’t anything like enough The strongest point in favour of the deal struck in Baku is that it is better than the alternative – that is, the summit ending without an agreement, meaning no increase to climate finance to the developing world. “It’s terrible,” Fiona Harvey said. “But it is also less bad than nothing.” Carbon Brief has an excellent, exhaustive summary of Cop29’s vexed final days. Tina Stege, the climate envoy of the Marshall Islands, summed up the mood in the most vulnerable countries. “We are leaving with a small portion of the funding climate-vulnerable countries urgently need,” she said. “It isn’t nearly enough, but it’s a start.” Here are some pointers on what the deal looks like. *** How much are developed countries offering? With many world leaders absent from Baku – only 80 heads of state, against 154 last time – there was early pessimism about the prospects for meaningful action. Countries in the developing world had called for $1.3tn a year by 2035 in financing to help them adapt to the consequences of climate change and transition away from fossil fuels. That figure is in line with a target published by the authoritative Independent High Level Expert Group on Climate Finance. And it does feature in the final text. But, as Fiona notes in this analysis piece, the deal says that: The money could come not just in the form of the grants and very low-interest loans that developing countries need, but … from a “wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral and alternative sources”. Money will be “mobilised” rather than provided – a nice distinction that allows for the inclusion of private sector co-investing to be counted alongside public money from government budgets and development banks. The direct commitment from the rich industrialised world is much lower: $300bn. That may be a significant increase on the existing $100bn a year goal, but that was set in 2009 and not reached until 2022, two years after the target date. While it will largely be provided in grants and loans, the text also allows for the counting of private co-investing – and while in practice this will only be a small share of the total, it is viewed by some developing nations as a loophole. There is no allowance for the impact of inflation, further eroding the financing’s real value. Some delegates from rich countries acknowledged the inadequacy of the offer. But they note that the prevailing mood in the west – with the impact of inflation, the war in Ukraine, and the impending Trump presidency among other political and economic crises – is not conducive to a more ambitious figure. “In their defence, for developed countries to be able to stump up this cash requires them to sell it to their people,” Fiona said. “And even though most people in most countries want to see serious climate action, the success of right-wing parties at the ballot box makes it very difficult to achieve. We’re living in an Alice in Wonderland situation in which almost everyone agrees what is good for the planet, and yet the people who disagree are in the ascendant.” *** Why is the money important? Headlines about billions in commitments from wealthier countries may understandably lead to a perception that this is about charity, or reparations. But while it is true that some of the money will be spent on protecting people living in the global South from the worst impacts of the climate crisis, a large proportion of the finance provided will be spent on transitioning to green sources of energy like solar farms and wind turbines. That means it is also crucial to blunting global temperature rises that will ultimately devastate western economies and lives as well. As UN secretary-general António Guterres put it: “Finance is not a handout. It’s an investment against the devastation that unchecked climate chaos will inflict on us all.” *** Is $300bn a year a fair figure? Absolutely not. As much as $300bn sounds, it is about 10% of what is invested in global energy infrastructure each year. And even the $1.3tn overall figure falls well short of any just accounting of which countries did the damage. An LSE study last year estimated that countries in the global South would be entitled to about $192tn by 2050 on the basis of the share of the global “carbon budget” consumed by the global North. “If there was any justice in the world, developing countries would be receiving many trillions a year from the countries that emitted so much for so long,” Fiona said. Meanwhile, many of those same nations are paying huge sums in debt service that severely hamper their ability to invest in climate mitigation projects – $443.5bn in 2022, with China now the world’s biggest bilateral lender even as it is responsible for about a third of the world’s current emissions. Any concept of reparations is off-limits at Cop summits, considered unachievable and likely to close down negotiations – which adds to the sense of injustice in the developing world. As Samoa’s natural resources minister Cedric Schuster asked: “Is this how we treat the countries with the moral high ground in the process, who stand to lose the most and have already lost so much?” *** Is it enough? That’s a slightly different, and even more complicated, question. “The estimate of the core finance needed to leverage other forms of investment provided by the high level expert group was about $300bn a year,” Fiona said. “That would need to come with about $500bn a year from private sector investment, and the remainder would be new forms of finance – a whole mixture of things, from carbon trading to taxes on fossil fuels and frequent flyer levies.” In theory, $300bn could be enough to kickstart that wider investment and get somewhere close to the overall figure. But there are reasons to be sceptical. Individual countries have not yet been required to set out their national commitments towards meeting the overall goal, and past experience suggests that they will probably fall short. Meanwhile, new taxes and private sector investment need to be widely introduced to be effective, and are vulnerable to local political and economic crises. “None of it really exists yet,” Fiona said. “A lot of these things are not that difficult to put in place, and it is very important to keep talking about things like a modest wealth tax so that it is understood as a reasonable idea. But there is a danger that they will be pie in the sky.” *** Are there any grounds for optimism? You can find some, but they’re pretty scant. The deal at least reaches the $1.3tn figure in theory, and developing countries have secured a commitment to a “roadmap to 1.3tn” that will act as a yardstick for future progress. And although carbon markets have failed in the past, new rules agreed in Baku could do a better job of funding climate mitigation projects and capping emissions, as Patrick Greenfield explains here. Meanwhile, one major source of anger at Cop29 was how the summit was managed by the Azeri hosts, who were widely viewed as falling short. The next round is in Belém, Brazil, where there are hopes that the organisers will prove more effective. “They wanted a relatively straightforward Cop focused on national plans to reduce emissions,” Fiona said. “Now they have to clean up a bit of a mess.” It is also true that the Baku summit was in danger of failing totally – leading to the collapse of the least-bad mechanism available for international cooperation against the climate crisis. Angry though many developing nations are, they will already be planning for how to improve the outcome next time. But even these slim pickings should be seen in the context of the real-world impacts that are already being felt, and sometimes seem very remote from officials hammering out the fine details of a diplomatic text. As things stand, most climate scientists consider the goal of limiting temperature increases to 1.5C above preindustrial levels as already out of reach. Even if every country on earth honoured their current commitments, the world would warm by about 2.7 degrees. “If countries don’t have serious commitments to keeping below 1.5 in Belém, we will be toast,” Fiona said. “It will be too late.” What else we’ve been reading It’s always weirdly satisfying to learn what great chefs, like Abby Lee pictured above, eat when they’re off duty, and Saturday magazine’s cover story – with great pictures by Jay Brooks – more than does the job.

          "headline": "Enforced return to office leads workers to seek new jobs",
          "bodyText": "Recruiters have received a surge in job applications from disgruntled workers at companies that are removing employees’ flexibility over where they work after a flurry of return-to-office mandates were issued by large companies. Two-thirds of recruiters have seen an increase in applicants looking for new jobs who are working at companies that are mandating five days a week in the office, according to a survey. In addition, three-quarters of recruiters said they had seen candidates turn down new roles that did not offer hybrid working, according to the survey of 500 in-house and agency recruiters, conducted in November for the flexible workspace provider International Workspace Group (IWG). Similarly, 72% of surveyed recruiters said companies that do not offer hybrid working are becoming less competitive in the job market. The research comes amid the latest battle between employers and office-based employees over where they carry out their work after the explosion in home working caused by the Covid pandemic. A range of large employers have tightened up their rules on remote working in recent months. Underlining the unpopularity of some of these measures, in one of the more extreme employee reactions, the Guardian revealed last week that staff at the online lender Starling Bank had resigned after its new chief executive called thousands of workers back to their desks. All hybrid staff, many of whom previously attended for one or two days a week, were told by the boss, Raman Bhatia, to be at their desks for a minimum of 10 days each month, despite not having enough space to accommodate them all. Starling is joined by the grocery chain Asda, the accountant PwC, and the Spanish-owned bank Santander in clamping down on remote working. The strictest mandates have been issued by the online retail company, Amazon, which has called its staff back to the office full-time from January. The US technology company Dell has also ordered all its global sales team members to work permanently in the office. The IWG study did not specify which companies the employees hope to depart owing to stricter remote working policies. Many organisational leaders have praised the collaboration and creativity sparked by bringing employees together in offices, whereas many employees appear to have grown accustomed to being able to choose where they carry out their work. More than a third (36%) of white collar workers in roles requiring five-day office attendance said their employer was risking losing its best talent, according to separate research by IWG. Almost half (46%) of these 1,000 workers, surveyed in September, said they were actively looking for a new job that did not require a long daily commute. Mark Dixon, the chief executive of IWG, said: “Flexible working offers further benefits to businesses beyond employee retention. The hybrid model is proven to boost workforce productivity and job satisfaction while also cutting costs significantly.” The requirement for more office attendance comes despite warnings from some economists, including Stanford University professor, Nicholas Bloom, that it could unleash a wave of staff departures. Bloom has predicted that some return to office mandates will be repealed next year, if there is an exodus of talent."

          "headline": "The circus that bought a tiny California town: ‘We’re creating our own Disneyland’",
          "bodyText": "From 10 miles out, the tiny town of Nipton suddenly appears in the middle distance like a mirage: a huddle of lush eucalyptus trees in an otherwise impossibly vast, barren expanse of the California desert. From closer up, the place still feels dream-like. Old west-style buildings, including the Nipton Trading Post and a five-bed hotel built in the early 1900s, dot the community but are shuttered to the public. Other than the freight trains that regularly slice through the edge of town, Nipton is often completely silent. The unincorporated area is home to only about a dozen people, depending on the season, and spans just 80 acres. (“Blink and you’ll miss it,” one of the town’s caretakers says.) But recently, a rotating cast of unlikely characters has started showing up in this seemingly forgotten desert outpost. There were the six acrobats from Ukraine (and one from Russia), who came to practice death-defying stunts in matching uniforms. Then a posse of clowns arrived, staying for two weeks and taking over the historic hotel. A pair of contortionists followed, riding unicycles around in leather jackets and twisting their bodies into inhuman shapes. All of those performers came with the circus. Spiegelworld, an entertainment and circus company based in Las Vegas, bought the entire town in 2022 for $2.5m. This isolated plot of land, roughly an hour’s drive from Vegas and the same distance from the nearest grocery store, is now known as Spiegelworld’s “global headquarters” or, more simply, the “circus town”. “I was totally bewitched by the whole thing,” Ross Mollison, Spiegelworld’s founder, said of his first visit to Nipton. “It was just gorgeous.” Mollison, whose preferred job title is “impresario extraordinaire” (an old-school show business term that underscores he’s “the guy behind it all”, he says), had characteristically grand plans for his new town. And in the nearly three years since its sale, Nipton has slowly started to transform into the circus haven of Mollison’s dreams. Nipton now functions as both a retreat and a rehearsal space for Spiegelworld circus performers, who filter into the remote town on a regular basis to come up with new acts for Spiegelworld shows in Vegas – and to simply escape from the stage for a few days. In other words, Mollison says: “We’re creating our own little Disneyland.” ‘Summer camp to make a show’ Over the past century, Nipton has been forced to shape-shift many times to survive. The town first materialized just after the turn of the 20th century. Then called Nippeno Camp, it served as both a whistle stop on the railroad between Salt Lake City and Los Angeles and as a gold mining camp for prospectors trying their luck in the surrounding “golden triangle” mining district. Clara Bow, a celebrated silent film actor, was a frequent guest at the sole Nipton hotel in the 1920s (the room where Bow stayed is still marked with a golden plaque). “It is, of course, unnecessary to state that Nippeno is the future metropolis of California,” the now defunct Salt Lake Herald newspaper wrote confidently in 1905. But towards the middle of the century, Nipton languished, hovering on the brink of extinction. In more recent years, the town has changed hands several times; a marijuana company bought Nipton in 2017 with plans to turn it into a cannabis-themed tourist destination. Elsewhere in southern California, other small communities have sometimes been bought up by corporate interests, including the ghost town of Eagle Mountain near Joshua Tree and a tiny settlement called Desert Center. When Mollison finally showed up in Nipton a few years ago, the place felt almost deserted. There was trash heaped everywhere, and the town’s historic buildings were in disrepair. “This place is a dump,” Mollison remembers thinking upon first setting foot there. But he was also thinking about his circus, and the lack of community spaces in modern American life. “With the diminution of religion for many people, there’s nowhere where we go to sing together any more,” he said. “[But] the circus is a real community. We have brought families, or individuals in some cases, to Vegas 15 years ago, who have been there the whole time and have now bought homes and had kids, and their kids are coming and working in the circus.” Many members of that circus community have since ventured out to Nipton, including Max Baumgarten, who describes himself as a comedic actor with “a speciality within the world of clown”. Mollison initially reached out to Baumgarten in the spring of 2023 with an unusual question: will you come up with a comedic performance based on Formula One racing? The show was to be completely created and rehearsed in Nipton over the span of two weeks, then performed in the town’s trading post for a select audience, and finally showcased for one night only in Spiegelworld’s restaurant and bar Superfrico within Vegas’s Cosmopolitan hotel. Baumgarten quickly assembled a team of his “closest clown performer friends” and the group trekked out to the desert. “It was kind of like summer camp to make a show,” Baumgarten said. Each night, the performers bunked together in Nipton’s hotel, and each day they jumped between the town’s different buildings to rehearse their new show. An old schoolhouse built in the 1930s, an unassuming one-room space with a tin roof, was their favorite place to practice; the weathered wooden floor and high ceilings made the building feel like an upscale dance studio – just in the middle of nowhere. As for Formula One-themed props, the group rolled in real tires, brought in boxes of steering wheels and helmets, and built entire sets out of cardboard. Their costumes were inexpensive race car drivers’ outfits from Amazon. For the group’s two performances in Nipton, their invited guests included other circus performers, who drove out from Vegas, and also a handful of local miners, who work in the nearby rare earth mines and some of whom live on the Nipton property in RVs. “Being away from all the distractions, and having that be your only job, with people who are that skilled – you can make so much,” Baumgarten said. Plumbing issues, trash and ‘magic’ But in between the clown shows and the acrobatics and the general glitz and glam that has drifted in from Vegas, Nipton has no shortage of mundane, real-world problems to contend with. Alex and Frank Strebel, a couple from Colorado who now mostly live in Nipton, were hired by Spiegelworld to deal with those issues. On one recent October afternoon, their most pressing matter was the town’s 70-year-old plumbing system, which had suddenly sprung a leak. “We’ve got water – oh no, turn it off, turn it off,” Frank cautioned in a phone call to Alex that afternoon, who was stationed on the other side of the property, as a small geyser of water shot out from a broken pipe. “Guess what: the pipe has a crack in it. It’s fractured.” Alex and Frank have gotten used to patching problems like this one. Before Nipton, the duo were “artists full-time and handymen by necessity”, Alex says, and worked for Spiegelworld in an informal capacity by crafting the occasional prop or circus costume. But now the latter part of their job description has taken center stage. Over the past few years, they’ve removed roughly 350 tons of trash from the property (including old mattresses, toilets and an abandoned boat); fixed the area’s electrical issues; and transformed a sludgy hole in the ground into a pristine pond with a little dock. The ultimate goal has been to turn “magical” Nipton, as signs for the town promise, into an oasis for both Spiegelworld performers and the seasonal miners and other locals who have lived there for longer. Because the town has no local government, if non-Spiegelworld residents have any issues, they typically take them up with Alex and Frank. And while some people have kept to themselves since the circus came to town, others have wanted a front-row seat to the spectacle. One retired long-haul trucker, who often introduces himself as the unofficial “mayor” of Nipton, stops by frequently to help the couple with their renovation work, they said. “[Desert people] are extremely hard workers, because living out in the middle of nowhere is always hard work,” Alex said, sitting in Nipton’s shuttered cafe and saloon after troubleshooting that day’s plumbing issues. “And then most circus people, especially if they grew up in the circus, they know everything – they know how to repair the tents and set them up and fix the costumes.” “So hard work is no stranger to either party,” Frank added. With Frank and Alex’s help, the next major phase of work in Nipton will involve revamping the hotel and a cluster of metallic, mid-century trailers that line the town. Spiegelworld aims to open some of those accommodations to the public in late 2025. In total, the company said it plans to invest at least $20m into Nipton. Once a gold rush town and then merely a neglected, dusty exit off the freeway, Nipton has since been reborn as “the heart and soul” of the circus, Mollison said. Still, years after buying it, he feels no great pressure to define what, exactly, his “circus town” might look like in a decade – or another century – from now. “Especially when your life is putting on shows or running restaurants,” he said, “it’s nice to just disappear out to the desert.”"

          "bodyText": "A 69-year-old Lithuanian man has been praised for his “extraordinary resilience” after emergency service workers were forced to amputate his leg during a 20-hour rescue operation in remote south-west Tasmania. The man, who remained in a critical condition in Royal Hobart hospital on Sunday evening, had been travelling with a group of 11 tourists on a multi-day rafting trip on the remote Franklin River. He slipped on a rock while walking beside the river and became trapped, partially submerged, in a crevice for close to 20 hours. Mitch Parkinson, an intensive care flight paramedic with Ambulance Tasmania, was among the first people on the scene. He said it was “the most challenging case that I have ever taken part in”. “This was an exceptionally strong and resilient man and he maintained that throughout the night,” Parkinson said. “Our efforts were to keep him warm as best as possible, to keep him fed and watered as much as we could.” Meanwhile, rescuers continued in their attempts to free him. One of the two surf lifesavers who worked to free the man, Ace Petrie, said when he first reached the man, he was submerged from chest down in fast moving water. “He had a little bit of broken English,” Petrie said. “When we tried to pull his leg out, he would say ‘oh, my leg is broken’. Apart from that, we couldn’t take his mind off the situation and talk to him about his family. That was really hard. “He was wedged like an hourglass. He had his knee trapped in rocks in a deep section of that rapid. There were a number of hazards that we had to work around to gain access to the patient.” The water level dropped as the operation continued, but not nearly as much as emergency services personnel hoped for. Petrie said he did everything he possibly could to free the man. This included using ropes and pulleys. Eventually, the team used airbags and hydraulic tools to try to shift the submerged rocks that were pinning him. “These machines have a capacity of 50 tonnes, but we were not budging these rocks at all,” Petrie said. “This went on for about 10-12 hours of different scenarios.” Sign up for Guardian Australia’s breaking news email Const Callum Herbert from Tasmania police said: “This rescue was the worst case scenario of the worst case scenario. “He could not be physically removed and every available angle to try and manipulate him out, and every resource possible was used before the amputation,” Herman said. Radio signal was so poor in the region that the Maritime Safety Authority needed to dispatch a jet from Canberra, which acted as an intermediary between the rescue staff on the ground and helicopters in the region. “The focus of the entire evening was ensuring that [amputation] was the absolute last resort,” Parkinson said. “There was an understanding that every conceivable single effort had been made. This was not a discussion or decision that was made lightly.” Parkinson said the man’s Lithuanian friends helped to supply him with hot drinks and meals during the entire time he was stuck. One of the ten people who were rafting with the patient was a doctor in Lithuania, who was able to communicate with him as a translator. Through him, the trapped man was informed that amputation was the only option. Petrie said those conducting the rescue, including himself, had put their own lives at risk during the rescue operation. “We do train for these type of scenarios, but this one was out of the box,” Petrie said. Emergency personnel have worked with diplomats to reach his family overseas, to keep them informed. On Sunday evening the man remained in a critical condition in hospital."

          "bodyText": "The photographer Andrew McConnell first went to Kazakhstan in 2015, to witness what the Earth’s primary space portal looked like on the ground. A particular corner of the remote steppe-land, near a village called Kenjebai-Samai, was where, every three months, astronauts and cosmonauts on the International Space Station fell to earth, having been launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome 400 miles to the south. McConnell had spent much of the previous years working in war zones and was keen to focus on something more life-affirming. He discovered a curious landscape that was both on the frontier of human exploration and unchanged for centuries. Over a dozen visits in the subsequent years, McConnell became used to the rhythm of the landings. He would sleep out on the steppe in a tent with the ground crew of the Russian space agency; on hearing the explosion that heralded the capsule separating in the sky above, they would drive out over the wasteland to meet it as it landed – a vehicle no bigger than a family car. Over time McConnell became at least as fascinated by those who assembled to watch the spacecraft descend. “On each visit I would stay in Kenjebai-Samai or explore further afield,” he recalls. “The steppe, which at first appeared as a boundless void, would over time reveal unexpected details. I found a people largely uninterested in the space travellers and yet somehow bound up in this strange ritual.” He took this picture of one of the village boys, called Roman, at a waste tip in the district in 2018, where he had come to collect scrap to recycle. In McConnell’s book, Some Worlds Have Two Suns, the images of astronauts and their mission are juxtaposed with those of local Kazazh nomads in the moonscape of the steppe. Some Worlds Have Two Suns by Andrew McConnell is published by Gost (£60)"

          "bodyText": "Some people train their whole lives to earn a Guinness World Record. For others, picking one up is a happy accident. After all, the more than 40,000 records currently maintained by Guinness run the gauntlet from fastest marathon (an impressive 1hr 59min) to the largest number of hotdogs eaten in one minute (six, including the bun). So what motivates someone to pursue a world record – and what happens to your life after you get one? To find out, we spoke to five record holders, past and present. ‘Definitely the coolest thing to ever happen to a 10-year-old’ Michelle Boyle – lowest limbo in roller skates For a hot minute in the 1980s, Michelle Boyle was a world leader. Then a child, Boyle held the Guinness World Record for lowest limbo in roller skates, managing to get under a pole raised just 5.25 inches (13.35cm) off the ground. “It’s a pretty obscure, strange thing to do,” she laughs. “But that’s what it was.” Rollerskating was all the rage in the 1980s. One day at the roller rink she would frequent during school holidays, Boyle made a friend who invited her to join her roller-skating team. She did – and before long that team was tackling the Guinness record. She and her teammates each took turns making the attempt in an empty Sydney shopping mall after hours “because the floor there was really smooth”. On one of her last attempts, Boyle – a “very small” human at this point in time – successfully limboed at the record height, a feat a few of her teammates equalled that day. A Guinness adjudicator was there to verify her attempt and Boyle remembers the nod they gave her after she successfully went under without knocking the pole. “It was definitely the coolest thing to ever happen to a 10-year-old,” Boyle says. Her parents took her to McDonald’s on the way home to celebrate and the mayor of her local council presented Boyle with her Guinness certificate at school. Being a world record holder, however, has not had a particularly lasting impact on her life. “I’d like to say that I went on some kind of motivational speaking circuit or something like that. But, no, I didn’t,” she says. “It really put me up there in terms of coolness at primary school for the next couple of years. Then I got to high school and I aged out of limbo roller-skating, because it’s not something you can really do once you hit puberty.” Boyle didn’t really skate again until Covid lockdowns, when she bought a pair of inline skates for a cheap thrill. Now it’s just a fabulous party tale, perfect for rolling out after a few drinks. “It’s just a feel good 80s story, really, isn’t it?” ‘I could hardly imagine a better adventure’ Chris Turnbull – fastest run from Perth to Sydney It takes 41 hours to drive from Perth to Sydney. To run it, it took Chris Turnbull 39 days, eight hours and one minute to run between the two cities. As the 40-year-old ultramarathon runner tells it, he didn’t explicitly set out to smash the Guinness World Record in 2023. Turnbull really just wanted to tick off the 3,856km run because it seemed like a cool challenge. “It was really more about an interesting way of experiencing Australia, seeing the sites, meeting the people – as well as seeing how fast I could do it,” he says. Turnbull spent about four months in endurance training and logistical preparation to get ready for his run across Australia’s most remote stretches. When he set off, he was joined on his journey by crew cars, who carried food, water, camping supplies and satellite phones. He ran for an average of 13 hours a day, with no rest days, his alarm going off at 4.30am each morning. He had dodge passing trucks on the way, as the sealed highway was the only manageable terrain on which to run. Turnbull remembers the mix of fulfilment, relief and satisfaction that came over him when he saw the ocean at Manly Beach finally come into view. Overwhelmed with emotion, he “sat down on the stairs of an apartment block and burst out in tears”. Turnbull stayed there and cried for about a minute, took another five to compose himself, then got up and ran the final few hundred metres to the finish line where friends, family and news crews were waiting to greet him. He was sprayed with some celebratory champagne then promptly “just laid down on the ground”, before heading off to the pub. But it was a long road back for his body. Turnbull couldn’t sleep when he first got home – his limbs in too much pain to allow it – yet battled a waking fatigue so intense it was also difficult to get out of bed. He dealt with both nerve damage and muscle atrophy in his first months after finishing. Between training and the run he’d lost 8kg. And he had significant sun damage on the left side of his body, where the sun hit every day (the only way to describe it, he says, is “lizard skin”). All told, it took about six months for his body to get back to normal functioning – though Turnbull has now returned to running a comparatively easy 24km a day, to and from his job as an engineer. But it sure was an interesting experience. “I could hardly imagine there being a better adventure,” he says. “It was incredible. I have the most intense and vivid memories of things so different from normal life. I went there for a lifesize adventure, and absolutely got it.” ‘Changed my whole world’ Anthony Kelly – most arrows caught by hand in one minute (and about 60 more) Anthony Kelly was watching the 1985 movie The Last Dragon when he had the idea that changed his life. In that film, a karate student is tasked with catching an arrow with his bare hands. Kelly, a martial artist who often did demonstrations like “board-breaking or smashing concrete with my head”, felt inspired to try and catch an arrow himself. So he decided to attempt the feat at the Chinese restaurant in his home town of Armidale in 1991. “It blew out a lot bigger than I anticipated – the local news, the TV, everyone came down,” he recalls. “I ended up catching a few arrows and sent the footage over to Guinness … I thought they may be interested in it as a world record.” They were – he was flown out to Madrid six weeks later to catch arrows again at a Guinness event. Becoming a record holder “changed my whole world”, Kelly says. He went from never having been overseas to regularly travelling the globe to tackle other agility-based records. The profile Guinness gave him has led to martial arts demonstrations on the TV show Mythbusters and work as a forensic martial arts specialist in a murder case for the New South Wales police force. Along the way, he’s become friends with other world record holders, including the most pierced lady in the world (“who I speak to on a weekly basis,” he says). Kelly now teaches martial arts for a living. Since that day in 1991, Kelly has attained over 60 further Guinness World Records, including most paintball bullets caught in two minutes (11) and most spears caught underwater in one minute (10). (He’s also bettered his own original record for most arrows caught by hand in one minute, taking it up to 17.) “It just kept going and going and going,” the now 60-year-old says. “It’s not about catching something, but it’s about setting a goal to achieve a specific thing in life.” But there have been some failures along the way as well. One time, while he had a Guinness adjudicator around to oversee another record attempt (the largest human wheelbarrow race, with 1,554 participants), he decided to tackle the title of most Ferrero Rocher chocolates eaten in one minute. Kelly didn’t bother practising ahead of time because he figured it would be easy to smash the current record of three. He was wrong. “After you eat one, you have to clear your mouth, open your mouth, show the adjudicator, and then start the second one,” he says. The chunky almonds in the chocolate, he remembers, slowed him right down. With TV news there to capture his big moment, he managed only three – failing to better the record. Kelly gave the large boxes of leftover chocolates he had bought, expecting to eat, to some schoolchildren who’d come to watch. The chocolates came with a word of hard-won advice: “If you’re ever going to go for a world record, make sure that you practise first.” ‘It’s pitch black down there, and you’re just sinking alone’ Ant Williams – deepest dive under ice Ant Williams was working as a psychologist for athletes involved in high-risk sports such as speed skiing, base jumping and moto GP when he had an epiphany: “I was a total fraud. “I hadn’t done any sport … yet here I was teaching the world’s best how to tear down a racing track faster, or ride big waves, but it was all from a textbook. “I decided that I needed to gain some lived experience.” So Williams did what any dedicated professional would do: took up free diving so he could understand what it’s like to put your body on the line. That was in 2001. By 2019, Williams had become so successful as a competitive free diver that decided to go for the Guinness World Record – not just for deepest free dive, but deepest free dive under ice. He travelled to Kirkenes in far north-eastern Norway to go for the record, joined by a support crew. “It was one of the warmer days when we arrived, -36C,” Williams remembers. It took nine hours to cut a hole in the ice on a frozen lake. Once the hole was ready, he had to get out of his snowmobile and into the water within one minute, otherwise he risked hypothermia. Williams then had to retrieve a flag that had been dropped 70 metres beneath the water by the crew to secure the record. The total dive time was only about two minutes and 40 seconds – but it was a terrifying couple of minutes. “Once you go into the ice water it’s pitch black down there, and you’re just sinking alone, freefalling by yourself,” Williams says. So the feeling of successfully snatching the flag and getting back to the surface was more one of relief than anything else. He has since launched a career as a keynote speaker. The glory of the record, he says, has “opened a few really nice doors for me”. But the biggest perk of the title was closer to home. “At the time, my daughter was 10. She comes home from school one day and she goes, ‘Oh my God, Dad, I was at the library today with all my friends and you were on the inside cover of the Guinness World Record book. All my friends just freaked out!’ So that was a really lovely moment.” ‘I’m going to be the record holder as long as I am on this Earth’ Omkar Palav – fastest time to type the alphabet with nose Omkar Palav isn’t an extreme athlete or a brazen daredevil. He’s an IT worker who, by his own description, “is very good at typing”. For years, Palav had dreamed of claiming a Guinness World Record. He found appeal in the idea of having secured a clear, tangible achievement. So he started looking for a record he could claim without risking life or limb, and eventually set his sights on becoming the fastest person to type the alphabet using their nose. After a lot of practice – the trick is memorising where each of the keys are located, he says – Palav did just that. On 20 July 2024, he managed the feat in 20 seconds and 51 milliseconds at a community centre in Adelaide. He hasn’t had long to bask in the glory – there are other nose typists already plotting their own attempt, so Palav is planning to try and beat his own record soon so that he can retain the title. “I’m going to try to be the record holder as long as I am on this Earth,” he says. Because the effort is worth it: “It’s not very easy to achieve. [But] achieving that gives inner happiness.”"

          "headline": "Islamic State is primed to be thorn in the side of incoming Trump administration",
          "bodyText": "Amid a presidential campaign with foreign policy discussions more focused on the wars in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon, the Islamic State stayed under the radar while calling on supporters and operatives to attack Americans on election day. The FBI thwarted a serious plot in Oklahoma City only weeks before the vote, prompting a similar public reaction to news involving the terror group that has become customary of late: is the Islamic State a renewed threat? But the reality is that the terror group has always been one to watch. For the last few years, since the fall of its so-called caliphate, IS was forced to reimagine itself and rallied by restructuring its cells in Europe and reinforcing strongholds in Afghanistan under the banner of the very busy Khorasan (ISKP) branch, and another in Somalia among others. Now IS is primed to be a major thorn in the side of the incoming Trump administration and wants to be active this holiday season, as it has in years past. In the depths of its chatrooms on Rocket.Chat, its chosen encrypted communications platform, IS talk of operations in the west has spiked as Christmas and Thanksgiving approach. “For the brothers interested in stealing a car and using it in the next attacks,” wrote one IS operative in November, with a YouTube link explaining remote carjacking techniques. Vehicle-ramming has been a hallmark of IS operations, including the 2017 attack on London Bridge and another on a Berlin Christmas market (which involved a stolen truck) in 2016. The terror group recently posted other manuals, one which urged the use of civilian drones as weapons. A flurry of graphic propaganda images in October and November also beckoned followers to act. One image had the slogan “target them in their temples” with a knife and a Catholic church in the background, while another featured a Christmas tree and the barrel of what appears to be a Kalashnikov rifle and a hand grenade as an ornament. Lucas Webber, a senior threat intelligence analyst at Tech Against Terrorism, said there was a “heightened [IS] threat to the west during the holiday season”. “ISKP has begun setting the information space by releasing threatening propaganda images depicting one of its fighters holding a gun beside a Christmas tree, another urging supporters to follow European terrorists who had conducted recent attacks in Europe,” he said. Though the amateurish IS imagery might suggest unseriousness, there is more than ample reasoning to take the threats very seriously. ISKP carried out a lethal attack on a Moscow theater in March that brutally killed 145 people. Afterwards, the terror group vowed to bring the same level of carnage to an American target. It then released a poster featuring the US Capitol building and the message: “You are next.” Webber said recent plots involving Somali IS planners show the group has multiple, international vectors of attack. “The Islamic State’s Somalia branch has been linked to plotters in Sweden, for instance, where the branch’s leader lived for a time,” he said. “IS-Somalia was likewise linked to a bomb plot in Italy.” But the US and its political significance is never far from the brains of IS planners. President-elect Donald Trump, who in a televised event announced the killing of the IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019, is a common topic of online discussion among its followers and operatives. One IS supporter on RocketChat brought up the assassination attempts on Trump this past summer, which he called “lazy”, hypothesizing about the potential for future opportunities. “I believe if somebody is dedicated and smart enough he could do it,” the user went on. “Intelligence and security are human, they can make a lot of mistakes … It was that easy.” “Hopefully one of them is successful,” said another user. IS was a constant talking point for Trump during his first campaign, accusing then president Barack Obama and his administration as being the “founder” of IS who then failed to stop it. Once Trump did take power it was, in the end, his Pentagon that led an “anti-IS” coalition that ultimately eliminated the group’s land holdings in Iraq and Syria. He also sanctioned the 2017 dropping of the “mother of all bombs” on IS fighters in Afghanistan. Now, years later, IS is once again on the march as Trump takes office for the second time. Colin Clarke, director of research at the Soufan Center, believes of all the terrorist organization’s chapters, ISKP will be foremost in the minds of American intelligence officials. “[Right] out of the gate, the threat posed by ISKP should be at the very top of the Trump administration’s priorities in terms of counter-terrorism,” he said. “ISKP remains determined to strike the west, and would love nothing more than to launch a high-profile attack in the United States.” Clarke continued: “From day one in office, Trump’s counter-terrorism advisers must focus on the threat posed by ISKP external operations. This means looking at ISKP wherever the group operates, from south and central Asia to Turkey to Europe, working closely with other allied intelligence services to share information.” Clarke did say that some of Trump’s national security appointments could potentially antagonize intelligence workers in the US government who are at the forefront of tracking IS, which would be a “poor way to begin his second term”. “The intelligence community, including the CIA but also others, are the first line of defense in protecting the US homeland from groups like al-Qaida, Isis and their various affiliates and branches worldwide,” he said."

          "headline": "Unseen Barbara Hepworth letters reveal ‘recipes’ for sculptures – and her high standards",
          "bodyText": "Barbara Hepworth’s stone and bronze sculptures are recognised around the world for their distinct, curved forms. The oval alabasters and gleaming bronzes, punctured with holes and lozenge-like gaps, were all made in contrasting tones and surfaces, creating a new aesthetic. Now, Hepworth’s previously unseen letters to the London foundry owner who made many of her bronze pieces offer a revelatory new guide to her work. The bundle of letters and draft sketches, which cover a decade of work and will be sold for the first time this week, also reveal the exacting standards of this pioneering woman, hailed as one of Britain’s most important artists. Many of the instructions make it clear how deeply involved Hepworth was in the casting procedure, caring not just about the final look of the metal, but also the precise angle of balance. “These details will be fascinating to read, but also very useful to the people looking after her works,” said Michael White, a professor of art history at the University of York, who worked with the Hepworth Wakefield museum on setting up the Hepworth Research Network. “We’ve already learned from her notes how attentive she was to the colours, something some Hepworth scholars may not know. She aimed at a wide range of shades and effects, with slight variations,” said White. “It would be lovely if whoever buys these documents could make them available to academics and researchers. “Art historians are sometimes too remote from the making process. The museum in Wakefield has a store of studio notes that read almost like recipes for creating the correct patination. The new letters will show how she used these in her instructions for specific work.” Hepworth, born in 1903, was part of a groundbreaking British artistic moment. Her work gained status in the 1940s and 50s alongside that of the sculptor Henry Moore and painter Paul Nash. In 1949, she moved with her husband, the artist Ben Nicholson, and three children to Trewyn, a house and studio in St Ives, Cornwall. She died there in a fire in 1975 at the age of 72. The property is now run by Tate as a museum and sculpture garden. The annotated sketches and correspondence up for sale on 26 November at Chiswick Auctions, west London, are dated between 1960 and 1971 and were sent to Michael Gaskin, son of founder of the Art Bronze Foundry, Charles Gaskin, who died in 1969. There are 39 letters and five sketches from Hepworth which will be part of a sale of modern British and Irish art, going under the hammer with a guide price of £15,000-25,000. Hepworth’s early pen and pencil designs for bronzes depict trademark works, each signed and covered with working notes to aid the bronze casting process at the traditional “lost-wax” foundry – known informally as Gaskin’s and established in 1922. The sculptor was quick to point out defects and damage, but was always polite when dealing with the artisans who helped her create her influential work. Writing to Michael Gaskin in March 1962, after an unsatisfactory result on a bronze, Chûn Quoit 2, Hepworth writes: “Please do not say you have failed: On Chûn Quoit 2 the back to front stance was excellent but does not lean quite so much over the right. I enclose a photograph of the plaster which might help you adjust the near straight line on the right hand of the sculpture which is running slightly vertical. The join at the bottom was excellent and please do not think me unappreciative.” In November 1971 the artist wrote to Gaskin with news that a bronze in Japan “is in a very poor state as regards to patina”. She adds, “I had always thought Japan as a clean country, but all my bronzes were returned in a very black condition. Would it be possible for you to re-patinate this cast for me sometime soon …?” Hepworth liked the softness of alabaster, a property that allowed her to create a fluid line and then add a detailed finish. She experimented with other materials, though, working in slate as well as in bronze and, as she wrote, “always remaining constant to my conviction about truth to material”. “The bronze casting process is complex right through to final finish,” White said, explaining that Hepworth came to love it when she brought in both carving and casting. She took to producing plaster models at the same scale as the final bronze, which she could then carve. This went against the custom of making a small “maquette” version that would then be enlarged. The archive has come from a relative of Charles Gaskin, and the cache of letters – which also includes 31 from Hepworth’s secretary and 24 carbon copy letters from the family’s Art Bronze Foundry – has been catalogued for sale with the help of a trustee of the Hepworth estate. “Conservators, in particular, will be looking at the descriptions of colour,” said White. “They are often unsure whether they should take it back to the original, or whether an aged effect was something Hepworth wanted.” • This article was amended on 9 December 2024 to include the detail that the archive of Barbara Hepworth letters has come from a relative of Charles Gaskin; a previous version referred only to the seller being “a collector”."

          "headline": "Seoul says Russia sent air-defence missiles to North Korea in return for troops",
          "bodyText": "Russia has sent air defence missiles and other military technology to North Korea in return for the deployment of troops from the North to support the Kremlin’s war in Ukraine, intelligence officials in South Korea have said. The shipments were the latest expression of a deepening alliance that allies and enemies fear could fuel the escalation of the war in Ukraine, geopolitical tensions in Asia, and potentially even global nuclear arms proliferation. North Korea’s dispatch of troops to fight against Ukraine and weapons from its vast stockpiles has been repaid with Russian oil and advanced military technology, experts believe, although neither side has commented publicly on the practical details of their alliance. As a sign of how important the relationship is to Pyongyang, one of the country’s top generals has been deployed to supervise more than 10,000 men now fortifying Russian lines in the Kursk region, the Wall Street Journal reported. Their numbers could grow. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, has said up to 100,000 North Korean troops could join the battlefield, without giving further details. When Joe Biden authorised Ukrainian troops to use the US-made Atacms missiles to hit Russian territory this week, the decision was in part a response to the arrival of North Korean troops there, US officials said. Russia responded to the first use of Atacms inside its borders by denouncing Biden’s decision as escalatory, then striking the Ukrainian city of Dnipro with a new, nuclear-capable missile that underlined its own capacity to escalate. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Valerii Zaluzhnyy, formerly the country’s top general, warned this week that North Korean troops fighting beside Russians should be recognised as a sign that the war in Ukraine had already spilled over national borders. “We can absolutely assume that world war three has begun,” Zaluzhnyy told an awards ceremony in Kyiv, the Ukrainska Pravda newspaper reported. “The reason is that in 2024 Ukraine is no longer facing Russia. Ukraine is facing soldiers from North Korea. Let’s be honest. Iranian-made Shaheds [drones] are killing civilians in Ukraine.” In a TV interview on Friday, South Korea’s top security adviser, Shin Won-sik, suggested the Kremlin’s technology and aid was “payment” for the deployment of more than 10,000 North Korean troops to Ukraine. Experts believe North Korea has been promised military technology ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, and possible security guarantees from Moscow. “It has been identified that equipment and anti-aircraft missiles aimed at reinforcing Pyongyang’s vulnerable air defence system have been delivered to North Korea,” Shin, the national security adviser to the South’s president, Yoon Suk Yeol, told the broadcaster SBS. North Korea is thought to be eager to bolster air defences after it accused South Korea of using drones to drop propaganda leaflets over the capital in October. Shin did not offer details of how intelligence officials had confirmed the arrival of Russian military support, and North Korea and the Kremlin have not commented on his claims. The US and South Korea are concerned about possible transfers of Russian nuclear and missile technology to the North, which has continued to develop a nuclear arsenal in defiance of decades of UN-led sanctions. In June, Vladimir Putin travelled to Pyongyang to meet the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. They signed a mutual aid agreement that obliged both countries to provide military assistance “without delay” in the case of an attack on the other. The leaders are thought to have agreed to cooperate to oppose western sanctions targeting Russia and the North’s ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programmes. China, North Korea’s neighbour and longstanding economic and political backer, has not directly commented on the North Korean troop deployment to Ukraine or Moscow’s embrace of Pyongyang. However, a series of subtle diplomatic moves have indicated Beijing’s displeasure, including in July when the Chinese ambassador in Pyongyang stayed away from celebrations marking the anniversary of the end of the Korean war. China is thought to share concerns that technology transfers to North Korea could fuel regional proliferation, including nuclear weapons, and deepen geopolitical tensions with US allies on its doorstep, particularly Japan and South Korea. A military alliance also means that in theory China could be drawn into the war if North Korean territory is attacked from Ukraine, although currently that seems a very remote possibility. North Korea had also received “various forms of economic support” from Russia in return for its troops and weapons and may have acquired technology for its troubled spy satellite programme, Shin said. Pyongyang claimed it had put its first spy satellite into orbit in November last year after two failed attempts, but experts have questioned whether it can produce imagery that could be useful to the country’s military. Another satellite launch in May also failed. Shin did not say whether Russia had made transfers, and experts believe the Kremlin is unlikely to agree to provide such sensitive technology while the North’s troop deployment alongside Russians is still in its early stages. For now, the bulk of the military aid appears to be moving in one direction. North Korea has sent more than 13,000 containers of artillery, missiles and other conventional arms to Russia since August 2023, South Korea’s national intelligence service said last month. Intelligence officials told parliament this week they believed North Korean soldiers had already seen combat, with some assigned to Russia’s airborne brigade and marine units."

          "bodyText": "We’re winding down the blog now. Negotiations are still taking place over the draft texts, and there has been no announcement of whether we’ll have another set of drafts soon, whether the next text will be the final one, or whether it’s just all on hold till tomorrow. Some are choosing to get a bit of sleep before the potential slog over the weekend. It felt like a busy day but what actually happened? Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said on Thursday night that rich country budgets were stretched amid inflation, Covid and conflicts including Russia’s war in Ukraine, and warned that poorer countries might have to compromise. The UK government pledged £239m to tackle deforestation In an unusual intervention, the UAE stepped in and warned that the world must stand behind a historic resolution made last year to “transition away from fossil fuels” as the Saudis tried to block the language. The draft text was published, but met a pretty hostile reception. It called for $1.3tn by 2035. Civil society called it “an absolute embarrassment” Few countries have spoken up so far, but their reactions have been mixed. The Australian climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has responded to the latest text from the presidency, describing it as a “genuine attempt”. But Amb Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s Special Envoy for chair of the African Group of Negotiators called it as “totally unacceptable and inadequate.” We’re waiting for the next round of texts to emerge and will pick up the story then. If you’re just catching up on events, the impact of the draft text is helpfully reported by my brilliant colleague Fiona Harvey here: It’s worth going back to this piece by my colleague Fiona Harvey for some idea of why this Cop is quite so tricky. Written as we glided in towards the opening day, she explains: Money will be the core focus of Cop29. Under the Paris agreement, countries must agree a “new collective quantified goal” (NCQG) for climate finance, to flow from the rich to the poor, to help developing countries cut their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of the climate crisis. This is something that has never been tried before in three decades of talks. Until now, the only climate finance target has been a promise made in 2009, at Cop15 in Copenhagen, for $100bn a year to flow to the developing world by 2020. That target was only achieved two years late – a delay that damaged the faith of developing countries, according to Alok Sharma, the president of Cop26 in Glasgow and now a member of the UK’s House of Lords. “Not reaching the previous $100bn goal on time sapped the confidence and trust of developing nations, and that’s why any future finance goal has to meet the deliverability test,” he said. No Cop has ever discussed a finance goal before, let alone any tested of its rationale. The $100bn figure was “plucked out of the air”, said Rachel Kyte, the UK’s new climate envoy, speaking before her appointment to the role. The offer was made – largely at the instigation of the then US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton – based on political calculations of what developed country governments thought their electorates would stand for. It’s that unprecedented aim which is one of the reasons this Cop is turning out so tricky. For the Azerbaijan presidency, it was clear from early in the talks that reconciling these two approaches – one based on need, the other on what developed countries are prepared to stump up – means including at least two key numbers in the NCQG. What has emerged from pre-Cop talks in recent months is a “layered approach”. These layers have led some participants to call it an onion, others a camembert (because the sources of cash will be divided up into wedges), while a few prefer comparisons to a pie or a sandwich. However, we’re a few hours away from the supposed end of these talks, and the camembert, or apple, or pie, or sandwich remains, for now, intact. Meanwhile the Azerbaijani energy minister, Perviz Shahbazov, has been talking fossil fuel deals at the Istanbul Energy Forum, my colleague Dharna Noor spotted. Turkey’s energy minister, Alparslan Bayraktar, said on X: “During the meeting, we discussed the possibilities to increase natural gas supply and TPAO’s [Turkish oil company] activities in new fields in the Caspian to further enhance our already intensive natural gas cooperation.” No new fossil fuel production is compatible with net zero emissions by 2050, the International Energy Agency said in 2021. But Azerbaijan is planning to significantly expand its gas production in the next decade. Do as I say, not as I do? There is some sympathy for the host nation Azerbaijan, as they attempt to usher this increasingly acrimonious conference towards some sort of finishing point. But no mercy is being shown by Climate Action Network, the gigantic web of climate groups which awards the Fossil of the day award every day at Cop. They’ve chosen … yes, that’s right, Azerbaijan! Their reasons: Today’s fossil goes to a country that doesn’t understand the gravity of the Presidency, or for that matter the value of civil society. Azerbaijan has fallen short, way short of the leadership needed here, which shouldn’t be that hard given the previous two COPs were hosted by the fossil fuel industry. Their take-it-or-leave-it approach is putting at risk not only the climate finance goal, but also other crucial topics failing to advance human rights-based climate action, such as the Just Transition &amp; Gender Work Programmes. In these decisive hours, the COP29 Presidency must use every chance to bring negotiators back to the table and to secure the transformative outcomes that it had the mandate, and responsibility, to deliver. There is no hope without climate finance, we must move forward here before we reach Belém [where next year’s Cop will be taking place]. Afternoon or evening, depending on where you are. This is Bibi van der Zee, taking over from my colleague Matthew Taylor. Send over your thoughts and suggestions at bibi.vanderzee@theguardian.com. The Alliance of Small Island Developing States says it is “deeply disappointed” by the texts which “basically asks Parties “how low can you go?” on climate ambition. This is unacceptable.” This text will not be adequate to fully implement the Paris Agreement, to truly drive action to hold the 1.5C limit. On the NCQG, the proposed $250 billion a year by 2035 is no floor, but a cap that will severely stagnate climate action efforts. It is an investment goal that stands at a fraction of the at least $1.3 trillion that is needed to effectively protect our world from the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. It does not raise the bar from the previous ineffective $100 billion goal. We cannot be expected to agree to a text which shows such contempt for our vulnerable people. We appeal to the moral conscience of those who proclaim to be our partners to stand with us, give us a hand, do not leave us further behind. For 30 years, SIDS have been bearing the costs and the burden of climate impacts. All we ask is that we are guaranteed and receive the protection that is promised to us under the Paris Agreement. This ask is not a threat. It is just a matter of justice. Tina Stege, Marshall Islands Climate Envoy, says: “It is shameful to put forward texts like these. This package puts small island developing states and the least developing countries first on the chopping block. “When the world ignores the science and stands still on fossil fuels, what we hear is that our futures are being tossed away. We cannot accept that. “On finance, we are offered only a fraction of what the world has spent on war in the past year, and lose everything that we have fought for over the past two years to make that money more accessible to smaller nations. No sub-targets or minimum floors. No definition of climate finance. No clarity or accountability for where the money will come from or go to. She finishes by saying: “It is incomprehensible that year after year we bring our stories of climate impacts to these meetings and receive only sympathy and no real action from wealthy nations. We are not here to tell stories. We are here to save our communities.” Trade unions representatives at Cop29 have weighed in, describing the climate finance goal “as nothing more than a bluff” and “an outcome so inadequate it can be dismissed out of hand”. The Trade Union Non-Government Organisations, known as Tungo, are one of nine UN-recognised NGO constituencies at the summit. In a statement, it said: “At a time when the world needs to be massively expanding climate finance this deal could well scale it back. It sets a goal of $250bn by 2035. Given inflation, this barely even budges the status quo, in real terms. “It leaves the global south with a fraction of the financing the text itself recognises as essential. There are no commitments to public or concessional financing and only a token reference to loss and damage. Crucially, human rights have been stripped out, and workers deliberately omitted.” Following a flurry of [overwhelmingly negative] reaction to the new texts released a few hours ago, we are now waiting for the plenary – where countries set out their formal reaction – to start. My colleagues on the ground in Baku have asked Cop29 officials what the timings might be as this stretches into the evening local time. but are getting nothing back yet. The scientist and chief executive of Climate Analytics, Bill Hare, who has been attending Cops since the 1990s, says there are “massive issues” with the text . He describes the proposed climate finance goal as “incredibly weak”. “I think the presidency will have to iterate more than once now to try and find something workable,” he said. On climate finance, he said the $250bn goal was weak as “any kind of finance can count towards it, and it only needs to be achieved by 2035, which means it’s essentially a ceiling, not a floor”. “It also expands the contributor base to include anything that multilateral development banks fund. It means developed countries are not accepting the responsibility they have. “Small islands and the least developed countries have been sidelined by the Azeri Presidency text. There is no mention of minimum allocations from them - a key ask - no explicit acknowledgement even of their special circumstances, which is already in the Paris agreement and the convention, so a step back to not include here. And perhaps most cruelly is the exclusion of any mention of loss and damage. “The ‘call’ for a broader mobilisation of climate finance from public and private sources including investment is quite weak, being just a call when there needs to be strong direction. “The $1.3tn per year put forward to go to developing countries by 2035 needs to be now and not 10 years time - and would need to be much higher by 2035.” My colleague Dharna Noor has this from Jennifer Morgan, Germany’s climate envoy, on the new texts: ”This is not at a landing ground yet, but at least we’re not up in the air without a map. Lots of work still needs to be done. We‘re working with allies from all around the world, especially the most vulnerable, to ensure an ambitious and fair outcome.” My colleague Dharna Noor has this from Amb Ali Mohamed, Kenya’s Special Envoy for chair of the African Group of Negotiators. Like many others he is furious about the latest text, describing it as “totally unacceptable and inadequate.” On the New Collective Quantified Goal text, he says: “The proposed target to mobilise $250 billion per year by 2035 is totally unacceptable and inadequate to delivering the Paris Agreement. The Adaptation Gap Report alone says the adaptation needs are $400 billion; $250 billion will lead to unacceptable loss of life in Africa and around the world, and imperils the future of our world. Moreover, it is no longer developed countries who are responsible under this formulation. It is rendered as a target for which all countries are responsible and where developed countries are taking the lead. This is unacceptable.” On the Global Goal on Adaptation text, he says: “The African Group of Negotiators reiterates the importance of prioritising adaptation and calls for an explicit decision for the technical and expert teams to finalise the work on the indicators six weeks prior to SB62. We believe that the finalisation of indicators is a party- driven process, and as such parties must be given enough time to consider the work and further the development of indicators. Furthermore, we are not happy with the inclusion of transformation adaptation in the text as parties did not have adequate time to engage on the concept. We are also extremely disappointed that the outcome does not provide a clear guidance on the inclusion of the indicators to track the means of implementation for the adaptation. We call for clear guidance for the inclusion of the Means of Implementation in the final text.” On the Just Transition Work Programme text, he says: “The Just Transition text is unacceptable and lacks balance between domestic and international dimensions of just transitions. Just transition is about fairness, international cooperation, shared prosperity and access to economic opportunities, as well as addressing challenges for the transitions. The Baku decision should effectively respond to the Dubai mandate and scope of just transitions.” A joint statement by Amar Bhattacharya, Vera Songwe and Nicholas Stern, co-chairs of the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Climate Finance, recognises that $250bn from developed to developing countries is “too low and not consistent with delivery of the Paris Agreement”. We welcome publication of the new COP29 Presidency text on the new collective quantified goal on climate finance. It calls on “all actors to work together to enable the scaling up of financing to developing country Parties for climate action from all public and private sources to at least USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2035”. This is consistent with our analysis of the investments and external finance required by developing countries outside China to deliver on the goals of the Paris Agreement. The text also calls on developed countries to increase their financial support for developing countries to $250 billion per year by 2035. This figure is too low and not consistent with delivery of the Paris Agreement. Our analysis shows that the NCQG, based on the components that it covers, should commit developed countries to provide at least $300 billion per year by 2030, and $390 billion per year by 2035. We believe that these targets are feasible and will require stepped up direct bilateral finance from developed countries, much higher ambition on the part of the multilateral development banks, and improved private finance mobilisation. The Australian climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has responded to the latest text from the presidency, describing it as a “genuine attempt”. He said there would be “long and tough conversations” into the night. “I think we’re in a genuinely finely balanced situation.” On the climate finance target, he said: “Any quantum conversation is going to be highly controversial. There has been a strong effort to try to get a quantum that is ambitious and achievable. There is no point in the developed world signing on to a quantum that they just don’t believe they can deliver, so that will be a key issue over coming hours.” Speaking on behalf of the Umbrella Group of wealthy countries in the plenary on Thursday, Bowen was sharply critical of the lack of an explicit reference to the agreement in Dubai that the world needs to triple renewable energy by 2030 and transition away from fossil fuels. He noted there had been changes on this in the latest text. It now says the summit “reaffirms the outcomes of the first global stocktake” - that is, what was agreed last year. “Obviously I’m pleased that there is no explicit backsliding from the Dubai consensus. There are ongoing references to the work of that. I always like to have these things loud and explicit but that will be an ongoing conversation over the course of the evening,” he said. Bowen did not speculate on when Cop29 might finish. He is scheduled to leave tomorrow night to be in the Australian parliament from Monday for the release of a national climate statement next week. Reaction to the latest Cop29 negotiating texts from countries is starting to arrive. Panama’s lead negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, who gave a barnstorming speech yesterday, is absolutely furious: “The $250bn offered by developed countries is a spit on the face of vulnerable nations like mine. They offer crumbs while we bear the dead. Outrageous, evil and remorseless.” It is fair to say the reaction to the new text from civil society groups has been overwhelmingly negative. There are a few more here – some again suggesting developing countries walk away – the key thing now is to hear what countries say. It could be a bruising afternoon. Mariana Paoli, from Christian Aid, said: It is baffling that despite everyone knowing all year that this was the ‘finance COP’, rich countries are still refusing to put substantial enough funding pledges on the table. This is irresponsible, immoral and risks condemning both people and planet. Developing countries would be better walking away from the table than signing up to this garbage. “With hours to go, unless significant changes are made to the text, especially the amount of finance to be provided, developing countries will be left behind. The funding that the global south is fighting for here is a lifeline and will lay the groundwork for climate action over the next decade. Victor Menotti, US coordinator for the Global Campaign to Demand Climate Justice, told the Guardian: “The big thing people are looking for is that quantum, the core of public financing, go up from the 100 billion years ago. Now what we’re seeing, 250 billion, is in current dollars about the same amount of money when you consider inflation and all of that. So it’s something between a joke or an insult…. The trillion is a big number. It’s more than the Pentagon budget. But what’s important is the public resources that are going to leverage that money. Stephen Cornelius, from WWF said: The climate finance text is completely inadequate. It now has a finance target, but it completely misses the mark. The amount is far too low, and rich countries don’t even commit to delivering all of it. This simply will not be good enough, and I expect there will be fireworks when countries meet later. We need a core of public finance closer to US$1 trillion. There is too much at stake for this process to end in a bad deal that doesn’t deliver the necessary finance. This is an investment in our collective future. Dr Vaibhav Chaturvedi, senior fellow, Council on Energy, Environment and Water in India said: The 1.3 trillion USD number is at best a sham. Even the apparent increase in the provision from developed world to developing world of USD 250 Bn USD annually by 2035 is the same as the 100 Bn USD by 2020 if 6% annual average inflation is accounted for. There is no grant or low cost finance component. This is a bad deal for the developing world, irrespective of how it is going to be portrayed by the presidency. In response to the newly released text on climate finance, a senior U.S. official said: “It has been a significant lift over the past decade to meet the prior, smaller goal. $250 billion will require even more ambition and extraordinary reach. This goal will need to be supported by ambitious bilateral action, MDB [multilateral development banks] contributions, and efforts to better mobilize private finance, among other critical factors.” In 2009, developed countries agreed that by 2020, they would collectively mobilize $100 billion per year to support developing countries’ decarbonization and adaptation plans. But the reassurances from the Cop presidency have done little to calm the anger of civil society groups. In response to the latest NCQG text, Laurie van der Burg, Oil Change International global public finance manager, said: This text is an absolute embarrassment. It’s the equivalent of governments handing the keys to the firetruck to the arsonists. The vague $1.3 trillion investment target is not to be relied on and the $250 billion goal is not debt-free. Previous suggestions to end fossil fuel handouts and make polluters pay have all been axed. This amounts to a cop-out for polluters and allows rich countries to dodge their responsibilities by relying on the private sector and even developing countries to cover the bill, creating a debt-trap for countries most vulnerable to the climate crisis. “We know rich countries can pay up the trillions they owe to the Global South by ending fossil fuel handouts, taxing the super rich, and changing unfair global financial rules. We need a dramatic change in direction if we want a fighting chance to leave Baku with a finance deal that can support the fair fossil fuel phaseout that we need to avoid breaching 1.5°C. Namrata Chowdhary, Chief of Public Engagement at 350.org said: The Global North must stop playing poker with people’s lives and pay their overdue debt. We need real leadership—from wealthy nations and the Presidency—to land this deal. If they can’t deliver, they must step aside, because we will not accept a bad deal that fails to meet the moment. As the world watches what should be the final day of this year’s climate talks, the agreement we came here for remains elusive. This new climate finance goal is three years in the making, and the global majority remains leaps and bounds ahead of the governments who are continuing to stall and let progress slip away in the name of profits. But we will not be silenced. At COP29, we hold the line in our demand for more climate finance, not this bare minimum offer. A statement from the COP29 Presidency insists the new text is the result of “an extensive and inclusive consultation process.” Throughout the year, the COP29 Presidency has been pushing for a fair and ambitious new climate finance goal, taking into account the needs and priorities of developing country Parties. We conducted an extensive and inclusive consultation process that extended into the early hours of the morning. We gave all groups the opportunity to react to the package of texts we released yesterday morning and we thank them for their constructive engagement. Taking into account the views expressed during the consultations, and what we heard from Parties at yesterday’s Qurultay, we have now published updated texts. These texts form a balanced and streamlined package for COP29. The COP29 Presidency urges Parties to study this text intently, to pave the way towards consensus, on the few options remaining. As a first reflection of Parties indications the New Collective Quantified Goal decision contains a call on all Parties to work together to scale up financing to developing countries for climate action from all public and private sources to at least USD 1.3 trillion per year by 2035. Further, reflecting the submission of developed country parties, it includes a decision to set a goal in extension of the goal of jointly mobilizing USD 100 billion per year, with developed country Parties taking the lead, to USD 250 billion by 2035 for developing country Parties for climate action. We will further engage with Parties to collectively agree final adjustments to the few outstanding yet important issues. We will continue to work hard, inclusively and transparently, to press all sides for the highest ambition outcome possible. NGOs are fast out of the blocks in reacting to the latest negotiating texts - as countries pore over them line by line. John Verdieck, director of international climate policy at The Nature Conservancy, is concerned about whether the text is clear enough about developed countries’ role as the providers of climate finance. “It’s been a hard-fought week, but this proposed number of at least $1.3tn, with a public floor of $250bn, for climate finance to developing countries shows that negotiators are taking this crisis seriously. Unfortunately, saying that “all actors” have to take responsibility is too ambiguous and could allow wealthy nations to skirt their responsibilities.” While we wait for countries to react, civil society groups are already giving their verdict – and it is not positive. This from War on Want Writing on BlueSky Fadhel Kaboub President of the Global Institute for Sustainable Prosperity and senior Advisor with Power Shift Africa said: Historic polluters offering $250bn by 2035 in poor quality financing (aka economic entrapment &amp; false solutions). #IsItAJoke Global South negotiators bravely walk out. No Deal is Better than a Bad Deal. #PayUp James Murray editor of Business Green Harjeet Singh, climate activist, Cop veteran and with the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty Initiative, is not happy with the latest text on the all-important climate finance goal: It is a disgrace that despite full awareness of the devastating climate crises afflicting developing nations and the staggering costs of climate action - amounting to trillions - developed nations have only proposed a meagre $250bn a year. Trust has been shattered; developing countries must stand firm. Rejecting this is a stand for dignity - no deal is better than a bad deal, especially when it disrespects those bearing the brunt of a crisis they did not create. The text - which came as much of a surprise to many negotiators as it did to everyone else in the conference centre - contains a “quantum” of finance from developed countries which is lower than the sums that the Guardian is aware have been talked of by some rich nations in private. This amount is described in the text as coming from “a variety of sources” - including private finance. At first sight, this might seem a violation of the terms on which developed countries are supposed to be providing climate finance. The “quantum” is supposed to be made of “core” finance, to come directly from the public budgets of developed countries or through multilateral development banks, which are funded mostly by the developed world. Private finance is supposed to come in the outermost layer of the “onion” of finance being talked about here - that is, after the “inner core” of public money and the middle layer of money to come from sources such as new taxes, carbon trading and other innovative sources of finance. So why is private finance being mentioned in the inner core? The explanation is that this is a reference to “mobilised” finance. Mobilised finance is when private companies invest on top of money put in by countries from public budgets. So, for instance, the EU provides $30bn of public finance a year to climate efforts in developing country, and this core funding also mobilises about $7bn a year in co-investment. Because of the way some countries account for their climate finance, it is not possible to separate out the “mobilised” finance cleanly from that provided from public budgets. Therefore the word private is included in this text, but it should be understood in this context as being limited to this “mobilised” portion of finance. The real private finance will still be in the outer layer of the onion - according to some estimates, this outer layer could be worth about $500bn of the $1 trillion or $1.3 trillion goal. It may be possible for the presidency to clarify this meaning further, potentially in a footnote, if developing countries are unhappy that the inclusion of the word private in this portion of the text could be used as a loophole. Hello Matthew Taylor here [I took over the blog just as the new text dropped.] Send any thoughts, nuggets etc to matthew.taylor@theguardian.com Damian Carrington has more on the key phrase “transition away from fossil fuels”. It is now mentioned in one of the latest negotiating texts - but in a pretty convoluted and weak way: “Underscores the multisectoral and multidimensional nature of just transitions and the resultant need for whole-of-economy approaches to just transitions that engage the private sector, including micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, and contribute to the creation of green, decent jobs and recognizes that such approaches include significant socioeconomic opportunities associated with transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems” There has been a big row between the many countries that wanted to include the transition phrase - a key achievement of the Cop in UAE last year. But oil-rich Saudi Arabia and allies have fought to keep it out, to try to sideline the commitment every nation signed up to at Cop28. UEA today said all countries should “honour what they agreed”. My colleague Patrick Greenfield the key will be to watch out for in country reactions. We are waiting for countries to give their formal reactions to the text. Negotiating teams from around the world will be huddled over their laptops going through the documents line by line and checking it against their negotiating priorities. We will start hearing from them in the next hour or so. During yesterday’s five hour plenary, there was a clear split between developed and developing countries in their reactions to the first draft. Developing countries were angry about the lack of target on finance. In the new draft, the $1.3tn that the G77 and China has asked for is in, with a sub target of $250bn for developing countries by 2035, but this might prove unacceptable for countries that want to see far more from the developed world. Developed countries, particularly the EU, were concerned about backsliding on last year’s deal in Dubai, with member states and other countries from the global north demanding that the Baku text reaffirms the landmark deal to ‘transition away’ from fossil fuels. This was fiercely opposed by Saudi Arabia yesterday. We need to give countries a bit of time to digest what the Azeri presidency has prepared. We will bring you the reactions the moment they start coming through. More from Guardian environment editor Damian Carrington. The new text on the all-important finance target “calls for” $1.3tn by 2035. That’s what developing countries asked for, but what kind of finance remains important - grants, loans, private? It “decides” on $250bn for developing countries by 2035 - that’s in the ballpark of the figures that have been frequently mentioned for the “core” funding, though $300bn was at the top end. This might be the start of a haggle. It “invites developing country parties to make additional contributions”. Nations like China and Saudi Arabia will like that - they are still officially developing countries in UN climate talks and very strongly reject any calls to be obliged to contribute. But this is just the latest iteration of the text - let’s see what countries make of it. The new draft text “calls for”: a finance target of $1.3tn by 2035 “Decides” $250bn by 2035, including public and private “Invites developing country parties to make additional contributions” The new draft text has just been published here. Azerbaijani authorities have blocked the website cop29.com, after the URL was acquired by environmental justice campaigners and pointed to a website criticising the country’s hosting of the UN climate summit, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. Any delegates at Cop29 in Baku clicking on cop29.com today were greeted with the following message: “The application you are trying to use has been blocked in accordance with Cop29 policy rules. Please report to information center if you believe this is an error.” It’s no error by the Azerbaijan government hosting the summit. The site was acquired by campaign group Global Witness and leads with the faces of five big oil bosses and the headline: “Fossil fuel companies are destroying the planet for profit. They broke it, they should pay for it.” The site has also been reportedly blocked outside the conference by the authoritarian regime. It remains accessible to those using a VPN to browse the web. “We may never know why Azerbaijan tried to block cop29.com from its citizens and the world’s decision-makers attending Cop29,” says Alexander Kirk at Global Witness. “But it looks like they’re worried about our central message: if you break it, you should fix it, and Big Oil should be made to pay.” Azerbaijan is a petrostate, heavily reliant on oil and gas, which is a “gift from God”, according to President Ilham Aliyev. It is significantly expanding gas production in the next decade, despite repeated warnings from scientists that no new fossil fuels can be exploited if there is to be any chance of keeping global temperature rise below 1.5C. Azerbaijan says the EU has requested more gas, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Global Witness acquired the cop29.com site from an Indian couple who used the domain for their family copperware business – 29 is the atomic number of copper. They were offered a significant sum by Azerbaijan’s Cop29 team for the site, Global Witness said, but the owners were worried about climate breakdown and decided to let Global Witness have it instead. Talks have not yet finished, but already the first Cop29 post-mortem report has rolled in – and it is a bleak analysis. Mohamed Adow, director of the climate and energy think tank Power Shift Africa, has described this year’s UN climate summit as “one of the most poorly led and chaotic Cop meetings ever”. And he lays the blame squarely at the feet of Azerbaijan, the oil and gas rich autocracy that this year hosted the talks. His comments come as negotiations are deadlocked, with no sign of a compromise between the demands of the developing world and the willingness of the wealthy nations to meet them. Adow says developing nations need to be ready to walk away without a deal if the package on offer does not improve. In comments sent in to the Guardian, he said: This COP presidency is one of the worst in recent memory and he is overseeing one of the most poorly led and chaotic COP meetings ever. COP summits are a delicate and precious thing, they require skill and determination in order to progress global climate action and land a successful deal. We only have a matter of hours remaining to save this COP from being remembered as a failure for the climate and embarrassment for the rich world. We need Mukhtar Babayev to get his act together, push countries to actually deliver a global finance goal that will keep alive the target of limiting global heating to 1.5C and not let the world’s developed countries wriggle out of paying their climate debt. The way this COP is going, developing countries are going to have to prepare themselves to walk away from COP29 if the package on the table doesn’t improve. It can and must improve, otherwise no deal. There’s no point accepting a bad deal if it buries climate ambition. Without a strong deal that will provide the trillions needed to tackle the climate crisis, Baku will be known as a global disappointment. No deal is better than a bad deal. Poor countries don’t need to be held hostage in Baku. If rich countries fail to deliver what they owe in climate finance, then they should be forced to come back next year in Brazil with a better plan. You may have missed this speech yesterday, made in the middle of five hours of nations decrying the poor state of the negotiations, but it was a barnstormer, writes Damian Carrington, Guardian environment editor. Juan Carlos Monterrey Gómez, Panama’s special representative for climate change, ripped into both rich nations for failing to offer a number for climate finance and petrostates such as Saudi Arabia for backsliding on last year’s commitment to “transition away from fossil fuels”. He said: I will not mince words. We are failing the planet and people once again at this Cop, after decades of empty mitigation [emissions cutting] and climate finance promises, emissions have more than doubled, and we are on a pathway to assassinate half of all living creatures on Earth. Mitigation is not just about adopting renewable energies or improving energy efficiency. It is fundamentally about phasing out fossil fuels. It is troubling to witness both utter silence and outright resistance on this critical issue. To make matters even worse, after three years of negotiations on the new finance goal, countless workshops and dialogues in remote places, our [rich nation] colleagues have yet to put forward a [number] for us to negotiate. We’ve been to South Africa, Germany several times, the Philippines, Egypt, Austria, Switzerland, Dubai, Colombia, Bakue a few times. For God’s sake, what’s the next stop? Mars? Quite frankly, this lack of commitment feels like a slap in the face to the most vulnerable. It is just utter disrespect to those countries that are bearing the brunt of this crisis. The current weak language of mitigation is a death sentence to Panama, our people and other vulnerable countries. Developed countries must stop playing games with our lives and put a serious, quantified financial proposal on the table. Why should Panama bear the burden of loans to cover the $250m in losses and damage that we have suffered in the past month due to torrential rains? We constantly hear from developed countries that the $1.3tn proposal presented by the developing world is extreme and unreasonable. So let me say what’s truly extreme and what’s truly unreasonable: spending $2.5tn trillion in wars while failing to commit less than half of that to save lives and investing $7tn in fossil fuel subsidies. My people have spent months under water in the worst torrential rains that we have seen in our recent history. Some of my neighbours, some of my family and friends, have lost their entire livelihoods, and yet our developed country colleagues expect us to finance this recovery with loans. We have waited 32 years for action, and here we are stuck once again. A lack of ambitious mitigation text is a death sentence to my people, A lack of ambitious mitigation text means giving up on a livable future. The absence of a quantified financial proposal from developed nations is not just irresponsible, it is despicable. It is sometimes quite evil. Let’s stop this circus. It is time to get serious, to get our act together and to deliver. You can watch the speech from the 2h 20m mark here. Saudi Arabia has been playing a strong blocking role throughout Cop29 – but most of the complaints of the country’s behaviour have had to be made behind closed doors by negotiators in private, writes Fiona Harvey, Guardian climate editor. The clearest issue in which the petrostate has been an obstruction is over the so called UAE consensus. That’s the name for the outcome of Cop28 last year in Dubai, when nations agreed for the first time to “transition away from fossil fuels”. Saudi has been determined to avoid a reaffirmation of that resolution, hoping to bury it at this Cop so that future Cops will find it difficult to revive. Now the UAE has stepped in to defend its achievement last year. The Guardian understands the country is full square behind the commitments made as part of the consensus. Whether the statement by a “brother” state and Arab neighbour will have much impact remains to be seen. Mary Robinson, former president of Ireland, told the Guardian she was deeply concerned. She said: One of the things that I want to see explicitly in the main text, obviously, is the words transitioning from fossil fuels and building further on that, not just mentioning it, but building further on, but expressly referencing it. Saudi Arabia have been working hard to wipe it from everywhere, and it has to be, if it isn’t, in my view, the Cop is not doing its job. They been blocking everything, from what I’m hearing from lots of sources, and you know, they’ve been blocking gender, they’ve been blocking trying to get rid of this language. Robinson is one of a group of senior Cop veterans who are seeking some reform to the process to prevent too much power being wielded by petrostates, especially as hosts. She said: I think we will see in the new year, moves to address some of the problems, for example, the over presence of the fossil fuel lobby, that has a chilling effect. It has an effect on negotiations that have effect on the results. If you’ve got a petrol state, it affects the presidency.

Hilda Nakabuye, 27, from Fridays for Future campaign group in Uganda, said: We are holding on to hope. As a mother I am here to represent my people, my community, but also future generations that we hold close and dear to our hearts and why we are all in this fight. The ones least responsible for climate change undergo its worst effects. We know what power we hold: the power to act. We are in an emergency. This COP is all about the money, but communities on the ground are not seeing the money. When the climate hits we need to respond like any other emergency, because it is an emergency. We all know deep down there is more than enough money to fill the loss and damage fund with trillions, so why are we still pleading for the bare minimum? What we can take from this discussion is hope. Hope that change will happen at the speed of empathy. We need action, more than ever. The world’s biggest consulting firm has been criticised for working with clients it knew were on a trajectory to push the world towards 3 to 5 degrees of global warming, write Ben Stockton in New York and Hajar Meddah in London McKinsey &amp; Company has worked with some of the world’s biggest emitters, including many of the largest fossil fuel producers. It has previously argued it is necessary to engage these clients to help them transition to cleaner forms of energy and hit the target of limiting global warming to less than 1.5C above preindustrial levels. But the Centre for Climate Reporting (CCR) and the Guardian have learned of an internal analysis of client emissions carried out by McKinsey in 2021 which showed that the companies the firm works with were set to exceed this target. Despite this, an internal email alleges that no senior members of staff were willing to “push the effort forward”. The revelations follow an investigation published in the Guardian yesterday, based on more than a dozen interviews with former insiders, internal documents and hundreds of pages of court records, which revealed new details about the firm’s work with the fossil fuel industry. Many of the world’s biggest fossil fuel producers have been significant sources of revenue for McKinsey, such as the world’s largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, and oil majors Shell and BP, according to an analysis of bankruptcy court records. “It is not a secret that McKinsey is in deep with big polluters, but now we know just how wide that hole is and how deep they’re digging,” said Rachel Rose Jackson from the campaign group Corporate Accountability. “The more it continues to partner closely with and profit from the very actors condemning people and the planet, the more complicit it becomes.” Click below to read more Azerbaijan has urged negotiators at the Cop29 summit to bridge their differences to come up with with a finance deal, as the UN climate talks looked set to, once again, run into overtime. In a note to delegates on Friday, reported by Reuters, the Cop29 presidency said: We encourage parties to continue to collaborate within and across groups with the aim of proposing bridging proposals that will help us to finalise our work here in Baku. Past COPs have traditionally run over time. Cop29 will run well into overtime, WWF has said, as delegates from nearly 200 nations awaited a fresh draft of a summit deal on Friday afternoon. Decisions at the annual UN climate talks are made by consensus, meaning that it is possible for a small number of objectors to easily hold up commitments. On Thursday, negotiations stretched late into the night in the cavernous sports stadium that has been adapted as a venue for the climate talks, with the promise that a new draft would be published at about midday today. That deadline has now passed. Developing countries are pushing for $1.3tn a year in climate finance by 2030, with at least $500bn coming directly from richer nations. But the EU and other major contributors are hesitant to offer such a vast sum and insist a greater share of the burden must be taken by the private sector. The new draft is expected to offer more clarity on the numbers, after an earlier version on Thursday said that developing countries need at least “USD [X] trillion” per year. Britain will give £239m to help forest-rich nations tackle climate change. The UK government, which made the pledge at Cop29, said the money would go towards tackling deforestation in countries such as Colombia and Indonesia, in recognition of “the critical role of forests in those countries as ‘carbon sinks’ that absorb more CO2 from the atmosphere annually than the UK and USA emit combined.” According to the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero, the funding comprises: £188m to support “the development of high-integrity forest carbon markets’; £48m for blended finance to unlock private investment in sustainable forest enterprises across the tropical forest belt; And £3m for the UNFCCC to help countries protect their forests. Ed Miliband, the energy secretary, said: Forests are the lungs of our planet – without them climate security is impossible. We’re determined to play our part in mobilising finance to protect and restore global forests in these critical years for climate action. The climate crisis has no borders and these issues impact people back home in the UK – we’re already seeing the damage flooding and record heatwaves can do to businesses and the most vulnerable in our communities. Providing this funding now helps prevent the escalating costs of climate catastrophe at home and abroad, this is what the UK means by climate leadership. News is so sparse on the final day of Cop29 that the Associated Press, US-based news agency, took a board game to the climate summit, and then reported on people playing it. Activists and experts who are pushing world leaders to save an overheating planet learned it’s not so easy, even in a simulated world. The Associated Press brought the board game Daybreak to the United Nations climate negotiations in Baku, Azerbaijan. Experts from three countries were asked to play the game, which involves players working together to curb climate change, caused by the release of greenhouse gas emissions when fuels like gasoline, natural gas and coal are burned. The goal of the game is to prevent the world from getting too hot or overrun by devastating extreme weather events. Three times activists, analysts and reporters took turns being the United States, China, Europe and the rest of the world, coping with weather disasters, trying to reduce emissions with projects like wetlands restoration and fighting fossil fuel interests, all according to the cards dealt. The yellow-red crisis cards are the ones that set players back the most. And every round comes with a new card, such as, “Storms: Every player adds 1 Community in Crisis” per 0.1 degrees Celsius (0.2 degrees Fahrenheit) temperature rise, or “Sea Level Rise: Every player loses 1 Infrastructure Resilience.” Those are tempered by blue cards that represent local projects, such as around fertilizer efficiency, which eliminates one game token of methane-spewing livestock, or universal public transport, which eliminates a token of polluting car emissions. In each game, the temperature went beyond the limit that the world set in the 2015 Paris Agreement: 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times, roughly the mid-1800s. Technically, the game isn’t lost until a temperature rise of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) is reached. However, 1.5 degrees has been ingrained as a threshold in climate circles, so the shoulders of players drooped in defeat when their fictional world blew past it. After just one round of play, which lasted about 20 minutes in the second game, the global thermometer rose to 1.45 degrees Celsius (2.61 degrees Fahrenheit). “How did that happen? It happened so quickly,” said Borami Seo, head of food and agriculture at Solutions for Our Climate in South Korea. She purposely chose Europe, arguably the world leader in climate policy and financial aid, so she would be in a position to help the rest of the world. She couldn’t. “I thought this game was supposed to give us hope. I’m not gaining any hope,” Seo said in a voice somewhere between curiosity and frustration. Hopes of a breakthrough at the deadlocked UN climate talks have been dashed after a new draft of a possible deal was condemned by rich and poor countries, write Guardian reporters in Baku. Faith in the ability of the Azerbaijan presidency to produce a deal ebbed on Thursday morning, as the draft texts were criticised as inadequate and providing no “landing ground” for a compromise. Instead of setting a global goal for at least $1tn in new funds for developing countries to tackle the climate crisis, the text contained only an “X” where numbers should have been. Oscar Soria, a director at the Common Initiative thinktank, said: “The negotiating placeholder ‘X’ for climate finance is a testament of the ineptitude from rich nations and emerging economies that are failing to find a workable solution for everyone. “This is a dangerous ambiguity: inaction risks turning ‘X’ into the symbol of extinction for the world’s most vulnerable. Without firm, ambitious commitments, this vagueness betrays the Paris agreement’s promise and leaves developing nations unarmed in their fight against climate chaos.” Click below to read more Poor countries may have to compromise on demands for cash to tackle global heating, a former UN climate envoy has said, as UN talks entered their final hours in deadlock, writes Fiona Harvey, Guardian environment editor. In comments that are likely to disappoint poorer countries at the Cop29 summit, Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland and twice a UN climate envoy, said on Thursday night that rich country budgets were stretched amid inflation, Covid and conflicts including Russia’s war in Ukraine. “It’s finance, and it’s absolutely vital, and it’s the responsibility of the developed world,” she told the Guardian in an interview. “But you can’t squeeze what isn’t squeezable.” Rich countries have yet to make any formal offer of finance to the poor world as of Thursday night, even as two weeks of talks stretched into their final official day on Friday. The summit is focused on finding $1tn (£790bn) a year for poor nations to shift to a low-CO2 economy and cope with the impacts of extreme weather. But the rich world is expected to offer only about $300bn a year at most in public finance, far less than many developing countries hoped for. The developed world is likely to argue that the remainder of the $1tn can be made up from other sources, including private sector investment, carbon trading and potential new sources such as taxes on fossil fuels. Welcome to day 11 of negotiations at Cop29: the hurry up and wait phase. And we may be waiting for a while, though nobody can be sure just how long, writes Adam Morton, Guardian Australia climate and environment editor. Ministers and negotiators met until the early hours this morning trying to find common ground on the issues where they have been at loggerheads. The big ones are the lack of dollar figures in a draft text on a climate finance goal, and the resistance by some countries - notably Saudi Arabia and other gulf states - to allow previously agreed goals of tripling renewable energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels to be explicitly repeated. In a five-hour plenary session on Thursday, dozens of countries expressed anger at the state of what the Azerbaijani Cop presidency had put forward. Quite what this meant was hard to gauge. On the one hand, we have been here before many times. Despair over an insufficiently ambitious text is not unusual at this stage of climate summits. On the other, the UN consensus process is a tricky beast and there is plenty of opportunity for disruptive forces to tip the cart if they choose to. The Saudis have been clear all year that they are unhappy about the reference to a fossil fuel transition in the text agreed in Dubai, and have held on to that position in Baku. They were uncharacteristically explicit about it in Thursday’s plenary, albeit when talking about the climate finance debate, when the Saudi delegate Albara Tawfiq declared “the Arab group will not accept any text that targets any specific sectors, including fossil fuels”. It underlined how tough the battle may be over the coming hours and days. But some observers saw an upside - at least he had said the quiet bit out loud. What China, which has also expressed reservations about repeating the fossil fuel language but is considered more open to changing its position, does from here will be crucial. The other major sticking point has been the reluctance of wealthy nations to be clear about how much they are collectively prepared to stump up in climate finance to help the poor develop clean economies, adapt to inevitable change and repair the damage from the climate crisis they largely have not caused. At least $1tn a year is needed, and the frustration from some of the world’s most vulnerable countries is real. Ultimately, if there is going to be an agreement in Baku these two issues – climate finance and emissions reduction – will need to be decided hand-in-hand. A bigger finance goal could allow a more ambitious mitigation text – and vice versa. Some cracks in the text may have to be papered over to get there, and it will take leadership from the hosts that has not always been evident. Let’s see what today brings. Good morning! This is Damien Gayle, environment correspondent in London, with you again for another morning of updates from the Cop29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan.

          "headline": "Many protest movements of the past decade have backfired. What would it take for one to succeed under Trump?",
          "bodyText": "The day after Trump’s 2017 inauguration, the freshly minted junior senator from California addressed the crowd at the Women’s March in Washington. “Let’s buckle in,” Kamala Harris declared, “because it’s going to be a bumpy ride.” She wasn’t kidding. An estimated 470,000 demonstrators poured into DC that day, the pink tide of pussy hats (a defiant rejoinder to Trump’s endorsement of sexual assault) flooding the National Mall. With millions more attending simultaneous demonstrations around the country, the outpouring of resistance was dubbed the largest single-day protest in American history. For all of the event’s emotional power, however, once the chartered buses groaned back on to the Beltway, Trump settled into the White House and set about implementing his agenda. In that sense, the event was arguably a failure, comparable to a number of recent American mass political mobilizations that delivered less in the way of tangible change than their participants hoped. The wealth gap has widened considerably since Occupy Wall Street. The Dakota Access pipeline went online in 2017, despite the valiant efforts of Standing Rock’s water protectors. Many of the progressive gains in criminal justice reform made in response to the George Floyd protests were quickly rolled back. Not only is Atlanta’s Cop City still under construction, similar facilities have been approved around the country. And Israel continues its war on Gaza (having extended the theater to the West Bank and Lebanon), with the help of US-supplied weaponry, in defiance of the mass public outcry. So what gives? As the dazed and beleaguered liberal coalition ponders its future under a second Trump regime, activists might be forgiven for wondering whether taking to the streets en masse can ever make a meaningful difference. For the journalist Vincent Bevins, who has spent years studying grassroots political movements around the world – occasionally dodging teargas and water cannons to do so – and has witnessed many of them fail to deliver on their promise, the answer is complicated. On the one hand, he says, the American left may have no choice. “If celebrities and elite media and voting every two years were sufficient, we would have already won,” Bevins says, speaking by video conference from London. Characterizing widespread rejection of Biden-Harris-style liberalism as a wake-up call, he adds: “That the Democratic party has failed in such a consequential moment not only opens up space for pressure from below, but it makes it imperative.” But strategy matters, as Bevins’s extensively reported 2023 book, If We Burn: The Mass Protest Decade and the Missing Revolution, makes all too clear. The collective exhilaration of mass popular action and the dashed hopes that often follow are hardly limited to recent US-based movements. Focusing on the 2010s, a decade that began with the Tunisia uprising and ended with the emergence of Covid-19, the book examines roughly a dozen mass protest movements, of which only two (in South Korea and Chile) led to the sort of change advocates envisioned. Nearly all of the remaining instances of high-profile mass protest – including those in Tunisia, Egypt, Hong Kong, Brazil and Ukraine – “experienced something worse than failure”, he writes. “Things went backward.” As If We Burn demonstrates, some of the same characteristics that allowed a series of people’s movements during the last decade to attract masses of supporters and destabilize the existing order – spontaneity, fuzzy objectives, a reliance on social media and an allergy to structure, central leadership and even designated spokespeople – also carried significant, sometimes fatal, drawbacks. This recipe can be “an incredibly explosive combination when what you need to do is get as many people on to the streets as possible”, he points out. “And these moments are experienced as euphoric victory for the participants. But it’s poorly suited for what comes next, which is filling the power vacuum that has been created or elaborating a set of demands.” While there is good historical justification for the left’s mistrust of organizational hierarchy – the authoritarian turn of the Bolshevik revolution makes for an enduring cautionary tale – the downside was seen in the ease with which the Muslim Brotherhood managed to usurp the loosely organized Tahrir Square protests in Egypt, or the way rightwing forces in Brazil turned the populist energy unleashed by the left in 2014 to their own ends. For domestic examples of the value of structure and discipline, one need only compare the success of the civil rights movement, with its clearcut demands, well-trained activists and strong leadership, with the ambiguous legacy of Occupy Wall Street. Occupy’s emphasis on “horizontalism” and consensus-based decision-making is often credited to the efforts of the late anthropologist and anarchist writer David Graeber, an enthusiastic advocate of prefiguration – the idea that a movement should model the world it hopes to create. And Occupy did so brilliantly. During my own visits to Zuccotti Park, I quickly learned to stop quizzing activists about their goals and to instead simply immerse myself in the enthralling if fragile utopia they had somehow conjured in a bleak stone plaza. In addition to reframing US political discourse around a powerful class-based critique, Occupy proved that an entirely different paradigm of human relations, based on direct democracy and mutual aid, could flourish if left to its own devices. In doing so, it provided inspiration for movements around the world. But of course Occupy wasn’t left to its own devices for long. As Bevins points out, genuine disruptions to state power nearly always prompt a violent crackdown. “There doesn’t even actually have to be a revolution for elites to launch a counterrevolution,” he adds. “They just have to think that their privileges are threatened.” That said, especially in the era of social media, violent government repression often leads to the opposite of its intended effect. In almost every case Bevins studied, “Viral images of police brutality cause a massive scaling-up of the protest” – a dynamic that played out during last year’s campus demonstrations on behalf of Palestine. This is the point at which the mobilization of more organized groups – churches, political organizations and especially unions – can prove decisive. While marches, encampments and various forms of civil disobedience are great at commanding attention, they rarely succeed on their own. Strikes, walkouts and boycotts, on the other hand, can cripple an economy – a reliable pain point for the elite class. “It’s often when the economy stops working that the existing leaders in capitalist systems really have to take notice,” Bevins says. In recent decades, the strength of the US economy – and the relative comfort it has afforded many of us – seems to have acted as a pressure valve, dampening the fervor of domestic protest movements. As much as progressives might wish for a better world, few Americans have so far been willing to take real personal risks to challenge the status quo. (And tweeting doesn’t count.) For many liberals, the anguish of the first Trump administration was mostly “affective”, Begins suggests – a sense of emotional discomfort brought on by “the stuff you had to see on the news”. He draws a contrast with the enormous hardship Brazilians suffered under Bolsonaro. “People that had jobs at a bank or in a restaurant were living on the streets with their families,” he recalls. “It was when governance became so obviously chaotic that he even lost well-off Brazilians in the large cities that his government began to fall apart.” Since the Great Depression, that kind of suffering has been fairly limited in this country, but the prospect seems less remote every day. “We’re in a world of polycrisis,” Bevins says. “We’re in a world of environmental collapse. We’re in a world where Donald Trump has promised change that is likely to be quite chaotic and unpredictable and dangerous.” If there’s a single lesson to be learned from the last decade of mass protest, he adds, it’s simply this: in an atomized, digitally mediated society that has left so many of us feeling alienated and adrift, transformational change will depend on solidarity, community and human connection. “I see people saying, don’t limit yourself to participation in politics, which amounts to pressing buttons in a voting booth every two years. Join a labor union, a social movement, a political party, a tenant union, a community organization, a book club. Literally anything is better than sitting at home and scrolling on your phone and getting mad at the news,” Bevins says. One opportunity will arise soon enough – another Women’s March is slated for 18 January. In addition to sending a message, it will rally the troops, provide inspiration and fellowship, and ideally give participants the chance to connect with or build the sort of focused, disciplined organizations that sometimes manage to force genuine change. “If groups get large enough and employ tactics like strikes or boycotts, or somehow make the reproduction of routine daily life impossible,” Bevins says, “they can really impose concrete costs on an existing political system. “The more that you are arm in arm with other human beings and able to act collectively and hopefully democratically,” he advises, “the better you’ll be prepared for whatever comes.”"

The animation is stunning, with Maurice Sendak-style critter designs and intricate detail aplenty. And the songs – such as the samba extravaganza about adventurous eating – are actually memorable. Rooted in a quest narrative that occasionally dips into a group therapy session, it builds into a surprisingly moving parable about adult responsibility. Out now, Netflix *** Monkey Man Dev Patel always seemed like such a nice boy – but his directorial debut, produced by Jordan Peele, informs us that he had an ultraviolent, Charles Bronson-style avenger inside him all along. He plays the titular protagonist, a rural commoner inspired by monkey god Hanuman to bust heads all the way to the top of the evil crime syndicate who trashed his village and killed his mum. In the shadow of John Wick as much as Hindu mythology, Patel displays impressive martial-arts skills and kinetic, if sometimes OTT, camerawork. Friday 29 November, 10.05pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** Event Horizon Directed by the other Paul (WS) Anderson, this sci-fi horror blow-out was a flop on release in 1997, but has deservedly acquired cult status since. Cleaving to the Aliens voyage-into-the-unknown template, Laurence Fishburne leads his crew on a mission to Neptune to salvage a vessel with an experimental warp drive that has ripped a hole in the fabric of reality. Channelling Hellraiser’s Pinhead, you’ve never seen cuddly Sam Neill on such unsettling form as the technological genius becoming one with his creation. It gets a little schlocky, but always retains a disturbing bite. Saturday 23 November, 1.40am, Film4 *** The Most Dangerous Game Namechecked in one of the Zodiac killer’s letters, this treat from 1932 is a surprisingly lurid blueprint for the survival-horror films that followed down the decades. Joel McCrea’s big-game hunter becomes the prey after being shipwrecked on a remote island belonging to Count Zaroff (Leslie Banks). Filmed on the same sets as King Kong and also featuring that film’s Fay Wray, it is pacy, haunting and scored through with a perverse excitement. The likes of Running Man and Hunger Games all dine at its table. Sunday 24 November, 1.30am, Talking Pictures TV *** Widow Clicquot This biopic of champagne pioneer Barbe-Nicole Ponsardin Clicquot owes a debt to Shekhar Kapur’s Elizabeth: after her husband dies, the beleaguered vigneron (Haley Bennett) must defend her kingdom from her father-in-law, the Moët family next door, and general forces of the patriarchy. Set against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars, its ravishing sweep is spurred along by Sam Riley as the devil-may-care vintner who becomes her new beau. There aren’t many wine-making biopics, let alone feminist ones, so this is a welcome addition. Tuesday 26 November, 12.45pm, Sky Cinema Premiere *** Manhunter Five years before The Silence of the Lambs, Michael Mann’s third film was the first on-screen outing for serial killer Hannibal Lecktor – compared with Anthony Hopkins, a restrained performance from Brian Cox. Instead, all the prima donna attitude emanates from William Petersen’s FBI investigator, fretting about staring into the abyss as he chases down the Red Dragon psychopath with Lecktor’s help. Mann lords it up too in entrancing 80s style: the sequence when Tom Noonan gets a blind girl to pet a sedated tiger is a showstopper. Wednesday 27 November, midnight, BBC One *** Iron Monkey Future Matrix and Crouching Tiger choreographer Yuen Woo-ping was on a hot directorial streak in the earlier 90s, with the likes of Tai Chi Master and Wing Chun. But he kicked off the run with this 1993 caper starring Donnie Yen as real-life folk hero Wong Kei-ying. He teams up with a mysterious, masked, Robin Hood-esque wealth redistributor to stick it to a pair of bully-boy governors. With the finest Hong Kong wirework known to humanity, this slice of pure enjoyment has all the nimble, rooftop-prancing, skylight-crashing chops of a true action genius.

          "bodyText": "Good morning. For a clear symbol of how much work lies ahead at what is supposed to be the last session of the Cop29 climate summit today, you only have to look at the figure included in the draft text on new climate finance for developing countries: “[X] trillion dollars”. That placeholder on the most important single detail under consideration – included in two rival versions of the text – was supposed to leave space for negotiation. But it also suggests how much still has to be decided if any kind of positive momentum is to be rescued from two very difficult weeks in Azerbaijan. A new text has been delayed, and is now expected at midday local time, about an hour from now. Meetings between governments and the summit leadership ran into early Friday morning: “There’s nothing like a 3am huddle in a windowless, airless room with bright lights and proposals on the future of Planet Earth to focus the mind,” wrote Ed King in his Climate Diplomacy newsletter this morning. But while there are huddled negotiators bickering over numbers and square brackets and semicolons, there is hope. Today’s newsletter, with the Guardian’s Patrick Greenfield in Baku, is about how much is left to do, and how Cop29 might be viewed once it comes to an end. Here are the headlines. Five big stories Israel | The international criminal court has issued arrest warrants for the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the country’s former defence minister Yoav Gallant and the Hamas leader Mohammed Deif for alleged war crimes relating to the Gaza war. It is the first time that leaders of a democracy and western-aligned state have been charged by the court. Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the use of an experimental ballistic missile by Russia amounted to “a clear and severe escalation” in the war and called for worldwide condemnation of the move. Vladimir Putin said that the missile lauch “was a response to US plans to produce and deploy intermediate and short-range missiles”. US politics | Matt Gaetz, the former Florida congressman, withdrew from consideration to serve as Donald Trump’s attorney general on Thursday amid intense scrutiny of allegations of sexual misconduct. Later, Trump nominated former Florida state attorney general Pam Bondi in Gaetz’s place. Farming | New inheritance tax rules for farmers could be changed to make it easier for those 80 and over to hand down their farm without it incurring the tax, in what would be a partial climbdown by the government after a bruising row with farmers and a huge protest march in Westminster on Tuesday. Art | A banana bought for 35 cents and taped to a gallery wall with duct tape by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan has sold for $5.2m, making it surely the most expensive piece of edible fruit on the planet. One of three editions of the 2019 work was bought by crypto entrepreneur Justin Sun at Sotheby’s New York for four times the initial estimate. In depth: ‘There has never been a finance target like this negotiated before’ Patrick was at the plenary session in Baku yesterday, where dozens of countries expressed their anger at the draft text that is supposed to be finalised ahead of an attempt at consensus agreement, theoretically by 6pm local time today. “It was pretty negative,” he said. “The biggest thing was the lack of a headline figure for climate finance. Developing countries say that they need a specific number to work with in negotiations. Meanwhile, the EU and other wealthier nations in that bloc are angry that there’s not enough emphasis on emissions cuts, which they say creates the risk of backsliding from what was agreed last year.” “This kind of thing has happened before,” he added. “Cop presidencies [the role is currently held by this year’s host, Azerbaijan] sometimes see value in putting out a text that pisses everyone off to heighten the appetite for compromise.” But it’s a high stakes game. Here’s what you need to know. *** What are the big issues on the table? The headline goal of the summit in Azerbaijan is a deal on climate finance – specifically the “new collective quantified goal” (NCQG) mandated by the 2015 Paris agreement, whichis now meant to be set in stone. (Read more about that in Nimo’s First Edition from the start of the summit.) The current goal of $100bn a year for poor countries is viewed even in rich countries as inadequate, but the ask of about $1.3tn a year by 2030 is still subject to negotiation – in terms of the headline figure, how it is paid and which countries qualify as recipients. “There has been no concrete counterproposal from the developed nations on a figure yet,” Patrick said. And even when a number materialises, there will be scrutiny of how much of the money comes in direct financial assistance and how much is in the form of private sector investment or money from fossil fuel taxes. “Then there is the debate over who is still a developing country, and whether India, China and others qualify – even Saudi Arabia is included in a bloc of developing countries. When you talk to negotiators from African countries, a lot of them are frustrated that the investment often goes to places that already have it, like Egypt, Morocco and Vietnam, as well as India and China – and they are not in position to attract a significant slice.” Meanwhile, there is a battle over “mitigation” – the term for commitments to curbing greenhouse gas emissions. In Baku last week, Saudi Arabia and its allies sought to unpick commitments made at Cop28 to “transition away from fossil fuels”, and the key question is whether that pledge will be reiterated in this year’s agreement. “That is what most countries say they want,” Patrick said. “But the group led by the Saudis is resisting that approach behind the scenes.” At the moment, the phrase “transition away from fossil fuels” is absent from the section of the draft dealing with mitigation. *** How have talks gone so far? Even with a good faith approach from every country involved, this is very difficult stuff. “There has never been a finance target like this negotiated before,” Patrick said. And while $1.3tn is in one sense a lot cheaper than the accumulating cost of the climate crisis, “it’s also equivalent to the combined military budgets of the US and China – so it’s a really serious amount of money. We shouldn’t expect it to be easy. It’s a personal view, but when you view the talks up close, it doesn’t feel as hopeless as it maybe does when you’re not here.” Even so, “there’s not a lot of trust on display,” Patrick added. One key area of frustration is the leadership of Azerbaijan, which has been accused of using the summit to boost its fossil fuel industry. Ilham Aliyev, Azerbaijan’s president, recently called oil and gas a “gift from god” and said that countries should not be blamed for “bringing these resources to the market”. And Azerbaijan is on track for a major expansion in fossil gas production over the next decade. “This is the third Cop in a row at a major fossil fuel producing state,” Patrick said. “The Emiratis dealt with that tension pretty well last time, and they had an impressive diplomatic operation – but Azerbaijan doesn’t really have that in place. Now they have gone to the British and the Brazilians, as lead representatives of the developed and developing world who have either hosted a Cop summit recently or will do soon, to help them put together a new draft of the text.” But regardless of who Azerbaijan brings into the drafting process, many delegates suspect that they are simply too committed to fossil fuel production to be a fair broker for the difficult day ahead. Meanwhile, the shadow of a second Donald Trump presidency, and the sense that the US will once again abdicate its responsibilities on the climate crisis, only heightens the pressure on the process. *** How will the process work today? In 2022, Fiona Harvey gave us a fascinating rundown of the negotiation process ahead of Cop27, explaining how the first week is made up of negotiations between officials, followed by ministerial appearances in the second week, and then the final plenary session at which consensus must be reached for a deal to be locked in. In short, Fiona said then: “It’s awful and inadequate and frustrating, but it’s still essential.” The final stage of the process follows a logic of its own. Ahead of the final plenary session, delegations from different countries and blocs will hold private consultations with the presidency on what they feel needs to change in the text for them to agree to it. Once a text has been hammered out, agreement must be by unanimous decision, and if no consensus can be reached there is no option of a majority vote as a last resort. Some argue that this mechanism enforces the “will of the laggards” who always have the option of junking the whole deal; others say that it forces those working to sabotage agreement behind the scenes to show their hand, and that sometimes they can be shamed into acquiescence. Either way, the process is notorious for running over. “My flight home’s at 7am on Sunday, and I don’t expect it to be done by then,” Patrick said. “But we’ll see.” *** How important is this year’s Cop likely to prove? That really depends on what the final agreement says. A deal that locks in a big increase in climate finance from the developed world to the developing world would be a major milestone, and it would be a victory for climate realists to repeat the Cop28 language about fossil fuels. Backsliding from the Cop28 commitments would be a real setback, and developing countries’ limited faith in the process would be further damaged if the finance commitments are underwhelming. Whatever happens, there is always next year. And, on the other hand, there is also the reality that keeping global heating to 1.5C above preindustrial levels already appears to be a very remote prospect. “A large majority of scientists think that 1.5 is already dead and buried,” Patrick said. “That is massively consequential. But it doesn’t mean that efforts to limit warming shouldn’t continue” – both because it is a commitment that governments have signed up to, and because this is not a binary: every fraction of a degree of additional warming will have profound consequences. Even if an encouraging deal is struck today or over the weekend, and the Cop bandwagon stays on the road, that should not be mistaken for a concrete result. “The process doesn’t need countries to leave it, or to ‘fail’, for warming to go well beyond 2C,” Patrick said. “Whatever happens in Baku, it’s ultimately only important if it leads to action.” What else we’ve been reading After the death of John Prescott, Stephen Bates’s fine obituary captures something of his crucial role in the success of New Labour - but also his remarkable path to the top, and how sensitive he was to classist mockery in the press.

Something for the weekend Our critics’ roundup of the best things to watch, read and listen to right now Music Father John Misty: Mahashmashana | ★★★★☆ You could argue that Mahashmashana is not an album built to change anyone’s mind: if you’ve already decided that Josh Tillman is an insufferable smartarse, you can doubtless find evidence to support your claim among its dense, allusive songs. But you’d have a harder time arguing that he’s not a fantastic writer in terms of melody – all of the tracks bear a tune that’s both beautiful and beautifully constructed – and the scope of his musical ambitions … for a man who apparently spends a lot of time consumed by angst and portents of doom, Tillman seems to be doing just fine. Alexis Petridis TV A Man on the Inside | ★★★★☆ A Man on the Inside is the story of Charles (Ted Danson), a lonely, retired widower who takes a job with a private investigator, infiltrating a retirement home to discover the identity of a thief. Only, as you may have guessed, the job gives him purpose and the residents give him companionship and everything is lovely and sweet and heartwarming. Stuart Heritage Film Snow Leopard | ★★★★☆ The Tibetan writer-director Pema Tseden died of heart failure last year at age 53, just months after completing this movie; his health was almost certainly weakened by rough treatment from Chinese police some years earlier. He was not an overtly political film-maker and this is not an overtly political film; nor was the incident that may well have led to his death an overtly political incident. And yet the political implications of power are everywhere in his final film about the rescue of an illegally captured snow leopard; the meanings are transformed and displaced into these characters and incidents. It’s a strange, sad swan song.

By the time she played for Team USA in the inaugural women’s world championships in 1990, she noticed that even the sport’s top female stars were still wearing ill-fitting equipment designed for men. So she set about changing things: “I was so full of energy and visions of where women’s sports could go. I just picked up the phone and called every single hockey manufacturer.” Dyer eventually persuaded a Candian company to make women’s hockey gear, prompting the Chicago Tribune to write, in 1996: “Makers of sports equipment have finally realized there’s another sex.” Bored at work?

He served as deputy prime minister for more than a decade under Tony Blair and played a pivotal role in his government. Blair said Prescott had been “one of the most talented people I ever encountered in politics, one of the most committed and loyal, and definitely the most unusual … There were no rules he really abided by”. During his time in office, Prescott was seen as a custodian of traditional Labour values in the face of a modernising leadership. He acted as a mediator in the often tumultuous relationship between Blair and Brown, which led to him being described as their “marriage counsellor”. The son of a railway signalman who left school at 15 to work as a trainee chef and then as a steward on the Cunard Line, Prescott is held up to this day as someone who rose from humble beginnings to reach the top of British politics. Between 1997 and 2001, he served as secretary of state for the environment, transport and the regions, and became Britain’s lead negotiator for the Kyoto protocol, the first international treaty to set legally binding targets on greenhouse gas emissions. In government he earned the nickname Two Jags for making use of two Jaguar cars – his own and the ministerial one. When in 1999 he faced criticism for using his ministerial Jag for a 200-yard journey to his hotel at Labour conference, he claimed it was so his wife Pauline’s hair would not get blown about. Known for being straight-talking and at times short-tempered, Prescott punched a protester who threw an egg at him during an election campaign visit in north Wales in 2001. At a press conference the next day, Blair’s response to reporters was simply that “John is John”. The incident inspired a tweak to his nickname: Two Jabs. The protester, Craig Evans, who now lives on a remote farm outside Denbigh in north Wales, said he had “no regrets” about throwing the egg and that his thoughts were with the late politician’s loved ones. In an interview with the Guardian in 2019, Prescott said: “When I do die, after 50 years in politics, all they will show on the news is 60 seconds of me thumping a fellow in Wales.” There were instances of heroism too. In 2004, a canoeist told of how he was rescued by Prescott after being knocked over by a raft while tackling a mountain river in Eryri (Snowdonia). The canoeist was hauled out of the river by Prescott, who was himself planning a white-water trip, after being dragged underwater when his craft capsized. Towards the end of the New Labour years, media attention became increasingly concentrated on Prescott’s private life. In 2006 he admitted to an affair with his former diary secretary Tracey Temple, triggering a flurry of lurid stories. In a cabinet reshuffle later that year, Prescott lost his secretary of state role, though he remained deputy prime minister. Not long after he felt compelled to give up his grace-and-favour country pile, Dorneywood, after being pictured on the lawn playing croquet with his staff – for which he was mocked for being at odds with his working-class image. After standing down as an MP, Prescott wrote an autobiography and won praise for opening up about his 20-year battle with bulimia, which he believed had been brought on by the stress of life in politics. He was ennobled in 2010 and introduced to the upper chamber as Lord Prescott of Kingston upon Hull, having served for four decades as an MP for the city. He ceased to be a member of the Lords in July after developing health difficulties. Blair said in a tribute: “There was nothing about John which fitted conventional wisdom. He was from proud traditional working-class stock yet understood instinctively and completely the aspirations of that class and their desire to better themselves. “He could talk in the bluntest and sometimes bluest language, but it concealed a first-rate intellect, which meant he thought as deeply about issues as much as he cared about them. It is no exaggeration to say the Labour party could never have won three consecutive full terms without John. He was a commanding presence.” Brown described Prescott as a “titan” and a “gentleman” and said that “despite an outwardly deceptive image of uncompromising toughness, he was generous, believing in the good in everyone”. “John Lennon said the working-class hero is a difficult thing to be, but I think John would be just fine with being remembered that way,” he said. “He wanted the good things in life for everyone and not just himself. And he showed that Britain can be a country where if you work hard you can fulfil your potential.” Former colleagues and political adversaries of Prescott’s lined up to describe their favourite encounters with him. William Hague, the former Conservative leader, said Prescott was a “formidable debater” who proved a more challenging adversary at prime minister’s questions than Blair was. Blair told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that his former deputy “had this extraordinary instinctive sense that something was afoot. He often used to come in unannounced into my room in Downing Street and he would say to me: ‘I know you’re up to something, I don’t know quite what it is, but I know you’re up to something.’ And I would be sort of protesting and saying: ‘No, John, you’ve got it all wrong’ … and of course he would always be right.” Peter Mandelson, another architect of the New Labour movement, revealed he had worked for Prescott in his 20s and that Prescott later became his referee when he applied to become the Labour party’s campaign and communications director. “What he said to me at the time was: ‘Peter I’ll do this for you. You’ll do a job. Well, you’ll do a reasonable job; you might as well do it. You’ve got to keep your nose out of politics,’” Mandelson told Sky News. “I said: ‘John, I’m wanting to be the campaign director of the Labour party.’ He said: ‘You know what I mean. You keep your nose out of politics and stop stirring things up. Just do a job and then that will be fine.’” Al Gore, the former US vice-president who worked with Prescott on the Kyoto protocol in 1997, said that connecting with people was “second nature to him” and that “he fought like hell to negotiate the Kyoto protocol and was an unwavering champion of climate action for decades to come”. King Charles said he remembered the former deputy prime minister with “great fondness – his unique and indomitable character, as well as his infectious sense of humour”. In their statement announcing his death, Prescott’s wife, Pauline, and sons, Jonathan and David, said he had died “surrounded by the love of his family and the jazz music of Marian Montgomery”."

          "headline": "Swedish police focus on Chinese ship after suspected undersea cable sabotage",
          "bodyText": "Swedish police investigating the believed sabotage of two fibre-optic undersea cables in the Baltic Sea have said a Chinese ship off the coast of Denmark was “of interest” as Danish officials said its navy was shadowing a Chinese-registered cargo ship. The ship, identified by Denmark as the Yi Peng 3, passed the two cables on Sunday and Monday about the time it is believed they were severed in a suspected malicious attack. The ship has been shadowed by a Danish navy vessel since it was located in waters between Sweden and Denmark. The Danish defence command said: “The Danish Defence can confirm that we are present in the area near the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3. The Danish Defence currently has no further comments.” Swedish officials have confirmed they are interested in the ship but did not give further details. Specialist Swedish underwater search crews were at the site of the Finnish-German cable on Wednesday – one of the two undersea fibre-optic cables that was damaged – gathering evidence for Swedish investigators. A cable between Sweden and Lithuania was also damaged. Swedish police said a Chinese ship off the coast of Denmark was among those they were looking at. Per Engström at Sweden’s National Operative Department said: “It is part of the sphere of interest, but there may be more.” He said the Swedish coast guard is assisting with “increased surveillance around the relevant areas”, adding: “We are ready to take investigative measures to get a clearer picture of what may have happened.” Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said: “China has consistently and fully fulfilled its obligations as a flag state and requires Chinese vessels to strictly abide by the relevant laws and regulations.” The Swedish navy said earlier it had an “almost 100% identification” of the ships that were in the area of the two cable breaks. According to Vesselfinder tracking data, the last time the cargo ship, which is owned by Ningbo Yipeng Shipping, a company registered in Ningbo, visited a port was on 15 November in Ust-Luga in western Russia, close to the border with Estonia. It stopped overnight on Tuesday to Wednesday in the Kattegat strait between Denmark and Sweden. The Russian maritime pilot Alexander Stechentsev, who had boarded the ship to guide it out of port, said there was nothing unusual about the vessel. The Ust-Luga port authority employee said he took the ship to a receiving buoy located 11 miles offshore before disembarking. He described the Yi Peng 3 vessel as “a standard 225-metre bulk carrier” with a crew of Chinese nationals. He said: “There was absolutely nothing unusual about the ship.” A Russian maritime database confirms that he left the Yi Peng 3 vessel on the afternoon of 15 November. Russia has denied any involvement in the cable incidents. On Wednesday the Kremlin said such accusations were ridiculous and it was absurd to accuse Russia without evidence. Sweden and Finland are jointly investigating the incidents as potential sabotage, with Sweden leading the investigation. The Swedish prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, said on Wednesday: “We assume that this could very well be sabotage but we don’t know anything yet. The destroyed cables must be carefully investigated, both by the police and internationally. We have seen sabotage in the past, so we take it very seriously.” The investigators in Sweden were analysing any potential role by the Chinese ship but the Swedish government did not comment on this. A government source said information on the incident was “moving very quickly”. Last year, the anchor of another Chinese vessel, the container ship Newnew Polar Bear – was found to have damaged a gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia. Authorities have not said whether they believed the incident to be intentional or accidental. Overnight, the Swedish navy used unmanned, remote-controlled submarines to investigate the southern site of the two cables, but said it would take “several days” due to the challenges of forecast bad weather and the potential for poor visibility. Jimmie Adamsson, a Swedish navy spokesperson, said the navy had been asked to support the Swedish prosecutor and police with their investigations and ships were sent out immediately. They have been asked to gather evidence at the sites of the two breaks – one 100-150 metres deep (the Sweden-Lithuania cable) and the other 20-40 metres deep (the Finland-Germany cable). They have also been asked to put together a picture of what vessels were there, and at what time. The navy’s crew, which is trained to search underwater, has performed similar tasks twice before during the investigation into the suspected sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines in 2022. Adamsson said: “Yesterday [Tuesday], a couple of navy ships left the Swedish ports and went to the most southerly point of the two. They have been working throughout the night until the morning. There was a bit of rough weather.” At any given time, there are about 4,000 large vessels in the Baltic passing over a web of underwater cables transporting data, electricity and gas across Europe. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, has said she was “not surprised” by the potential for sabotage. “If the immediate assessment is that it is sabotage and it comes from outside, then it is obviously serious. I am not surprised that it can happen,” she said. Germany’s defence minister, Boris Pistorius, has already said he assumed the act was sabotage. “No one believes that the cables were accidentally damaged,” he said. Sweden’s civil defence minister, Carl-Oskar Bohlin, quickly made the link between the movement of ships and the severed cables. “There are ship movements that correspond to this crime on maritime surveillance,” he said. The Finnish security intelligence service (Supo) said it was “too early to assess the cause of the cable damage” but it was supporting other authorities with their expertise. It said about 200 submarine cable breakages happened every year, the most common cause being human activities such as fishing or anchoring."

          "bodyText": "I was following orangutans in Borneo with my wife, Cheryl Knott, a primatologist who has spent 30 years working in Gunung Palung national park, in the Indonesian part of Borneo. I am a biologist by background, and did my PhD research in rainforest ecology in Borneo, before I went into photography and film-making. I saw so much destruction in the rainforest back in the 90s, and it dawned on me that I could publish scientific articles that maybe 10 people would read – or an article in National Geographic that 10 million people would see. I was getting increasingly serious about my photography while working on my PhD when I got funding from the National Geographic Society for field research. Through that connection, I was able to show them my pictures and eventually I published an article in the magazine about my work, which in turn meant I was able to get an assignment to document Cheryl’s orangutan PhD. This fruiting fig tree was unique, in that it didn’t have any branches connecting it to other trees, so the orangutan had to climb right up the roots growing on the trunk to reach the canopy. I had been thinking about getting a picture like this for years: a wide shot looking down on an orangutan in its habitat. I was on the ground when one first passed me and I thought: “OK, it’s going to come back tomorrow – there’s a lot of fruit there.” I went and got my gear, climbed the tree and rigged up three camera mounts with different viewpoints. While it was still dark the next morning, I put the cameras up and, over the next three days, another two orangutans visited. I had a remote control on the ground so when the orangutan was climbing, I triggered the camera. Had I been up the tree myself, I would never have got the shot. I do a lot of bird photography, often from hides. You effectively have to make yourself invisible to get a shot. But that doesn’t work with orangutans. I’ve built hides up in the canopy where I’m totally camouflaged and birds, gibbons and monkeys all come, not noticing me. But an orangutan always knows you’re there. They are not aggressive toward people, generally. I’m drawn to them because they’re one of the great apes – our closest relatives – but they’re much harder to photograph and study than, say, chimpanzees or gorillas, because they spend very little time on the ground and don’t live in social groups. This image won me the Wildlife Photographer of the Year award in 2016. I think its success is due to the perspective. Most of the orangutan pictures I’ve taken have been with a long lens from down on the ground, or from a hill with an eye-level view. So being able to get a wide shot looking down – that’s probably what captured the judges’ interest. There are so many great wildlife photographs out there: to win, you need to shoot something in a unique way. I do all kinds of nature photography, from underwater to big mammals to insects. But if I had to pick one thing, birds are my biggest passion. You have to be patient, keep trying new things and put in the time, waiting for the animals to show up, for good light, all that stuff. There are definitely frustrating moments: like trying to photograph a bird of paradise, sitting in a hide for a week, and they never come back. Or you don’t get any good behaviour to capture. Or it rains. There can be times when you spend a week, get nothing and have to give up. But it beats sitting in an office in front of a computer all day. Tim Laman’s CV Born: Tokyo, Japan, 1961. Trained: “Trained in field biology, self-taught in photography.” Influences: “Fellow Harvard biology grad student Mark Moffett turned his PhD research on ants into a National Geographic article, which inspired me to do the same with my research in the Borneo rainforest. And many National Geographic photographers whose work I admired in the 70s and 80s, especially David Doubilet and Mitsuaki Iwagō.” High point: “Publishing my first story in National Geographic in 1997, and winning Wildlife Photographer of the Year in 2016.” Low point: “Usually about 3.30am when the alarm goes off, before I get ready and then have to hike, climb or whatever to get into position before sunrise for a day trying to photograph wildlife.” Top tip: “Wildlife photography is all about getting to know your subject and spending time in the field. So even if it means getting up at 3.30am, it’s worth it. You’ll never get the shot if you aren’t out there.” • This image features in 60 Years of Wildlife Photographer of the Year: How Wildlife Photography Became Art, published by the Natural History Museum (£40)"

          "bodyText": "In sports broadcasting’s equivalent of a team changing its colors from red to blue in mid-season, the Diamond Sports Group, a bankrupt operator of 16 regional sports networks, last month rebranded its channels as the FanDuel Sports Network. The prior name was already linked to gambling – Bally’s held the branding rights for three years. But FanDuel is a higher-profile new partner with a much larger parent company. Flutter, headquartered in New York and originating from the Irish-British merger of Paddy Power and Betfair, is the world’s largest online betting business. If Bally’s is a brand that evokes Las Vegas-style gambling in a bricks-and-mortar casino, FanDuel looks more like the future: younger, fast-expanding, built for the smartphone era and blurring the lines between the media and the betting industry. In 2022 it launched FanDuel TV, a channel that offers live action and original sports chat from veteran broadcasters and through a partnership with Bill Simmons’ The Ringer podcast network. Now FanDuel has its fingerprint on a broadcaster that holds regional rights to 13 NBA teams, eight NFL teams and a to-be-determined number of MLB clubs. It plans to syndicate FanDuel TV program on the FanDuel Sports Network. Amid the normalization of gambling, betting companies are resembling broadcasters and vice versa. A convergence is taking place as gaming firms embed themselves in the sports media landscape while traditional media add gambling content, both responding to demand and perpetuating it. As a result, coverage is rapidly becoming a tangled web of vested interests. It is increasingly challenging for fans to find a mainstream provider without a stake in the gambling industry, whether they are consuming content directly produced or sponsored by a gaming business, made by a traditional media company with a wagering side hustle, or officially linked to leagues and teams. The major American leagues and many teams have gaming partners. The Diamond and FanDuel partnership “is a more direct connection to mobile sports betting, an evolution” of the Bally’s arrangement, says Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive. “It’s taking advantage of the folks who are there and adding another level of engagement that can be monetized. For some folks it will be the primary reason why they’re engaging… the only reason why they’re watching a game is because they’re gaming.” Regional sports networks (RSNs) attract loyal fans who watch their teams religiously. That makes them enticing targets, according to Crakes: “The gaming companies need daily bettors. I’ve always thought that pairing up with the RSNs on the gaming side is a good place to do it. Because a lot of the folks you want to reach if you’re a sports gaming company are probably watching those games.” The Diamond deal is the latest salvo in a battle between FanDuel and its main rival, DraftKings, for the biggest share of the fast-growing US legal sports betting market, with sports wagering now allowed in 38 states after a 2018 US supreme court ruling permitted states to make their own laws. The digital DraftKings Network offers TV and movie reviews as well as sports news, betting advice and a programming schedule anchored by the star podcaster Dan Le Batard, formerly of ESPN. In 2021 DraftKings reportedly beat out interest from the radio network SiriusXM by agreeing to pay Le Batard’s media company at least $50m over three years in a distribution, monetization and sponsorship deal. It also sponsors podcasts on a network founded by another popular personality, Colin Cowherd. While traditional media companies struggle to retain audiences and stay profitable in the cord-cutting and online news era, DraftKings and FanDuel are growing revenue fast and have the marketing budgets to spend heavily on ventures that complement their advertising blitzes. (DraftKings is loss-making but expects to turn a profit soon.) “To our fans, know that DraftKings is the reason you aren’t behind a paywall, and I’m promising you the money won’t change the show or corrupt us in any way,” Le Batard said in a statement in 2021 that anticipated an obvious concern: bias. Shilling for an insurance company or supermarket chain is unlikely to have life-altering consequences for listeners or pose ethics questions for outlets. As online sports betting surges, however, problem gambling hotlines are detecting increases in the volume and seriousness of calls, with support services and regulation struggling to keep pace with a boom that puts young people at particular risk. While responsible gambling advice routinely accompanies programming, it’s typically perfunctory. And pervasive sponsorship and industry-generated content mean fewer sources without potential conflicts of interest. “Betting-related controversies have swept through sports,” noted an ESPN website story examining the risks to leagues and players in March. Mentioned in passing in the middle of the article was the fact that ESPN signed a deal with a gaming operator last year to create a sportsbook named ESPN BET. Reporting on players embroiled in scandals is unavoidable: outlets could hardly ignore a Toronto Raptors player being banned from the NBA for life. But addiction is a public health issue and examining the role of the sports and media industries in a disorder that affects about 1% of ordinary, non-famous and less obviously news-worthy Americans, requires more pro-active and harder editorial choices. “Sport media companies in general may previously been playing a watchdog role in terms of the negative effects that gambling could have on sport, gambling addiction or players shaving points,” says Stephen Shapiro, a professor in the Department of Sport and Entertainment Management at the University of South Carolina. “Some of the traditional ways of covering gambling are going to change when companies like ESPN are in the business of gaming. Over time, does it erode some of the journalistic credibility that media might have in covering sport?” ESPN Bet is a minor player and ESPN insists that journalistic integrity is crucial to its brand. Still, breaking news, such as player injuries and coaching hires, has the potential to influence betting markets. In 2021 the Athletic and BetMGM announced an “exclusive partnership” and promised to “seamlessly blend media, analysis and betting”. Last year, the NBA “insider” Shams Charania, then a reporter with the Athletic, now at ESPN, sent a tweet about the draft that moved the odds on FanDuel – who happened to be paying him to appear on FanDuel TV. Like ESPN, The Athletic has ethics rules on gambling by its journalists that are designed to avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest. The Associated Press, a wire service that touts its independence, signed a deal in 2021 to make FanDuel its exclusive provider of sports odds. In 2021 the AP gave staffers who worked on the FanDuel deal an internal achievement award for “[turning] sports odds into an exciting revenue opportunity” that “is the type of business growth that is essential to AP’s future”. This year the AP switched its odds provider to BetMGM and even publishes columns provided by BetMGM, with one recently appearing online in the Washington Post. Media companies “know the revenue opportunities and so they’re willing to take a calculated risk that the consumer isn’t going to be bothered so much by the potential clash between promoting sport gambling and providing media coverage for those same sports,” Shapiro says. “Certainly I think the credibility of a media organization can be questioned when they’re in these partnerships and also reporting on issues related to sport gambling.” For broadcast networks, gambling tie-ins add a revenue stream that works in synergy with live and pre-game betting. “Sport gambling is a complementary activity to the core product so it’s ideal for second-screen usage,” Shapiro says. “What we’ve seen in our research is that an individual still is a traditional fan of a team, but they’re clearly consuming at a higher level: consuming more games, consuming games for a longer period of time the more that they’re involved in gambling.” More research needs to be done, Shapiro adds. “Are sport fans who gamble more interested in watching pieces of games instead of games in their entirety? Are they more interested in the beginning of a game or the end of a game? Are they more interested in players than actual teams? I think that’s the next stage in studying the impact of gambling on sport.” It’s not hard to imagine algorithm-driven future scenarios. Perhaps you’re watching your baseball team on television and they’re down by four runs heading into the ninth inning. You’re about to switch off - but then a tempting in-game wager promotion flashes up on the screen. You grab your phone or remote control, make the bet and keep watching: a win for the broadcaster, the gambling company and the league, regardless of the final score."

          "headline": "A stunning eco-cabin with scenery to match: a winter stay in remote Scotland",
          "bodyText": "I am sitting on a sofa with my feet up, next to a log-burning fire, which is crackling away. The view out of the floor-to-ceiling window in front of me is on to a mess of deciduous forest stripped of its colour by winter. Beyond the trees, the main character of the piece, Loch Fyne, shines. The month is late November, and Scotland’s longest sea loch wears a coating of ice; thin enough to sink a skater but thick enough to colour the reflection of the vermilion sky and the rolling hills beyond. My wife and I are staying here, at Kabn, for a long weekend. It is on the west coast of Scotland, just an hour from Glasgow, yet a world away. There are two “luxury eco-cabins” made of charred larch, meaning they are black but require no paint. Each looks out on the loch, and neither is in sight of the other. The interiors are inspired by Japanese minimalism and Scandinavian contemporary design. They are open-plan, with neutral colour tones and warm lights. There is a king-size bed, an en suite with a rainfall shower, and a breakfast bar with every utensil required, plus herbs, spices, oils and coffee. The loch is always in view, a few metres away, across a pebble beach. The cabins sit just beyond a coast road and viewpoint called the Rest and Be Thankful, and the name of that famous route sets the tone for the ethos here. This is a place for slow living; watching; noticing the colour of the leaves, the movement of the water and the mountainous reflections, which shift with the weather. My wife is still in bed, and my main pursuits so far today have been starting the log fire, unrolling a yoga mat, which I will not get around to using, and making a V60 coffee pour-over – which, admittedly, I had to watch a YouTube tutorial in order to do. The space is small, and making a coffee becomes an activity in itself – the hand grinder sending the scent upwards, the pause after the pour giving space to look at the loch anew. Is it all a bit bougie? Undoubtedly. I’m a keen hiker, usually more at home in a cold tent or on the floor of a bothy than in such chic surroundings. But the hot shower in the fancy bathroom with the vegan soap is very nice. And the organic mattress, combined with the duvet and blankets made from recycled plastic bottles, is very comfortable. Besides, who’s here to judge me? I pick up my binoculars (without moving) and find only a distant seal peering back. We leave the cabin in the afternoon for a low-level walk through the frost-touched Ardkinglas Estate, with clearings revealing the high-rising mountains of the Arrochar Alps behind. We watch a red squirrel scampering around, looking for a snack among the bare forest. This wider area is renowned for its hiking. One of Scotland’s finest mountains, Ben Arthur (better known as the Cobbler, for its distinctive summit), is very close, but we do not climb it. We do venture to the Fyne Ales brewery for a pint of Jarl, but don’t quite get around to visiting the picturesque town of Inverary nearby, or eating at the Inver restaurant, instead buying ingredients at the Loch Fyne Oyster Bar deli and cooking a meal of our own as the sun sets. The only downside of a winter visit is missing out on a visit to William Hamer at Wild Kabn Kitchen, a chef who has worked at Michelin-star restaurants and who cooks locally sourced food over open fires when the weather is amenable. There’s a lot to do here. On this visit, we don’t do much of it. We rest, and are thankful, instead.

          "bodyText": "That’s it for today, thanks for reading. Here’s a wrap of the main stories: Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, says Australia is “ready” for a second Trump presidency and he will work closely with the incoming administration; Opposition leader Peter Dutton’s position on international student caps is “utterly reckless”, the skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, says; The Victorian government announces it will spend $370m to build a massive solar farm and battery in Horsham, which will be able to power more than 50,000 homes and be wholly state-owned; Sydney trains will run on Thursday after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday; Crossbench senators are attempting to suspend standing orders in the upper house to force the Albanese government to better resource the procedure office, which helps parliamentarians with drafting legislation and amendments; Australia’s $50m Cop29 pledge is “nowhere near our fair share”, Greens senator says; and The share market has snapped its four-day winning streak, retreating from the previous day’s all-time high amid geopolitical jitters after Ukraine fired American-made ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time. We will be back here with more news tomorrow. Visa applications plunge in first quarter of 2024-2025 Visa applications have dropped by 28% for the first quarter of 2024-2025 compared with the same period in 2018-2019, the Department of Home Affairs has revealed, indicating current measures to reduce international student intake is working. An update on the federal government’s evidence level requirements released on Wednesday suggested there were “encouraging signs” in some offshore markets that the “quality” of foreign student visa applications had been improving, while refusal rates had also increased due to integrity measures to weed out non-genuine students. From today, student and provider risk ratings have been re-revalued under Ministerial Direction 107 to reward higher education institutions that showed improved performance in recruitment. As part of the rating, students from India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Columbia, Mongolia and Thailand are considered the highest risk (level 3), while Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Fiji are at a level 2. Universities have bemoaned the continuation of Ministerial Direction 107, introduced in December last year as a de facto cap to reduce visa approvals among high-risk universities. The vice-chancellor of La Trobe University, Prof Theo Farrell, released a statement earlier today expressing his “deep disappointment” by the failure of the Senate to pass legislation for international student caps, which was to replace the directive. Ministerial Direction 107 is a blunt and opaque instrument that has caused financial havoc … it has led to a handful of very large metropolitan universities becoming even larger … At the same time, many smaller universities, mostly in outer metro and regional areas, have suffered catastrophic losses in student numbers. Aussie shares dip from peak as Ukraine strikes Russia The share market has snapped its four-day winning streak, retreating from the previous day’s all-time high amid geopolitical jitters after Ukraine fired American-made ballistic missiles into Russia for the first time, AAP report. The benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index on Wednesday finished down 47.7 points, or 0.57%, to 8,326.3, while the broader All Ordinaries dropped 50.1 points, or 0.58%, to 8,579.1. In currency, the Australian dollar was at an eight-day high against its US counterpart, buying US65.26c, from US65.08c at Tuesday’s ASX close. Family of Melbourne teenager fighting for life after feared methanol poisoning hopes for answers The family of one of two teenagers fighting for life in hospital after a suspected methanol poisoning incident in Laos hope authorities work out exactly what happened “as soon as possible”. Melbourne friends Bianca Jones and Holly Bowles, both aged 19, had been staying at a hostel in Vang Vieng, north of the Laos capital, Vientiane, when they fell critically ill last week. They have since been hospitalised in Thailand, where their families have flown to be at their bedsides. You can read more on that story here: Many thanks for joining me on the blog today, I’ll hand over to Nino Bucci to take you through the rest of our coverage this evening. Take care, and I’ll see you bright and early tomorrow. David Coleman says Coalition wants social media ban passed by end of year The shadow communications minister, David Coleman, has also been up on the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing this afternoon, asked about the social media ban for under-16s – likely to be put before parliament tomorrow. Coleman said the Coalition would “work structurally with the government” and that he wants the bill to be passed by the end of the year. We will work constructively with the government and we will await the legislation when it is published tomorrow, but we want to get this done. Rio to take full control of uranium mine near Kakadu Mining giant Rio Tinto will shut down and rehabilitate a controversial uranium mine surrounded by the World Heritage Kakadu national park, AAP reports. Rio has announced it would compulsorily acquire the remaining shares it does not own in Energy Resources of Australia (ERA). The purchase will give it full control of the Ranger uranium mine, where rehabilitation activities have already started, and the nearby Jabiluka deposit in the Northern Territory, about 300km east of Darwin. The Rio Tinto chief executive of Australia, Kellie Parker, said the company would rehabilitate the Ranger Project Area to a standard that would establish an environment similar to Kakadu. She told the Australian Stock Exchange today: Our utmost priority and commitment is to complete this important rehabilitation project in a way that is consistent with the wishes of the Mirarr People. Proceeding with compulsory acquisition after participating for our full entitlement in the ERA capital raising underlines our commitment to Ranger’s rehabilitation. Rio said it did not intend to mine or develop the Jabiluka uranium deposit if its compulsory acquisition was completed. The skills and training minister, Andrew Giles, is speaking with the ABC’s Afternoon Briefing program about the legislation the government is attempting to pass during these last two sitting weeks. On the international student caps, he is asked what the next move is for the government, after the Coalition said it wouldn’t support the legislation? He responded: Peter Dutton has got to really offer a better and more convincing explanation of his position. It is utterly reckless and inconsistent with everything he has said. The best solution is that which is on the table. The best solution is the legislation that we have proposed and I am yet to hear a persuasive argument against it. Asked if he thinks there is a link between international student numbers and housing prices, Giles responded there was a “relatively small one”. Man dies after falling from electric skateboard in NSW A man has died after falling from an electric skateboard on the New South Wales Central Coast. The man reportedly fell about 6pm on Sunday near Umina Beach. Police said the 45-year-old was treated at the scene by paramedics before being airlifted to Royal North Shore hospital in a critical condition, where he later died. A report will be prepared for the coroner, police said, and anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. South Australia’s DV crisis line received record number of calls the day royal commission began work South Australia’s domestic violence crisis line received a record number of calls on 1 July – the same day the royal commission into domestic, family and sexual violence began its work. As AAP reports, the Women’s Safety Services SA chief executive, Maria Hagias, told the commission’s first day of public hearings the system is in crisis because it doesn’t have the resources to handle the significant increase in demand. The state domestic violence hotline received a record number of calls on the day the commission started its work, and expected to receive 35,000 calls for 2024. Hagias said: We can only answer 70% of those calls … this is an extreme challenge and it takes a lot of courage for people to call in. When you can’t pick up that phone to support that person at that time, there are extreme frustrations, not only from people who are trying to call in, but also external stakeholders because they can’t get through. That puts significant stress also on our frontline staff … and when you can’t reach every person that calls, it is extremely distressing. Of the 70% of answered calls, another 55,000 calls are then made to support families. The demand is significant, and the system isn’t coping, and it’s at crisis point. Lifeline: 13 11 14 And with that, question time has wrapped up. The Liberal National party MP Garth Hamilton has got up and asked another question on – you guessed it – nuclear energy. The acting PM, Richard Marles, said he was happy to stay on this topic “all day and every day between now and the next election”. The Australian people understand that, as the leader of the opposition pursues this ridiculous policy, that the only people who will end up paying for it is them. Every step that we take is going to be about putting downward pressure on the costs that they experience, which is so very, very different to what this leader of the opposition represents … what this leader of the opposition represents is a material and present risk to the household budget of every single Australian. Rowland says social media ban will contain ‘robust’ privacy provisions Rebekha Sharkie from the Centre Alliance party has asked about the government’s plan to ban social media for under 16s – specifically, how age verification will be obtained. The communications minister, Michelle Rowland, acknowledged that the policy is “contentious” and “one that has not actually been implemented at scale anywhere in the world”. The legislation that we will bring to this parliament will contain robust provisions as they pertain to privacy … this is precisely why we are undertaking the age assurance trial, which we funded in the budget. We will use this time during the age assurance trial, and I would point out that the legislation will contain a one-year implementation timeframe to ensure that these matters are of concern are ones that are properly examined and properly accounted for. I do want to make this message clear to the Australian people: this is not about government mandating any form of technology or demanding any personal information be handed over to social media companies. Coalition persists with questions on nuclear The deputy opposition leader, Sussan Ley, has asked the acting PM about a report from the US claiming a renewables-plus-nuclear electricity grid is cheaper than a renewables-only grid – because clearly, we were due for another question on nuclear. Responding to this, Richard Marles said the report would be “assessing an economy which already has a civil nuclear industry in place [and] where costs have already been put in place literally decades ago”. This seems to be the fact that has completely escaped those opposite, that in order for us to get to a point of having a civil nuclear industry, we would need to go through the process of establishing it – which is deeply costly. [It won’t be] the same as the calculation which exists in the United States or the United Kingdom or France, where they … have a civil nuclear industry already established, and those costs have already been sunk and are not priced into the future. But the reality of what we face is you can’t go out there and just magic the reactors, you’ve actually got to go and build them [and] that costs money, and the people who will pay for it are the Australian public. Infrastructure minister answers question on Middle Arm industrial project in Darwin Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown has asked whether the government would redirect costs for the Middle Arm hub to support clean energy projects instead. The infrastructure minister, Catherine King, said the government remains committed to Middle Arm and said: Let me just remind the House that this is an equity injection. It is not money that then can be transferred to other projects … The Australian government remains committed to Middle Arm, there are a number of processes that have to be gone through, through the environmental processes, through planning processes, as well, through Infrastructure Australia, and all of those are under way at the moment. But again, I say to the Greens, stop using politics constantly in these sorts of debates, stop using politics, because we know that Middle Arm actually does support renewable energy … and it also makes sure that we have a strong economic future for the Northern Territory. Nationals MP asks where is the housing for new immigrants Nationals MP Anne Webster has asked about housing and immigration. She claims that a new person is arriving to live in Australia every 44 seconds – where are these people meant to live? The housing minister, Clare O’Neil, responded that migration is “coming down because of changes that have been made by our government” and “if there is a single person in this parliament who is responsible for [the] broken [housing] system, he sits over there in the opposition leader’s chair”. She said the government arrived to office and found housing “in an absolute mess”, and said when the opposition was in government “they didn’t even have a commonwealth housing minister.” O’Neil took aim at the Liberals and Greens for not support its housing policies, and said: Now if only, Speaker, we had a parliament that actually wanted to work with us on this issue that affects millions of people … What we have is an opposition that knows only one word – no, no, no – to every single proposition that’s put forward. [The] Greens … talk a big game about housing, but when it comes time to make real change for real people, they say no too. So who would have thought the far left and the far right had so much in common in this country. Despite that opposition, we will work hard to make sure that we meet the housing needs of people in this country Marles says supporting a civil nuclear industry ‘makes no financial sense whatsoever’ The shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, has asked another question about – surprise, surprise – nuclear energy. He asked whether the government’s opposition to nuclear “has nothing to do with cost or time, but because of their political battle with the Greens in inner-city seats”? Richard Marles replied that “we do have a battle with the Greens political party, and we join that battle with relish”. Which really does stand in stark contrast to what we see from those opposite who, when it comes to housing, the environment or now immigration, are in the greatest love affair of all time with the Greens political party. I mean, I think Romeo and Juliet teaches us that love conquers all. But I definitely do not think that Shakespeare [could] imagine what was going on here. What we are seeing here is the most unholy alliance between the Greens and the Liberals. Marles echoed earlier comments, and said “the simple reason why we are not supporting a civil nuclear industry, it’s because it makes no financial sense whatsoever”. Marles on ‘crystal-clear articulation’ of Coalition philosophy While taking a dixer, Richard Marles pointed to some comments from the deputy opposition leader Sussan Ley yesterday in parliament, that “if you don’t pay for something, you don’t value it” – in reference to fee-free Tafe. You can read more on this in yesterday’s blog here. He said it gave “a crystal clear articulation of the philosophies of those opposite”, and said: This was exactly demonstrated when the leader of the opposition was the minister for health, when he tried to introduce a GP tax, when he tried to put a cost on the attendance at emergency departments right around the country, when he sought to increase the prices of basic medicines. And what he did as the minister for health, if given the chance, he would do as the prime minister across the board. Well, Mr Speaker, on this side of the house, we have a very different philosophy … Marles is asked again about civil nuclear industry Nationals MP Kevin Hogan has asked the acting prime minister whether the government signed an agreement under the Indo-Pacific economic framework that includes a cooperative work program to support the uptake of small modular nuclear reactors? Richard Marles said the opposition “crawl[s] to this topic through every different alleyway”, and repeated: But let me be really clear, what I can absolutely confirm is that this government is not going to be pursuing a civil nuclear industry … Kylea Tink asks about use of public money to pay interest on political party loans Independent MP Kylea Tink has asked the treasurer how the government can justify allowing public money to be used to pay the interest on political party loans, while ordinary Australians are struggling? The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, said minister Don Farrell “has been working for some time in a consultative way to do what we can to make sure that our donations regime is as transparent as possible, and that we take responsible and necessary steps to lessen the impact of big money on politics.” He urged the parliament to support the government’s measures – meaning the electoral reform legislation. In a question time where the opposition seemed set to put more focus on to nuclear energy, shadow energy minister Ted O’Brien has gotten himself kicked out quite quickly, after a strange interjection. Asking acting PM Richard Marles about “global momentum for nuclear energy”, and his claim that the government “remain stubbornly in opposition of this proven energy resource”, O’Brien took his seat. “The answer is – it’s all about cost and it’s all about economics. We don’t have a civil nuclear industry in Australia today. It is a significant fact, an inconvenient truth,” Marles started to respond – before O’Brien made a noisy shouted interjection. Marles called it a “ridiculous display”. O’Brien was ejected by speaker Milton Dick under standing order 94a. Richard Marles criticises ‘ridiculous’ Coalition nuclear policy After Labor’s Catherine King took a dixer on policies to address the gender pay gap, shadow climate and energy minister Ted O’Brien asked why the government remains opposed to exploring nuclear as an option. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said it comes down to cost. He began giving an answer but had to stop twice due to interjections, and O’Brien was sent out under 94a. Marles got up for a third time, and answered: It is a ridiculous policy that has been put forward by those opposite, and it simply fails to ignore the convenient truth for those opposite – that we don’t have a civil nuclear industry in Australia today and to establish one from scratch, costs money, and takes time. It’s not that simple, although the leader of the opposition may think it’s that simple, because he thinks that the way it works is that you go up and burn uranium, that we go out the back, set up a bonfire, throw some uranium on it, and bingo, there’s renewable energy. But unfortunately, that’s not how it actually works. He said the government’s renewables policy “stands in stark contrast to the ridiculous antics that we see from those opposite.” The opposition leader Peter Dutton has opened question time with a question to Richard Marles, again asking why Australia didn’t sign up to a civil nuclear deal signed by the US and UK. Marles answered questions about this yesterday, and the UK government admitted Australia was mistakenly included on a list of countries expected to sign up to the deal: Marles responded that “there’s a very similar simple answer to that question – because we don’t have a civil nuclear energy country, and nor do we seek to establish one.” We don’t seek to go down that path, so we are not a part of that agreement. And if we did go down that path, as the leader of the opposition is suggesting, there would be no prospect of any piece of electricity entering into the grid for two decades. Just minutes into Question Time, before Marles even gave his answer, Spence MP Matt Burnell was sent out under 94a for interjecting. Question Time will begin in about five minutes’ time. Grab a coffee and stay tuned, we’ll bring you the latest here in a moment. Shadow treasurer replies to Chalmers’ statement on the economy Earlier, the shadow treasurer, Angus Taylor, delivered a reply to treasurer Jim Chalmers’ statement on the economy (which you can read about earlier in the blog, here and here). He argued the government, in its nearly three years in office, has “made bad decisions and had the wrong priorities” – pointing to the money spent on the voice referendum and “three expansionary budgets that have kept inflation higher for longer”. He outlined the economic approach the Coalition would take if elected to government, and said: We will get our economy back to basics – fighting high prices and interest rates first, winding back regulatory roadblocks, boosting productivity and delivering lower, simpler and fairer taxes. We will also stand up for consumers, small businesses and farmers by delivering stronger penalties for anti-competitive behaviour in the supermarket and hardware sectors. We will support Australians to build businesses, not bureaucracies. We will ensure that Australians have more affordable and reliable energy by rejecting the government’s reckless renewables-only approach. We will restore the dream of home ownership and unlock up to 500,000 homes by investing in shovel-ready infrastructure that will enable homes to be delivered faster. We will reduce migration and place a two-year ban on foreign investors buying existing homes. We will tackle union corruption that is continuing to drive up building costs. And, we will take action to make our communities safer, including online. Aemo confident power strains can be managed next week as heatwave sweeps east As noted in earlier posts, we’ve got the combination of warm weather lapping across most of Australia’s population centres over the next few days. The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued updated lack of reserve level 3 alerts for Tuesday evening in New South Wales, seeking extra generation (latest alert has the potential “interrupted” supply at 142 megawatts). To stress: the alerts are intended to prompt a market response and aren’t a prediction of blackouts. Aemo also indicates that one issue was a transmission one – and the resolution of that should ease the grid strain. In the meantime, AGL Energy has provided an update on what’s happening to its Bayswater coal-fired power plant in the NSW Hunter Valley. It’s a big one, with about 2715MW capacity when all four units are online. However, unit 2 is offline until early December (circa the 6th) for planned maintenance. Its unit 1 is working fine and its unit 4 is expected to return to full operation this evening. Unit 3, though, is the one that lately dropped out of service for unscheduled “tube leak repair” work, an AGL spokesperson tells us. It’s expected to be back within 14 days if not sooner. Nick Bryant: ‘It almost seems like Australia has lost the ability to do big things’ Wrapping up his appearance at the NPC, Nick Bryant argued that it “hasn’t been a great century for Australia” when asked about an increasing focus on leaders, rather than policy issues, in the country. Bryant said the century started great for Australia with the Sydney Olympics, but “it hasn’t been a brilliant 23 years since.” You have had this churn of prime ministers, a politics that is incredibly destructive and personalised and it almost seems like Australia has lost the ability to do big things any more. The reform era was always based on big things. The reform era has sadly been replaced by a revenge era and a retribution era. It’s trying to get back to the reform era, big ideas rather than small-target politics. An optimism, which strikes me as the greatest natural characteristic that Australia has – there is a reason why the cameramen of the BBC are Australians – because they are optimistic and they always think they can do stuff. I don’t see that as much in modern Australia as when I first came here. Former BBC foreign correspondent Nick Bryant on right approach to Trump: ‘Don’t be bullied’ At the National Press Club today, former BBC foreign correspondent Nick Bryant has been speaking and taking questions from the crowd. He was asked to weigh in on Kevin Rudd’s role as ambassador to the US, and said Australia should stand by him: You cannot let America have a veto over your diplomatic appointments. The other point is, you cannot show weakness at the start of a new Trump era, right? I watch many international leaders deal with Donald Trump and they adopted a swathe of different approaches. Shinzo Abe tried to befriend him on the golf course … but Trump was still hostile against Japan. [Emmanuel] Macron did a faux friendship thing … Malcolm Turnbull had the right approach. Don’t be bullied … That is the approach to adopt with Trump, don’t concede ground. Watch: Kevin Rudd says he’s ready to work with incoming Trump administration Earlier, we brought you comments from ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, saying he is ready to work closely with the incoming Trump administration. Here is a video of the full comments he made via video link this morning, to the Sydney International Strategy Forum: Just following on from our last post: Brain Tumour Alliance Australia says it uses shoes to get its message across, because shoes “clearly visualise that brain tumours affect everybody regardless of age, gender or background and provide a powerful and impactful message to parliamentarians and to society.” A Parliament House courtyard has been filled with the shoes of people affected by brain tumours, as part of an annual “head to the hill” event. Brain Tumour Alliance Australia hosts the awareness event each year to advocate to government, saying that brain tumour research remains significantly underfunded compared with other cancers. Mike Bowers snapped these photos from the event earlier: Victorian renewable energy park to be completed by 2027, Jacinta Allan says Dubbed the SEC Renewable Energy Park, premier Jacinta Allan said the project will be capable of generating around 242,000 megawatt hours of renewable energy a year, or enough to power 51,000 homes. It will consist of 119-megawatt solar farm and 100-megawatt two-hour batteries, which will be developed by Swedish company OX2. Allan said the local community will also directly benefit from the profits from the projects, via a fund to be set up by the SEC. She said $42,000 a year will be spent in the local area during the project’s construction and a further $70,000 every year once the project is operational. It is expected to be complete by 2027 and will provide electricity to Victorian government schools, hospitals and offices. The Victorian government has announced it will spend $370m to build a massive solar farm and battery in Horsham, which will be able to power more than 50,000 homes and be wholly state-owned. The premier, Jacinta Allan, visited the city in Victoria’s west to announce the solar farm today as the second investment of the state’s State Electricity Commission. At the 2022 state election, the Labor government committed to reviving the SEC, which for decades was the sole agency in the state for electricity generation, transmission, distribution and supply before it was privatised in the 1990s. Allan said the solar farm would be the first 100% government-owned energy generation project since the commission was privatised in the 1990s. International student cap would lead to rents falling by just $5 a week in metro areas, report says International students are being scapegoated by both major parties as responsible for the housing crisis without evidence, the Student Accommodation Council has warned. A report released by the council last week found international students made up just 6% of the rental market and had a minimal presence in areas popular with families. It suggested capping international students at 270,000 per year, as Labor has lobbied for, would reduce their rental share by less than 1% – leading to lowered rents of just $5 a week for metropolitan areas. This week, the Coalition announced it would not support Labor’s cap on foreign students, with Peter Dutton maintaining yesterday “there is accommodation being taken up at the moment by international students that I believe very strongly should be occupied by Australian citizens”. The minister for home affairs, Tony Burke, pushed Dutton on his stance during Question Time, stating: If anybody is thinking because of the rate of immigration, they are having trouble getting into a home, just know the leader of the opposition has decided to make that worse. Student Accommodation Council executive director, Torie Brown, said while politicians were quick to blame international students for the housing crisis, it didn’t “reflect reality”. We need to address decades of structural failures across our housing markets and not unfairly pin the blame on a single group. International students only make up six per cent of the rental market – heavily weighted towards CBDs – with 73% of local government areas having an international student concentration of less than 1%.” Sydney train strike: all you need to know For all the Sydneysiders following along with today’s blog: here is everything you need to know about the train shutdown this weekend, with this explainer from Luca Ittimani: More on Jim Chalmers’ second ministerial statement on the economy Continued from the previous post: The Reserve Bank, though, has headline CPI rising by the middle of next year because they have to assume energy and other rebates expire – until the actual policy changes. As we have said often, it’s hard to believe pre-election campaign promises from both major parties won’t promise sizable “cost of living relief”. As for growth, Chalmers says: Treasury is expecting a gradual recovery in the economy driven by rising real incomes thanks to our cost-of-living relief, jobs growth and progress bringing inflation down. What we won’t see is a third consecutive budget surplus. That’s because government spending is rising but also because Australia’s exports of dirt (often red, as in iron ore, or black rock, with coal) won’t be delivering the budget upgrades of yore. In fact, iron ore prices are down 30% or more so far in 2024. But at about US$100 a tonne (as it was this morning), the commodity is still well above the conservative US$60/t average used by Treasury in its budget forecasts. So it’s likely we’ll get some revenue upgrades – unless China’s economy hits the proverbial wall – in the current budget. Just not as large as in previous budgets. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, is giving his second ministerial statement on the economy from noon, and it offers a “stocktake” on global and domestic conditions – and a bit of sneak peek at next month’s Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook (Myefo). As you might expect, it’s a generally upbeat speech, listing “significant progress” in fighting inflation, repairing the budget (and a few reforms) while Chalmers remains “optimistic” about the future. There’s not a lot of hard new numbers, though, it may be the first outing I’ve seen of a “1,000 jobs a day” created since the Albanese government took power 30 months ago. (We’ve known about the million jobs … though they may downplay that bit because we might yet get a few months of job cuts before they go to the polls.) Anyway, the inflation outlook will be largely in line with the May budget forecasts (with headline CPI falling to 2.75% by next June, and remaining there until the following June, before ebbing further in subsequent years to 2.5%). Canavan says Dutton did not ask for abortion bill to be removed Matt Canavan continued, from the previous post: I have this very simple, shared with Senator [Alex] Antic, very simple position on these issues, that any human being, no matter what their age, no matter what their state of health in this country, deserves to have care. That is all my bill does. Doesn’t change abortion procedure. Doesn’t restrict abortion procedures. It simply says that everybody, every Australian, deserves to have medical care appropriate to their circumstances. I will always defend that. Asked if Peter Dutton had asked them to remove the bill, Canavan said: “No one has done that.” We’ve got a great tradition in our party of respecting each other’s views. I do respect other views on this, but I would never seek to remove a Greens bill that took an opposite position than me on these issues. I have no problem debating my position but obviously the Greens are scared of a discussion. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan says he won’t back down after the Greens sought to remove his abortion-related bill from the Senate notice paper, accusing the minor party of seeking to “silence debate”. Canavan, the maverick Queenslander, said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has also not asked him or fellow co-sponsor, Alex Antic, to remove their “children born alive” bill from the Senate. Guardian Australia’s Karen Middleton reported overnight that the Greens senator Larissa Waters was seeking to have the Human Rights (Children Born Alive Protection) Bill discharged from the notice paper, where it has sat – without debate – for some time. Dutton told Coalition MPs in a party room address two weeks ago that they should avoid public debate about abortion, with concern the issue may have cost them seats at the Queensland state election. Asked about Waters’ push and the status of his bill, Canavan said: “The status of it is it’s on the notice paper.” This is an attempt to censor and silence debate … but obviously I do actually welcome the opportunity that Senator Waters has given me to state again that there are around two babies a week in this country born alive following a termination procedure. Canavan was at a press conference with Antic and the American free speech campaigner Michael Shellenberger, discussing the government’s misinformation bill – which is in danger of going down in flames, with little support on the Senate crossbench thus far. Coalition bill on McPhillamys goldmine rejected by Senate The Coalition is livid that its bill on the McPhillamys goldmine was rejected by the Senate this morning, with Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price accusing the Labor government of seeking “to keep Indigenous Australians disadvantaged in order to better control them”. Now to recap, this is the proposed goldmine at Blayney, in central west NSW, which was put in jeopardy after a decision by the environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, to prevent a tailings or run-off dam being built in one part of the project. It came after a Wiradjuri elder lodged an application to protect Aboriginal heritage from being destroyed. The Coalition has been continually outraged over the decision, citing a combination of local economic benefits and criticism of how the environmental consultation process was carried out, including concerns raised by other local local Aboriginal land council groups. The Coalition had put up a Senate bill which sought to prevent “the minister from making a declaration that would affect the construction or operation of a goldmine in the Blayney goldmine area.” But it was quashed at the second reading stage of debate, negatived 24-27 in a Senate vote today. Shadow ministers Jonno Duniam, Susan McDonald and Price gave a press conference shortly afterward, again criticising the original decision and how Plibersek came to it. McDonald claimed the government wasn’t doing enough to support mining, but Price – the shadow Indigenous Australians minister – raised concerns about the loss of income for local Aboriginal people. She said: They’re not doing anything to benefit Indigenous people in this country, and so in this situation, it’s whole communities that are missing out. This government is completely against ensuring that Indigenous Australians can benefit in any economic way going forward. But that’s not surprising to Labor, because Labor like to keep Indigenous Australians disadvantaged in order to better control them, in order to gain power and keep the little people down. I mean, why would they? Why would they allow for a development like this to take place, which would mean opportunity, which would mean jobs for the Indigenous community in the area, and more broadly, the wider community. Government’s spending and donation cap bill receives second reading The government’s controversial spending and donation cap bill has just received a second reading in the House of Representatives. The independent MP Kate Chaney is moving amendments that remove provisions on spending caps and increased public and administrative funding. Chaney says these are the “most offensive parts” of the bill. She says: The way this legislation is drafted, any ads that are not for the individual but for a party are not counted within the [$800K] divisional cap, so a party incumbent could outspend a challenger many times over … This is not a level playing field. Chaney argues that in a “cost-of-living crisis” the government should not be increasing public funding of elections by $40m: Parties are able to make a profit in unwinnable seats and shift that money to where they are being challenged … It gives them a war chest to fight any new challengers. It’s fine for me – I’m an incumbent. But it’s not fine for anyone new, who thinks we need new ideas and new ways of being represented in our politics. This reduces competition, and it’s not on. The independent MP Kylea Tink is now speaking in support of the amendments. ‘Wave of heat’ to elevate fire risks and electricity demand, meteorologists say We’re not officially in summer for another week and a half but for many in Australia’s south-east, it will certainly feel like it in the coming days. Dean Narramore, a senior forecaster at the Bureau of Meteorology, says day- and night-time temperatures will be as much as 8-14C warmer than usual for this time of year: We’re going to see the heat really start increasing across South Australia tomorrow, and then continue building there and into Tasmania, Victoria and southern New South Wales Friday and through the weekend. Some areas will endure a low-intensity heatwave although pockets can also expect severe conditions. As mentioned in our earlier post, the tail end of the warmth – what the Weatherzone senior meteorologist Ben Domensino dubbed a “wave of heat” – will also push up electricity demand. Domensino said: It’s probably the warmest burst of heat that we’ve had [so far this warming season], because the dew-point temperatures will be increasing as well. There’s a bit of moisture in the atmosphere, which will make it feel quite muggy with this hot weather. It’ll feel quite warm. Air-conditioning demand will likely be high. Relatively light winds will also mean there probably won’t be a lot of windfarm electricity generation, Domensino said. The lack of wind, though, will also mean fire danger levels – apart from the Eyre Peninsula and some other parts of South Australia – won’t be quite as elevated as they might otherwise have been. Chalmers outlines plan to encourage more women to study economics Last night the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, addressed the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia, revealing a plan to encourage more women to study economics and take up economic leadership roles. Chalmers said he has put on the agenda for the next meeting of state and territory treasurers next week: Exploring ways we can work together to lift barriers to the study of economics. The role treasuries can play, as stewards of the discipline, in making the profession more inclusive. How we can bring a broader range of views and perspectives into future public policy and advice. How we increase the number of women in economic leadership positions at all levels of government, including by exploring more robust and regular reporting. Chalmers also discussed some of the causes of alienation in politics: But underpinning, if not undermining, all of our efforts across all of these policy areas is the sense laid bare in the final report of the Covid review that there has been an erosion of trust in institutions, like governments. As Mark Butler said when we released that Covid report, it is going to be a long, hard road to get trust to the level it was before the pandemic. It’s easily lost and hard to build it back up … The loss of trust is not just from Covid, though, that’s just one of three shocks in 15 years – The GFC before it and an inflation spike exacerbated by two wars – Which have created economic and social undercurrents that revealed themselves around the world over this longer period, and not just recent weeks in US politics. These undercurrents have created a sense of alienation. Earlier this morning, some parliamentarians in Canberra attended the lighting of the giving tree in the marble foyer of Parliament House. Each year, Parliament House raises money for two charities through the giving tree. The president of the Senate, Sue Lines, and the speaker, Milton Dick, switched on the lights and announced the 2024 charities just earlier. And Mike Bowers was there to capture all the action: Leading economic indicator reports strongest result since July 2022 We’ve noted in a couple of places (such as here) that the worst of the economic slowdown is probably behind us (unless there is some nasty surprise looming). The solid labour market, tax cuts that are flowing and easing inflation suggest things are starting to look up. (Corporate failures, a lagging indicator, might have a way to rise further, though.) The Leading Index published by Westpac and the Melbourne Institute adds to the signs of a possible upturn gaining momentum. The index moved firmly into positive territory last month (going from -0.2% in September to +0.26%), and is now at its highest level since July 2022’s 0.63% reading. Back in mid-2022, the burst of economic activity after Covid-19 was fully under way, Ryan Wells, a Westpac economist, said. The index’s return to positive territory was “broadly consistent with Westpac’s view that the pace of [annual] economic growth, having hit a nadir of 1.0% in the middle of the year, is set to pick up pace, reaching 1.5% by year-end and 2.4% by the end of 2025”, Wells said. Not quite economic nirvana, mind, but something of a soft landing particularly if the Reserve Bank starts to cut interest rates from early 2025 (as Westpac predicts for February). Of course, if the leading index keeps rising, the RBA might think it’s too early to cut. Anyway, it all keeps a few pundits in business. 90% of industrial gas use can be electrified or regassed with green hydrogen: report Earlier today, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union and Lock the Gate launched a report commissioned from Springmount Advisory called Turning Down the Gas, which found that at least 90% of industrial gas use can already be electrified or regassed with green hydrogen, and technology solutions are rapidly being developed for the remaining 10%. It found gas demand could decrease 216 petajoules by 2035, including by: Replacing gas use in manufacturing with electricity using technology that is commercially available today would reduce demand by 112PJ. Doing the same in commercial buildings would reduce gas demand by 25PJ. “Regassing” and substituting metals smelting and refining, iron and steel manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing with green hydrogen would cut gas use by 62PJ. If gas use were reduced by this much, wholesale gas expenses would be reduced by at least $2.5bn, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions by more than 11m tonnes each year. The national secretary of the AMWU, Steve Murphy, said: Australia must prioritise our finite and precious gas resources to support the industries that employ hundreds of thousands of highly skilled workers and that underpin every aspect of Australian life, from food production and health, to infrastructure and household goods. There is a clear national interest in ensuring that local manufacturing industries are supported and thrive as the world decarbonises. We commissioned this report because it is clear to us that the interests of gas companies are cutting across the interests of Australian workers, Australian industry, our rightful place as the leader in our region for a fair and just industrial transition. I’m a firm believer that we can meet our commitments to climate action and create secure jobs in manufacturing if we make those two goals a national priority. Government senator says motion in Senate was about creating conflict Back in the Senate, the emergency management minister, Jenny McAllister, said she was disappointed crossbenchers chose to create conflict over discussion after being caught off-guard by a surprise suspension to the standing orders this morning. Those on the crossbench are frustrated with the amount of legislation the Labor government is attempting to push through the Senate this sitting fortnight. In particular, they’re concerned the drafting office – which supports them with amendments – is overloaded and under-resourced. McAllister stood up to say the government would not support the motion, saying it was not the appropriate place to raise it. She said: The appropriate place to raise this is either through discussions, informally, or through referral to the appropriations committee, which is the entity which oversees the budget for the Senate. And it is disappointing that the matter is instead being raised in this way, without notice, without discussion, and suggests that the people who are seeking to resolve it are not, in fact, seeking to truly resolve it, but actually to escalate a conflict, where a better and effective way of doing it would be through conversation. As McAllister delivered her response, Jacqui Lambie can be heard on the parliamentary broadcast interjecting off-microphone. Ultimately, the motion passed but unless the government actually allocates extra resourcing, that’s where it ends for now. But not before Lambie gets the last word: So for the last two years, we’ve been telling you this is a problem. So to come in here and act like everything’s all kosher and it’s fine and that we haven’t been doing anything for two years – now, I intend to come back in here tomorrow and do this again tomorrow morning, unless something is done today. Australia’s ambassador to the US, Kevin Rudd, says Australia is “ready” for a second Trump presidency. Rudd gave a speech to the Sydney International Strategy Forum this morning via video link, and said the embassy had been working over the course of the last year to “ensure that we were well prepared for this moment” – meaning the US election outcome. And the bottom line is, we’re ready. The team here at the embassy and the government of Australia are ready to work closely with the new Trump administration to continue to realise the benefits of what is a very strong economic and security partnership. Rudd said that Australia’s bilateral relationship with the US “has never been more relevant, or more important”, in this “age of strategic competition”. We live in a world of many challenges and we are clear that the region we want, the interests we have and the values we share require and call for our two nations to work together. And that is what we will continue to do with President Trump and his incoming administration. We here at the embassy in Washington look forward to contributing to that in the future. Rudd made headlines this month after deleting tweets he previously made about Trump, saying it did not reflect the views of the Australian government. Shortly afterwards, a senior Trump adviser reposted Rudd’s congratulatory statement to Trump on social media with a gif of an hourglass. Back in the Senate, and Greens senator Larissa Waters has accused the Albanese government of trying to curb the power of the crossbench in the Senate by “diminishing” their resourcing. Some of the independents banded together to suspend the standing orders to raise the resource issue within the drafting office, with senators warning the office couldn’t cope with the workload. For non-government senators, the office helps draft its amendments to bills. Waters said: When the drafters say to us, ‘look, we’re really sorry, but we’re slammed. There’s not enough of us to do the work that you need us to do, because the government haven’t [sic] given us the staff to do that work’. It’s not their fault. It’s the fault of the government not hiring enough people to do the work to help the Greens and the crossbench fix the government’s weak legislation. The ACT senator David Pocock added: When you cannot get amendments that are based on what you’re hearing from experts – when they have concerns about a government bill, when you’re hearing from people that you represent and you want to move amendments that reflect that, and you’ve got a government that seems intent to drop hundreds of pages of legislation, forgo all parliamentary scrutiny and ram it through, and you cannot move amendments – this is not good for our democracy. The Liberals supported the suspension, so Lambie was able to move the motion. More than 100 Sydney train services cancelled or delayed yesterday amid industrial action Back at the press conference on Sydney Trains, a spokesperson said more than 100 train services were cancelled or delayed across Sydney yesterday. I know that created and continues to create inconvenience for passengers as they move around the network. Please be assured that our teams are doing their very best to keep the system running reliably. He said there were cancellations on the intercity line, particularly services coming in from Gosford and Newcastle, and buses were replacing the Blue Mountain services for three hours today as a result of industrial action. Our teams are doing their best and we ask passengers to please be respectful of our staff, they are doing everything they can to help passengers navigate the challenging period. Crossbench senators are attempting to suspend the standing orders in the upper house in order to force the Albanese government to better resource the procedure office, which helps parliamentarians with drafting legislation and amendments. The motion, moved by Jacqui Lambie and co-signed by David Pocock, Lidia Thorpe, Fatima Payman and Larissa Waters, calls on the government to urgently hire more legislative drafters in the Department of the Senate before any “further controversial bills” are brought forward. First up to speak is Lambie, who describes the under-resourcing as “absolutely disgraceful”. We can’t get our stuff drafted, and you’re trying to throw through 20 bills in a fortnight? What is wrong with you? … The lack of resourcing is an absolute choke on democracy. The legislation that the government is trying to jam through is massive and has serious consequences. Other independent senators are getting up to speak. NSW transport minister addresses media amid strike affecting Sydney trains The NSW transport minister, Jo Haylen, has been speaking to reporters in Sydney after the announcement that Sydney trains will run tomorrow, after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday. You can read more on this earlier in the blog, here. Speaking just now, Haylen said: The actions are still in place for Friday and Saturday, causing potential massive disruption to our network and meaning that people cannot get where they need to go. The only way to keep our network running and to make sure people can get where they need to go is for the union to withdraw their industrial actions that are currently in place for Friday and Saturday. That remains our ask of the unions. She said the government would continue to meet with union leadership, but her responsibility is to “make sure that we can keep the travelling public up-to-date”. … to give them as much notice as possible and to do everything I can to minimise disruptions and keep our network running, while also continuing our negotiations and conversations with the unions to reach agreement. Instagram users will be able to refresh algorithm, Meta says Two days after a parliamentary committee recommended that users be able to have more control over their algorithm, Instagram has announced it will roll out a way for users to reset their algorithm that recommends content to them. In a blog post today, Instagram’s parent company Meta said the new feature will be rolled out in the coming weeks, and allow people, with a few taps, to reset what Instagram shows them in explore, reels and their feed: Your recommendations will start to personalise again over time, showing new content based on the content and accounts you interact with. When resetting, you’ll also have the option to review the accounts you’re following and unfollow any that share content you no longer want to see. Resetting the algorithm was one of the key recommendations of the parliamentary committee examining social media’s report, released on Monday. However, the recommendation went further including allowing users to opt out of the algorithm altogether. It’s one of a number of moves Meta has made in recent months to respond to increased political scrutiny on the impact platforms are having on society, including recently the introduction of Instagram accounts for teens with more restrictions over who they can follow, who can message them and what they can see. The committee, notably, did not recommend banning under-16s from social media, which the government is planning to legislate, instead calling for a report on the outcome of a trial of age assurance technology to be provided to the parliament when it is completed in mid-2025. The law academic Anne Twomey has written a piece for Guardian Australia, arguing that aspects of Labor’s electoral reforms are vulnerable to constitutional challenge. You can read her full piece below: Earlier this morning, we reported that Australia has pledged $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world’s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown, at the Cop29 summit. The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi says this funding is a start, but “nowhere near the fair share for a country which is one of the largest exporters of coal and gas”. This pledge risks becoming a token gesture if the Albanese government continues to approve new coal and gas mines that will keep exacerbating climate driven disasters which results in the loss and damage suffered by the Global South. The climate crisis is having a severe impact on Pacific nations who did nothing to create this disaster, yet bear the burden of the damage caused. Pacific nations need real and strong action from countries like Australia – that means ending new coal and gas, not pouring fuel on fire by opening the floodgates for fossil fuel projects. Anthony Albanese has met with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil. During the leaders’ opening remarks for their 10th meeting since May 2022, Anthony Albanese said India and Australia could build a “stronger, safer and more prosperous future for citizens in both of our countries”. The two discussed “increasing two-way trade, business engagements and market access for goods and services” as well as security in the Indo-Pacific region. Albanese said the countries would renew their defence and security pact next year after it was first signed in 2009. While no specific threats or countries were mentioned by name in the official statement, both leaders touched on their mutual interest in maintaining regional security and stability. Modi said: Friends, we have been working together to promote peace, stability and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, and we will continue to do so. We have stressed on dialogue and diplomacy to solve global conflicts and tensions. Albanese said: Prime minister Modi and I have also committed to developing a joint maritime security collaboration roadmap, including to deepen maritime domain awareness. Australia’s relationship with India is stronger, deeper and more consequential than ever before. Independent Tasmanian MP disappointed state government walking back plans for mandatory pre-commitment card The independent Tasmanian MP Meg Webb was on ABC RN earlier this morning, discussing the state government’s decision to walk back plans for a mandatory pre-commitment card. Yesterday, Tasmanian parliament moved to debate a motion of no-confidence in the premier, Jeremy Rockliff, after the government failed to vote it down. Webb said she had suspected the government would walk away from the card, and “unfortunately, yesterday, what came out was a firm indication that they are entirely abandoning … that card.” They’re not using that language. They’re saying it’s deferred indefinitely. But the reality is, if you’re deferring something and then you’re not continuing to work on it, you’re actually abandoning it. Before working in parliament, Webb worked for Anglicare. She said it is “insidious” the way poker machines are placed into local suburbs in Tasmania: We see that placed into our poorest suburbs where people are most vulnerable, because they’re already under financial stress. They’re most vulnerable to becoming addicted to these machines. They take millions and millions of dollars out of our poorest communities. And of course, it’s not just the person who has developed a problem with their poker machine use losing all their money, it’s actually having catastrophic losses, losing their housing. It also breaks up families. The impact flows out from that person. Albanese says Australian jobs were focus at G20 summit The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has shared some images from G20 to X and said the summit was “all about creating jobs in Australia.” Inflation is a global problem, and it requires a global response. And Australia’s relationships around the world matter. Here at this summit in Brazil, I’ve been able to meet with leaders to work on solutions to our shared challenges. Addressing supply chain issues that have pushed up prices, global action on climate change, and the opportunities that clean energy provides to our economies were key points of discussion. Summits like the G20 are all about how we can make sure that everyone benefits from economic growth. By making Australia’s voice heard, we can shape solutions that benefit Australians. Coalition nuclear costings to be released ‘very soon’, Littleproud says David Littleproud was pushed for when the Coalition will release the costings for its nuclear energy plan, and he responded: “Very soon.” We made it clear you will see it well before Christmas and well before the election. Nationals introduce bill to implement national standard for organic products The Nationals leader, David Littleproud, was also on ABC News Breakfast earlier this morning, when he spoke about the party’s decision to introduce legislation ensuring organic products in the supermarket are actually organic. He claimed that imported products can have as little as 2% organic material, so “Australian consumers are being misled about the standards they are consuming”. We’ve taken the unprecedented step of introducing a bill ourselves to bring in a national standard for organics … We think farmers should be protected in knowing what is being imported. You can have confidence in Australian produce, but it will also give us the export advantage where it is costing our farmers hundreds of thousands of dollars individually each time they go to crack a new international market. Littleproud said he would have no issue with the government changing a couple of words and reintroducing it in their name if that’s what is required to pass the changes, because “this is beyond politics”. If the Albanese government won’t do this, then we’ve made it as a significant commitment that it will be one of the bills to be reintroduced under a Coalition government. The bill was introduced to parliament yesterday. The Australian Energy Market Operator has issued an alert about a possible blackout for some customers in NSW next Tuesday evening – a fairly rare warning. To be clear, an Aemo alert is NOT a forecast of what’s to come but a call to the market to respond. As of this morning, the supply gap is a bit under 400 megawatts from 4.30pm to 8pm. (Aemo uses AEST time, hence the adjustment to the note in X post below.) The so-called lack of reserve level 3 is a bit of a rare thing. According to Dylan McConnell, an energy expert at UNSW, there has only been one other such alert issued for NSW since 2019 (excluding the market chaos that triggered a suspension in 2022). Across the national electricity market, there have only been 14 LOR3s across the five eastern states (only Western Australia and the Northern Territory are not in the Nem), McConnell says. Part of the issue is an expected spike in power demand as an early season heatwave sweeps across the east. Western Sydney will have had five days with maximums in the 30s by Tuesday, with the CBD forecast to reach 31 on that day too. There’s also a prediction of relatively little wind. However, the coal-fired power plants aren’t looking in good shape. AGL’s Bayswater unit 2 is offline for major maintenance until 8 December. Its unit 3 was also shut for unplanned work, according to WattClarity, an energy website. Other units offline include Vales Point 6, Eraring 3, and Tallawarra 1 (a gas-fired plant), so there’s 2,630MW unavailable. There are also other Aemo alerts at a lesser LOR2 level for both next Monday and Tuesday for NSW. It will be interesting to watch if the market does respond to the Aemo alerts – or whether other action might need to be take (ie turning off big power users). Littleproud says Coalition’s alternative plan on international student numbers will be detailed before election The leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, spoke with ABC RN earlier this morning about the Coalition’s decision to oppose government legislation capping international student numbers. He was asked what the Coalition’s alternative plan is, if they’re not backing the legislation? Littleproud said “you’ll see our detailed caps before the election”. We made it very clear we don’t intend to hide anything … We intend to reduce our migration and determine who comes to this country, the skills they have and where they should live … He said that state and local governments need time to build housing supply and “they need the human capital” to do so: So let’s get our migration working for Australia and making sure we get the settings right, and give the state local government some time to build some homes and give some hope to young people that they might own a home in Australia one day. Independent MP urges federal battery rebate scheme The teal MP Kylea Tink has called on the Albanese government to back a federal battery rebate scheme to support households and small businesses invest in battery storage technology. In a joint statement with Solar Citizens, she says a well-funded rebate scheme, supported by a target of 1m batteries nationally by 2030, would “also create new, well-paid green jobs in our suburbs and towns”. With over 8,000 people calling for a federal battery program, it’s clear voters want the government to support the rollout of small-scale battery storage solutions and it makes absolutely no sense that energy and climate change minister Chris Bowen has to date ignored the petition from Solar Citizens. More than 8,000 people have signed a Solar Citizens petition calling for a federal subsidy to drive the rapid rollout of small-scale battery storage. The statement notes modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator, showing the equivalent to 1m household batteries are needed nationally by 2030 to harness the rooftop solar uptake and stabilise the energy grid. But household batteries remain the only technology in Aemo’s roadmap without a federal government policy to drive delivery, the statement says. Solar Citizens’ national campaigns director, Joel Pringle, says solar batteries typically cost more than $10,000, with payback periods ranging between five and 10 years. With the current cost-of-living crisis, batteries are often not an affordable option and that’s why government financial support for batteries is needed. Sydney trains will run on Thursday after a small concession from the rail union to delay strike action until Friday, AAP reports, amid an ongoing wage dispute with the government. A months-long dispute between the NSW government and the state branch of the Rail, Tram and Bus Union escalated yesterday when the transport minister, Jo Haylen, announced no train services would run for four days: But early this morning Transport for NSW said it had agreed with the union to run services on Thursday, a relief for Pearl Jam concertgoers who would have had to find alternative transport to Sydney Olympic Park in the evening. A spokesperson said: At this stage the RTBU has not agreed to lift their industrial action they have planned for Friday through to Sunday. The notified bans in place by the union will bring the heavy rail network to a shutdown on Friday, Saturday, and through until Sunday morning this weekend. Haylen is hoping the concession will give the union and the government more time to come to an agreement before the weekend. She told 2GB: It gives us another day to continue our negotiations and hopefully get people where they need to go. But the union industrial action is still planned for Friday and Saturday and we know that’s going to have a massive impact on millions of people who rely on these train services. One-third of young Australians say they are willing to lie, commit violence, send threatening messages to MPs or vandalise government offices in support of a cause they care about. As AAP reports, a new survey by the Susan McKinnon Foundation quizzed 3,000 voters across Australia on their attitudes to political polarisation and social cohesion. The majority, 55%, said Australia has become more divided compared to five years ago, with 27% saying they feel the country is extremely or very divided. Generational differences about how to deal with views on social justice were stark, with between 2% and 4% of people over the age of 55 backing similar responses to their young counterparts. One in three generation Z voters and a quarter of millennial voters said they were prepared to support actions including encouraging or using violence, sending threatening or intimidating messages to members of parliament, damaging property, vandalising government offices and lying to advance a cause they cared about. The program lead at the Susan McKinnon Foundation’s McKinnon poll, Matt Crocker, said the survey reflected “some emerging areas of concern”. While young people have always been passionate for social change, younger people appear more willing to support some practices that can undermine safety and circumvent our democracy. The high level of support for some of these practices is surprising and concerning. A bare majority of Australians believe both extreme left views (51%) and extreme right views (53%) are a serious threat to the country. However, the research also found that those with stronger political views were more likely to blame the other side. It found that 76% of those on the left were much more likely to think extreme right views were a problem, while those on the right (71%) were much more likely to think extreme left views were a problem. Marles says the cost of online scams is rising On ABC RN, the acting PM was asked about the latest Australian Signals Directorate findings that cybercriminals are using fake QR codes or sophisticated AI scams to trick Australians into giving up their private details or downloading dangerous files. Richard Marles said the ASD is seeing reports every six minutes, and the cost of each of those attacks is going up: We are worryingly seeing an increased focus by both cybercriminals and state actors on our critical infrastructure, and that’s something which has become much more prevalent in the course of the last year … One of the actions that we take is attribution. We have raised attribution in respect of China, in respect of Russia, in respect of Iran. We do so very carefully in circumstances where we can, but attribution is an important tool that we have applied more in the last year than we have ever done. Marles says government will raise Gordon Ng sentence with Chinese government Richard Marles was also asked about news that 45 pro-democracy activists were arrested in Hong Kong, including the Australian-Hong Kong dual national Gordon Ng, after the city’s largest national security trial. He said the government is “very concerned”, specifically about the sentence applied to Ng, and “we will continue to make representations in respect of the sentence”. But beyond that, as you say, we are very concerned about the application of the national security law in Hong Kong, and obviously in terms of how it’s been applied to Gordon Ng, and that’s a point that we made when the original conviction occurred … [This is] a matter that we will continue to raise with the Chinese government in all of our advocacy, and this is a consular matter which is front and centre in terms of the way in which we are engaging with China. Will the government seek to reopen the embassy in Ukraine? Richard Marles said it was “something we want to do”. We’ve been wanting to do it for some time. We do have our ambassador in the region, who operates out of Warsaw. This is a matter of making sure, obviously, in the context of a war zone, that we can open this in a manner which is safe for all of those who would be in the embassy. And so this continues to be a work in progress around how that can be done, but we are engaging closely with Ukraine. Marles weighs in on latest developments on war on Ukraine Richard Marles also spoke with ABC RN just now, asked about the latest developments out of the war in Ukraine. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons after the Biden administration’s decision to allow Ukraine to strike targets inside Russian territory with US-supplied longer-range weapons. Asked for his reaction, Marles told the program: It’s completely reprehensible on the part of Russia. I mean, there’s only one country which is talking about using nuclear weapons, and that’s Russia … Russia’s cooperation with North Korea, such that we now have North Korean troops massing on the Ukrainian border, is an appalling escalation in what is already an appalling conflict … What’s at issue here is the global rules-based order, which is very much in Australia’s national interest, and that’s why we will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes for this conflict to be resolved on its terms. So you don’t see it as a dangerous escalation from the US to allow Ukraine to use these missiles to strike on Russian territory? Marles said this was Ukraine defending itself: Ukraine is the country that was attacked. It was Russia which crossed the border into Ukraine and began this war, and Ukraine has a right to defend itself. It’s not Ukraine who’s talking about an escalation to a nuclear level … at every point it is Russia which is escalating this. The acting prime minister, Richard Marles, was on ABC News Breakfast earlier and was asked about the Coalition’s attack on the government for not joining a US-UK civil nuclear deal (as we flagged earlier). Marles said the opposition leader, Peter Dutton, is “intentionally seeking to conflate two ideas here and, frankly, spread a form of misinformation really”. We don’t have a civil nuclear industry. This is an agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States to cooperate in respect of their civil nuclear industries. It is simply not an agreement which would apply [and] sits completely separately to what we are doing with the UK and the US in relation to Aukus, which is an agreement that is proceeding very well. Marles said what is “embarrassing” is Dutton’s proposition that “Australia should walk down from where we are now in having no civil nuclear industry, to trying to acquire one”. That is embarrassing because it would be pursuing for Australia the single most expensive form of electricity on the planet, like $1,200 on each and every household’s budget power bills, that would be the increase by walking down that path. We wouldn’t see it for a couple of decades and even when it came into place, it would contribute at most about 4% to the power grid. Putting that proposition in front of the Australian people, that is what’s embarrassing. Clean Energy Council data shows surge in renewables since 2015 has reduced relative emissions by 30% Kane Thornton, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Council, was up on ABC RN earlier this morning to discuss its new report – showing a surge in renewables since 2015 has reduced emissions by 30%, relative to if Australia had remained reliant on the 2015 fleet of power stations. This morning, he told the program this was a good news story for the sector: About five years ago, we were at around 15 or 16% of the grid coming from renewables. Today, we’re over 40% and by the end of next year, we’ll be pretty close to 50%. So a pretty dramatic increase in the amount of renewables in the grid, which is obviously great for emissions, it’s also great because coal-fired power stations are starting to close down, they’re starting to get less reliable, and that renewable electricity is also [helping keep] power prices down and keep the lights on. Thornton said the data shows the importance of having confidence about the future and “all political parties having a clear vision and … being aligned on targets”. Where they’ve got that sort of certainty, then investors will put significant money on the table, and that rate of renewables accelerates. Where there’s uncertainty about the future, then the rate of new investment tends to slow down. Cost of living, cybersecurity and AI top ethical considerations for Australians: report The Governance Institute of Australia’s 2024 ethics index shows that cost-of-living pressures and concerns about cybersecurity and AI are the top ethical considerations for Australians. Based on a survey conducted with Ipsos, Australians perceived supermarket pricing as the most unethical behaviour (-50) while perceptions of GPs who don’t offer bulk billing have also fallen further (-33). In terms of government promises ahead of the next federal election, Australians ranked affordable housing, renewable energy and grocery prices as their top three campaign topics. But the Governance Institute CEO, Megan Motto, said clear differences emerge when examining election promises by party preference: Liberal voters favour nuclear power, while Labor voters focus on affordable housing, renewable energy and union actions. There is also a significant difference in perceptions of US relations based on the election result. Fire services (76), nurses (75) and ambulance services (74) were seen as the most ethical jobs, while real estate agents (-18), federal politicians (-15) and state politicians (-6) were seen to be the least ethical. The report also found that the ethical obligation for organisations to tackle climate change, even if it results in reduced profits or job losses, has increased significantly over the past year. The ANU’s National Dictionary Centre has selected the portmanteau – or blended word – “Colesworth” as its word of the year, highlighting the perceived duopoly of Australia’s largest supermarket retailers Coles and Woolworths. A senior researcher at the centre, Mark Gwynn, says the phrase has been around for a number of years but usage has spiked recently as ordinary Australians vent their frustration at the increasing prices of food staples and questionable pricing practices. Aussies walk out of the supermarket with less after paying more, but then hear news of massive profits in the supermarket sector. And with official investigations into some of the pricing practices at Australia’s two largest supermarkets, it’s no wonder that ordinary shoppers have become cynical. The blend of the supermarket names Coles and Woolworths into Colesworth provides a succinct way of referring to both supermarkets while at the same time hinting at the negative aspects of what is perceived as an unfair duopoly. Some other words on the shortlist were breaking (in reference to Raygun’s Olympic appearance), climate trigger, ute tax (a derogatory term for the new fuel efficiency standard) and YIMBY (yes in my back yard). Oxfam reacts to Australia’s Cop29 pledge Oxfam Australia has welcomed the government’s Cop29 pledge of $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world’s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown. Oxfam said its new research shows a 700% increase in the number of people impacted by climate disasters in the Pacific region this decade, compared to the previous decade. Its climate policy and advocacy lead, Julie-Anne Richards, welcomed the pledge, but said the funding must also be included in the new global climate finance goal for developing countries, which is a key demand of the Pacific and one Australia is yet to support: If climate change losses and damages are not included in the new global climate finance goal, the new fund for responding to loss and damage risks becoming an empty vessel. The danger is that developed country governments will prioritise meeting the new and ambitious climate finance goal, and will not prioritise a fund that doesn’t count towards it. If Australia is to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Pacific, we must ensure the region gets the funding needed to recover from and build back better after climate change impacts, and Australia must be an important contributor alongside the global fund designed for this purpose. Coalition continues attack on government over nuclear deal decision The Nationals senator Matt Canavan was up on the Today show earlier this morning, continuing to criticise the government for not signing up to a civil nuclear deal signed between the US and UK. As Adam Morton reports, the UK government has conceded Australia was mistakenly included on a list of countries expected to sign up to the deal. Yesterday in parliament the acting prime minister, Richard Marles, said the deal goes to nuclear reactors which provide energy to electricity grids, and “we do not have that in this country, and so as a result … this agreement is not relevant to Australia”. But today, Canavan is insisting Australia should have joined, telling the program: I don’t want to concern you, Karl [Stefanovic], but you’re sitting only 30km from a nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights in Sydney. We have some of the best nuclear scientists in the world. And sure, it doesn’t produce nuclear energy, but it produces some of the world’s best nuclear medicines. And because of that expertise, we have always been involved in these international developments to look at new nuclear technologies which might help us make better nuclear medicines in the future. And of course, the current government is buying eight nuclear submarines. And so why shouldn’t we be involved in an international discussion about nuclear technologies? What the hell is going on? Canavan argued that the prime minister should “recall Chris Bowen here and override this for our national security”. It seems like it’s been a decision made by just the energy minister. Has this been considered by the cabinet? Has this been considered by the whole of government? Because there are a whole lot of other questions that arise here about why the government is making this decision. The only explanation is they’re doing so for pure domestic political purposes. Gender pay gap data reveals Australia’s female CEOs paid $170,000 less than men on average Circling back to Jim Chalmers’ economic statement to parliament today, one of the claims he’ll make is that the gender pay gap is at a record low. According to government figures today, the pay gap is 21.1%, an improvement on last year’s figure (21.7%). However, when the pay of chief executives and heads of business is included, the figure is higher at 21.8%. Our story today leads on the gap in top pay with women CEOs earning $170,000 less than male counterparts. Here’s the full story: The number of vacant rentals nationally has jumped to its highest level since July 2023, according to the latest PropTrack Market Insight Report. The report found that the national rental vacancy rate increased by 0.19% points (ppt) in October to 1.36%, as capital city vacancies rose 0.33ppt year-on-year, while regional areas saw a 0.13ppt decline over the same period. A healthy vacancy rate is widely regarded to be 3%. REA Group senior economist Anne Flaherty said: Rental conditions improved in all capital cities and regional markets over October, with the national vacancy rate now 0.21ppt higher than at the same time last year. Despite the improvement, rental supply remains well below pre-pandemic levels, with 35% fewer properties available for rent. While rental supply improved across both capital city and regional markets in October, there has been greater relief for renters in cities. Over the past year, vacancy rates in capital cities rose by 0.33ppt, while the combined regional areas remain 0.13ppt lower than a year ago. Compared to March 2020, there were 45% fewer properties available for rent in Australia’s regional areas compared to a 32% drop in the capital cities. Emily Wind here, signing on for blogging duties as we reach the halfway point of the second-last sitting week of this year. You’ll have the whole Canberra team bringing you the latest today – Karen Middleton, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Sarah Basford Canales. Let’s get started. The politics of Australian electoral reform – Full Story podcast Big money and politics seem to go hand in hand, but the government wants to pass new electoral reform laws that they say will keep cashed-up donors out of federal politics. The detail has independents and minor parties crying foul. In today’s Full Story podcast, Guardian Australia chief political correspondent Paul Karp speaks to Reged Ahmed about why Labor and the Coalition have been accused of cooking up a “secret deal” on new electoral rules. Another area where the two main parties agree in theory is international student caps. But they’ve managed to fall out a bit. Our explainer today looks at what’s behind the stoush. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will today deliver an economic statement to parliament setting out the progress the government has made on key indicators and causes for optimism about the economy and the budget. In advance excerpts released by his office, Chalmers will claim that inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again and the economy is expanding. He will say that one million new jobs have been created and that two huge deficits have been turned into two substantial surpluses. At every stage we have been upfront about the nature and magnitude of our economic challenges. Even with very substantial progress in the aggregate numbers, we know that doesn’t always translate to how people are faring and feeling day-to-day. We’re not pretending its mission accomplished – it isn’t. We are realistic about this, but optimistic too. Today as I provide a stocktake of the global and domestic economy preview the mid-year update which we will hand down in December. And outline our policies and plans. I will explain why that very cautious confidence and emerging optimism is welcome and warranted. Of course the bit they’ve given us doesn’t tell us what’s in the mid-year economic update. You’ll just have to tune in at midday, and then again in mid-December for that. It’s forward sizzle. It’s the advent calendar approach, you can’t have all your chocolates at once. More on the record number of GPs in training The RACGP president, Dr Nicole Higgins, said the increased number of GPs in training is a reflection of how the government has provided the college with the flexibility and the funding to accommodate prospective trainees. Higgins praised the government’s rapid support for requests including funding for accommodation, travel and childcare that allowed the college to place 177 general GPs in training in rural communities that had not had a registrar in years. However, she warned the government must make lasting investments to tackle Australia’s GP shortage and ensure Australians can see a GP regularly: This 20% growth in GPs in training is a sign the GP workforce is recovering. But it can’t be taken as a sign the job is done. The story we’ve been told, and that we’ve often told each other as GPs, is one of general practice in decline. These training results show us we can turn that around with the right investments, because funding general practice gets results. The college is calling on the government to link the allocation of government-subsidised medical places to a target of 50% of graduates training as GPs, fund 500 more training program places for the RACGP over the next five years and ensure GPs in training have equal pay and work entitlements to other medical specialists in training. A record number of GPs will be trained in 2025, the first time in years the specialty has filled all its training positions, which will go some way towards addressing Australia’s GP shortage. A government report in August, which found that a shortfall of more than 5,000 GPs was expected in the next decade, was the latest in a number of warnings that as more Australians live with chronic conditions, not enough medical graduates are choosing general practice as a career. However, the Royal Australian College of GPs (RACGP) has today confirmed the trend is turning around, with 1,504 junior doctors having accepted specialist training through the college’s program. It represents an increase of 20% – or 249 trainees – on 2024. The signs are also positive for the regional and remote areas the government report found were most at risk from the shortage, with 844 trainees accepting a general training pathway, 583 a rural pathway, and 77 composite rural placements. Good morning and welcome to our live politics blog. I’m Martin Farrer with the best of the overnight stories before Emily Wind takes the reins. The climate change minister, Chris Bowen, has declared the landmark Paris agreement “is working” as it had brought the world back from “the brink of catastrophic 4C warming”, but argued countries must set the most ambitious emissions targets possible for 2035 to limit worsening global heating. Speaking at the Cop29 summit in Baku, Bowen also pledged $50m towards a global loss and damage fund to help the world’s most vulnerable people to repair the damage from climate breakdown. Reaction coming up. KiiS FM, the radio station that is home to the graphic and at times derisive Kyle and Jackie O show, this year attracted the biggest share of listeners aged 10 to 17, Guardian Australia can reveal. That is more than 200,000 children and teenagers listening to the station in Sydney alone. But despite children being exposed to inappropriate material on the station’s top-rating show, the Australian Communications and Media Authority has failed to launch its own investigation into the program. A record number of GPs will be trained in 2025, the first time in years the specialty has filled all its training positions, which will go some way towards addressing Australia’s GP shortage. More details coming up. The treasurer, Jim Chalmers, will spruik the government’s economic achievements in parliament today. He will claim that inflation has more than halved, real wages are growing again and the economy is expanding. He will also claim that the gender pay gap is at a record low although there is a little bit more to those figures than meets the eye as our story on the subject reveals. More coming up."

          "headline": "Labour mulls scheme to alert rape and stalking victims if perpetrator is nearby",
          "bodyText": "Survivors of serious crimes such as rape in England and Wales could be given the option of being alerted in real-time if their perpetrator is nearby, under a scheme being considered by Labour. James Timpson, the prisons minister, is planning in two weeks to examine a similar scheme which has been established in Spain, he told MPs on Tuesday. It could be used as one of the measures courts can impose on criminals convicted of sexual and domestic-abuse offences. Survivors of stalking have condemned the courts for failing to strengthen restraining orders against abusers, amid a drop in the number of convictions for breaches. The government’s plan emerged at a hearing of the Commons’ justice select committee, when Lord Timpson told MPs that he was interested in the use of technology to monitor offenders once they are let out into the community. Timpson said he was going to Spain in a couple of weeks to look at their use of tags. “They are doing some really interesting things there,” he said. “I don’t know all the details on this, I am looking forward to learning, but it is around how victims can get much better information about where offenders are geographically and getting much better information for them.” He added: “Hopefully in due course I will be able to come back to update you on what the options are but I am really excited about them.” It is understood that ministers are interested in giving survivors of crimes, including rape and stalking, the option of being alerted in real-time if their offender is nearby. Spain’s ministry of equality last year introduced a system where rape survivors can now demand their offenders wear trackers once released from prison. Reports claim that courts accept requests for former inmates to be tracked via an electronic band around their ankle or wrist. The GPS band is linked to a device held by the victim alerting any breach of an exclusion zone, and also to a control centre run by Spanish security forces which monitors all devices. In the case of a breach, a police patrol car is supposed to be dispatched to the victim’s location. Offenders then faced further sentences, including jail time, if they were caught breaching an order imposed by a court, it was reported. In June, a woman from Wales who was stalked and held hostage at gunpoint by her former partner warned that she and her family were in danger after a judge refused to strengthen a restraining order against her abuser. Rhianon Bragg had asked for the restraining order on Gareth Wyn Jones, who was freed from prison earlier this year, to be extended to cover the whole of Gwynedd in north Wales rather than a limited area around her remote smallholding in Eryri (Snowdonia). Ministry of Justice data shows convictions for breaches of restraining orders dropped by 44% between 2018 and 2023. Figures show 8,744 men were convicted for breaching restraining orders in the year to June 2018, but the number had fallen to 4,904 in the year to June 2023."

          "headline": "The 20 best Christmas wines for 2024",
          "bodyText": "When it comes to choosing the right wines, Christmas dinner is something of a challenge. The classic bird (or plant-based alternative) with all the trimmings is a riot of sensations, flavours and textures, from the soft umami hit of stuffing and gravy to the piercing sweet-sour burst of cranberry sauce and the bitter green tang of sprouts. I tend to go one of two ways: pick out an acid-driven wine (white, red or orange) that will cleanse and revive and cut through the fat; or something substantial and spicy (a beefy red or rich oak-aged white) that stands up to anything you care to throw at it. I’ve included several examples of each in this year’s selection, and in a range of prices and sources. There are also wines to take care of aperitifs, puddings, parties and the shapeless hours (and leftovers) of the days after you’ve cleared away the wrapping paper but before you’ve popped the cork on the New Year’s Eve fizz (also included here). A final suggestion: if you need more than a couple of bottles this Christmas, it’s worth thinking about buying by the case of six or 12, with plenty of multi-buy discounts available from independent merchants and online specialists as well as the supermarkets. Whites Kakapo South Island, New Zealand 2023 (£6.50, Asda) Largely made of riesling, this cheerfully floral-aromatic, tropical fruit salad-juicy blend is an attractive solo sipper and a good value party bottle. It has the presence and verve to be a match for any spicy soups or leftover turkey curries. M&amp;S Chez Michel Marsanne Collines Rhodaniennes Rhône, France 2023 (£9, Marks &amp; Spencer) Made from local variety marsanne by the ever reliable Rhône co-operative producer Cave de Tain l’Hermitage, this delightful Christmas dinner-ready white combines fulsome soft pear and white peach with a subtle, pithy citrus and herb quality. Reyneke Organic Chenin Blanc Stellenbosch, South Africa 2023 (£10.99, Waitrose) There are so many fine Cape white wines being made from old chenin blanc vines right now. This is hard to beat on value for money, with gorgeous honeyed apple shimmering over racy citrus pith, zest and juice. Bring on the roast bird. Tenute Orestiadi Organic Orange Inzolia Sicily, Italy 2023 (£13, Booths) With their mix of red wine grip and white wine freshness, orange wines are among the most versatile with food. This graceful, nutty, mandarin-scented and very gently astringent Sicilian is a fine festive grub all-rounder. BEST BUY Zuccardi Q Chardonnay Uco Valley, Argentina 2023 (£16, Tesco) Argentina is still much better known for its reds but its top whites have never been more compelling. An exceptionally smart, savoury-mineral Burgundian chardonnay, this comes from a family producer at the top of its game and is brilliant value. Ventisquero Grey Sauvignon Blanc Atacama, Chile 2021 (from £16.50, vinvm.co.uk; ndjohn.co.uk; reservewines.co.uk) There’s something counterintuitive about finding super-fresh white wines from one of the world’s driest places, but that’s what we have here. A scintillating, pristine, seafood-friendly sauvignon blanc that lifts and cleanses with green-herb energy. Ulysse Cazabonne Sauternes Bordeaux, France NV (£21, thewinesociety.com) Christmas dinner isn’t complete without the sticky elixir of a sweet wine, whether it is paired with cheese or pudding or sipped solo. This Wine Society exclusive, sourced from an undisclosed big-name producer, is a zesty, toffeed, decadent delight. Domaine Moreau-Naudet Chablis Burgundy, France 2022 (£33.95, leaandsandeman.co.uk) Chardonnay comes in many guises, but at its best it’s hard to beat chablis for the purest, most fluently stylish iteration of the renowned white grape variety. Domaine Moreau-Naudet’s incisive example is a model of perfectly balanced succulence. Reds Nice Drop Pinotage Western Cape, South Africa 2023 (£4.25, Asda) Most of the cheapest wines on the market resort to a hefty dose of sugar to cover up their flaws, but this surprisingly serious budget buy avoids such mawkish sweetness and offers a smoky-savoury tint to its berry juiciness. A sound party bottle. Chassaux et Fils Costières de Nîmes Rhône, France 2023 (£6.99, Aldi) If your ideal Christmas dinner wine is the solar-powered richness of châteauneuf du pape, but your budget doesn’t stretch that far, this robust brambly-spicy red Rhône blend from vineyards around Nîmes is a more than acceptable alternative. M&amp;S Found Saperavi Kakheti, Georgia 2022 (£10, Marks &amp; Spencer) The Found series of lesser-spotted styles and grape varieties is home to many of the highlights in the M&amp;S range. Not least this deliciously hearty but brightly blackberry-juicy, liquorice-spiced version of saperavi, Georgia’s red grape speciality. Ponte da Boga P Mencía Ribeira Sacra, Galicia, Spain 2023 (£11.95, thewinesociety.com) In the spectacular steep, remote vineyards of Galicia in north-west Spain, the mencía grape variety makes some gorgeously vivid, fresh red wines. This example’s satiny cherry-skin feel and black cherry-juicy flavours are a guaranteed cranberry sauce-like hit with the turkey. Tesco Finest Viña del Cura Rioja Gran Reserva Rioja, Spain 2017 (£13, Tesco) For fans of the cosy-mellow, vanilla and coconut softness of traditional American oak-aged rioja, Tesco’s house gran reserva is consistently superb value. The latest vintage has all the suave tannin, tobacco and umami savouriness required for Boxing Day roast beef. BEST BUY Château Tour Marcillanet Haut-Médoc, Bordeaux, France 2018 (from £15.95, hhandc.co.uk, swig.co.uk) Like rioja, classic claret is a must for many at the Christmas table, and this is a fine example from a highly regarded vintage. It’s at a lovely moment in its evolution, when the fruit (graphite-edged cassis) is still bright but the nimble tannins are softening up beautifully. Gulfi Rossojbleo Sicily, Italy 2023 (from £22.15, fieldandfawcett.co.uk; cellarnextdoor.com ; corksofbristol.com; chapelstreetwines.co.uk) From one of the masters of the Sicilian native red grape variety nero d’avola, this is a joyous Christmas feast bottle. It is rich and ripe but full of unforced, supple red cherry and berry juiciness and tomato brightness, coupled with a hint of sage herbiness. Mil Suelos La Verdad Malbec Buscado Vivo o Muerto Uco Valley, Argentina 2019 (£35.25, corneyandbarrow.com) Like so many of my favourite Argentinian wines, this impeccably stylish, hugely impressive high-altitude red combines fleshy malbec with the spine and fragrance of cabernet franc. A wine of lightly worn concentration, immaculate red fruit and super-fine silky tannins. Fizz Taste the Difference Cava Brut Spain NV (£8.75, Sainsbury’s) Cava is more than just an affordable alternative to champagne, and few other fizzes can match wines such as Sainsbury’s classic brut for bottle-fermented richness and tang, at a price that leaves change from a tenner. Prince Alexandre Crémant de Loire Brut Loire, France NV (£14.99, reduced to £10 from 4 December to 1 January, Waitrose) Crémant sparkling wines, made using the same techniques as champagne in other parts of France, can offer superb value. This light, red- and green-apple-scented blend of chenin, cabernet franc and chardonnay from the Loire is no exception. Can Sumoi Ancestral Montònega Penedès, Spain 2023 (from £19.49, thefinewinecompany.co.uk; shrinetothevine.co.uk; chanctonburywines.co.uk) Made in cava country using the “ancestral” or “pét-nat” method of bottling the wine while it is still fermenting, this light (9.5% abv) but lively and evocative bubbly has become a festive favourite thanks to its effortless, food-friendly, herb-scented charm. BEST BUY Veuve Monsigny 1er Cru Champagne France NV (£21.99, Aldi) A cut above Aldi’s standard Veuve Monsigny champagne (£14.99), but still around half the price of most mainstream branded champagnes, this pinot noir-dominated fizz, sourced from high-quality “premier cru” vineyards, is a lemon-creamy, butter-biscuity bargain."

          "headline": "‘A road trip like no other’: my epic drive on Kraftwerk’s Autobahn",
          "bodyText": "Ask people what the most iconic musical road trip is and they’ll most likely direct you towards America: take Highway 61 through the birthplace of the blues, they’ll say, or head to California on Route 66. They may even mention vintage T-Birds or Cadillacs. Yet there’s a road trip arguably more important to the history of popular music than any other, one that tells its story not just via the cities it visits but through the sounds of the journey itself – and the hum of the engine that’s powering you. And the best way to ride it is in a humble Volkswagen. Fifty years ago this month, Kraftwerk released Autobahn, a 22-minute 43-second song about the German road network. Astonishingly for a 22-minute 43-second song about the German road network, it somehow managed to change the musical landscape forever. Indeed, look back at the soundtrack to the last few decades – with its abundance of pristine synths, robotic vocoders and repetitive beats – and you’d be hard pressed to find a road that doesn’t somehow lead back to Autobahn. The song achieved chart success at the time of its release – it became the band’s biggest American hit in 1975 after being edited down to three minutes 28 seconds – but record buyers seemed unsure how to view it. Was it a novelty record? A quirky Beach Boys pastiche? Some kind of experimental in-joke? Melody Maker’s Keith Ging declared it to be “spineless, emotionless sound with no variety, less taste … for God’s sake, keep the robots out of music”. Acquaintances of the band were equally wary. “We played it to our friends and a few of them said, ‘Fahren auf der Autobahn!? [driving on the Autobahn] You’ve gone crazy!’” the band’s Ralf Hütter told the NME in 1991. These days we see it with clearer eyes: this song is the point where electronic pop music truly began. Where did it come from? What were the band trying to say? And why did it have such a transformative effect – not just on music but on the band themselves? Before Autobahn, Hütter and Florian Schneider were a long-haired, experimental duo, trying to figure out a new German sound alongside krautrock peers such as Can, Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream. Afterwards, though, they had transformed themselves into a smartly dressed four piece – cropped hair, suits – who seemed to be travelling on a completely different road to everyone else. It felt like there was only one way to truly understand this remarkable record. To get in a car and drive the autobahn itself – to hear what the band heard, see what the band saw and feel what the band felt on a road trip quite unlike any other. *** The section of the motorway frequently attributed to the song is the A555 that links Bonn to Cologne. The band would have used it frequently on their travels – it was close to the studio of their iconic producer Konrad “Conny” Plank, and a major road towards Düsseldorf from southern Germany. Schneider’s father Paul was a renowned architect responsible for the brutalist Terminal 1 building in Cologne Bonn airport – and it is here that I pick up an early morning hire car and drive the short distance to Potsdamer Platz in Bonn, the most southerly point of the A555. I wind the window down and let the sounds of the road fill the car. It’s something we should all do more often, for the sound of driving, with its engine revs and speeding traffic, is unbelievably musical. The tarmac hums, the wind whistles and the tyres play various rhythms as they bump up off the asphalt. Hütter viewed the car – and indeed most things in everyday life – as an instrument in its own right. Autobahn even begins with a car – we hear a door slam, a few throaty roars of the engine and then a parping horn. You can’t recreate this effect so well in modern cars – the engine in the Hyundai I’ve been assigned purrs so quietly it’s barely audible – but Hütter was driving the altogether more rustic VW Beetle. Many believe this to be the car sampled in the song, but it appears to be taken from library music: Karussell’s Anlassen von Automotor und Abfahren. Shortly before Autobahn was recorded, Hütter – who, along with Schneider, came from a well-to-do background – purchased a Minimoog synthesiser. It was, he recalled, just as expensive as the car, and just as essential: “I had to have that synthesiser and I wanted that Volkswagen – both meant freedom to me.” Previous Kraftwerk albums had been based around Hütter’s organ playing and Schneider’s decidedly un-rock’n’roll use of the flute. Autobahn still features the flute, as well as other acoustic instruments in its more bucolic passages. But, unlike previous recordings, it is largely electronic. Hütter’s Minimoog was used to play the bass line, which bounces up and down the octave like the repetitive bounce of the wheels. Other early synths – including an EMS Synthi and ARP Odyssey – were used to provide the song’s futuristic-sounding phased chords. The Doppler effect you hear when vehicles pass by you was achieved by using tape-reversed bursts of white noise. Perhaps most impressively of all, Schneider built a programmable speech synthesiser called a Robovox to achieve the vocoder-effect on the lyrics. Masterminding the whole thing was Plank. He’d recorded the band’s first three albums and, according to Wolfgang Flür at least, was instrumental in the giant strides taken on Autobahn. The way Flür recalls it, Plank would create various car noises using the array of instruments while Hütter and Schneider sat on a sofa approving or rejecting them. “It was like going shopping,” said Flür. “They bought songs.” Despite his contribution – Flür has called him the true “visionary” behind what became the Kraftwerk sound – Plank was bought out by the band for DM 5,000 and never made anything from the subsequent success of the song nor the album of the same name from which it comes from. The band produced all future recordings in their studio Kling Klang and Plank never worked with the band again. It’s an unsavoury pit stop in the journey of Autobahn, perhaps, and Plank should be remembered as instrumental in helping locate this eureka moment for the band. From this point on, all Kraftwerk albums would be entirely electronic. *** Fancy time-travelling back to the future? Then head to YouTube where you will find a 1975 transmission of the BBC’s Tomorrow’s World. On it are a strange German band determined to perform a different kind of live show. They talk about electronic body suits that would allow them to trigger music from their clothing. And their recently hired drummer (Flür) is using metal drum sticks to his six metal pads – each one triggers sounds from a modified Maestro Rhythm King drum machine. It’s about as far-removed from an energetic Keith Moon performance as you can imagine – Flür is calm and composed as he goes about triggering his sounds. As Hütter liked to boast about Kraftwerk: “Our drummers don’t sweat.” And yet the technological leap happening here – and on Autobahn – is astounding. Kraftwerk had worked out a way to “free” the preset rhythms of the drum machine so that they could be manipulated by a human being. It was a perfect example of the Mensch-Maschine in action. *** Why did Kraftwerk decide to write a song about a road? When I spoke to Hütter in 2017, he told me that Autobahn was simply supposed to be “an environmental composition, a sound painting”. Ever evasive, he refused to ascribe the meaning given to it by many critics: that it was an attempt to reclaim the story of German infrastructure from the country’s horrifying recent Nazi past. The A555 was actually a product of Weimar Germany – it was the first section of the autobahn to be built, officially opening on 6 August 1932, months before Hitler gained power. But that hasn’t stopped a false narrative growing that the Nazis invented the autobahn, partly because they did build a huge chunk of it during their reign (around 2,400 miles completed, with another 1,550 under construction). It proved advantageous for them during wartime, helping them to fight on two fronts. Were Kraftwerk hoping to write a more optimistic story of their home country? For the band the autobahn didn’t have to mean war and nationalism and genocide. It could represent travel, freedom, exchanges of culture. The outdoors have always been of importance to German culture, from Goethe’s poems about the Harz mountains to the Romantic landscapes of Caspar David Friedrich. Even today – when motorways are loathed for their pollution and congestion – it’s hard not to feel the thrill of speeding down two clear lanes towards some faraway destination. From Cologne I take the A57 and then join the A46 to cross the glorious Fleher Brücke and make my entrance into Düsseldorf, the home of all things Kraftwerk. *** Imagine going to Liverpool and there are no Beatles museums, no walking tours down Penny Lane, no buskers singing Help!, no gift shops selling plastic yellow submarines. Unthinkable, yet you can easily visit Düsseldorf without ever knowing that the city’s most iconic band exist. “Kraftwerk?” repeats a waitress, looking puzzled. “I don’t think so. We do have a band called Die Toten Hosen.” Ah yes, Die Toten Hosen. Ask about famous local bands in Düsseldorf and they’ll happily chew your ear off about Die Toten Hosen, a four-decade old German rock band whose name translates as “dead trousers” (it’s slang for “uneventful”). The hotel receptionist? A bierhaus server? A group of guys drinking in the street? When faced with the Kraftwerk question they all look blankly before saying: “No, but we have Die Toten Hosen.” My hotel’s barman has at least heard of Kraftwerk – but he isn’t overly impressed. Other bands from the area give back, he says. When an earthquake devastated parts of Turkey and Syria in 2023, Die Toten Hosen – those guys again – organised a benefit show to raise funds. Kraftwerk, he implies, are cold and aloof when it comes to connecting with their home city. For almost four decades – from 1970 to 2009 – Kraftwerk operated out of their Kling Klang studio on Mintropstraße 16, an unassuming street in what used to be an industrial area of Düsseldorf. This is where they recorded groundbreaking albums such as Trans-Europe Express, The Man-Machine and Computer World. It’s also where work started on Autobahn, although much of it was made at Plank’s studio, which was situated in a former pig sty in an old farm in Wolperath on the southern outskirts of Cologne. The studio was renowned for its unique, handmade 56-channel mixing desk mounted on a wooden base made from Plank’s own cherry tree. Plank had designed it so that it could be detached and taken on the road to record on location. For Autobahn, Plank would drive his 16-track mobile recording truck to Kling Klang, park in the yard outside and run wires from his mixing desk directly into the building. Head to Mintropstraße 16 today and there are no plaques commemorating the impact of Kling Klang. Instead there is a yellow and beige tiled building with fading signage for electrician services Elektro Müller GmbH. Walk through the entrance and you come to a plant-filled courtyard and another Elektro Müller sign above the door where the band once entered. The only nod to Kraftwerk is an extremely niche one – an orange traffic cone, as featured on the sleeves of their debut album, sits on the steps outside. I suppose it’s entirely possible that this isn’t even a Kraftwerk reference at all and simply a traffic cone. Back on the street an emergency vehicle’s siren builds then fades. A motorbike rider lets his engine rip. But the area is largely unremarkable. The only trace of Kraftwerk I’ve seen so far on this whole trip has been in a Cologne brauhaus stuffed with vintage music contraptions – put a euro in the slot and you can watch a duo of accordion and tuba-playing puppets perform the band’s biggest hit The Model. Fun, of course, but not the most towering of tributes to the godfathers of dance music. It doesn’t seem right that our autobahn journey should end here. For a start, I’ve barely been on the autobahn. The A555 was a rather unspectacular piece of road whose entire length could be driven in 15 minutes. That’s not even enough time to play the song in full. Bonn, Cologne and Düsseldorf are all so close that each leg has barely begun when it’s time to pull off the road – and that’s just not how a record as expansive as Autobahn feels. *** A quote by Flür sparks inspiration. He described Autobahn as “the musical description of a car journey from Düsseldorf to Hamburg, if you know the route, you’ll recognise the sounds: the mechanical sounds represent the Ruhr valley, the conveyor belts of the mining towns of Bottrop and Castrop-Rauxel. Then you have the stretch through the rural Munsterland, where the countryside is symbolised by the flute and the song is completely different in feel.” I set the satnav for Bottrop – A52, A3, A42 – in the hope of hearing the sounds of industry. But it is a mining city no longer – Prosper-Haniel was the last coal mine in the whole of Germany to shut when it closed its doors in 2018. Instead, the nearby Volkspark rests in almost complete silence, stirred no longer by the noise of 20th-century industrial Europe. Instead I move on to Castrop-Rauxel near Dortmund, and the next best thing to industry: the LWL Industrial Museum Zollern. This former coal mine is an exquisitely grand memorial to Germany’s industrial heritage – with its stained-glass art nouveau entrance, climbable pithead frame and vast engine hall. It’s quiet here, too. But while examining a rusting sinking bucket outside, I realise I can make my own industrial sounds by banging my fingers on its shell. The noise sounds instantly familiar – it reminds me of the wobbly bass notes that appear over the song’s grinding rhythm around the nine-minute mark. Creating music out of the everyday: it feels like a very Kraftwerkian thing to do. *** To get back on to the autobahn for my final four-hour drive to Hamburg I check the road signs for the iconic blue and white autobahn sign. It’s the same sign that features on the Autobahn album sleeve – although this was not the album’s original artwork. For its initial German release the band used a painting created especially for them by their trusted artistic adviser Emil Schult. The poet and painter was a star pupil of the legendary German Fluxus artist Joseph Beuys who had been professor of monumental sculpture at the Dusseldorf Academy of Art before a sit-in protest he was leading resulted in him being escorted from the building by police and subsequently fired. Featuring a photograph of the band members on the dashboard and the same sun and mountains imagery that he would later reuse for the band’s 3D film, Schult’s painting is simultaneously childlike and loaded with reference points. Was the VW Beetle in which the viewer was situated driving towards a bright future? And was the Mercedes – a favourite vehicle for Nazi party members – travelling in the other direction supposed to signify the country’s past disappearing into the distance? The sleeve united Kraftwerk’s visual and musical ideas and was the first step in a lifelong ambition of theirs to make a gesamtkunstwerk, or “total work of art”. This idea – that various artforms should all be utilised to create an even greater whole – has been a key theme running through German culture from Wagner to the Bauhaus. And it reached its pinnacle in Kraftwerk’s world when, in 2012, they played a series of shows at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, during which viewers watched specially made films through 3D glasses. The footage that played during Autobahn was especially absorbing, based as it was on Schult’s original painting (and, indeed, designed with input from Schult himself). When the show came to Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall the following year, I got my first taste of driving on the autobahn. There I stood as Volkswagens, Mercedes and enormous lorries passed by my side, and the 800 or so passengers riding with me reached out to touch them. It was a perfect synthesis of music, art, technology, design and film. And it all grew from the seed of Schult’s painting. Almost as an afterthought, somebody – perhaps Schult, maybe designer Barney Bubbles, nobody appears to know for certain – added a sticker to Schult’s original album sleeve featuring the blue and white autobahn symbol: two white lines converging towards the horizon, interrupted midway by a motorway bridge. The band liked the simple, Warhol-like usage of this everyday symbol so much that they decided to use it for the UK album’s release. They have since used it for all Autobahn releases including the 2009 catalogue remasters. As with the song, this simple design was enormously influential. Famed designer Peter Saville claims that when he first saw it in 1975 it “had a markedly profound and enlightening influence upon me … I saw the vast landscape of past, present and future Europe unfold in my mind.” When, in 1978, Saville was tasked with creating a brand signifier for Factory Records, his appropriation of the hearing protection symbol was “a direct consequence of the Autobahn sign”. In my case, the sign has a more utilitarian meaning – it leads me towards Autobahn 1, which runs all the way to my final destination. Itching to get on the open road, I crank the song up on the stereo and put my foot to the floor. *** It’s often said that there are no speed limits on the autobahn. That’s not entirely true – limits of 70 or 80mph are common on some parts – but vast stretches remain thrillingly, terrifyingly anarchic. I wind down the windows, head north of 150km/h and listen to the cars zipping past me in the opposite direction. I pass green fields and red-brick farmhouses, remote churches and towering wind turbines. This is flute-solo country. Is the autobahn less symbolic of freedom now than it was in the 1970s? Between Bonn and Dortmund there are frequent roadworks to navigate, a result I am told of a lack of investment in infrastructure since the 2008 crash. Elsewhere, a proposed extension to the A100 in Berlin has led to protests by ravers and environmentalists – the fact it threatens the future of several nightclubs in the east of the city is grimly ironic given Kraftwerk’s influence on the dance scene that has thrived there. But such things won’t have been strangers to Kraftwerk even at the time they were writing it. In 1973, an international oil crisis was so severe that Germans were banned from driving the autobahn on Sundays for a month – instead people took strolls on it. Yet such tumult is noticeably absent in the song’s nursery rhyme lyrics, which were written by Schult. Kraftwerk had never sung words on their music before. Hütter’s sprechsingen (talk-singing) covered awe-inspiring valleys, repetitive white lines, green ditches – and what sounded to anglocentric ears like a Beach Boys lift. But Hütter isn’t singing “fun, fun, fun on the autobahn”, rather “Wir fahren, fahren, fahren auf der Autobahn” (“We drive, drive, drive on the motorway”). If it was intended as a Beach Boys reference – the phrasing does resemble Fun, Fun, Fun and Barbara Ann, after all – then it was a decidedly German twist on it. Singing in German was a radical – and risky – move for a band operating in the early 1970s. Many of the band’s German peers preferred to use English as a way to distance themselves from their country’s past, but Hütter was adamant that German words made the most sense for Kraftwerk: “The German language, like our own rhythms, is more machinelike, more abrupt.” It was also part of the band’s desire to tackle their history directly. The Nazi regime, with their shunning of “degenerate” artists, had eradicated the Weimar’s thriving avant-garde scene. Kraftwerk wanted to connect back with it and build the Germany that had originally been promised. *** When I spoke to Hütter in 2017 he told me how the band would travel hundreds of miles, from clubs to art galleries, on the autobahn. “And when we played in other cities, we didn’t have money to stay in hotels. So we were always driving on the autobahn, going somewhere and coming back at night all the time.” Their experience of the autobahn would often have been in darkness. As it turns out, the sun is starting to set as I approach Bremen. Its reflection looks glorious in my wing mirrors, while ahead of me the leaves on the trees are bathed in a brilliant red light. As evening falls, the track’s hypnotic finale, powered by the motorik beat, seems especially resonant. This 4/4 rhythm was once described by Brian Eno as one of the three most influential beats of the 1970s alongside Fela Kuti’s Afrobeat and the funk of James Brown. It was pioneered by German musicians – initially by Can’s Jaki Liebezeit and then built upon by Neu!’s Klaus Dinger. But it was only on Autobahn that its propulsive rhythm was married directly to the experience of driving. The rhythm conveys not just a sense of constant, forward motion but also the repetitive, trance-like state induced by long road trips. It is no wonder that Schneider once claimed that the band played faster if they’d travelled to the gig by autobahn. I turn up the volume and let the beat propel me towards the shimmering lights of Hamburg. *** The German autobahn has taken me from the birthplace of Beethoven in Bonn to arguably the birthplace of the Beatles in Hamburg. Joining these two places is the story of one of music’s equally loud big bangs, with after-shocks that are still being felt. Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s Andy McCluskey says that the release of Autobahn was like news of JFK’s death – everybody remembers where they were when they first heard it. In his case, he was in his bath listening to a little transistor radio. A year after its release, he found himself at the band’s Liverpool show, still only 16 and thinking: “I want to do this.” Germany was suddenly on the musical map. David Bowie – who used to ride the autobahn while listening to the record – moved to Berlin and went on to make the electronically influenced Low, “Heroes” and Lodger. Brian Eno relocated to the rural village of Forst to record with the influential avant-garde band Harmonia. Conny Plank became a leading producer of electronic pop music, working with the likes of Ultravox, DAF and the Eurythmics. The world took a while to catch up – it would be another three years before the next similarly seismic release in electronic music arrived in the form of Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder’s I Feel Love. Eventually, though, the track became regarded as a launch-pad for countless genres – from new wave to electronica. Juan Atkins credited it as part of his journey towards pioneering techno. Underworld and Stereolab are just two of the artists to have sampled it. Autobahn did more than just influence the direction of pop, though. Speaking to Uncut in 2017, Flür said that the song had given postwar Germany something it desperately needed: “Something positive and youthful, that freed us from the stench of the past.” I turn off the autobahn for the last time, drive my car to its final destination and kill the engine. Following the roads Kraftwerk once took has been a thrill – and an education. But there’s only so much it can really teach you about their music. We can all follow the blue and white signs to the next city, but only some of us know the directions to the future."

          "bodyText": "Location Saint-Martin-Vésubie, France Disaster name Storm Alex, 2020 Elisa is a women’s clothing designer who runs her own label in Montreal, Canada. She was born and grew up in Nice, France, where much of her family remained, but was in Canada with her children and partner when Storm Alex gusted towards France and the mountain village where her mother lived. The storm was a powerful extratropical cyclone that caused extreme flooding around the Mediterranean in October 2020, killing at least 15 people. Three months’ worth of rain – 50cm – fell on Saint-Martin-Vésubie in one day, 2 October 2020. My mom found this house that had a lot of charm in a small village called Saint-Martin-Vésubie. When she bought it with her savings in 2015 they did a lot of renovations. My dad helped her with the construction and contractors. For a bit, they were happy there. It was a three-floor, chalet-type house with a wood roof and some wood on the outside. Her goal was that it be a family house. She wanted to be welcoming people and having big dinners. A couple years after, my parents were in divorce. My mom always repeated to me that for retirement, she wanted to travel all the time. Have just a tiny apartment and travel, travel, travel. I remember tellingher: “If you’re divorcing anyway, you should just sell the house and get out of there.” She was like: “I don’t feel I had enough time in this house. Maybe I can enjoy a little bit more years?” She was always Skyping me from her little office: the background was a window with the mountain outside. It was beautiful. The land was pretty big. The house had two little rivers passing by it. That turned out to be a crazy thing. I don’t really follow news, especially French news. I’m unaware of what’s happening on a daily basis. My brother called on a Saturday telling me there was a storm in Saint-Martin-Vésubie and our mom was not answering her phone as of about 4pm yesterday. My uncle called him the day before saying the last time that he had her on the phone, the water was up to the door of the car. She said the car was probably going to float away. The first thing I said was: “Why didn’t you call me yesterday?” I was pissed I didn’t get a call from one of my uncles. Being really far from your biological family, people always forget about you. I said: “I need to look online.” We hung up. I started typing: “Saint-Martin-Vésubie”, “tempête” [storm]. My first reaction was: “No, no, no. It’s not possible.” That was what I was repeating out loud. I was saying no constantly. My partner, Mark, was like: “What’s happening?” There was not yet a lot of news articles. It’s when I started going on those Facebook or Instagram videos that I realised the amplitude of the storm. There was a couple in a house surrounded with water and huge waves, doing signs with a flashlight. After that, it was a video of a building half-detaching. It was surreal. In all those videos, I was trying to see if I was able to see my mom’s house. “Oh, that was close to her. No, I can’t see it. Fuck.” Every video was like: “Fuck, I can’t see it.” I was watching, again and again. I was seeing all that distress and traumatic visuals. I was taking it all in. I called my brother and I said: “You have to go right away.” He was like: “Yes, I’m thinking to take a bus on Monday.” I was like: “No, you take the bus tomorrow. No matter what. If she’s alive, she’s going to need your help. You go. I can’t go.” I had my baby, Nash, in my arm. He was 15 days old. He was breastfeeding. I couldn’t travel with my newborn. If I catch Covid, I can’t come back. We were all in quarantine. It was impossible for me to go. I accepted that my reality will be to follow the whole thing through my brother. I remember waking up at 3am for months because it was 9am over there, trying to catch up on life in France. There was no communication with Saint-Martin-Vésubie. Roads were impassable. Everything has been cut. Every two, three hours, I was calling to check a phone line in Nice that was for people that were rescued. I was continuing to check every list of missing people. My brother arrived in Nice the next day. The decision was made that my brother and one of my uncles, the young one, would go with the car to another village close by, climb up and down a mountain, and arrive in Saint-Martin-Vésubie. The whole thinking was: “Go to see if the house is still there, if she’s still in there, because maybe she can’t get out.” That happened really early on Monday. My brother called when he was on top of the mountain, telling me he was going down to Saint-Martin-Vésubie. I was waiting, waiting, waiting. That was an awful wait. The most awful wait of my whole life. He called me back and said, and I can remember his voice. In French, he said: “Il n’y a plus rien” [There’s nothing any more]. I said: “What? No house?” He said: “Nothing. You can’t even tell it was a house before.” He said: “No foundation, nothing.” I was like: “What?” He sent me videos, and that was of a whole river where the house was, and no trace of any house being there before. I think that was when I was like: “Oh my God, that’s the end. She could have not gotten out.” It was really long, long, long days because I was talking to my brother every hour or so and to my uncles, trying to reach anyone possible to push to find her body. When you don’t have the body, it’s hard for your mind to process that it’s real. There’s no body so maybe there’s other things that could have happened. She was not in the house. She’s somewhere in Mexico, living her best life. She was saved by a neighbour. She’s unconscious, and no one knows who she is. She’s in a hospital bed somewhere. I think this is the most traumatic part of the event, that missing body. Eight or nine days after the storm, they found the body of my mom’s old neighbour about 26km [16 miles] away, down the river. I was like: “OK, there is really so small a chance we find her.” Wild wolves literally saved our ass in that case, if I can say it like this. A neighbour from the same part of the valley was coming back to grab his stuff from his half-destroyed house, and he told the rescue team that he saw, a few times, wild wolves smelling behind his house. The wolves smelled her body in decomposition. Thirteen days after the storm, a bunch of men with shovels took her body out. She was about 100 metres from her house, literally right there, that whole time. My brother maybe even walked on that part a few times when he was searching for stuff. Someone took him to the spot and he sent me a picture. There were big rocks, dry mud, soil and trees. He was standing in front of that hole. I was able to see it was really deep down: probably six feet under. I was so thankful. I still feel really weird about that feeling because I felt so grateful to the wolves. I was like: “Thank God they smelled her body because she could have stayed there for years.” Because I’m a really visual person, I’m imagining what my mom passed through in her last seconds, minutes, hours. After they found her body, that shortened my imagination of the event. There was an autopsy. They were able to tell us that she died by something falling on her head, maybe a part of the house. She didn’t drown. My brother asked to see the body. They said they can only show the hand. He put me on his phone. When he was alone in the room, he took his phone out from his pocket. She was under a white cover, and there was just her hand out. That was important for us to see a part of her body we recognised. If I was there physically, I would take her hand in my hand and kiss it. For weeks, my brother basically transported me in his shirt pocket with the camera. I was there the whole time. He was taking me everywhere. When he was in the car by himself, we were talking the whole way. When he was going out to see people, he was hanging up and calling me back. At some point, I ended up in the hospital because it was too much to deal with. I was exhausted in every part of where you think exhaustion can be. I ended up in hospital because I had stroke symptoms: all numb in my arm and my mouth. It turns out it was a migraine. I think my brain was unable to take it any more. After that, I really wanted my brother to come to Canada because we needed to be united. We needed that so much in that moment. When I took him from the airport to the Airbnb, he took out a couple bracelets from my mom’s body. My first thing was to open the police bag, plastic with all that tape, and smell. I thought maybe I can smell her, but I couldn’t. What I smelled was that storm: death mixed with nature. I still have that bag. Sometimes I open it and smell, just to give me a sense of reality. My brother did his two-week quarantine beside our place in Montreal. I was bringing him food wearing a mask. After the quarantine, he was able to be with us for three weeks. We were able to pass Christmas together. He was able to meet his new nibling. It’s odd because I was passing through life and death at the same time. My newborn was being his little cuteness and just learning how to smile. I was still smiling to my kids, because I had to. I could not process my emotions the way I would have processed them if I was alone. I remember the face of my baby. Every time I was looking at him, I was thinking that my mom never met him and he will never meet her. She was really lovely. She was a beautiful woman. When she died, she was 67, but not looking like 67. I remember the softness of her skin. She trusted me, but was judgy with a lot of people. She loved to sit on the bench and just critique everything. I actually really miss that. For a long time, I was scared because my mom had harsh words sometimes. We had a not-my-ideal relationship. When she died I was in the process of grieving the mom I would have wished to have. She believed in me way more than what she showed me. But I also know she meant well. I started working again. I was just trying to keep the business together and trying to go back to a normal kind of life. I was finally able to go in France in June 2021. I had my first dose of vaccine for Covid, and my baby was not breastfeeding any more. I was able to go to Saint-Martin-Vésubie. I remember being shocked. I especially remember the size of the rocks: bigger than trucks. I think that helped because I was finding that it was unbelievable that a three-floor house can disappear like that. At that moment, I realised the house didn’t have a chance. I’m always asking the question, did she see that coming? Because she had windows on the upper part of the valley. Imagine that second of your life and you see that coming. It’s such an awful death. Oh my God. I talk to so many people about what happened to me, to my mom, and it’s still really hard for people to understand how it’s linked to climate change. It’s not just a remote thing happening far away. It’s going to touch everyone. This is really one of the main reasons why I want to put my story out. I see that as putting myself naked in the public space because we need, as a society, to take action to stop or reduce those things happening. The help I want is everyone to recognise that this is what happened. My mom was a victim of climate change. It’s not a normal storm. It’s not a normal event. Fuck, why me? I don’t need to be confirmed that we have a problem. I don’t need the planet to confirm that exists. I already knew. But now I’ve been touched by it. I went to her little one-bedroom apartment in Nice that was her spot in the city. We had six days to empty that apartment, and my mom had a lot of things. When all this happened, I told my brother: “Don’t touch anything until I come. I need this because there was nothing left in her house. Everything disappeared.” I went right away to the bedroom. I sat on the bed. I found a book she was reading: Traité de Morale Pour Triompher des Emmerdes. It’s vulgar, like how to triumph from your shit in life. She was probably reading that because she felt that her life was going all wrong because of the divorce and she was feeling so alone. I think my mom was a person that never had the chance to grow emotionally. As someone close to my own emotions, I saw she had a lot of emotions she was unable to understand. I wish I could have helped her. In the months before she died, I was feeling I could go deeper with her and maybe have a new relationship. No matter. She was a really good mother. It still feels surreal, what happened with Storm Alex. But I know it’s real: that I passed through this and my mom died the way she died. Today was her birthday. She would have turned 71. I feel it’s really nice to be able to talk about this on her birthday. I want to tell my kids that I did everything I could with my own terrible and traumatic story and put it out there just to see if that can help anyone else. We need more sharing in society. I think it’s how people can understand that we need change. Edited by Aldyn Chwelos Design and development by Harry Fischer and Pip Lev"

          "headline": "Starling Bank staff resign after new chief executive calls for more time in-office",
          "bodyText": "Staff have resigned at Starling Bank after its new chief executive demanded thousands of workers attend its offices more frequently, despite lacking enough space to host them. In his first major policy change since taking over from the UK digital bank’s founder, Anne Boden, in March, Raman Bhatia has ordered all hybrid staff – many of whom were in the office only one or two days a week, or on an ad-hoc basis – to travel to work for a minimum of 10 days each month. But the bank, which operates online only, admitted that some of its offices would not be equipped to handle the influx. “We are aware that in some office locations we may not be able to accommodate 10 office working days per month for everyone right now. We are considering ways in which we can create more space,” an email sent by Starling’s human resources team and seen by the Guardian said. Starling has 3,231 staff, the vast majority of whom are in the UK with some also in Dublin. However, the Guardian understands that the bank has only about 900 desks, including 260 at its Cardiff site, 320 in its London headquarters and 155 in Southampton. The bank has a further 160 desks in its newest site in Manchester, where it has signed a 10-year lease to occupy the fifth floor of the Landmark building, which also houses Santander UK and HSBC staff. The announcement led to a flurry of complaints from staff on the company’s internal Slack messaging channels, with many highlighting the lack of desk and parking spaces, as well as disruption to their work-life balance. Some staff have already resigned over the “rushed” announcement, while others have threatened to do so. One staffer, who has handed in their notice, told the Guardian: “I’ve worked for Starling for years, and have done my job effectively while working almost entirely from home. “Being asked without warning to take on the time, expense and life disruption of returning to the office for half of the working week is not something I can personally understand or accept, so I made the decision to resign.” One aggrieved staffer posting in Slack, with more than 100 likes, said the changes had been “rammed down everyone’s throats despite their legitimate concerns”. They also accused Bhatia of trying to create a “bland grey corporate hellscape filled with dead-eyed zombies who care about nothing more than doing the bare minimum, clocking off and collecting a paycheque”. Bhatia hit back in a company-wide email, saying he was “surprised” to hear that the policy was unexpected, and that he had spoken about getting staff back in the office two or three days each week “over the last few months”. Bhatia said “the leadership team has been thinking for some time about how to operationalise this because we share a conviction that working in the office is important for creativity, collaboration, problem solving, performance and engagement”. The online bank, founded in 2014 by Boden and backed by Goldman Sachs, has grown rapidly from 43,000 customers in 2017 to 3.6 million in 2023. Over that time, its workforce increased from 279 to more than 3,200. The return to office announcement came a month after the Financial Conduct Authority hit Starling with a £29m fine after discovering “shockingly lax” controls that it said left the financial system “wide open to criminals”. That included failures in its automated screening system for individuals facing government sanctions. Starling’s new policy puts it among a growing number of companies attempting to get staff to return to the office more often, after the pandemic caused an explosion in home working. Goldman Sachs became one of the first major employers to get employees back in five days a week in 2023, setting a precedent for companies such as Amazon, which has asked staff to return full-time from January. The supermarket chain Asda has also toughened its stance, making it compulsory for thousands of workers at its offices in Leeds and Leicester to spend at least three days a week at their desks from the new year. Starling said in a statement: “Starling recently formalised a longstanding practice in which colleagues were encouraged to work in their local office for two to three days a week. By bringing colleagues together in person, our aim is to achieve greater collaboration that will benefit our customers as we enter Starling’s next phase of growth. “People managers are able to provide additional support to colleagues with wellbeing and other personal needs. Those with fully remote or flexible arrangements in place already remain on those terms.”"

          "headline": "Greg Lynn launches appeal over conviction for murdering camper Carol Clay in Victoria’s high country",
          "bodyText": "A former Jetstar pilot who was convicted of murdering an elderly camper in Victoria’s high country has formally lodged an appeal against his conviction and sentence. Greg Lynn, 58, was last month sentenced to a minimum of 24 years in prison for the 2020 murder of 73-year-old camper Carol Clay in the Wonnangatta Valley. A supreme court judge describing the killing and the subsequent attempted cover-up as “brutal” and “horrific”, after a jury in June found him guilty following a five-week trial. He was acquitted of murdering her fellow camper Russell Hill, 74. Lynn had pleaded not guilty to both murder charges. A spokesperson for the supreme court confirmed to Guardian Australia that Lynn filed an appeal against his conviction and sentence late on Monday. The spokesperson said Lynn had also applied for an extension of time application. A hearing date in the supreme court’s court of appeal has not been listed yet, the spokesperson said. Justice Michael Croucher sentenced Lynn to 32 years in prison, with a minimum of 24 years. Lynn would be 79 before he could become eligible for parole in 2045. Delivering his sentence, Croucher said he was unable to determine the motive for the murder, while prosecutors had argued Lynn had killed Clay because she was a witness to Hill’s death. He said he was satisfied that there was a “brusque interaction” between the men prior to Clay’s death, and that Lynn had intended to kill her by shooting her in the head. He described Clay’s death as a “very grave example of murder”. “It was a violent, brutal, horrific death, with a weapon designed to kill,” he said. “There is no suggestion that Mrs Clay posed any threat to Mr Lynn.” Croucher said Lynn’s crime was “aggravated significantly” by the fact Lynn concealed Clay’s body in a remote location, later returning to burn it to “almost nothingness, just fragments”. “This was an appalling thing for her loved ones to learn. Mr Lynn must have known that these actions, once revealed, would cause Mrs Clay’s loved ones no end of grief and distress,” he said. In a letter of contrition to Croucher that was read to the court during his sentencing, Lynn said he was “disappointed and perplexed” about the verdict, maintained his innocence and flagged his intention to appeal. But he apologised for his conduct after the couple’s death. “I accept that my decision to flee the scene and attempt to disappear … was selfish and callous in the extreme, causing family and friends of both Carol Clay and Russell Hill much grief and stress for 20 long months,” Lynn wrote. He also apologised to his former employer and his family for the “pain, shame and suffering they have endured”. Lynn’s wife and son, who were present in court during the trial, did not attend Friday’s sentencing. “I don’t ask for forgiveness, I am simply sorry for what I have done,” Lynn wrote. Lynn’s defence team argued the deaths were the result of a tragic accident and that his client had “made a series of terrible choices” to cover them up."

          "headline": "Migrant rights advocate held in Tunisia under anti-terrorist investigation",
          "bodyText": "Tunisian anti-terrorist investigators are handling the case of a leading advocate for migrants who has been taken into custody, in what the head of a rights group said was a troubling first for the country. Abdallah Said, a Tunisian of Chadian origin, was questioned along with the secretary general and treasurer of his association, Enfants de la Lune, said Romdhane Ben Amor, the spokesperson for the Tunisian Forum for Social and Economic Rights. According to La Presse newspaper, which is close to the Tunisian government, Said’s association is suspected of receiving foreign funds “to assist sub-Saharan migrants to enter illegally on to Tunisian soil”. Tunisia is one of the main launching points for boats carrying people trying to cross the Mediterranean to seek better lives in Europe. In May the Tunisian president, Kais Saied, lashed out at organisations that defended the rights of migrants, calling their leaders “traitors and mercenaries”. Saied, who has overseen a sweeping crackdown on undocumented black people living in Tunisia, won a second term as president last month in a vote with turnout of just 28.8%. Tunisia has received large funds from the EU in exchange for help with curbing small boat crossings to Europe, under an agreement signed last year. Ben Amor said this was the first time authorities had used anti-terrorist investigators against associations specialising in migration issues. The arrest was “a dangerous signal” and part of “a new wave of even tougher repression” against migration activists after a crackdown in May, he said. In 2023, the Guardian revealed how thousands of people from sub-Saharan Africa had been forcibly returned by Tunisian officers to remote desert regions where some died of thirst. Last month a Guardian investigation revealed abuses by EU-funded security forces in Tunisia, including allegations that members of the Tunisian national guard were raping migrant women and beating children. In a note released over the weekend, the Committee for the Respect of Liberties and Human Rights in Tunisia said: “Abdallah Said is incarcerated as part of a policy of criminalising solidarity with migrants, which has resulted in numerous arrests and ongoing prosecutions in cases for which no hearings have yet been scheduled.” On Friday, Victor Dupont, a 27-year-old PhD student at Aix-Marseille University’s Institute of Research and Study on the Arab and Islamic World,returned to Paris after almost one month of detention in Tunisia. Dupont researched social movements, youth unemployment and Tunisia’s 2011 revolution. His case had been compared to that of Giulio Regeni, the University of Cambridge PhD student whose tortured body was found dumped after he went missing in Cairo in 2016. Dupont’s arrest provoked concerns about the safety and security of foreign researchers in Tunisia, where Saied has reversed many of the democratic gains made since the country’s longtime dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was toppled in 2011 during the regional uprisings known as the Arab spring. “Our fear was that after the presidential election on October 6 the repression of any voice and form of dissent would only increase,” a European PhD student based in Tunisia said. “The arrests of Dupont and Said confirm that the authorities are willing to gamble with both diplomatic relations and relations with marginalised citizens to crack down on freedom of speech, academic freedom, and solidarity with refugees,” added the student, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation. Agence France-Presse and Associated Press contributed to this report"

          "headline": "‘A log cabin straight out of a children’s book’: a remote woodland stay near the Lake District",
          "bodyText": "If you want to reach Shank Wood log cabin, the key is to keep going: to the very top of England; deep into the woods; right to the edge of a river. As we drove through pockmarked fields, and down bumpy dirt tracks, steeling ourselves for a steep, muddy descent, I began to realise just how isolated our home for the next few days would be. The cabin, with its moss-covered roof and walls made from stacked sitka spruce logs, could have been lifted straight from the pages of a children’s book. Perched above the River Lyne, in Shank Wood ancient woodlands in the very north of Cumbria, it lived up to its billing on the website as “the real secluded log cabin experience”. With no television and no phone signal, we had no option but to disconnect from everyday life and instead appreciate the world around us. Full disclosure: I am not very good at relaxing. I often fall asleep with my phone still in my hand. In the morning, I’m woken by the news on the radio. When I go on holiday, I typically try to squeeze in more sights, bars and restaurants than seems necessary. And, although I love being outdoors, I am not very good at camping. The idea of immersing myself in nature has always appealed, but the tent part of the deal has always put me off. So this was a revelation. The only cabin in the wood, it was built with exactly this in mind: to reconnect visitors with the natural rhythms of the world. A bathroom pod, solar power and outdoor kitchen with running water and barbecue provide a softer gateway to the great outdoors for those of us who can’t quite embrace life under canvas. Rob Carr, a dairy farmer from Carlisle, wanted to open up this untouched corner of England to the world when he built both the Shank Wood cabin and, later, the more accessible Hidden River cabins, which lie just under two miles away, closer to civilisation. On our first night it rained, but rather than put a dampener on things, it only served to make me feel more connected with the world around me. I sat in the hot tub, listening to the sound of the swollen river rushing past, and watching tiny bats flit through the trees overhead while raindrops fell on my head. The rain lashed relentlessly on to the wooden roof, but it felt calming to be in the cabin, warmed by a log burner, lit by its flickering flames. It was not dissimilar to one of the artificial sleep sounds I play to drown out the noise of city living, and it helped me drift off. In the morning, we woke to birdsong, and sunlight slowly filtering through the window of the mezzanine level where we slept. I crept outside, hoping to catch sight of the red deer or otters that are often seen nearby. Shafts of sunlight pierced through the oak, ash, birch, sycamore and alder and danced on the fast-flowing tea-brown river. While I could have happily never left the cabin, there is plenty to see and do within easy reach. Around half an hour’s drive away is Birdoswald Roman Fort and the longest continuous stretch of Hadrian’s Wall. Another 15 minutes west of Shank Wood takes you to Gretna Green, where wedding ceremonies are still held in the Famous Blacksmiths Shop where young runaway couples first married in 1754. We went for lunch at the Hidden River Cafe, which lies close to the six larger log cabins at the Hidden River site. Bathed in natural light from the floor-to-ceiling glass doors, we settled on to a bench looking out on the patio that gives way to rolling green fields. Sipping steaming mugs of coffee and refuelling on delicious plates of chilli squid, battered haddock and homemade chips, we were almost tempted to book another table for dinner. But neither the drive up those rugged roads, nor the half-hour walk along the riverbank, felt advisable in darkness. Also, we couldn’t bear the thought of missing out on another cosy night in our wilderness bolthole. So, by the time night fell we were back in the hot tub, catching glimpses of bright stars through gaps in the low blanket of cloud, the rush of the river our now-familiar background music. Later, as we settled into bed, hours earlier than we normally manage at home, my partner turned to me and said: “This is the most relaxed I’ve felt in years.” Shank Wood log cabin (fishinghideaway) sleeps up to four, from £420 for two nights"
