          "headline": "Beginners by Tom Vanderbilt review – it's never too late to learn",
          "bodyText": "Most highly skilled fields have rude names for beginners. In surfing you’re a “kook”, in chess a “patzer”, in competitive cycling a “Fred” and in the US army a “boot”. “Dilettante”, from the Italian dilettare, to delight, has come to mean a frivolous dabbler. “Amateur”, with its roots in the French word for love, now often means inept, bungling, uncommitted. And yet there has never been a better time to be a beginner. Learning platforms such as Coursera, Skillshare and Duolingo sell you an experience that you can fit around your busy life, achieving mastery in short bursts. The enforced inertia of lockdown seems to have led to a wave of intellectual and creative self-improvement, at least for the first few weeks. As a man arrested for illegally performing cosmetic surgery put it: “Pretty close to anything you want to learn you can learn off YouTube for free.” More than 100 “Smule babies” have been reported by couples who met performing duets on the online singing app. In this book, Tom Vanderbilt joins the growing army of beginners. Stuck in a gentle rut of mid-career competence, he decides to spend a year learning new skills. He hires a singing teacher and joins the Britpop Choir, which performs songs by Blur and Oasis. He takes up drawing, then surfing. He learns to juggle. With the help of a jeweller, he even makes his own wedding ring. None of these undertakings turn into life-altering passions. They are simply “capricious and tenacious enthusiasms”, in James Dickey’s phrase, done for the fun of it. The spur for all this comes from Vanderbilt’s experience of parenthood, an “epistemically unique” activity which can only be learned in the doing of it. All parents are beginners, and beginner teachers, clumsily passing on knowledge to their children (never more so than this year). As he watches his daughter effortlessly picking up how to swim or play chess, Vanderbilt worries that he has left it too late. “It’s hard to be old and bad at something,” as a friend, returning to hockey in middle age, puts it. The same doubts have plagued me as, in the last couple of years, and at a similar age to Vanderbilt, I too have taken up singing. Is it worth investing so much effort in my voice when it will already be succumbing to gentle, age-induced decline? Vanderbilt doesn’t try to gloss the hard facts about learning and ageing – babies learn best of all – but he offers some cautious reasons for hope, and shows that learning at any age is good for you. He also passes on plenty of good technical advice. For instance, we tend to fixate on the idea of a “high” note as something just that – vertically high – when it is nothing of the sort. So when straining for a “high” note we lift our heads up, tighten our shoulders and even stand on tiptoe, reaching for that note on the ceiling – all things that make it harder to reach. The tongue, Vanderbilt finds, is the singer’s worst enemy because it gets in the way of exhaled breath and sound. So focus on the vowels; vowels are the voice and consonants are its interruption. Even if you’re not a singer, this is all fascinating. Vanderbilt learns that beginners are all alike: they make the same mistakes. Novice archers always grip the bow too tightly and aim too long. Novice chess players always move their pawns too much and bring out the queen too early. Novice artists always overstress the things that are important to them. When drawing a face, they make the eyes too big and higher up than they are actually are, and the forehead too small. They draw the object they see in their heads, not the series of lines and angles in front of them. The good news is that, since beginners all fail in similar ways, they can all get better in similar ways. There is a certain bittiness to this book, with each section on a particular skill feeling self-contained. This is partly because, as Vanderbilt concedes, skill learning is specific. Nothing about trying to stand up on a wobbly surfboard will help you learn to draw. Even skills like surfing and cycling, which both require good balance and body strength, have little crossover. Gradually, though, an overall argument emerges, even if Vanderbilt is overfond of supporting it with the standard formulae “according to research” and “studies have found”. He believes, like Zen Buddhists, that we should all cultivate a beginner’s mind, as an encouragement to creativity, openness and humility. Being a beginner is good for the brain, because you are putting it through the equivalent of “a variety of high-intensity interval workouts”. Absorption in any new activity is meditative and makes you see the world differently. After his drawing classes, Vanderbilt finds himself stopping in the street to study “the subtle dynamics of a cityscape reflected in a car’s hood, or the textural pattern on the peel of an orange”. Hearteningly, he achieves tangible results with relatively little painful effort. People appreciate his inexpert but improved singing, because most people can’t sing very well. The title of one scholarly paper he cites – “Imprecise singing is widespread” – says it all. The acid test is “Happy Birthday”, the most familiar song in the language and yet quite hard to sing, because it spans an octave and moves up and down it dramatically. Juggling is another crowd-pleasing skill that can be learned in just a few days, once you teach your brain that it is less about throwing individual objects than “throwing to a pattern, like tossing to a little algorithm in the sky”. He quickly establishes that juggling gains you instant kudos among any group of seven-year-olds. This story mirrors mine. After you have been doing your job for as long as Vanderbilt and I have, people simply expect you to be proficient and stop praising you for your work. This is especially true in my own field of academia, where most of the feedback you get is critique; unqualified praise is rare and viewed, I have long suspected, as vulgar. But when I resolved recently, in lockdown, to learn how to play the spoons, I found out how easy it was to impress people with little clips posted on YouTube. After a couple of months spent learning a superficially difficult skill, I was receiving the kind of affirmation I had not had since primary school. But it’s not really about the praise. As someone who, like Vanderbilt, mostly “pushes electrons for a living”, the tactility of learning a new skill is itself comforting and grounding. This is Vanderbilt’s great revelation – that in a world where apps constantly rate us and measure our performance, so that learning anything becomes another form of work, we should enjoy the process more and worry less about the product. All he achieves in the end is a modest competency in various unrelated activities. But it has brought him “an immense and almost forgotten kind of pleasure”. This book conveys that pleasure and is itself a pleasure to read. It made me want to get back to my singing, and my spoons. • Beginners: The Curious Power of Lifelong Learning is published by Atlantic (£16.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.

          "headline": "Obsolete software from 1990s features in Brexit deal text",
          "bodyText": "The EU-UK Brexit deal refers to defunct decades-old computer software such as Netscape Communicator as “modern”, raising suspicions that some of the text may have been copied and pasted in. Online commenters gleefully shared the observation that page 921 of the painfully birthed trade agreement refers to Netscape Communicator – released in June 1997 – and Mozilla Mail as being “modern e-mail software packages”. A section on encryption technology also gave rise to suspicions that officials simply pasted large chunks of text from previous documents into the deal, which has been lauded by its backers as the beginning of a new chapter in relationship between the UK and the EU. Computer scientist Prof Bill Buchanan reminded followers of what Netscape looked like back in the day, tweeting: “One day we will build a digital world fit for the 21st Century ...” The references sparked a wave of nostalgia on Twitter and the trading of memories about old internet browsers such as Netscape, which was edged out in the 1990s by Microsoft’s Internet Explorer. The text of the deal reads: “s/MIME functionality is built into the vast majority of modern e-mail software packages including Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major e-mail software packages.” Other eagle-eyed observers noted how the agreement recommended the use of 1024-bit RSA encryption and the SHA-1 hashing algorithm, both of which are susceptible to cyber-attacks on account of their age. Liz Truss kicked off trade talks with Japan in June with a promise that the UK could establish itself as a “global technology superpower”. “I really do feel that we are world-leading in technology,” said the secretary of state for international trade. A Home Office spokesperson said: “The provisions in the relevant annex to the agreement set out the legally prescribed measures for cooperation. We currently use the latest technology to share this data, which is properly protected and in line with the guidance from the National Cyber Security Centre.” Separately, the UK announced on Tuesday that it had signed a free trade deal with Turkey, its first since agreeing a Brexit deal to leave the EU. Parliament will be recalled on Wednesday in order for MPs to debate and vote on the bill to enact Downing Street’s trade agreement with the EU. An 80-page draft version of the bill was published on Tuesday, leaving little time for members of parliament and others to scrutinise it."

          "bodyText": "Forced to Zoom and stream, theatres are reacting to events in ways that may change what they do for ever. They have become first responders. A vivid initiative shows how nimble they can be. Inspired by the Federal Theatre Project, set up after the Great Depression in America, which enabled unemployed theatre workers to produce politically engaged drama, the Royal Court is creating a Living Newspaper. Six online editions will involve more than 60 writers and 200-plus other freelancers – directors, designers, performers – who have been starved of income over the past 10 months. Each week they put on quick scenes in different parts of the building. Here are rattling raps, gentle dances, lilac deckchairs, husky song, declamation, sweeping shafts of coloured light; a cartoon featuring the union jack and a mound of poo; an acute monologue by a guilty white climate-change protester; an agony aunt whose main resource is an algorithm. Urgency. Meanwhile, under the direction of Tom Morris and Julia Head, Angels in Bristol shows the miraculous in the mundane. Nine short episodes talk of rebirth, drawing on the words of the Bristol City Poet, Vanessa Kisuule, and the gifts of local non-professional groups. A black female super-power presides over watery cloudscapes. A young dance group shrug themselves into life as Adam and Eve. Primary school children bunny-hop as they talk about Noah and his Ark. And looking at the promised land of Weston-super-Mare, adults talk of their dreams and transforming moments: the front of a ship seen through a room full of mist; the restoration of a lost sister; “a place I could go to where I wouldn’t be bullied”. As the city looks again at its history, the star in the east shines over the west. • Edition 1 of Living Newspaper has come and gone; edition 2 is available to watch until 27 December, 4pm; editions 3 to 6 will be released in the new year. • Angels in Bristol is online until 5 January"

          "bodyText": "Throughout the pandemic, technology has been saving our jobs and our sanity – but in Barcelona the lockdowns have led to the revival of one of humanity’s simplest and most enduring inventions: the book. The city’s booksellers are reporting a boom in sales and, against all odds, new bookshops have opened. The latest of the new crop of shops is the Llibreria Byron, launched by the small academic publisher Huygens, which opened in November in the Sant Antoni area of the city. “We’d been planning this for three years and were set to open in April, but that obviously wasn’t possible,” said Mariana Sarrias, the shop’s co-owner. “After nine months of uncertainty and with everything that, as a small business, we had invested, it was very worrying,” she said, adding that they chose the name Byron “because he was romantic and also quite transgressive”. “The day we finally opened in November there was a queue of people waiting to get in. There wasn’t room for everyone. It was really quite moving. Since then people come every day. I don’t know if it’s out of solidarity or because the bookshop is something the barrio [suburb] lacked.” “The pandemic has made people aware of the need to support their local bookshop,” said Maria Carme Ferrer, president of the Catalan booksellers’ association. “Bookshops are local cultural centres.” Sarrias says that as publishers they had already noticed an increase in orders during lockdown. “Maybe people ran out of things to watch on Netflix,” she said, or perhaps, as they were forced into isolation, people realised that books are good company. And yet only recently the book business looked doomed. In 2013 the Catalonia bookshop, a magnet for the city’s readers since 1924, was forced to close and was replaced by a McDonald’s. That same year Canuda, the labyrinthine secondhand bookshop that was the inspiration behind the “cemetery of forgotten books” in Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s bestselling The Shadow of the Wind, also went out of business. It is now a branch of fashion chain Mango. Perhaps this sudden revival is only to be expected in a city that is the capital of the Spanish publishing trade and where the Catalans’ love of books is celebrated every year on 23 April, birthday of the patron saint, Sant Jordi (St George), and coincidentally Shakespeare’s birthday. On this day people exchange gifts of books and roses and the streets are lined with impromptu book stalls. The pandemic meant that Sant Jordi was effectively cancelled this year and it’s likely to be a small-scale affair in 2021, according to Lluís Morral, manager of Laie, perhaps the city’s best-loved bookshop. Morral says sales have definitely increased during lockdown, especially among the classics rather than recent bestsellers. “A lot of people have come back to reading and they aren’t looking for the latest publication but are more catching up on books they meant to read a few years ago,” he said. “A lot of people buy books on Sant Jordi but don’t read them. Now they realise they have all these books at home and they’ve started reading them.” He agrees with Sarrias that isolation has led people to discover – or remember – that books are very companionable. “I can’t speak for everyone, but among my acquaintances a lot of people reached saturation point watching TV series,” Morral said. Both Laie and Byron are bookshop-cafes with quiet spaces for reading, a much-needed refuge in what is officially Europe’s noisiest city. Two other new outlets, Ona, which sells books only in Catalan, and Finestres, due to open in the spring, have also set themselves up as places to meet and read as well as to buy books. Both have been financed by local philanthropists and, while he wishes them well, Morral knows that like all bookshops these relative minnows will have a battle on their hands to compete with Amazon. “What we [independent bookshops] can offer is a personal service and an understanding of what book you’ve bought and what you might also enjoy, rather than have an algorithm tell you what to read next,” he said."

Investigative reporter John Sweeney helms a podcast on events described by its makers as “melancholic and macabre”, deftly delving into connections with a number of insalubrious sorts – and a familiar member of the British royal family. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 19 United Zingdom Vice journalist Zing Tsjeng was born in Singapore, but has lived in London since she was in her teens. But should she trade her Singaporean passport in for a British one, and what does being British mean anyway? This riveting roadtrip – in the company of the sweet, slightly sardonic Tsjeng – offers wonderful, human tales from Newcastle, Glasgow, Essex and beyond, bringing some regional intrigue to the often London-centric podcast world. Available on BBC Sounds 18 The Isolation Tapes Honesty has long been the policy of this charmingly filterless show from standups Elis James and John Robins – and it paid dividends during the pandemic. This year saw the pair supplement their weekly BBC Radio 5 Live broadcast with extra podcast episodes that drilled down into the tedium, melancholy and anxiety of lockdown with kindness and giddy humour – public service broadcasting at its most restorative. Available on BBC Sounds 17 Off Menu In 2020, James Acaster and Ed Gamble’s dream restaurant – a place where guests can magically summon their favourite three-course meal – was among the few culinary establishments consistently open, tirelessly churning out dishes ridiculous and sublime. This year, David O’Doherty indulged in canal-dredged chowder, Romesh Ranganathan got his Gobi 65 fix and Jo Brand feasted on Birds Eye potato waffle coleslaw, their foodie fantasies invariably accompanied by a hearty side of banter. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 16 The Nobody Zone A grim listen, this co-production between Ireland’s national broadcaster RTÉ and Denmark’s Third Ear podcast unpicks the story of Kieran Patrick Kelly, the “London Underground serial killer” who preyed on some of society’s most vulnerable people – fellow members of south London’s homeless community. Rumours, suspicions, and new evidence come together in a thoroughly researched crime saga. What we said: Teasing music, intricate sound design and an old cassette tape of one of the police interviews set the scene nicely. But the real genius is in the scripting. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 15 The Heart An “audio art project about power and love” from US/Canadian podcasters Mermaid Palace, The Heart is where you’re as likely to hear personal tales from transgender creators and consumers of porn as you are a monologue on holiday romance from a queer Asian man or a miniseries about tackling white supremacy. It is powerful, often emotional and unapologetically inclusive. This show about connections shines at a time when we’ve been pondering them the most. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 14 The Sink This comedy-horror series takes a slightly different tack than the meditation, ASMR and sleep shows around, instead offering help for those with “difficult toes”, a “callous attitude to wrists” and “overwhelming dread”. This disquieting dream exploration by Natasha Hodgson might not actually, as it claims, banish the “bad smell” from your brain (can anything in 2020?) but it is deliciously bizarre, in a Blue Jam kind of way. Available on BBC Sounds 13 Rabbit Hole Fans of the Netflix doc The Social Dilemma can find more insights into the internet’s mind-warping effects in this highly unnerving New York Times series. It’s a deep dive into YouTube, and features CEO Susan Wojcicki, superstar creator PewDiePie and those who were “radicalised” by the platform. Taking in QAnon, white supremacy and terrorist attacks, it doubles as a stark warning against letting the site’s algorithm dictate the contents of your next binge. What we said: If you’ve not yet fallen down the rabbit hole that is the Rabbit Hole podcast prepare to be enlightened and a little freaked out. Available on Spotify, the New York Times website and Apple Podcasts 12 The Adam Buxton Podcast “I added one more podcast to the giant podcast bin”: so goes the theme tune to the cult ramble-chat show. If the pod market seemed crowded in 2015 when this endearing series debuted, it is positively heaving now – which makes Buxton’s continued ubiquity especially impressive. This year has featured some quality repeat guests (Zadie Smith, Natasia Demetriou) and seen Buxton speak movingly about his mother’s death with old friend Joe Cornish. What we said: These conversations are the opposite of Twitter: kind and curious. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 11 The Daily This was the year that the news went into overdrive, with Covid, Brexit, Trump, and Black Lives Matter dominating headlines. As such, the existing glut of news podcasts only increased, though few were as incisive and thoroughly reported as this journalist-led flagship show from the New York Times. Plus: bonus points for Michael Barbaro, and his unique way of letting us know what else we need to “NoTuhDay”. What we said: The Daily’s investigation into child sexual abuse imagery is hugely powerful, encapsulating why narrative news and audio are such a powerful combination. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 10 You’re Wrong About Modern myths, moral panics and media storms are dissected and (usually) debunked by journalists Michael Hobbes and Sarah Marshall in this sensationally clever podcast. With topics ranging from the still ubiquitous (Princess Diana, Marie Antoinette) to the largely forgotten (the Tuskegee syphilis study, the disappearance of Chandra Levy), the podcast sees the smart and funny pair uproot lazy assumptions, interrogate prejudices and uncover crucial facts buried beneath public misconception. What we said: The journey is equal parts entertaining and interesting, with an unforced and easy chemistry between the hosts, driven by Marshall’s sharp intellect with Hobbes’s more fun-loving side. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 9 Twenty Twenty Journalists Simran Hans and Tara Joshi were in primary school during that brief, blissful moment when children could legitimately say to their friends: “See you next millennium!” In this podcast, they return to crunch the pop culture they unthinkingly embraced at the time – from Craig David to Faking It to The Sims – with sharpened critical faculties and a keen sense of the enduring influence of these not-so-trivial artefacts. What we said: Its hosts have a serious love for 2000s pop culture and, having grown up with the boundaries between supposedly high and low culture coming down, know how to expertly shift between funny and profound. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 8 Slow Burn Another year, another series of Slate’s hit podcast, which has previously covered the deaths of Tupac and the Notorious BIG, the Watergate scandal and Bill Clinton’s impeachment. This time around, the focus was on the white supremacist leader-turned-politician David Duke, as host Josh Levin brought together troubling archive clips with prescient analysis. Two more series – on the run-up to the Iraq war and the 1992 LA riots – are on the way. What we said: It’s hard to ignore the sense of foreboding eeriness that comes as you start to realise – through clever scripting and use of archive – that the story of a white man getting to power by making himself “a cause” for the disenfranchised isn’t a historical one. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 7 From the Oasthouse: The Alan Partridge podcast Opinionated, minutiae-obsessed and a big fan of the sound of his own voice: Alan Partridge isn’t justperfect for local radio, he’s also the platonic ideal of a podcast host. From the Oasthouse sees him soliloquise for seven hours on topics including his love of corporate gigs and his estrangement from his grandchildren. It’s testament to Steve Coogan and co’s lack of preciousness that Partridge keeps moving with the times. This latest troll-besieged iteration is an unbridled joy. What we said: A triumphant return, with Partridge segueing from his own Blue Monday to a complaint about ravers ruining service stations, “the essential haven for the weary traveller”. Available on Audible 6 Katherine Ryan: Telling Everybody Everything While most podcasts thrive on the back-and-forth between co-hosts and/or guests, this series from comedian Katherine Ryan is essentially a series of extended monologues that take in a slew of disparate subjects: potty training, miscarriage, cancel culture, showbiz sexism. With her spellbinding self-assurance and suffer-no-fools attitude, Telling Everybody Everything elevates Ryan to inspirational figure status, her pod sermons full of striking candour and hard-won wisdom. What we said: Ryan’s acerbic one-liners are in full flow in a podcast that covers a lot of ground, including Tiger King, her daughter Violet and getting romantic in lockdown. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 5 Where is George Gibney? This BBC podcast saw reporter Mark Horgan travel across Ireland, the US and the UK in search of Irish Olympic swimming coach George Gibney, who was charged with child sex offences in 1994 but vanished before he could stand trial. Devastating but essential and with disturbing content, the show centres on sensitively covered accounts from victims and those who had been under Gibney’s tutelage. What we said: Unlike a lot of true crime, the focus is skewed towards the survivors and their stories, which makes it seem a lot more valuable than some of the gore-centric entities of the genre. Available on BBC Sounds 4 Nice White Parents In the face of a global reckoning triggered by the murder of George Floyd, podcasts about racial inequality took on new relevance. Rising above the docuseries surfeit, Nice White Parents asked whether the actions of well-meaning but overbearing, clueless, and sometimes cowardly, white parents had in fact made the US school system a worse place to be for black students over the past 60 years. What we said: Chana Joffe-Walt presents what is an intriguing look at “arguably the most powerful force” in the US public school system and continued role of segregation in US education, with a hefty accompanying reading list available online. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 3 Grounded With Louis Theroux When lockdown left him unable to film his immersive documentaries, Theroux pivoted to podcasting, taking the opportunity to corner some of the most interesting names in showbiz while they were also under house arrest. Despite the matey overtones (Helena Bonham Carter reminisces about the pair’s schooldays; Sia recalls writing him fan mail), Theroux pulls no punches interview wise, and is unafraid to ask awkward questions. What we said: Theroux is a skilful listener rather than an interrupter and guests such as Boy George, Lenny Henry and Miriam Margolyes promise to be interview gold. Available on BBC Sounds 2 Dear Joan and Jericha Incest, bestiality, public defecation and snaring prospective sexual partners with a big net: the advice of Julia Davis and Vicki Pepperdine’s all-nonsense agony aunts leaves no taboo unturned. But their bizarre counsel isn’t just bleakly, hysterically funny, it’s also cathartic. In Joan and Jericha’s world, women are lazy, unsympathetic and physically repellent, while “guys” are hard-working and gorgeous, making the show an outrageously gratifying pastiche of misogyny old and new. What we said: Armed with their own experiences of marital difficulties and large-headed lesbian progeny, no problem is too filthy or absurd to receive a dose of their unique wisdom. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts 1 Wind of Change Was a hammy 90s power ballad in fact a secret, anti-Soviet counter-intelligence tool, penned by the CIA? Such was the outlandish claim at the centre of our top podcast of 2020. Named for the song at its centre – Wind of Change by West German rock outfit Scorpions – this gripping podcast, hosted by the New Yorker’s Patrick Radden Keefe, had it all. For history fans, it offered a window into the espionage tactics of the cold war era; for music fans, it told of an intriguing urban legend behind a seemingly anodyne hit; and for those with a taste for true crime and mystery, it was a chance to see the conventions of those genres applied to a whole new subject. A singular series, and one which – in an age of ubiquitous fake news – challenged listeners to think about the complicated nature of truth. Plus, bonus points for getting the whistle-along earworm that is Wind of Change into all of our heads. Available on Spotify and Apple Podcasts"

          "bodyText": "It’s no surprise that decades ago, you were more likely to get a job if your name was Smith rather than Singh – as anti-racism campaigners found. In these more enlightened times, companies have strategies to beat a kneejerk reaction to an unfamiliar name, the “wrong” gender, or the suspect “gut feeling”. Yet the diversity statistics suggest these strategies haven’t yet proved effective in the tech sector. Something certainly hasn’t been going right – tech remains notoriously male, especially higher up the company rungs. Women make up just 20% of IT specialists and just 12% of leadership roles, according to the latest analysis by BCS, The Chartered Institute for IT, and numbers have budged very little over the past five years. “Current methods of countering bias – such as quotas, or training – are rudimentary and traditional,” says Riham Satti, a clinical neuroscientist turned entrepreneur who’s created technology to make it easier for people to recruit staff more fairly, regardless of background, gender or ethnicity. There are more than 140 cognitive biases, she says – unconscious bias is one – and while we can be aware of them, we can’t remove them. From confirmation bias (interpreting new information as a vindication of existing beliefs) through to anchoring (relying on the first piece of information encountered when making decisions), these cognitive biases have an impact on every choice we make. Recruiters, for instance, typically review CVs in seconds, and they need to take mental shortcuts amid an overwhelming amount of details. To counter this, there’s been a broader move by companies in the last few years to recruit “blind” – assessing a candidate’s skills anonymously. Rather than a traditional application, some companies, such as public sector startup Public, invite applicants to complete online tests, based on an aspect of the job advertised, to determine their skills. “So you can’t tell what gender they are, or where they are from,” says Hanna Johnson, Public’s chief operating officer. A handful of staff rate each answer – and these ratings help build a leaderboard of candidates to be invited for interview. “You don’t know their gender, ethnicity, where they live or what university they went to.” For three years her organisation has been using blind-hiring software Be Applied – it also has a stake in it – and it’s only backfired once. “We had a candidate who answered all questions fantastically – but he lived abroad and didn’t have any prior experience.” Her company now employs more women than men – a rarity in the tech sector. But many companies still require a traditional letter and CV for their hiring processes. That’s why Satti’s tech plugs in to more than 15 types of software (application tracking systems, also called ATS) that analyse CVs. Using eye-tracking technology she asked recruiters to glance over applications for 10 seconds. “We knew where they looked and their neural activity,” she explains. And that’s where the problems start. Recruiters focus on candidates’ names, where they studied, who they’ve worked for. “But these don’t tell you much about who they are or what they can do,” she says. “A name is not an indicator of talent.” Her company, MeVitae, has created technology that uses computational linguistics to spot and remove a host of telltale details on a CV and cover letter, such as school, university, disability, gender, ethnicity, marital status, age and hobbies – all the stuff that says who you are and where you are from. “I went to a girls’ sixth form, for instance,” says Satti. “There are many subtle things – apart from your name – that reveal more than you realise.” It also recognises common ground between different roles – data scientist and computer scientist, for instance, and compares how skills correlate among university degree modules, rather than relying on degree titles, which can be confusing. As well as speeding up the process, Satti says, this technology has helped shift the dial – diversity and inclusion has improved by 30% among their mostly UK and US clients, in both public sector and commercial. Next March the company, which has received funding from the likes of the European Space Agency and Innovate UK, plans to launch an algorithm to help companies draw up detailed candidate shortlists. And the team behind the algorithm have been careful to avoid building technology that risks entrenching existing norms and prejudices. In the recent past, algorithms have displayed bias – Amazon scrapped an AI recruitment algorithm in 2018, which proved biased against women, and in 2019 Apple launched a credit card, provided by Goldman Sachs, that appeared to offer women less credit than men. There are several checks and balances that can overcome potential bias within AI during its design, says Satti, and these includes, in part, using data to train AI on what should be, rather than what is. “We are very selective in what data we use,” she says. “We know where biases lie.” Large tech organisations are taking bias seriously – IBM is developing an algorithmic bias detection tool, using publicly available data. Facebook is launching an independent team that audits its algorithms to ensure they don’t discriminate against minority ethnic groups. Of course, bias-free recruitment is just one part of the puzzle of better diversity – beyond hiring a more mixed workforce, companies need to work harder at hanging on to staff, developing their careers, and making workplaces more palatable. And there are other means of attracting more women, suggests Simon Lyle, UK managing director of outplacement firm Randstad RiseSmart. “Organisations looking to employ more women in tech would be well advised to highlight job security now,” he says. He asks if HR is losing its human touch – research commissioned by Randstad RiseSmart showed 57% of employees believe recruitment is becoming too automated. Good applicants risk being overlooked if they omit critical key words during automatic scanning, he warns. Satti, who describes herself as a “tickbox” case for diversity – “I’m BAME, a woman, with a disability” – is optimistic that diversity and inclusion will be fundamental to business growth, and a fairer hiring process is a critical link. “We are on a path to creating a more meritocratic society. More companies are hiring heads of diversity and inclusion – but they need a budget and the will from the top to drive that change.”"

          "bodyText": "Frontline healthcare workers saw their hopes dashed last week when a botched algorithm, crashing scheduling platforms and other logistical mishaps thwarted their efforts to be among the first in the US to receive a long-awaited coronavirus vaccine. Amid a surge in infections overwhelming hospitals around the US, doctors were incensed by administrative failures that denied access to the potentially life-saving shots, even as they volunteered to work in intensive care units or looked after the critically ill. Christine Santiago is an internal medicine resident with Stanford Health Care in California, where ICU availability is at 2% statewide. “I think that there’s a sense of disappointment in not really being considered,” she said, “despite sort of being held up as like, you know, ‘healthcare heroes’, and being on the frontlines. “Maybe it was just words.” More than 100 Stanford doctors protested on Friday, standing up for respiratory therapists, environmental services workers, nursing staff, residents and fellows who interact with patients. They were unable to lay claim to initial doses of the vaccine, even as they learned that employees doing telehealth from home had nabbed slots. “Healthcare heroes, support is zero,” the protesters chanted. Residents – doctors completing their training after medical school – were especially frustrated because they were being asked to volunteer for the Covid ICU but Stanford’s algorithm was not prioritizing them for vaccination. Ronald Witteles, program director at Stanford’s internal medicine residency program, tweeted that the vaccine rollout “was an absolute mess” and “one of the most upsetting 24 hours I have ever experienced”. Stanford Medicine said it took “complete responsibility for the errors in the execution of our vaccine distribution plan”, which it was “immediately revising”. “Our intent was to develop an ethical and equitable process for distribution of the vaccine,” the statement said. “We apologize to our entire community, including our residents, fellows, and other frontline care providers, who have performed heroically during our pandemic response.” On the east coast, doctors in Boston’s Mass General Brigham system were also distraught. After the online scheduling platform crashed, employees filed into a long line on Thursday morning to sign up for shots in-person. But staff in emergency departments couldn’t abandon their patients. Once appointments came back online, availability vanished in minutes, a rush one physician likened to buying tickets to see Taylor Swift. “It has converted it [into] almost like a parking spot, you know?” said the doctor, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “It’s almost become an employee perk that everyone’s rushing to get as soon as they can.” In an email to leadership that was ultimately not sent, the physician described how “employee was pitted against employee in a dystopian race” and how “what should have been a moment of triumph for medicine and the healthcare system writ large was instead clouded by the dysfunction that hospitals are known for only too well”. Other disappointed healthcare professionals posted screenshots on social media, showing error messages received instead of appointments. “In attempting to prove I am not a robot repeatedly, I watched every date and time slip away,” tweeted George Alba, a pulmonary and critical care physician at Massachusetts general hospital. He added: “We got crushed by a boulder of operational failure.” A spokesman said Mass General Brigham was following priorities set by the commonwealth of Massachusetts with guidance from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that “the first group is deliberately inclusive of the role groups who are involved in the care of Covid patients”. “While we have now scheduled as many appointments as our initial supply allows, we expect to receive a significant shipment of vaccine in the coming days,” he said. Tufts medical center experienced similar issues with online signup, the Boston Globe reported. As the US mounts a historic vaccination campaign, such hiccups could prove a harbinger of problems affecting Americans at large, Santiago warned. “It’s more [about] lessons learned for when this really is gonna be distributed on a large scale for the rest of the population,” she said. The troubles were yet another blow to frontline workers enduring a year in which more than 317,000 people in the US have died from the coronavirus. “I’m going to try to focus on being happy for everyone who managed to get a vaccine slot, and not on my personal inability to do the same,” tweeted Yuval Raz, a doctor at Mass General. “I mean, I’m probably going to fail and throw a tantrum, but I’ll try.”"

          "bodyText": "High-impact journalism | Introduction from Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief This year was the most challenging and extraordinary year for news that I can remember, and I’m sure many of you feel the same way. As you’ll read in this report, our journalists worked tirelessly throughout 2020, from the very start of the year with the Australian bushfires, through the struggle for Hong Kong, the Harvey Weinstein verdict to the death of George Floyd, and the dramatic and divisive US presidential election. But of course, the Covid-19 pandemic was the dominant global story of the year, transforming so much, from our editorial priorities to how we work. Our coverage sought to foreground the science and the latest data, to hold the government and the scientific establishment to account and expose incompetence, and to bring empathy and humanity to the stories of the victims. We realised early on that the pandemic had the capacity to change everything about how we live, so Guardian and Observer journalists devoted formidable effort and resources to investigating the social and economic effects of this crisis. We also understood the important role that endeavour, community and charity would play in confronting the emergency, and so sought out hope wherever it could be found. We expanded our reporting on the climate and environmental crisis, following the movements trying to bring about change, digging deep into the loss of wildlife and investigating the mounting problems of air pollution and microplastics. We also drew the connection between the Covid crisis and the environment, trying to get politicians to understand how the pandemic is the result of our annihilation of nature, year after year. Our investigations team produced a succession of game-changing revelations about the UK government’s handling of the pandemic, such as the scandalous disregard for life in care homes, and the repeated mishandling of vital protection equipment for healthcare workers. In the UK, our sensational revelation, in partnership with the Daily Mirror, that the prime minister’s right-hand man, Dominic Cummings, had travelled from London to Durham during lockdown, and then taken a 50-mile trip to Barnard Castle to “test his eyesight”, resulted in a public outcry. Our reporting, like a lot of the best stories, originated with Guardian readers who told us what they had seen. Our investigations were not limited to the UK. We also revealed further allegations of sexual abuse committed by Donald Trump, and unearthed the disturbing background of his supreme court justice pick, Amy Coney Barrett. We published the Luanda Leaks, showing how Africa’s richest woman, Isabel dos Santos, made her fortune through exploiting her own country, and revealed Jeff Bezos had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince – a truly astonishing exposé. These kinds of revelations are at the heart of what we do. Without reader support, we would have fewer resources for the time-consuming, painstaking reporting that often takes weeks or months to get to the front page. If you are a Guardian supporter, thank you for helping us to bring these stories to light. Guardian journalists in the US, UK and around the world have reported with clarity, authority and calm on the Black Lives Matter movement, the debate on monuments to slavery, and the broader social and political questions they raise. In the US, our election coverage included rigorous analysis of the myriad ways millions of Americans are denied voting rights, extensive reporting on the primary and presidential campaigns, and round-the-clock analysis of the election itself. We spoke to voters in often-overlooked communities to understand who and what was motivating them to vote. In Australia, our reporters worked over the festive period to provide unrivalled live coverage of the unprecedented bushfires that ravaged the east coast. The team followed this up with The Frontline, an in-depth multimedia investigation into the many ways the climate emergency is already affecting Australia. Our numbers: +66% in podcast listens, including for Today in Focus, Football Weekly and Full Story ** Our multimedia journalism continues to go from strength to strength. Today in Focus, presented by Anushka Asthana, took home the best current affairs podcast prize at this year’s British Podcast Awards. And we had an incredible 12 months in video (including our standout series on the US election, Anywhere but Washington, and Anywhere but Westminster, covering stories of altruism and community during lockdown) – reaching 3.5 million subscribers across our YouTube network. While these are challenging times for media organisations for a number of reasons, financial support for the Guardian from digital readers in every corner of the world has grown as readers seek out expert journalism and analysis they can trust. The Guardian and the Observer have a history of powerful, high-impact journalism that is read by millions of people worldwide. We now receive support from readers in more than 180 countries, helping us to safeguard the Guardian’s independent journalism. The pandemic and its effects have made life much harder for Guardian readers and supporters around the world. This year, even more than in the past, we are extremely grateful for the financial support readers give to help safeguard our independent journalism. Thank you. Change and adaptation | Introduction from Annette Thomas, chief executive officer I joined the Guardian in March 2020, a few weeks before the first lockdown in the UK. At that point I could never have imagined just how much our business would need to change and adapt in what has been an extraordinary year. My priorities as chief executive throughout the pandemic have been to ensure we continue to serve our readers, digitally and in print, while prioritising the safety of our employees and minimising the economic impact of the pandemic on our business. Strong Guardian journalism relies on a solid business and a team of dedicated commercial colleagues across many different departments. Working life has been very different in 2020, and I am extremely grateful for the commitment and flexibility our employees have shown this year. Our numbers: 2.1 billion unique browsers to our digital platforms, +67% on the year before ** The growing appetite for Guardian journalism was reflected in continued growth in readership – we had a record 1.5bn unique browsers and 16.4bn page views to our digital platforms during 2019-20, both up more than 20% on the previous 12 months. Whilst we experienced record digital readership, coronavirus has accelerated difficult changes across the media sector – we have responded by restructuring some areas of our business as part of a strategy to support the Guardian’s long-term commercial growth. Sadly these changes have included job losses for a number of colleagues, to whom we will say goodbye over the next few months. This process has been difficult, and we have aimed to support all those affected as much as possible. We thank those leaving the organisation greatly for their contribution to the Guardian. Despite these pressures, our unique reader relationship model has proved successful. As our editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, writes, the Guardian has provided independent, fact-based journalism to unprecedented numbers of readers and we have seen an increase in readers’ support over the past year. Since the start of 2020, we have gained 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions, an increase of 43%. As a result, digital reader revenues have continued to grow – with recurring contributions and digital subscriptions (boosted by the popularity of our flagship Editions app) two critical sources of income to support our business and our journalism. Print subscriptions to the Guardian, the Observer and our international news magazine Guardian Weekly (with 70% of its subscribers living outside the UK) have also grown to record levels. And in the past 12 months we have received more than 530,000 single contributions from readers who believe in the Guardian’s purpose, and want to support us. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people have supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times in the last 12 months. Our numbers: 75,000 attendees to our Guardian Live online programme ** We adapted very quickly to the new normal. Guardian Live made a successful pivot to digital, with over 75,000 attendees to our online events, and Guardian Jobs supported the NHS, offering free job listings. And, while the advertising market remains challenging, teams have continued to win new business and high-value repeat bookings – a testament to the strength of our relationships and reputation for brilliant execution. Our international outlook and presence continues to deliver for us commercially as well as strengthening Guardian journalism, with significant growth in the US and Australia where we have well-established presences. And, in the year of Brexit, we have had record numbers reading and supporting the Guardian financially from continental Europe. We will continue to invest in the Guardian’s increasingly global business. We live in a time of great economic uncertainty. There are many challenges ahead for the global news media sector, but we remain confident that the Guardian’s core strengths – high-quality, trusted journalism, a meaningful purpose and trusted brand, a highly talented set of employees, and a commitment to being reader-centric and reader-funded – provide a solid foundation for the organisation to achieve long-term success. Thank you for supporting us. In a deeply troubling year it is inspiring that so many readers agree that progressive journalism is needed more than ever. Reader support | Our reader relationships Readers in 180 countries fund our journalism because they believe in our mission, our independence, and our reporting – and that’s inspiring to all of us who work at the Guardian. From our supporters: Only this week I was recommending the Guardian subscription to a friend because it is such good value for the money. Having read today’s newsletter, I have just altered my contribution and will endeavour to increase it further in due course. In this ever more dangerous world and the sinister manoeuvring of our own government, independent reportage with integrity, which is what you provide, is essential and I thank you for it. Liz Hanson, a reader in Melrose, Scotland Our unique ownership model means we are not controlled by a billionaire owner, or a group of shareholders demanding financial returns – any profits made, and all financial contributions from readers, are reinvested directly into our journalism. Many supporters believe, like we do, that everyone deserves access to quality journalism, so choose to help us remain open and free of a paywall. Our supporters tell us that they deeply value the approach we have chosen – where everyone can access Guardian journalism, regardless of where they live, what they can afford, or how they like to consume the news. Alongside our successful contributions model, in 2020 we have a renewed focus on offering digital subscriptions to our premium apps, in order to build a financially sustainable organisation. As part of our ongoing mission to deliver purposeful, quality journalism, we have evolved our digital subscription products in line with the changing demands of readers in a world of constant breaking news, best digital practices and journalistic innovation. In 2020, we introduced a Weekend Edition for Australian readers, as well as a special Earth Edition to sit alongside our UK Daily Edition – available as part of the Guardian’s digital subscription. We also launched Guardian Puzzles – a dedicated app for crosswords and puzzles from the Guardian and the Observer. From our supporters: I so appreciate the excellent and authentic reporting that the Guardian does – never more than now. I depend on your reporters and photographers to cover US stories with a deep cultural understanding of not only the news, but also the underlying issues that provide a necessary context to truly make sense of where we find ourselves today. Thank you for all that you all do! Susan E Werbe, a reader in Newton, Massachusetts, US Remarkably, despite the health and economic depredations of Covid-19, record numbers of readers chose to financially support us in 2020. The ongoing developments around the global coronavirus pandemic, the Black Lives Matter movement as well as the Guardian’s climate pledge and its US election coverage have all been significant drivers of reader support. Our numbers: 900,000 digital recurring acts of support, +43% since November 2019 ** The Guardian has gained 268,000 new digital subscriptions and recurring contributions over the last year, an increase of 43%. Total digital recurring support now stands at over 900,000, up from 632,000 in November 2019. An 11% year-on-year increase in subscriptions to print products helped offset the hit from the global pandemic to newsstand sales. We now have a record 119,000 print subscriptions across the Guardian, the Observer and Guardian Weekly. In the 12 months to end of October 2020, the Guardian also received over 530,000 single contributions from readers across the world. Including print subscribers and single contributions, people have supported the Guardian financially more than 1.5m times in the last 12 months. In the past few months, we have started to encourage readers to sign in when they visit the Guardian digitally, so we can remember their preferences, improve their experience of the site, and tailor the messages and advertising they see. Strengthening our relationship with our readers, combined with award-winning journalism that the world needs right now, along with our huge reach globally is how we’ll attract more people to support the Guardian financially by the end of our 200th anniversary. Journalism | Guardian reporting 2020 has been a year of monumental disruption, tragedy, activism and change. Throughout these disorienting times, we have sought to go beyond simply reporting the news to provide clarity, hold the powerful to account, and bring empathy and humanity to stories that may otherwise go untold. More than ever, our evidence-based journalism and rigorous analysis has sought to be comprehensive, authoritative and calm – allowing Guardian readers to navigate an at times overwhelming volume of information and noise. Reporting on the pandemic Coronavirus is one of the biggest and most complex stories of our time, touching on all facets of life – politics, science, the economy, people’s lives and relationships. Throughout, our reporting on the pandemic has been expert and courageous – not only in holding those in power to account for their handling of the crisis, but in bringing warmth and humanity to a bleak period and focusing on the tragic stories of the hundreds of thousands of lives lost around the world. Our numbers: 63% growth in subscribers to Guardian YouTube channels ** In the early days of the crisis, our 100 Days series looked closely at the growing international impact of the pandemic and our insightful video explainers and Q&amp;As clearly guided our readers to the facts during an increasingly complicated time. We pivoted our Science Weekly podcast to focus on listeners’ questions about the virus – doubling the podcast’s audience in just a few months. And, as the situation worsened, our Lost to the Virus series and Lost on the Frontline, a Guardian US and Kaiser Health News initiative, highlighted the immense human cost with care and sensitivity. Lost on the Frontline has become the exclusive US data source for Amnesty International’s initiative to track deaths of global healthcare workers from Covid-19. The series also influenced the Frontline Heroes Act, a proposed legislation in the US Congress to provide support for the families of fallen healthcare workers and was referenced by Senator Ron Wyden during a hearing about the national PPE shortage. We have never lost sight of the importance in holding the powerful to account for their role in managing the crisis. Within the Guardian’s investigations team we established a coronavirus investigations wing, publishing a string of exclusives. We uncovered who attends the secret scientific Sage advisory group – and revealed Boris Johnson’s then chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, attended meetings. We revealed the private firm running the UK PPE stockpile, Movianto, was sold in the middle of the pandemic and in a joint exclusive with ITV revealed chaotic conditions at Movianto’s warehouse, which resulted in delays in deploying vital supplies to UK healthcare workers. Our in-depth piece looking at missed opportunities pre-lockdown, the inside story of herd immunity and behind-the-scenes tussles between scientists and politicians was a comprehensive picture of the UK’s missteps. More recently, our journalists unpicked the allegations of “chumocracy” at the heart of the pandemic response, with a series of revelatory stories. In opinion, we discussed the government’s secret Covid contracts. Most notable was our sensational exclusive (with the Daily Mirror) on Cummings’ lockdown trip, which provoked national outrage and created the biggest crisis in trust for the UK government in recent years. The scoop forced Cummings to explain his actions in a Downing Street garden press conference and led the prime minister to make the extraordinary claim that his senior adviser had done nothing wrong and that people needed to ‘move on’ despite millions of people having abided by the rules. As both Johnson and Donald Trump succumbed to the virus, we closely covered the news of the president’s Covid diagnosis, hospitalisation, bizarre joyride, and his contagious inner circle. And we looked at how Johnson’s diagnosis, denials and admissions took the nation on an emotional rollercoaster. We challenged Trump’s claims that hydroxychloroquine was a “miracle cure” drug and revealed how the leader of a group peddling bleach as a coronavirus cure wrote to the president the week before he promoted disinfectant as a possible treatment. We improved and continue to update our coronavirus trackers and UK regional breakdowns, providing a valuable service to our readers over many months. And, following a reader callout, our science team answered questions about the pandemic covering everything from vaping to vaccines. We focused on its effect on young people with a new project – the Covid Generation – telling their stories, from missed education to the toll on mental health, through powerful words, portraits and their own lockdown drawings. We also provided hope by sharing practical and positive stories in series such as Guardian Australia’s The Good Place, the young entrepreneurs defying lockdown, and Anywhere but Westminster’s lockdown specials. Our correspondents around the globe contributed to our coronavirus coverage and our understanding of how different countries tackled the pandemic, from Iran – a country in the grip of one of the worst outbreaks – to how Venezuela used the crisis as a cover to crack down on dissent. From the plight of tourists trapped in a Tenerife hotel, to the eerily empty streets of Milan and the desperation of Covid sufferers in Beijing. We looked at the scandal of the Ruby Princess in Australia and the British holidaymakers stuck on cruise ships unable to dock. We followed the quarantine of Melbourne and the easing of restrictions, including a fantastic First Dog cartoon and a look at how Melbourne residents embraced their first day of freedom. Our coverage of the pandemic was also recognised as some of the most trusted among the major news brands. Oxford University’s Reuters Institute for Journalism cited the Guardian as doing the best job of all the papers among UK media outlets, and ranked us as the second most visited UK news site for coronavirus updates, second only to the BBC. A separate Survation study also named the Guardian as the most trusted UK paper on the topic. Diverse voices and Black Lives Matter Outside of the pandemic, the other major global story of 2020 has been the Black Lives Matter movement. Our coverage since the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on 25 May has been urgent, thought-provoking and clear in what has been a deeply personal and emotionally charged moment for so many. With journalists located around the world, we have been able to provide a unique and intimate perspective on the worldwide protest movement for justice. In the US, we reported, often under difficult conditions, on the protests for justice, incidents of police brutality and counter-demonstrations by racist militias. We investigated how communities of colour are enduring three crises at once: endemic police violence, Covid-19, and an economic crisis threatening jobs and livelihoods. Our coverage explored the history of brutal police violence and systemic racism in the US, and the institutional reforms needed to make a meaningful difference. Our journalists reported on these events, and the broader social and political questions they beg, with clarity, authority and purpose. We raised the voices of protesters, armed our readers with the facts, and provided wide-ranging perspectives on the government response. We profiled the black-led groups leading the calls for justice, the families directly affected by police brutality and asked what it really means to ”defund the police”. We exposed how structural poverty and enduring racism in the deep South has a direct impact on the deaths of black Americans from Covid-19, and our exclusive piece on the impacts of global heating further revealed how black and brown neighbourhoods would be unequally affected. Our interview with Bubba Wallace, Nascar’s only black driver, revealed rapidly changing attitudes to race in the sport. In Australia, we continue to focus on Indigenous Australians and the injustices they experience. We broke stories on outrages involving the mining company Rio Tinto, reporting on the firm’s decision to blow up a sacred Aboriginal site and the flawed legislation that allowed it. Our reporting ultimately led to the resignation of Rio Tinto’s CEO and senior executives as well as a parliamentary inquiry recommending a moratorium on any destruction of potential heritage sites until laws are passed in the new year. Our multiple award-winning Deaths Inside series, which has examined every Indigenous death in custody since 2008, continued to uncover stories of injustice this year. Images of protesters, who marched in cities and towns around Australia in support of Black Lives Matter, cited our Deaths Inside project and our investigations into the death of David Dungay Jnr to highlight systemic racism in Australia. In light of the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol, we reported from communities across the UK. Our Young, British and Black series highlighted 50 voices of this generation and we launched a powerful Black Lives series that looked at the extraordinary stories of the people at the forefront of social change and civil rights. And, to celebrate Black History Month, we produced an interactive timeline documenting two millennia of world-shaping individuals and momentous events that define black history and gave away glossy wallcharts with the newspaper. Our opinion writers also covered the shocking global implications and big new ideas emerging from the crisis in The World Turned Upside Down series, and highlighted the renewed urgency of anti-racist movements in America and the UK in columns by Patricia Williams on George Floyd’s killing, and Afua Hirsch on racism built in Britain. UK Although coronavirus has dominated the news in the UK, we’ve continued to report rigorously on other stories that are affecting people’s lives. On 31 January, we marked Brexit eve, capturing the mood of the nation, from Westminster to West Yorkshire. We wrote about the pain thousands of our readers felt and published our “Missing You Already” supplement, which included a moving series of letters to the UK from key cultural figures, generating an appreciative response from our readers. Away from Brexit, our reporting has captured the complexities of the coronavirus pandemic, a multitude of government U-turns, tumultuous party politics and reflected a determination to capture the hidden effects of an unprecedented year. With input from thousands of pupils, teachers and parents via our communities team, we led the way in our reporting on the GCSE and A-levels fiasco – from our exclusive forecast that 40% of A-level results would be downgraded to revealing that the chair of Ofqual threatened to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, publicly backed him. In business, we went back undercover at Sports Direct and discovered that question marks remain over the chain’s treatment of staff. We also covered the dramatic events as two of Britain’s biggest retailers collapsed – the demise of Philip Green’s empire and, the following day, of Debenhams. Off the back of Guardian reporting that consistently called for organisations such as Tesco to review their stance on rate rebates, big supermarket chains changed their positions and repaid hundreds of millions to the treasury. Our coverage of the EHRC’s damning report into antisemitism in the Labour party was detailed and revelatory, including our scoop revealing the key insights the day before the report was released. And – in the same week – we published a letter signed by more than 800 legal figures, accusing the government of dangerous rhetoric and calling for an immediate apology. As footballer Marcus Rashford’s campaign to end child food poverty captured the public’s imagination, we spoke to the families dependent on free school meals. And it was inspiring for us to read that Rashford was driven to campaign for free school meals after reading an article in the Guardian. And, with the ongoing inquiry into the Grenfell fire – which restarted in September 2020, 28 months since it began – we continued to highlight this hugely important story, covering the fallouts from the inquiry and speaking with the survivors still seeking justice. Our investigative reporting has continued to expose and uncover injustices across the UK. In March, a critical court judgment into Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum found he had orchestrated the abduction of his two daughters. This was the culmination of a 20-year inquiry that began with a Guardian exclusive. We doggedly followed the long and bitter court battle, which revealed UK police had been deterred from investigating the kidnap. We secured leaked Foreign Office documents, which uncovered that it was No 10 – not the Home Office – driving controversial plans to process asylum seekers in other countries. We have also maintained our focus on previous Guardian exclusives. Since the Guardian exposed the scandal of the wrongful deportation of Commonwealth citizens from the Caribbean in 2018, the Windrush debate continued with our reporting on the number of people entitled to compensation who may still be unknown. The EHRC Windrush report was a damning indictment of the hostile environment policy and the seventh critical report arising from our reporting. We reported on a public inquiry into undercover policing, which launched in November – six years after it was first announced. The inquiry was a result of a Guardian investigation revealing how police covertly monitored the campaign for justice over the racist murder of Stephen Lawrence. It followed years of disclosures uncovered by the Guardian and by the activists who had been the victims of spying. US In the US, the Guardian has continued to deliver deep and impactful journalism during a year in which the country’s social, economic and political fabric was dramatically challenged. We repeatedly broke news on the Trump administration’s constant departure from norms, starting with the anger and divisiveness of his state of the union address, shortly followed by Nancy Pelosi’s electrifying response. A key strand of our election coverage was our year-long Fight to Vote series – which launched in 2019. It assessed the many ways Americans are denied the fundamental right to vote, and included an ambitious ballot-tracking exercise. Our piece on Trump’s admission that he was undermining the US Postal Service to make it harder to vote by mail was cited in a lawsuit against the USPS. The project continues to deliver essential reporting on Trump’s attempts to defy the election outcome. In February, we detailed how the president survived impeachment and reflected on a decade in which America swung from the hope of the Obama era to the nihilism and misogyny of Trump. We chronicled the Democratic primaries and reported on Kamala Harris’s memorable challenge to Joe Biden’s race record. Our numbers: +100 million page views to the Guardian’s US election live results tracker ** We followed the twists and turns as the Republican party rushed to fill the supreme court seat left open after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsberg. An exclusive Guardian investigation revealed that Amy Coney Barrett – Trump’s now-confirmed supreme court justice – was involved with a secretive Christian group, a story cited by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, in his attack on the media. Our reporting on Coney Barrett’s anti-abortion stance was referenced by Senator Richard Blumenthal, who credited the Guardian for making key information public while questioning Barrett during the hearings. Our election explainers – including the inventive Build Your Own Election and how the electoral college helps the Republicans, enabled readers to visualise paths to victory for both candidates. Our live election results tracker was a monumental success and, along with our round the clock live blog, was a cornerstone of our coverage. Almost a year in planning, the tracker broke all traffic records, becoming the Guardian’s most viewed page ever, culminating in more than 100m page views in election week. It formed part of a record-breaking week for the Guardian overall, with more than 190m page views and 52.9m unique browsers worldwide within 24 hours. Our Today in Focus special US election episode took listeners through the momentous night moving from New York to Florida, Arizona to Pennsylvania and trying to make sense of what happened. After the election result was eventually called, we profiled the president-elect, looking at how Biden styled himself as the antithesis of Trumpism and at the election of Kamala Harris, the first woman of colour to be voted vice-president. Outside of politics, our journalists followed the sexual assault and rape trial of the disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein. As a guilty verdict was handed down, we broke the news before other major news organisations, and documented his rise and fall, the key moments of the trial, the six women at the heart of the trial and how it divided the #MeToo movement. In December, we also joined a global consortium to continue the work of murdered Mexican journalists. In collaboration with 24 international media outlets across 18 countries, and coordinated by Forbidden Stories, the Cartel Project investigates the global networks of Mexican drug cartels and their political connections around the world. Our reporting has also focused on society, culture and lifestyle. Our State of Men series took a hard look at what it means to be male in 2020. In a similar vein, we launched Childfree, a series in which women spoke openly about their decisions to not have children. And our pandemic epiphanies series centred on positive stories on what writers and readers discovered about themselves during the pandemic. Our series Trans Freedom Fighters shone a light on the trans and non-binary leaders on the frontlines of 2020 organising and activism in the US. Australia Our brilliant reporting of the massive Australian bushfires continued into 2020, as the devastating fires continued to burn across vast areas of the country. In the most devastating bushfire season ever, our small team closely followed events as conditions worsened, from Mallacoota beach to Bairnsdale, where conditions on the ground proved most devastating. Our analysis of the fires and the failure of the prime minister to act, or even acknowledge the connection to the climate crisis, shocked the world. Our innovative visual explainer showed how the 2020 fires are very different from those in previous years with an exclusive story revealing how the Australian government approved a Chinese company to run a water mining operation in drought-stricken Queensland. Our political reporting in Australia has exposed significant flaws, consistently holding the government to account. Our dogged coverage of the robodebt scandal culminated in November 2020 with a $1.2b payout to 400,000 victims. We revealed how the coalition government believed it had no duty of care for welfare recipients, and also exposed the questionable $400k grant given to an aged care home operator when others missed out. The New South Wales corruption tribunal was gripping, and exposed how the state premier, Gladys Berejiklian, had been in a secret relationship with a disgraced former MP, with excellent commentary on the fallout and unanswered questions. We continued our scrutiny of the government’s role in the climate emergency. In our Green Recovery series in May, we highlighted how there were many ways stimulus spending might have also hastened the transition to a low-carbon economy, but the government didn’t take up those options and the year ends with Australia’s climate policy debate still stuck in an endless loop of political rhetoric, but under increasingly critical scrutiny from the rest of the world. Facebook has apologised for defamatory posts about an Australian politician – it was not even prepared to delete the posts until Guardian Australia reported on the case in August. We also explored how Australia is starting to recognise coalmining might not be viable long term, including an exclusive on the private investigator working for the controversial Adani mine who secretly spied on and photographed an activist’s family. We also exclusively revealed a photograph of an Australian soldier drinking beer from a prosthetic leg thought to belong to a Taliban fighter killed by special forces in Afghanistan. And finally, The Wait series gave a voice to people and places that may otherwise go unheard, telling the story of the forgotten refugees stranded in Indonesia as a result of Australia’s border crackdowns. Guardian Australia has led the reporting on many of these local stories and will continue to pursue them, because facts and accountability matter, for good public policy and to shore up citizens’ trust in the political system. International At the start of the year, our groundbreaking scoop revealed that Jeff Bezos had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince. This was a truly astonishing exposé that Politico called ”the Guardian’s mega-scoop – a genuine marmalade-dropper”. The story had an immediate and far-reaching impact, and was followed up all over the world. The New Zealand election was another huge moment; from the details of Jacinda Ardern’s win and possible coalition to our reporting on the broader political picture on why the country does not respond to populism in ways other countries do. We ran a series of deeply moving pieces to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, including a beautiful dispatch from the memorial ceremony. We also spoke with survivors who returned to the camp for the anniversary in a series of heart-wrenching interviews, including on Today in Focus. Our This is Europe series featured many memorable stories — from our exclusive on the EU’s support for vulnerable EU nationals to remain in the UK, and research on rising support for Eurosceptic parties, to a collection of European critics’ responses to UK culture. We launched Europeans – a series of seven new films from across Europe and revealed how Europe’s demographic map is being reshaped from Germany to Spain. We focused on the profound changes taking place in Hong Kong in our Fight for Hong Kong series. Our Today in Focus podcast featured the pro-democracy activist Nathan Law, and a fantastic video followed a Hong Kong journalist working for a pro-democracy newspaper in the shadow of China’s controversial national security law. Our exclusive report on how Jordan became the country with the highest smoking rates in the world focused on claims of big tobacco interference and undue political influence – resulting in swift government interventions by banning indoor smoking across the country. August’s explosion in Beirut was one of the world’s largest non-nuclear blasts. We covered the explosion with on-the-ground coverage, witness accounts and explainers. We later told the stories of the people caught up in the blast in an extraordinary interactive using footage survivors captured on their smartphones. As protests continued in Belarus over the re-election of Alexander Lukashenko, a Guardian documentary followed three independent Belarusian film-makers as they turned their cameras on themselves and their communities. The photo of a protester holding up a sign inspired by a striking Guardian Weekly cover serves as a reminder that our journalism provides hope to many in the face of injustices. And, as the Nigerian government was accused of clamping down on one of the most striking protest movements for decades, we looked at the protests against police violence and the anti-robbery squad (Sars) that have swept the country. Sport In what was a particularly disrupted year for sport, our journalism has remained as important and impactful as ever. In November, our coverage of Diego Maradona’s death was quick, thoughtful, visually strong and properly international. The package of pieces curated by Sachin Nakrani included a fine appreciation by Jonathan Wilson and a superb piece by Marcela Mora y Araujo on Maradona’s meaning to Argentina. Our exclusive investigation, which began in April, into allegations of sexual abuse of girls and young women by the president of the Haiti FA, Yves Jean-Bart, led in November to him being banned for life by Fifa, showcasing the impact of Guardian journalism. Earlier in the year, we reported on the funding struggles of sports clubs and associations, revealing how UK Athletics fought to renew its TV deal with the BBC, and exposing plans to slash funding by 50% for second-tier English rugby union clubs. We were at the forefront of reporting on Manchester City’s two-year ban from the Champions League, followed with exclusives on the club’s funding and a possible further investigation. And we broke two major athletics stories – on claims of neglect in British athletics and the tussle over Nike’s Vaporfly running shoes. During the lockdown, our Football Weekly podcast grew its audience, despite no football taking place, and produced thoughtful specials on the “gamblification” of the sport, and on racism in football and mental health. The impact of Black Lives Matter reverberated throughout the sporting world too. We ran pieces on the lack of BAME representation in sport leadership, while our Sportblog provided some powerful opinion pieces, including Michael Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent’s broadcast on cricket and Black Lives Matter. Over the summer, our series on the greatest tennis players of the last 50 years delivered an excellent response, with thousands of replies to our callout. In September, the US Open was notable for Novak Djokovic’s disqualification and the rise of Naomi Osaka. Coverage of the collapse of the Newcastle United takeover was revelatory and nuanced, as was our report on the shocking allegations of abuse in British gymnastics. Our feature on how Jürgen Klopp transformed Liverpool provided great insights, as did our exclusive interview with Liverpool’s title-winning captain, Jordan Henderson. In October, our exclusive investigation revealed how much the FA chairman, Greg Clarke, and the Premier League knew, but did not admit, about secret Operation Big Picture talks. We also explored how the plans did not go far enough for women’s football. One of our Sportblog pieces was hailed by Gary Lineker as “the most sensible and balanced comment piece I’ve read on this by far”. In November, Clarke resigned after a disastrous select committee appearance, while our guide to the US golf Masters provided much-needed cheer. We were also the first to report on a revelatory film about Liverpool and Klopp and featured a vivid interview with the boxer Bilal Fawaz. Environment During the past year we’ve continued to report on every aspect of the environment – publishing a piece of environmental journalism roughly every three hours. In October, we renewed our commitment to readers, pledging to keep reporting on the climate emergency, raising the alarm and investigating the crisis and possible solutions. As part of this commitment we launched our environmental dashboard, which tracks a selection of the planet’s vital signs, from carbon dioxide levels to Arctic sea ice, providing a visual representation of the growing climate crisis. Our Last Chance series looked at what the world is doing to fight global heating and manage a green recovery and our exclusive analysis revealed that Covid recovery plans are threatening climate hopes. US congressmen Peter A Defazio and Matt Gaetz cited the importance of the Guardian piece “The secretive government agency planting ‘cyanide bombs’ across the US” – part of our This Land is Your Land series – in a letter they sent to Congress. As evidence of increased global heating accumulates, we investigated its devastating impact of this around the world. As bushfires burned across vast areas of Australia, our team worked tirelessly to produce outstanding coverage that has had a real impact both in Australia and abroad. As major weather events become more commonplace – from severe wildfires in California to Hurricane Laura – we launched 100 Days to Save the Earth, which took an in-depth look at the ways in which Trump’s presidency has made America dirtier and the planet warmer following his withdrawal from the US from the Paris agreement. As part of a year-long series on America’s water crisis, with partner Consumer Reports, our landmark investigation revealed how millions of ordinary Americans are facing unaffordable bills for running water. A piece by our US editor asked whether it was too much to ask for Americans to have access to clean water in 2020. Our numbers: +20% growth in increase in average monthly unique browsers to environmental reporting ** Following the Guardian’s Polluters series, which revealed the firms behind a third of all carbon emissions, in January 2020 we announced that the Guardian would not accept advertising from fossil fuel extractive companies. This announcement sent a signal to encourage other companies to follow our lead, increasing the pressure on oil companies, miners and other extractive industries to change course. Our exclusive on the vast profits made by big oil since 1990 served as a timely reminder of their role in the escalating climate emergency. And, in the lead-up to Davos, Greta Thunberg and other climate strikers wrote for us urging world leaders to abandon the fossil fuel economy. Features, lifestyle, culture and the arts Despite it being a tricky year for in-person interviews, we’ve still featured some fantastic names – Tom Hanks on surviving coronavirus, Black Lives Matter founder Alicia Garza on stepping away from the movement she helped create, the warm and irrepressible Miriam Margolyes and Samuel L Jackson on roots, race and revolution, Helena Bonham Carter on divorce, Pierce Brosnan on life after Bond and a hilarious Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. We also had a brilliant – and incredibly rare – interview with Joni Mitchell, and shared our encounters with Mary Trump and Jane Fonda. Our upbeat Black Lives series has been an inspiring insight into people at the forefront of social change and civil rights. Our interview with Andre Leon Talley, former creative director of US Vogue, dug deep into the ruthlessness at the heart of the fashion industry. As part of Weekend’s graduate special – class of 2020 – Victoria Beckham answered questions from fashion students on personal style, the Spice Girls and fashion after corona. We continued to give a voice and a platform to women alleging sexual assault. In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein verdict, Rose McGowan spoke to us about how her fight for justice cost her motherhood and a career, but sparked a movement and brought a prolific offender to justice. Weekend featured an exclusive interview with Amy Dorris – a former model who alleges Trump forced his tongue down her throat and groped her at 1997 US Open. Model Linda Evangelista spoke exclusively to the Guardian in support of four women who for the first time shared their stories of sexual assault or rape by her ex-husband, former Elite Models boss Gérald Marie. The story followed our compelling investigation into Trump’s involvement with the Elite Look of the Year contest. In our world exclusive with Elena Ferrante, the author answered questions from translators and booksellers, covering everything from coronavirus to therapy and we featured an exclusive extract from the late Clive James’ final book on the meaning of poetry in his life. As the long-awaited book in her Thomas Cromwell trilogy was published, we spoke exclusively to Hilary Mantel and published the very first extract of The Mirror &amp; the Light. Four years after leaving office, we spoke with Barack Obama about Trump, Biden and what the future holds for America, and also featured an extract of his new book. We published a moving long read on the fate of people deported from the UK to countries where they have no family or support as well as a beautiful piece on the closure of a high street butcher’s shop after four generations in one family. We looked into the battle to overthrow the Tampax empire, reviewed the evidence – or lack of it – in the unsolved mystery of the Gatwick drone and examined how the previously little-known Zoom is now being used by everyone from princes to piano teachers. We looked into the race to produce human breast milk in a lab, asking how liberating this might be for new mothers, and featured a moving account of the reality of a second lockdown with terminal cancer. Our piece about the quilters of Alabama was a fascinating look at how their masterpieces can be viewed as tokens of solace and defiance in tragic times. And from CocoRosie’s call to arms to Melania’s roses, our arts and culture team looked at the arts and pop culture that summed up the Trump era. In an apparently record year for oversized veg, we asked what motivates people to grow an 8-metre beetroot – and if there is any skullduggery involved. Our Indigenious fashion shoot featured creations from 28 First Nations designers and artists and looked at how Australian fashion is taking notice of the country’s oldest design traditions. Feast continued to provide inspiration for those of us tired of the same sandwiches on repeat for lunch with a series of brilliant alternatives – including Ottolenghi’s delicious spin on the working from home classic, beans on toast. After the UK’s first lockdown eased, we asked whether we were brave enough to eat out again and, as lockdown 2.0 came into force, looked at the boom in at-home meal kits. In a time where life can feel a lifetime away from “normal”, our series of 21 positive ideas to remake the world brought much-needed respite and hope. In our staycation special, comedians shared their worst trips and, after Blind date went temporarily virtual, we were thrilled to see it back in the wild. Journalism supported by philanthropy Philanthropic funding supports impactful, mission-driven reporting projects at the Guardian. Our projects are often timely, but none more so this year than the Fight to Vote series, which was supported by foundations including Craig Newmark Philanthropies and the Park Foundation. This series launched a year before the US presidential election and was a critical anchor of our election coverage. With philanthropic support for a dedicated editorial team, reporting from the series established the role of Republican suppression tactics and the campaign to undermine election integrity long before the election. The Guardian was first to cover the shift to mail-in voting, the role of USPS, and Trump’s false claims of widespread voter fraud, and broke many stories, including one on dark money behind voting restrictions and the Trump campaign’s first failed attempts to prove voter fraud. Similarly, the Age of Extinction series supported by the BAND Foundation and the Wyss Foundation – which reports on the global biodiversity catastrophe – has ensured that our interconnectedness with nature and its critical role in our own existence has remained a front-and-centre consideration among policymakers across the world dealing with the Covid outbreak, including the UN and the UK government. Support from an array of funders including Humanity United, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Packard Foundation, Open Philanthropy Project and the 11th Hour Fund continues to make possible in-depth and vital storytelling on a range of environmental issues, such as the global impact of intensive farming practices, the dramatic changes taking place in our oceans, and the ongoing damages to our public lands. Award-winning reporting on global inequality, poverty, and human rights will continue in the years ahead, with expanded support for the series on labour exploitation and modern slavery and the continuation of the global development site. We have seen immense impact across our projects, all of which are contributing to delivering change at a policy level as well as creating a lasting impact for the individuals affected by the issues. Observer journalism An incredible special report in the Observer on the Femicide Census, about the number of women killed by men every year was a truly shocking story, opening up the discussion on violence towards women. It came not long after readers expressed concern about the Guardian publishing an obituary of the convicted rapist and murderer Peter Sutcliffe – a sensitive topic covered by our readers’ editor in a thoughtful column, in addition to reporting of his victims and their stories. In the run up to the US election, the Observer continued to dissect the role of Facebook and the potential issues the platform could cause for Biden, including two powerful interviews with the whistleblower Yaël Eisenstat and early investor Roger McNamee. A deep dive into Facebook also looked at the pivotal role the platform would play in the US elections. In July, the Observer revealed how pressure from Donald Trump led to the British government banning the Chinese technology giant Huawei from its 5G telecoms network. And, the Observer also led on the story that the same controversial algorithm that sparked the UK’s A-level results fiasco was to set 97% of GCSE results. A year on from the death of Jack Merritt in the London Bridge attack, his family, friends and ex-offenders spoke to Observer New Review about Jack’s work transforming prisoners’ lives. After seven weeks in intensive care, the author Michael Rosen spoke exclusively to the Observer about his experience of having coronavirus, and Glenda Jackson discussed how she considers herself an anti-social socialist in a revealing interview in the Observer Magazine. The Black Lives Matter movement was a prominent inspiration for Observer journalism. We invited leading black British poets including Linton Kwesi Johnson, Grace Nichols and Raymond Antrobus to share thoughts on protest, change and the trailblazers who inspired them in the New Review. In a frank interview with the Observer magazine, Naomi Campbell lambasted the fashion industry for only becoming vocal about racism since the rise of Black Lives Matter. The star of the film Clemency, Alfre Woodard spoke to Observer New Review about the US prison system, her enslaved great-grandfather and her hopes for Black Lives Matter. The Guardian in America | An update from the US In a noisy media landscape, Guardian US stands out by providing a global perspective on American events and issues. Our reporters are rooted in communities across the country – with bureaux on the East Coast, including New York and Washington DC, the West Coast and in the South – and our vision is to continue to expand our coverage across the US. 2020 has been a momentous year. From the Trump administration’s mishandling of the pandemic, to the atrocious killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others that led to the powerful resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement, and a dramatic US election – our journalism has been authoritative and courageous. In this year of extraordinary upheaval, we’ve shared wide-ranging perspectives, elevated underrepresented voices, challenged controversial decisions on the climate crisis, and held the powerful to account. Reporting a presidential election in the midst of a pandemic presented new and interesting challenges for our news desk. A virtual newsroom replaced a crowded office. Major decisions were made via instant messaging instead of across desk dividers. Reporters were equipped with PPE to ensure they could do their jobs safely. What did not change was our commitment to be in as many places as possible, and speak to as many people as we could. From our supporters: Thank you so much for both covering terrible news incidents, and reporting about them in a way that speaks for peace and justice. I’m not black. I am Cuban-American and I trust the Guardian to report the news with a good heart, being honest and balanced. That is why you are my #1 go-to source, that I believe in for the truth about what is happening. Maria Velma Davis, a reader in Bloomington, Indiana, US On election day, we mobilised one of our largest editorial operations ever, with reporters on the ground in more than a dozen states, including Michigan, Florida, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Arizona, as well as Iowa, Georgia, Texas, Ohio, California, North Carolina, New York and of course Washington DC. We reported day and night, with a 24-hour editing and reporting rota ensuring continuous coverage around the clock. Our non-stop journalism drove record breaking traffic: on Wednesday 4 November, the day after the election, the Guardian recorded its highest-ever digital traffic, reaching more than 190m page views and 53m unique browsers worldwide in 24 hours, exceeding all previous traffic records by a huge margin. The Guardian’s live results tracker alone received more than 100m page views in election week and we also reached a larger number of Guardian readers in the US than ever before – 165m page views from 70m unique browsers in the month of November. Just as the Black Lives Matter movement in the US, and the global reckoning it spurred, defined much of our coverage this year, it also inspired us to look inward and assess how we could improve our own diversity, equity and inclusion, to ensure we better reflect the communities we serve and allow for a more diverse range of perspectives. In addition to the Guardian’s global commitments to anti-racism, in the US we made explicit commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion that involved changing our newsroom practices and systems to make them more equitable, and building a more equal culture. The degrading treatment of journalists by law enforcement, encouraged by political cheerleaders, is another deeply troubling aspect of these events. And our journalists have been reporting up close, at personal risk, to make sure millions of readers around the world can see for themselves what’s taking place. Throughout the year, Donald Trump continued to peddle disinformation, not just about the integrity of the news media, as he had done for the previous four years, but this time about coronavirus. Most notable was the misinformation he spread around the level of danger it posed and potential cures. As his daily coronavirus briefings became a platform for lies, campaigning and denials, Guardian political reporters were there, interrogating his claims and arming readers the facts, prioritising public safety in a way the administration was not. From our supporters: I would like to congratulate the Guardian on the depth and breadth of the coverage over last week in relation to the election … thanks for the excellent journalism you continue to provide which is why I have no hesitation in continuing to subscribe to the paper. Louis Boyle, a reader in County Down, Northern Ireland ** We continue to reject climate denial rhetoric, doubling down on our commitments to the environment both in our reporting and as an organisation. In America, we joined forces with hundreds of newsrooms to promote climate solutions as part of Covering Climate Now. We also invited first-time voters to take over the Guardian homepage as part of climate week. Beyond our partnership with CCN, we collaborated with other like-minded partners to go deeper and further on stories that matter to Americans. We teamed up with Kaiser Health News to launch Lost on the Frontline – an interactive documenting every healthcare worker lost to Covid – and we launched America’s Water Crisis with Consumer Reports to investigate the challenges many in the US face getting access to safe, clean, affordable water. Our base of recurring supporters also hit a milestone this year, surpassing 150,000 in August. This extraordinary growth is something we value deeply and which allows us to continue the essential reporting we do. This support was matched by an outpouring of generosity during our end-of-year campaign last year. Each year, we set an ambitious target to raise money for our journalism. In our 2019-20 end-of-year appeal, we raised $1.5m from more than 30,000 readers in every state across America. This year, our new partnership with Apple News also introduced millions more Americans to Guardian journalism. The US business has continued to grow steadily, contributing positively to the Guardian as a whole. Guardian US will continue to cover the stories that matter in America, with ever more readers and supporters who believe in our unique perspective, our business model and our editorial purpose. This year, more than ever, we thank all of our supporters, our readers, our philanthropic partners and patrons for their ongoing investment in high-quality, independent journalism. The Guardian in Australia | An update from Australia Readers turned to Guardian Australia in unprecedented numbers in 2020, looking for rigorous coverage and a trusted, independent voice amid some of the most significant news events in a generation. The surge in traffic is testament to the high level of trust in the Guardian, and the increasingly important role it plays in the Australian media landscape. The year began with the continuation of live, round-the-clock coverage of the catastrophic bushfires on Australia’s east coast, which, by February, had destroyed 85,000 sq km of forest. Appreciation for Guardian Australia’s coverage was reflected in strong audience growth and record financial support. Shortly after, the outbreak of Covid-19 propelled audience growth to record levels. The number of unique browsers increased by 104% in March alone to 11.6 million, making Guardian Australia the country’s fourth most popular news site. By August, several months into the pandemic, audience numbers remained high at 7.4 million, a year-on-year increase of 72%, cementing Guardian Australia’s position as the country’s leading progressive news brand. From our supporters: To me, Guardian Australia is one of the last bastions of independent journalism in this country. It is essential to any democracy that we have a free and independent press. They hold those in power to account, interrogate issues and inform the masses. The Guardian does those things for me. Charmaine, a reader in Victoria, Australia Throughout the turbulent and challenging events of 2020, Guardian Australia’s stretched newsroom still managed to produce a series of distinctive, in-depth journalistic projects. The Frontline series took readers inside Australia’s lived experience of climate change, from new bushfire zones to disappearing underwater forests, while The Green Recovery series explored the environmental opportunities in Australia’s post-pandemic recovery. The Full Story podcast is continuing to grow strongly and was recognised at the 2020 Australian Podcast Awards, winning silver in the best current affairs podcast category, and bronze in the best documentary podcast category. In partnership with the University of NSW, Guardian Australia introduced Temporary, a narrative podcast series that tells the stories of refugees stuck in legal limbo in Australia. The eight-part series focuses on the asylum-seekers languishing in Australia’s so-called “legacy caseload” of about 30,000 asylum-seekers arrived in Australia by boat between 2012 and 2014. Guardian Australia has pursued ambitious, high-impact, award-winning journalism on topics including the climate crisis, bushfires, logging and land clearing, Indigenous deaths in custody, the coronavirus pandemic, questionable use of taxpayers’ money by MPs, the ongoing threats to species, the robodebt scandal and, of course, the everyday political issues. For their coverage of Rio Tinto’s destruction of Juukan Gorge cave, a sacred Indigenous site in Western Australia, Lorena Allam and Calla Wahlquist won the Walkley award for coverage of Indigenous affairs. Guardian Australia’s latest series, Dreams interrupted, investigates how the pandemic is shaping a generation of young Australians who now find themselves in a recession that will have an outsized impact on the trajectory of their lives. The series, funded by the Barlow Foundation, will also explore how it is that so many Indigenous children are in jail, and how the disruptions of 2020 can give rise to an environmentally friendly recovery. In Australia, the challenges to journalism from many quarters are unrelenting – perpetual job losses, the reduction in the number of regional news outlets and cuts to the public broadcaster. In the face of these conditions, Guardian Australia made a concerted effort to grow its community to 150,000 supporters. The fundraiser was the first premised on supporting Guardian Australia itself, rather than distinct editorial projects, and was highly successful. The target was surpassed ahead of schedule, and several innovative features were launched, including an interactive map to display messages from supporters across the country. Our numbers: 150,000 community of supporters across Australia ** Amid the softening Covid-19 advertising market, Guardian Australia was bolstered by philanthropic support from VivCourt, the Judith Neilson Institute and the Limb Family Foundation. Meanwhile, a grant from the Balnaves Foundation helped fund a dedicated arts reporter for three years, and a grant confirmed from the Barlow Impact Group will fund three upcoming projects on youth inequality. In November, Guardian Australia’s Indigenous investigations series, launched in 2018 with funding from the Balnaves Foundation, was recognised with Philanthropy Australia’s 2020 Indigenous philanthropy award. In October 2020, we were proud to launch Australia Weekend, the Guardian’s first digital app-based product created specifically for Australian readers. The edition, which lives in the Guardian Editions app, is the first product created specifically for the Australian market, and provides a compelling new way to experience and support Guardian Australia journalism. The launch of Australia Weekend represents an important milestone as Guardian Australia looks to build on its growth in audience and financial supporters. At the Guardian | Our people, culture and organisational impact Our journalism seeks to have a wider, more positive contribution to society. Our values – of honesty, integrity, courage, fairness, and a sense of duty to the reader and the community – are likewise reflected in our people, culture and organisational impact. Our employees Coronavirus brought a year of extraordinary change to working practices for Guardian employees around the world. We responded quickly to the pandemic, shifting the majority of our workforce to remote working – with only very small groups of essential staff producing the website and newspaper from our offices in London. We have been forced to rethink our ways of working, adapt to the virtual world and overcome the challenges of keeping our teams connected with one another. Coronavirus has also accelerated many of the long-term trends affecting the news industry and, like many other titles, several areas of our business have faced financial pressures. In July 2020, we announced that we would need to restructure a number of areas, which sadly included job losses, meaning a number of valued colleagues left the organisation this year. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, many organisations, including the Guardian, have had to recognise that there is still much work for us to do. People from different backgrounds have different perspectives on what makes “news” and we recognise our employees need to reflect the audiences we serve. We have made some advances in diversifying the Guardian in recent years, but we need to accelerate our efforts so we are better equipped to produce more meaningful and more impactful journalism. Working collaboratively with our People of Colour groups based in the UK and US, we announced a company-wide commitment to anti-racism and plans to improve representation of black, Asian and minority ethnic people throughout the organisation. This work culminated in a comprehensive race action plan that looks closely at how we operate across all levels of the company; from hiring to remuneration, training to career progression. We commissioned Marcus Ryder, an expert on media diversity, to review our target of at least 20% black, Asian, minority ethnic (BAME) representation across the organisation, and to make recommendations for department-specific goals. Our efforts in this space have also involved reflecting on the Guardian’s history. In July, the Scott Trust commissioned research on the Guardian’s founding moments to identify any connections – direct or indirect – with the slave trade. The work will be carried out independently by the University of Nottingham’s Institute for the Study of Slavery, and will investigate any links between the Guardian’s founder, John Edward Taylor, his associates, their investments and/or business activities with historical transatlantic slavery. These commitments build on work we have already done. In December 2019, we released our first UK ethnicity pay gap report – one of only a small number of media organisations to do so. The ethnicity pay report is an extension of the yearly reporting we already do on our gender pay gap reporting and identifies key areas of focus. We have continued the important work of our employee-led diversity and inclusion forum to secure a consistent and strategic approach to drive real change across the business. This year, we signed up to the Business in the Community Race at Work charter, implementing the five calls to action. In January, we held our second diversity and inclusion week in the UK, attended by more than one-third of employees, and provided virtual events, training and learning opportunities – all aimed at cultivating a working environment that celebrates and supports difference in all its forms. Mental health and wellbeing has also been a key focus for us at the Guardian, particularly in response to the uncertainty and change brought on by the pandemic. In May, we held a week of events and workshops to mark Mental Health Awareness Week in the UK, and have since launched new workshops on mental health for line managers and employees across the organisation. We continue to provide free employee assistance programmes in the UK, US and Australia, and on-demand resources to promote strong mental health. Our environmental impact We show our commitment to tackle the climate crisis in three key ways – through sustained world-leading environmental journalism; through measuring our own carbon emissions and by working with our employees to make significant changes and lead by example. In January, we made global headlines announcing we would no longer accept advertising from fossil fuel extractive companies. Greta Thunberg, Naomi Klein, Greenpeace, Extinction Rebellion and Global Witness publicly supported our landmark decision and readers were delighted when we told them the news. In October 2020, we announced new climate commitments and launched further editorial and business initiatives, including a climate data dashboard. Our climate plan has been informed by a full audit of greenhouse gas emissions from Guardian Media Group’s direct and indirect emissions, with newspaper production and our print supply chain the biggest contributors to the Guardian’s carbon footprint. We renewed our environmental commitments in a letter to readers, with an ambitious business goal of eliminating at least two-thirds of our total emissions by 2030. In 2020, our employee sustainability forum supported the development of our Climate Pledge 2020 and our promise to prioritise the escalating climate crisis in our journalism and our business decisions. Our commitment to the environment has also been widely recognised. In 2020, the Guardian was awarded the first sustainability strategy of the year award at the Newspaper &amp; Magazine Awards, in October we were named winner in the business transformation category at the Reuters Responsible Business Awards, and in November we won the prestigious BBVA Foundation Biophilia Award for Environmental Communication for the Guardian’s environmental reporting, which the foundation said had had a “transformative impact” in the global community. Charity | The Guardian Foundation Through the Scott Trust, our independent charity the Guardian Foundation supports media under threat, promotes diversity in the media and empowers children and young people to engage with the news. The charity envisions a world in which all people can tell their stories, access the truth and hold power to account. In the last 12 months, the Guardian Foundation’s award-winning free news literacy project, in partnership with National Literacy Trust and PSHE Association, NewsWise, educated 2,563 children aged seven to 11 in 47 primary schools in disadvantaged areas across the UK. The results are inspiring – after taking part in the programme, twice as many pupils were able to tell whether a news story was real or fake (from 32.7% to 67.2%) and pupils were more than twice as likely to feel able to tell if a news source was trustworthy (33.3% to 82.8%). In response to school closures as a result of coronavirus, NewsWise created a family zone with activities, links, tips and advice to help families learn more about the news together, a series of teacher training webinars and the Happy News Project to help primary pupils transition back to school with a focus on wellbeing, with uplifting stories, teamwork, speaking and news writing. The programme was also recognised in Nesta’s 19 “Democracy Pioneers” awards, winning a £10,000 prize for their work to improve people’s understanding and experience of democracy in the UK. From December to early March, more than 1,617 people came through the doors of the Guardian Education Centre, which runs inspirational news media workshops designed for schools, universities, teachers and families. During the pandemic we transitioned our workshops to digital and have delivered virtual learning to almost 300 people so far this academic year, providing resources, activities and ideas to teach and engage young people with news and journalism. The Guardian Foundation announced the recipients of the 2020-21 Scott Trust bursary scheme and the winners of the Hugo Young and Young Hugo Award winners. The bursary recipients, Hibaq Farah, Weronika Strzyżyńska and Georgina Quach, are now studying for their journalism MAs at City, Goldsmiths and Sheffield universities respectively. Ian Johnston, a student from City University, won the 2020 Hugo Young award for his opinion piece ”A united Ireland might be convenient for some. But don’t we deserve something more exciting than convenience?”, which was published on theguardian.com. The winner of the Hugo Young Award was revealed by the Guardian editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, as part of an online video announcement hosted by Sonia Sodha, the chief leader writer at the Observer. This year, a Young Hugo award was introduced for 16- to 18-year-old students who attended a Guardian Education Centre workshop in the previous year. Amy Rushton from Burnham Grammar school was announced as the winner of the first Young Hugo award for her article titled ”Hypocrisy and big business: how difficult is it to go green in a modern world?”, which was featured on the Guardian Education Centre website. The foundation’s international media capacity-building programme continued to focus on Turkey and with Syrian journalists in exile across Europe, providing training, workshops, mini-grants and mentoring to 44 people. The foundation also once again supported the European press prize for excellence in journalism. The 2020 winners were unveiled via a virtual announcement in June. The GNM Archive, which exists within the Guardian Foundation to preserve and share the history of the Guardian and Observer, has begun three new projects this year to engage different audiences with the collections. These externally funded initiatives include work with secondary school students and members of the University of the Third Age. Participation levels in the foundation’s programmes were impacted by the coronavirus pandemic this year. Activities that would normally require a physical presence in our offices or overseas travel have been adapted to ensure participation is still possible and the charity can continue to make a meaningful impact."

          "headline": "How ministers made a shambles of English schools",
          "bodyText": "After the most tumultuous school year imaginable, Jo Rockall, headteacher of Herschel Grammar School in Slough, had dared to dream that the last day of term, scheduled as a half day, might allow her time to head home and walk the dog. Instead, she is firmly ensconced in her office, attempting to work out the logistics of a detail-light coronavirus testing programme that landed on her desk days before the Christmas holiday. For Rockall and other heads in Slough, who she has been consulting in the past week, it is the latest example of a recurring theme. “We do understand that all of this is unprecedented,” she says. “We are very empathetic with the situation. I don’t want to be negative. But I don’t think we feel that the government, or the Department for Education in particular, are properly engaging with heads. Communication is last minute, it’s ill thought-out and it hasn’t included our voice in the whole process.” Other academics, teachers’ leaders, MPs and experts who spoke to the Observer about the government’s handling of England’s schools during the pandemic acknowledged the unprecedented challenges of managing a nation’s education during the past nine months. Yet all pointed to needless, serious and often repeated mistakes since March that have led to accusations of serial mismanagement. In the past fortnight relations between teachers and the government have soured even further, with Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, threatening legal action against Covid-hit schools seeking to close early this Christmas – before announcing plans to stagger reopenings and introduce a mass testing that schools are scrambling to set up. Now there are concerns about a legacy of widening inequality and an exodus of experienced staff. Anger is far more widespread than frontline staff or unions. One Tory MP says: “I would regard myself as a loyalist. I think this has been the biggest shambles and disgrace from beginning to end.” After schools closed to all but vulnerable children, early issues soon cropped up. Teachers began receiving angry calls from parents unable to access the online voucher system for free school meals, run by Edenred. At the peak of the crisis, the company’s helpline was receiving almost 4,000 calls and nearly 9,000 emails from school staff and parents. By April, Department for Education officials were holding daily crisis calls with Edenred. It later emerged that the government had signed contracts worth up to £425m with the company, despite “limited evidence” of its capacity to deliver. With immediate concerns that more deprived and vulnerable children would be hardest hit by the loss of classroom time, ministers announced a plan to hand free laptops to those most in need a month into lockdown. However, the programme was hit with delays and teachers continued to complain that they were not receiving them in time and in big enough numbers. While 220,000 devices had been delivered by August, the children’s commissioner warned that just over a third of disadvantaged children had benefited. By then, 27 multi-academy trusts had received only one laptop each. This weekend, the government announced plans to make another 440,000 laptops available, saying this would bring the total to one million. The attempted reopening of schools before the summer break caused relations between the government and teachers to deteriorate further. Heads had been trying to devise ways to create social distancing since the early spring. Behind the scenes, heads, teaching unions and ministers had been discussing a workable plan for school return. However, Boris Johnson announced plans that included the return of all primary school pupils a month before the summer holidays. “A child in a primary school maths class could have told you that under the restrictions, there weren’t enough teachers or enough classrooms to accommodate that,” says Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. With heads warning of staff shortages and contradictions with the government’s own Covid guidelines, the plan was dropped. The battle over reopening schools was only a prelude to the fiasco that was to unfold over the summer. With GCSEs and A-levels cancelled, ministers planned to use an algorithm to calculate results. While ministers emphasised the need to keep grades in line with those of previous years, warnings were being made both publicly by the education select committee and privately to the government. The main concern was the potential for bias against disadvantaged students. Teachers were shown the results just a day before they were passed to students. The fallout was swift. Tory MPs were furious. Williamson said the appeals process would be improved, but told a Saturday paper: “This is it … No U-turn, no change.” Later that day, the exams regulator Ofqual published and deleted details of the appeals process. By the Monday, a screeching U-turn was announced. The top DfE civil servant and the Ofqual chief executive were casualties of the crisis. No minister resigned. By the time September arrived, schools had spent the summer making their classrooms Covid compliant as best they could. Further anger erupted when new government guidance on reopening was issued on a Friday evening the week before students were due to return. “There’s been a public narrative prompted by the government at times that somehow teachers are lazy and spent the period of lockdown sitting in their garden sipping prosecco,” says Whiteman. “The reality is very different.” Coronavirus testing is now the issue preoccupying teachers. This weekend, some heads have been writing to parents about draft plans, but warning them that the tests depend on permission slips being produced by the government and on the assumption that the right kit arrived. Some asked any parents with a medical background to help out. Department guidance eventually emerged at 9pm on Friday. Longer term, there are concerns that the Covid fallout for the most disadvantaged students will be severe unless more help is directed at them. A study by the Education Policy Institute found that broadly speaking, places with lower prior GCSE results had lost more school days relative to pre-pandemic levels – areas such as Knowsley, Oldham, Rochdale and Sandwell. Attendance rates were as low as 53% last week for secondary schools in Medway, according to FFT Education Datalab. Some warn that those left behind need far more help. “So far, the DfE hasn’t targeted enough resources at those disadvantaged pupils,” says Natalie Perera, chief executive of the Education Policy Institute . “It’s made available £1bn for catch-up support. While £650m of that is being allocated directly to schools, it’s allocated on a per pupil basis with no acknowledgement of deprivation.” Meanwhile, the membership of a promised expert panel to advise on fairness in exams has not yet been announced. The department says it took swift action on an expanded free school meals programme. It says it recognised the challenge of mass testing and is grateful to staff. It says it will make exams as fair as possible, adding that it has invested millions in mental health charities to support teachers. “Children’s education is a national priority and this government has acted consistently in the interest of young people since the start of the pandemic,” a spokesperson says. “We have announced an unprecedented package of measures to make exams fair next year; we have developed a £1bn catch-up programme for pupils; we are delivering half a million devices to children – with more to come; and we have prioritised, above all else, making sure young people can be in school, with their friends and teachers. We are enormously grateful for the resilience and commitment they have shown in supporting children during such a challenging time.” Simon Burgess, a professor of economics at Bristol University who has been monitoring the impact of the pandemic on pupils, says the government should not be judged against a “perfect performance” given the circumstances, but errors are clear. “Advice or instructions given to schools have often been contradictory,” he says. “We’ve just witnessed the last couple of days. They were prepared to go to court to force Greenwich schools to stay open. And yet, they’re now promoting online learning. The national tutoring programme has £350m to spend, but it’s nowhere near enough money. They need to recognise the chasm of lost skills.” Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, says education civil servants have been given “an impossible job” by politicians. “The reason why so much of what the DfE has done has been so poor, is because they’re trying to obey a political mandate which is just irresponsible, and is just inoperable,” she says. “They’ve got this mantra that schools must remain open. Unions didn’t want to keep schools closed. Unions wanted to open schools safely.” Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, says there is plenty of blame to go round – and calls for a reset on education policy. “The government has been firefighting making their own mistakes, but has also had to battle Ofsted and the unions, who both should have done more,” he says. “The catch-up fund potentially could be groundbreaking if it works, but there should be a national long-term plan for education, just as the NHS has a 10-year plan.” Unsurprisingly, teacher stress and anxiety has peaked, especially for heads. A week before school lockdown, those reporting very high work-related anxiety hit 38% among headteachers, before peaking again at 40% among the group during the June reopening, according to a Teacher Tapp survey. It has raised concerns about a teacher retention crisis once the pandemic is under control. Last month, 47% of those who took part in a poll by the NAHT said they were likely to leave their jobs prematurely. Rockall admits fatigue is kicking in. “The staff and the children are what keeps you going really, but I’m tired,” she says. “I know the other heads are tired. It’s quite a struggle when you get such big things like this land on your desk. At the end of all this are young people whose lives have been turned upside down by this pandemic, who look to us for certainty around their futures. It’s very difficult to be able to provide them with that.” The view from inside the classroom Dr Robin Bevan, headteacher, Southend, and president of the National Education Union “This year has been the hardest I’ve had in my 14 years as a headteacher. I’ve never cried publicly in an assembly before – but when I had to send our oldest pupils home in March, without all the usual end-of-year celebrations and rites of passage, knowing I’d probably never see them again, I shed a tear. You make an emotional investment in the pupils you teach and sending them away, closing the school, is not what you come into teaching to do. During lockdown, teachers at my school delivered 50,000 online lessons. That was extraordinary and I think my staff did some really inventive and creative work, transforming what we would do in class to activities pupils could do at home. But not all parents had realistic expectations during lockdown and it could be challenging. There were weeks I worked 70-plus hours. Now, I’m exhausted. I go to bed at 9.30pm every night, trying to recuperate. I felt under the most pressure during the summer, when I was working out the logistics for full reopening of the school for September. The government guidelines only came out in August and we needed to work out the changes we were going to make before that, to ensure the school would be Covid-secure. It was a relief to find my plan worked within their guidance. This term, we’ve all been more stressed and anxious than usual. We’ve lost some of the social cohesion you normally have in schools, due to social distancing. Recently, I’ve been spending most of my Sundays contact tracing. It takes about two hours to process each positive case. Classrooms are some of the most overcrowded work environments in this country and over the past week alone, 24 teaching staff and over 500 pupils were off school self-isolating. What gives me hope is seeing how much students cherish being in school now, following the lockdown. When they are told they have to go into self-isolation, my goodness, they really do not want to go. They want to be here. I’ve never known anything like it.” Ed Finch, primary school teacher, Oxford “I spent most of the first lockdown teaching vulnerable and key workers’ children, so I still went into school every day. Like a lot of teachers, I relished the opportunity to work with smaller groups – a maximum of 15 were allowed in each classroom – and since they were all of different ages, there was much less pressure to teach an academic curriculum. You’d hear teachers saying: this feels like why I went into teaching. I’ve noticed children have been quite anxious this term and less able to concentrate than usual. I’ve missed the singing assemblies and being able to chat to colleagues in the staff room. We have worked hard to maintain a sense of community – making videos with green screens instead of inviting parents in to school to watch the nativity show. But a lot of what makes the school a special place to be, and binds us together, has had to be sacrificed. For example, last week, we weren’t able to have Christmas dinner together in the hall or sing carols at the old folks’ home the way we normally would. Overall, it has been a melancholy experience, teaching this term. And the way the Department for Education has treated teachers over the past week – when we’ve been on our knees, crawling towards the finish line – beggars belief. They do not communicate in a way that shows any respect for the people who have to implement their decisions. As one last gift from 2020, I found out this weekend that I had been in contact with a person [at school] who had tested positive and am now having to self-isolate until Boxing Day. I feel very glum – I had been looking forward to spending time outdoors enjoying socially distanced walks and coffees with people I haven’t seen enough of in many months. My hopes have to be pinned on a better 2021.” Jeremy Barraud, parent of GCSE pupil, London “My son is 16 and will be sitting his GCSEs next summer. The first few weeks of lockdown were confusing for him. He is at that age where suddenly not being able to see his friends was quite disorientating. On top of that, it took a while for the school to get going with remote learning and for him to get to grips with that. For example, we found out quite late in the day that there were some areas where my son had missed things he was supposed to do, without realising it. We were concerned at the start of the academic year about his exams in the summer, but the school reassured us that they would make sure all the pupils in year 11 were back up to speed in time. The main problem is that my son has had to repeatedly self-isolate over the past term. In total, he’s had three periods of self-isolation because of illness within the year group, plus a short period when the entire school was closed when the senior management team had to self-isolate. That meant his mock exams were rescheduled twice. There has been a huge amount of disruption this term and he’s had an awful lot to deal with, including sickness within the family. I worry that the grades from his mocks will count more than usual if exams are cancelled in the summer, and he will have to base his whole future on exams from a period when there was massive upheaval at school. I also feel sorry for the teachers. I don’t think his year group will have a chance to fulfil their potential.”"

          "bodyText": "My first reaction to “jetski man” was hysterical laughter. I couldn’t get over the idea that he thought it would take only 40 minutes to travel on his whizzy new water scooter from the Scottish coast to the Isle of Man – as if the Irish Sea was merely a dual carriageway and his ride a double-decker bus – and every time I thought of it, I cracked up again. In the end, of course, it took him four-and-a-half, freezing cold hours, and though history does not yet record what he thought as he finally glimpsed the Emerald City, otherwise known as Ramsey harbour, one guesses that he looked up at the sky and offered grateful thanks to whatever greater power it is that watches over lovelorn men who are so desperate to see their girlfriends they care neither for Covid restrictions, nor for the fact they cannot swim. By this point, after all, gratitude was due. Another 10 minutes and he would have been out of petrol. But then I stopped laughing, and not only because our hero, aka Dale McLaughlan, a 28-year-old roofer from Irvine, had been given a month-long prison sentence for having broken the island’s emergency regulations by entering without a permit, a punishment that seemed excessive to me. One by one, the details battered at the door of my lockdown heart. McLaughlan had twice applied for permission to visit his girlfriend, Jessica Radcliffe, and been refused. He had saved up to buy his jetski, which he’d then towed 70 miles to the beach; until that fateful day three weeks ago, he’d never been in charge of one before. After he made landfall, 25 miles away, he had to hike 15 miles to Radcliffe’s home. A photo of him approaching Ramsey mysteriously appeared and there was something so poignantly Boy’s Own adventure about it: his woolly hat, tight on his head; his bulging rucksack, in which I pictured clean underpants and a box of Milk Tray; above all, the determined, forthright way he gripped his handlebars. It brought to mind a boy I once knew who used to ride his Chopper up the steep Sheffield hills every evening just so he could sit outside my house for a minute. In these strange, meanwhile times – the Great Pause, the Great Ache; call it what you will – jetski man, I concluded, is Everyman. To consider his simplicity, resourcefulness and impetuosity is not quite to look in a mirror. But it is a bit like briefly catching sight of your reflection in a window and wondering what on earth you’ve become. I think we can all agree that it’s getting hard now. You don’t have to be insane with love to feel, well, insane. Last week, I switched on the TV in anticipation (not the right word) of the news. A Panorama programme about the Oxford vaccine was just finishing and Fergus Walsh, the BBC medical editor, was asking Mene Pangalos, the British neuroscientist who is vice-president of AstraZeneca, what he was looking forward to in the Afterwards. Pangalos warned Walsh that answering this would make him emotional. “I haven’t seen my mum since last Christmas,” he said. “She’s in Greece. She’s on her own.” He took off his glasses and wiped his eyes. “It’s been tough,” he said. Outwardly, we battle on – and away from the doom, the media drip-feed us hope. On the news, we see the freshly tested at last able to hug their relatives in care homes. On Channel 4, a documentary about love in the time of Covid offers stories of those who shacked up after only one date when lockdown began and are deliriously happy; of previously antagonistic couples who have discovered they like one another after all. Meanwhile, we tell ourselves that the pandemic has taught us who our real friends are; that it has reminded us of who we love and who we only tolerate. How lucky we are to have mobiles and FaceTime, if not jetskis and a barely visible horizon. But alongside all this there is, unseen and unspoken, a sadder story. At its heart is something more subtle than isolation, and more brutal, in its way, than loneliness. Deep down, we know there exists a casually ruthless algorithm when it comes to love. Absence makes the heart grow fonder until… it doesn’t. Our most tender organ has its defence mechanisms: when weary, first it drifts, and then, fatally, it enamels itself. Even those of us who are not islands – who do not talk, half Hemingway and half Yoda, of accepting what we cannot change – can reach a point when losing touch is easier, less painful, than maintaining it. A message arrives and we don’t reply and so it begins. Columns are supposed to answer questions; to proffer opinions, preferably firm. But at this moment, when I miss people so much that I’m close to feeling nothing at all save for a plodding numbness, I have no answers. My mind resembles an exam paper: the kind of esoteric quiz that might be set by an Oxbridge college were it unaccountably to seek undergraduates to study for degrees in futile self-help and amateur shrinkage. Will I be able to pick up where I left off? Am I forgotten? Who have I forgotten? Are there people I will never now see again? What if something terrible happens to someone I love before this thing is done? How far would I go to be with them and they with me? Would I ride, metaphorically speaking, full throttle on a jetski across a gunmetal sea? Would they do the same for me? What, should such a thing prove necessary, dissolves enamel? Siri, tell me this: how will it be between us when all this is over? Rachel Cooke is an Observer columnist"

          "bodyText": "Five years ago, I was invited to test one of Google’s prototype driverless cars on the streets near the company’s headquarters in California. The car, alive with tech and sensors, navigated the traffic faultlessly and, sitting passively inside it, I could see only a couple of reasons why, by 2020, the vehicles wouldn’t be everywhere. One stubborn problem was the insurer’s question of who would be liable in the event of an “autonomous car” being involved in an accident. That came closer to being resolved last week with a framework government legal report suggesting, logically, that responsibility for all motoring offences, even fatal accidents, should transfer from the driver (now the “user-in-charge”) to the car-maker or its software. What the report did not resolve, though, was another potential difficulty that had struck me. Given that the cars had no choice but to stop if they detected unusual movement in front of them, and were predictably perfect at it, what was to prevent pedestrians continually walking into the road knowing the algorithm was on their side? Wouldn’t cars be stranded in a permanent limbo of giving way? When I raised this with the driverless gurus at Google, high on their “rational mobility solutions”, they looked puzzled. Why would anyone step out like that? “Have you ever met a British teenager?” I wondered. We are not a muse In the current issue of the London Review of Books, the artist Celia Paul reviews the second volume of William Feaver’s life of Lucian Freud. In it, Feaver catalogues the changing cast of young “neurotics” who became the ageing Freud’s lovers. Paul, now 61, who had a son with Freud at 25 before he lost interest in her, was one of those women. I spoke to her about that one-sided relationship last year. If there was one description of her she liked less than “muse”, it was “in her own right”, as in “she is now a painter in her own right”. In her LRB piece, Paul writes poignantly of how female artists – Gwen John was another – become footnotes in the biographies of the controlling men who “discovered” them. It is a “cellar life”, Paul writes. Quite rightly, she believes coming up for air is long overdue. Last rites Most presidents use their farewell months to grant clemency to prison inmates with dubious sentences. Donald Trump, never knowingly unsociopathic, appears determined rather to make the Christmas period the most lethal of a presidency that, since federal executions were restored in July, has killed more prisoners than any for 50 years. Execution orders on five inmates are being rushed through before he quits the White House in January. The urgency reminded me of a sentiment of the US justice campaigner Bryan Stevenson, who has overturned the unsafe convictions of dozens of prisoners on death row. “The question is never whether these people deserve to die for what they have done,” he said. “The question is whether, given our history, we deserve to kill them.” Christmas miracle My mum and dad, both well into their 80s, were among the fortunate first recipients of the initial dose of the Pfizer Covid vaccine last Wednesday. After they’d had the jab, they were told to wait for 15 minutes to make sure there were no immediate side-effects in a makeshift marquee in the clinic’s car park. “Is that where the drinks are?” my mum joked, characteristically, to the nurse. Certainly, after our year of prohibitions, it felt like a rare – hopefully increasingly familiar – champagne moment."

          "headline": "Top football clubs relying on transfer valuations made by volunteers",
          "bodyText": "Valuations by the football data website Transfermarkt, which can often influence transfer negotiations and have appeared on several clubs’ annual financial reports, are determined mainly by volunteers, according to an investigation. Transfermarkt, established in 2000 by a Werder Bremen supporter, records more than one billion page views every month and is one of the world’s largest football websites. Its database contains the details of more than 800,000 professional footballers, including statistics on how many minutes they play, medical history, contract duration, as well as publishing frequently updated estimates of every player’s market value. These valuations have been cited in the fiscal reports of several clubs including Lyon, Marseille, Porto and Schalke, but a report by the Dutch website Follow the Money found that they are merely estimates usually based on the hunch of an individual. “I spend a bit of my free time on my computer at home, estimating prices. And the football industry then takes these valuations seriously,” said Martin Freundl, who decides the market values of all players in the German Bundesliga. “It’s unreal. I’m just a social worker. I do this Transfermarkt work for fun and the football industry is worth millions. The contrast is insane.” One example is the former Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu, who cited Transfermarkt to justify the €72m transfer price of the Brazilian player Arthur Melo in June. Uefa used Transfermarkt data in a 2016 report and it is also used by scouting departments at clubs all over the world. Christian Schwarz, who as Transfermarkt’s international head of market values is the first point of contact for players and clubs who disagree with a valuation on the site, admitted he had been surprised by the growing influence its estimates are having on the industry. “Clubs shouldn’t make transfer decisions based on the figures on our website,” he told Follow the Money. “Our method is not scientific.” According to Schwarz, players in top-level leagues are revalued four times a year, with major updates before each transfer window. Rather than using an algorithm, prices are set according to the “wisdom of the crowd” principle, which is similar to the way Wikipedia works. Users can discuss market values on the Transfermarkt forum but the ultimate number is based only on substantiated arguments and is ultimately determined by Freundl and his colleagues. Other criteria, according to a Transfermarkt document obtained by Follow the Money, include minutes played, goals, assists, matches played for the national team, contract length, salary, and the club’s prestige and financial situation. “I think of it as a kind of game,” Freundl said. “You make a prediction and it’s satisfying to be proven right.”"

Finding the right classic red, wintery berry tone or 90s chocolate brown (a huge trend online) can be risky without testers, so make the most of modern tech by using virtual try-on tools. MAC Cosmetics allows visitors to upload a selfie and try on as many of its uncomparable 800 lipsticks as you fancy. Bare Minerals has a similar service for its lipsticks, while Bobbi Brown extends the idea to eyeshadows and L’Oréal Paris to entire makeovers, on their respective UK sites. All fun, useful and with zero commitment to buy. If you’re not sure where to start, several brands have attempted to preserve on-counter jobs by diverting as many of their artists as possible to an online space, where they can provide video or live-chat consultations on skincare and makeup. Most of the big brands have this facility on their e-commerce sites, as does multi brand retailer Cult Beauty (10am-6pm). The SpaceNK website invites you to throw your question out to the wider Space NK community of customers, while large beauty enthusiast groups on Facebook (mine is Sali Hughes: Get The Look, but there are hundreds to choose from) are a font of ideas and personal recommendations. Foundation is the trickiest product to choose online, since a woeful number of brands still provide little more than a thumbnail swatch of colour that varies from screen to screen. Life would be infinitely easier if they ditched the oblique, single-word shade names and adopted the MAC, Nars, NYX Cosmetics, Estée Lauder and Bobbi Brown approach of describing undertones and depth, eg “medium deep with cool undertone”, allowing online shoppers a better stab at a match. As a brief guide, cool undertones are pinkier/redder with bluish veins and look better in silver jewellery. Warm undertones are yellow/more golden, have greenish veins and suit gold jewellery, and neutral undertones are neither pink nor yellow, have mixed shade veins like a map, and are flattered by either metal. If you’re still nervous about choosing, you can try foundation matching software, which chooses a shade from an unfamiliar brand based on those you already own. The IlMakiage.com claims its Power Match quiz can find your perfect shade in 90 seconds (it worked well for me on shade, but less well on formula and finish). Of the multi-brand online foundation-matching tools, like findation.com, temptalia.com and Slapp App, I find the latter to be the most consistently accurate. But when it comes to judging undertones across a modern (large) array of shades, an algorithm is simply is no substitute for face-to-face, hygienic colour matching by an expert on-counter – so do please support your beauty professionals by visiting them."

          "headline": "Google rejects plan to make it pay for news in Australia despite law being watered down",
          "bodyText": "Google has rejected a bargaining code designed to force it and other tech groups to pay publishers for news they use on their websites, even though it has already been watered down after a fierce lobbying campaign by the search giant. In a post to Google’s official blog, the company’s Australian boss, Mel Silva, said the proposed code would “fundamentally break how search engines work”, complained it would involve giving news publishers special treatment and slammed the “final offer” method that is to be used to resolve how much should be paid for news as “unfair and unprecedented”. “Unfortunately, while the government has made some changes, the legislation still falls far short of a workable code,” she said. Silva said Google was “still fully committed to getting to a version of the law that’s workable” and made proposals to further weaken the code. A program under which Google proposed to pay some publishers for using their work, Google News Showcase, “remains on hold in Australia until we can be sure that the final code is workable”, she said. Industry sources said Silva’s blog introduced new arguments Google has not previously aired in its campaign against the code and appeared to be a stiffening of its position. It comes as Google is hit with a wave of anti-trust lawsuits in the US, alleging that it has an illegal monopoly in search. The initial version of the news media bargaining code, proposed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission chair, Rod Sims, only took into account the value of news content to Google, Facebook and other tech groups. After consultation with affected parties, including Google, the draft legislation now before parliament was watered down so that the value news organisations get from links published by internet companies is also recognised. However, as much of the traffic search engines send to news websites would probably arrive directly if search engines did not exist, the value transferred to publishers by companies such as Google is limited. Other changes that have been made include reducing the length of time tech groups have to give news publishers before changing their algorithms in a way that might hurt the media companies from 28 days to 14 days. There has also been an increase in how significant algorithm changes have to be before notification is required. After pressure from the Greens, the legislation now also includes the government-owned broadcasters, ABC and SBS, which were initially excluded. But the final offer arbitration model used to resolve disputes over how much cash should be paid has not been changed. Under final offer arbitration – also known as “baseball arbitration” due to its use in the sport in the US – each side puts forward a final, binding bid as to how much should be paid and the arbitrator picks one. Silva said the latest version of the code “forces Google to pay to show links in an unprecedented intervention that would fundamentally break how search engines work”. “No website and no search engine pays to connect people to other websites, yet the code would force Google to include and pay for links to news websites in the search results you see,” she said. She complained that notifying news publishers of changes to the algorithm amounted to “special treatment”. “Even if we could comply, that would delay important updates, drive up operating costs and mandate special treatment to news publishers in a way that would disadvantage everyone else,” she said. Silva proposed weakening the code by limiting notification of algorithm changes to “actionable” ones, but did not explain what she meant by the term. And she again blasted final-offer arbitration, which Google has consistently opposed, saying it “incentivises publishers to make ambit claims and resort to arbitration rather than good-faith negotiations”. Silva proposed replacing final offer arbitration with a model “that would let arbitrators look at comparable transactions, rather than just looking at only one side’s costs”. Peter Lewis, director of the Centre for Responsible Technology at thinktank The Australia Institute, said Google’s statement showed “that it does not recognise that professionally produced journalism has value greater than other content”. “The code recognises that Google’s monopoly on advertising, including their illegal data sharing with DoubleClick, has created a massive market distortion,” he said. “Google’s response is to dismiss journalism as a charity, deserving of sympathy but not respect.”"

          "bodyText": "A government U-turn on plans to increase housebuilding in the Tory heartlands will make it harder to hit the target of building 300,000 new homes every year, leading planners have warned. Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, announced on Wednesday that 20 cities would instead be asked to build an extra 100,000 new homes in the next five years, heading off a rebellion from Conservative councillors and backbenchers. But planners said it would make it more difficult to increase housebuilding because some cities were already struggling to find land on brownfield sites and it might trigger protracted negotiations where cities tried to hand off their housing requirements to neighbouring rural authorities. Jenrick said the new housing plan was “levelling up” by targeting 35% increases in building in cities including Bradford, Hull, Leeds and Stoke. He said that after Covid’s economic impact there was an “opportunity to repurpose more commercial centres, offices and retail spaces into housing”. Outside London, Birmingham is set to see the biggest increase in proposed building, with more than 1,200 additional new homes now expected on top of existing demand for 3,577 per year. Bristol is being told it will need to more than double its existing annual delivery from about 1,500 to 3,200, according to analysis by Lichfields, a planning and development consultancy. But Matthew Spry, senior director of Lichfields, said the new system “makes it more difficult to deliver 300,000 homes a year”. He said that some of the cities facing demands for more housebuilding had previously struggled because “they don’t have enough land”. Toby Lloyd, Theresa May’s former housing adviser, said the strategy would not, on its own, boost housebuilding, and shifting targets to cities may make hitting housing targets harder, without other measures. “The government remains stuck in the same hole as before, namely, how to square centralised target-setting with the desire to leave actual decisions on where homes go to local processes,” he said. “Shifting the balance of the formula towards cities and the north may relieve the immediate political pressure, but without stronger interventions as well it won’t address the deeper problems of planning, housing supply or affordability.” Jenrick said: “This government wants to build more homes as a matter of social justice, for intergenerational fairness and to create jobs for working people. We are reforming our planning system to ensure it is simpler and more certain without compromising standards of design, quality and environmental protection.” The shift to building in cities follows a political backlash in August against what one Tory MP described as a “mutant algorithm” which prioritised building in villages and towns in the south-east, while reducing construction of new housing in northern England. It was designed, in part, to suggest more housebuilding in areas of greatest unaffordability. The Local Government Association said it would “seriously jeopardise” the government’s professed intent to level up economic activity in disadvantaged areas of the country. The CPRE charity said it would lead to “a massive loss of countryside”. The original proposals would have reportedly required housebuilding in Newcastle to fall by 66%, Manchester by 37% and the north-east generally by 28%, while in the south-east outside London development would have risen by 57%. Critics said the plans as they stood would abolish the traditional distinction in British planning between built-up areas and the 70-80% of land that was still rural and accelerate the decline of poorer cities. The new plans include a £100m “brownfield land release fund” to promote urban regeneration and development on public sector land. Ministers also allocated more than £67m in funding to the West Midlands and Greater Manchester authorities to deliver new homes."

          "headline": "UK coronavirus: PM says Christmas rules will not change but urges caution and minimal contact with others – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has urged families to limit the length and scale of Christmas gatherings, saying existing rules for a festive respite from Covid regulations across the UK would not be changed – but that people should be extremely cautious. Fresh lockdown measures are to be imposed in Wales beginning on Christmas Eve, while the law will be changed to limit Christmas mixing to two households, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced. A fifth of people still have coronavirus symptoms five weeks after being infected, with half of them continuing to experience problems for at least 12 weeks, official data suggests, as concerns grow about the scale and impact of “long Covid”. Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, has said that he expects the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to be approved for use in the UK by early in the new year. Speaking at the No 10 press conference, when asked when it would be available, he said it was up to the regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). He went on: I think there’s a fair chance that by early in the new year, possibly before, but that entirely depends on the data, they will be able to say whether they are confident that this vaccine is both efficacious and safe. Unicef has launched a domestic emergency response in the UK for the first time in its more than 70-year history to help feed children hit by the Covid-19 crisis. More than 300 passengers were stranded on a ferry overnight in Birkenhead after six crew members tested positive for Covid-19. A clash over EU access to British fishing waters could still sink hopes of a post-Brexit trade deal, Ursula von der Leyen has said, with agreement said to be “so close but yet … so far away”. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told Radio 4’s PM programme that he agreed with 95% of what the prime minister said at his press conference this afternoon about Christmas. Asked if it was a mistake for the four nations to agree rules for Christmas in November which he is now tightening up in Wales, he replied: Well, certainly things have changed in a way that if we were making the plan today from scratch we probably wouldn’t have come to the same set of conclusions. But you are right that the driver for deciding it when we did was because people were anxious to know what sort of Christmas was going to be available to them. And people will have been able to plan within the parameters that were set there – those parameters are broadly still there although we are asking people to use that modest additional freedom carefully, cautiously and responsibly. Downing Street has put out a statement saying it expects the trade talks with the EU to continue “over the coming days”. The Commons will go into recess, as planned for Christmas, tomorrow, but Downing Street says it can be recalled very quickly to pass the trade deal legislation if necessary. That could happen early next week, a spokesperson said. The process for recall will align with the process for finalising the legislation for a deal, if one is secured, and no time will be lost. Under the recall process, we will adapt the days’ proceedings to focus exclusively on the passage of that legislation. This may mean meeting at an earlier time. From the Daily Mirror’s Pippa Crerar The UK government has not yet updated its coronavirus dashboard. Normally it gets updated at around 4pm. This may be related to a hold-up with case numbers from Wales. (See 3.29pm.) These are from ITV Wales’ James Crichton-Smith. The Welsh government has said that it is making its guidance on limiting Christmas bubbles to two households a legal requirement so as to make it “easier” for the public to understand. A Welsh government spokesman said: Ministers decided this afternoon that we will be amending the regulations in Wales. So for December 23 to 27 the restriction on two households meeting will be part of Welsh law. It makes it easier, so we don’t have the position where the law says one thing and the guidance says something else. Earlier today Mark Drakeford, the first minister, said the two household condition was just guidance. But a decision was subsequently taken to make it law. Labour has accused Boris Johnson of “mixed messaging” over Christmas. Here is Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary. From the former Financial Times editor, Lionel Barber The leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, Paul Davies, has accused the Welsh government of losing control of the Covid crisis. He said: The Welsh government has clearly lost control of the pandemic in Wales, where we now need a fire blanket not a firebreak to put out the flames of infection that are raging in some part of Wales. Over the last few weeks families would have been making the tough calls as to who they need to cut out from their Christmas, now having to rethink, whilst also having to deal with the confusion in the mixed messages from the Welsh government with guidance saying one thing, and regulations saying something else. The Plaid Cymru leader, Adam Price, said: Given the mixed messaging from the prime minister and Westminster, the Welsh government need to change the rules not just the guidance on household mixing at Christmas. Otherwise, it’s simply a recipe for confusion and poor adherence to the new policy. This morning some newspapers (generally those sceptical about Covid restrictions anyway) led on stories about how Boris Johnson was defying calls to tighten the Christmas rules. “PM will defy pressure to cancel Christmas,” said the Daily Express splash headline. The Daily Mail (here), the Times (here) and the Daily Telegraph (here) said much the same. In a narrow, technical sense, they weren’t wrong. The law that will allow a five-day window during which up to three households can meet in England will stay in place. But, in considerably strengthening the advice about how people should minimise contact at Christmas, Johnson has come close to performing a U-turn. When the government originally announced the Christmas plan, it stressed the importance of acting responsibly, but did not go into details. At a press conference two days later, asked if it was really sensible to travel hundreds of miles to see relatives, Johnson essentially dodged the question. Now he is issuing extensive precautionary advice, which he set out in his opening statement. Johnson suggested people should delaying visiting elderly relatives until they have been vaccinated. He said: So if you’re elderly, the best way to minimise your personal risk is to wait to be vaccinated before spending time indoors with others. And if you have an elderly relative, you might want to delay seeing them until they’ve been vaccinated. He said people in high-prevalence areas should if possible avoid travelling to a low-prevalence area. In practice, in England, this seems to mean advising people in tier 3 not to visit people in tier 2. He said people should if possible avoid staying away from home overnight. He urged people to adopt an isolation policy before Christmas, as far as possible, if they were visiting others for the holiday. He said: If you are visiting others over Christmas, we are asking you – in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday – to reduce the number of people you are in contact with to the lowest possible because this virus spreads from human contact. He said it was “safest to minimise the number of people you meet”. He said, if possible, people should avoid having three households meeting for up to five days. Although this was what the law allowed, he said these were “maximums, not targets to aim for”. He said people should “think carefully about avoiding crowds in the Boxing Day sales”. At one point in the press conference Johnson also said it would be “inhuman” to cancel Christmas. I want to be clear, we don’t want to ban Christmas, to cancel it, I think that would be frankly inhuman and against the instincts of many people in this country. But for some people, following his advice in its entirety might feel like cancelling Christmas. He did stress that this was advice, not law. But with gap between the law and the guidance now increasingly wide, Johnson may have muddled the overall messaging, leaving people less sure as to what is acceptable. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, has written to the Conservative party co-chair, Amanda Milling, calling for an inquiry into the revelation that the Wellingborough Conservatives have been urging activists to campaign using “fake news”. In her letter Rayner said: After the prime minister and the foreign secretary refused to speak out when President Trump was claiming victory and alleging fraud in the US presidential election, this newsletter seems to demonstrate that the Conservative party is copying from Donald Trump’s playbook and implementing a political strategy of weaponising fake news, making dishonest statements and telling brazen lies in order to “crowd out” and “overwhelm” the truth. Johnson ends the press conference using a joke that he used in his opening statement. Have yourself a merry little Christmas but this year, alas, preferably a very little Christmas. But he says that he hopes next year it will be back to “Christmas as normal for everybody”. Q: Where are we in the trade talks? Johnson says that is very much a matter for the EU. They know the UK’s terms. But the UK would prosper if it had to trade on WTO or Australian terms. Q: When will the Oxford vaccine become available? Johnson says he has always been in the anxious camp on vaccine, keen not to “over-promise”. He does not want to jinx things by over-promising at this stage. Whitty says this is very much in the hands of the regulator. It has access to lots of data not in the public domain. He says he is hopeful that by early in the new year, or possibly before, it will get approved. If that happens, it will be rolled out gradually at first, as with the Pfizer one, so the health service can check for problems. But it will be much easier to distribute, he says, because it is easier to store than the Pfizer one. If it can be used, it will considerably speed up the point at which all vulnerable people can be protected, he says. Asked if he has a Christmas present for Nicola Sturgeon, Johnson says the people of Scotland will become the proud possessors of thousands of tonnes of fish after the post-Brexit transition ends. Q: Does this represent a more tolerant approach to restrictions? Johnson does not accept that. He says, “alas”, the government is still being very proscriptive. It may be the strictest approach since Cromwell’s time, he says. The guidance is there to help people exercise personal responsibility, he says. Q: If someone follows the law, but ignores the guidance, and they give Covid to someone who dies, whose fault is it? Yours or theirs? Johnson says he does not want to criminalise people, but he wants people to follow the guidance. Whitty says in much of the UK the problem is getting worse or flatlining. Within the choices available, people should do the minimum. Some medical experts are saying this should be law. Others are saying it should be guidance. But they essentially agree on the need to do the minimum. Whitty says it is like driving on ice. You would not drive at 70mph, even if you could. He says he does not think people will push things to the limit. He expects people to act responsibly, as they have done throughout this. Q: Wouldn’t it be better to stop people meeting at Christmas? Johnson says it would be “inhuman” to try to cancel Christmas. But he wants people to think about what they can do to minimise contact at Christmas. They should exercise their personal responsiblity. Q: What does the modelling say about the risks of people mixing at Christmas? Whitty says the modelling shows that more mixing at Christmas would lead to more deaths. He stresses the importance of people doing what they can to reduce the risks. Q: Will social distancing end once the vulnerable have been vaccinated? Johnson says a few weeks ago he spoke about the crossover point, when vaccination would allow measures to be eased. We are “by no means there yet”, he says. But he says that point will come before Easter. Whitty says the vaccine will initially help to reduce the number of people dying from the disease. But if you relax the rules then, other people would get infected in large numbers. Some would die. He says population immunity will occur if vaccine can reduce transmission. He says the Pfizer vaccine, and the next two vaccines coming, the Oxford one and the Moderna one, will stop people getting ill. But he says they do not know if the vaccines will stop the spread. He hopes they will. He says it is not realistic to expect that there is no coronavirus in the community. It will continue to be present, at low levels, “probably for the foreseeable future”. He says he expects it will be like flu, which kills 7,000 people in a normal year, or 20,000 people in a bad year. Whitty says both options for Christmas are bad options. The government has tried to minimise the risk. But people should think what they can do to reduce the risk. Whitty urges people to keep it short, keep it local, and keep it small. That means they should not mix households for long periods. They should minimise travel. And they should mix in small groups. Boris Johnson is speaking now. He says, with the vaccine being rolled out, an end to the crisis is in sight. But we must “hold our nerve”, he says. He says there are worrying signs of cases rising. At Christmas people should exercise “extreme caution”. He says, “alas”, the overall situation is worse than it was when the Christmas rules were drawn up. The four nations of the UK will not criminalise people who made plans based on the five-day relaxation of restrictions announced in November, he says. So the rules will not change, he says. But the four nations are issuing strong advice. When we say three household can meet on five days, I want to stress that these are maximums, not targets to aim at. Of course, it’s always going to be safest to minimise the number of people you meet and that means that, if you’re visiting others over Christmas, we’re asking you in the five days beforehand, as early as this Friday, to reduce the number of people you’re in contact with to the lowest possible, because obviously this virus spreads through human contact. Johnson also says people if at all possible should avoid travelling from a high prevalence area to a low one. If possible, people should avoid staying away from home overnight, he says. He says people may want to avoid seeing elderly relatives until they have been vaccinated. And he urges people to avoid crowds at the Boxing Day sales. Boris Johnson is about to hold a press conference at No 10. He will be joined by Prof Chris Whitty, the goverment’s chief medical adviser. A new software update from Apple means that the NHS Covid-19 contact tracing app should shortly be available for older iPhones, dating back to 2013’s iPhone 5s. The exposure notification technology on which the NHS’s app runs was built by Apple and Google, and set strict limits on what governments are able to do to build contact tracing apps. They are unable, for instance, to access the location of users of the apps, nor can they track who has been in contact with potentially infectious. The chief limit until now, however, has been that governments are unable to support devices which haven’t received a crucial software update containing the exposure notification framework. For Apple, that meant any device older than 2015’s iPhone 6s wasn’t supported, no matter how much the government wanted to ensure that people without access to the latest tech were included. (For Android devices, the situation is more convoluted, given the widespread fragmentation across manufacturers). Now, Apple has pushed a rare software update for so-called “obsolete” phones, which don’t normally receive anything other than crucial security updates. iOS 12.5 will bring the exposure notification framework to older phones for the first time. Sadly, it is unlikely that that will lead to the NHS Covid-19 app making it onto those devices before Christmas: developers will still need to update their own apps to make them work on the older devices, which, paired with the review process, means even January is a stretch. But eventually, one of the main complaints about the exposure notification system should be put to rest. But the coronavirus figures for Wales today have been delayed, Public Health Wales says. Here are the latest coronavirus figures for Northern Ireland. Here are the latest coronavirus figures for Scotland. There are also 1,031 Covid patients in hospital now. A week ago the figure was 972. NHS England has recorded 369 further coronavirus hospital deaths. The details are here. This is the highest daily recorded total for more than two weeks. Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, has suggested that further Covid restrictions could be introduced in the region after Christmas. She said Robin Swann, the health minister, will be proposing new measures at a meeting of the power-sharing executive tomorrow. She said she was not expecting recommend tightening rules before Christmas, but she said she could not rule out further restrictions after the holiday. She said: Unfortunately the last two weeks don’t appear to have brought the R number down below 1, there is a diminishing return in terms of restrictions, people are out and about now and so there is a very great need for people to have personal responsibility. I note what Wales have done, we were speaking to Mark Drakeford this morning on a four nations call and he indicated that that would be the case. I am not going to prejudge what the minister [Robin Swann] is going to bring to us but undoubtedly we will have something to say tomorrow and over the next few days. Michelle O’Neill, the deputy first minister, said she thought a further intervention was needed. She told reporters: I think it is totally unacceptable that people are being cared for in the back of ambulances but that shows you our health service is under huge pressure so it is very clear to me that what we need is to have an intervention, what that looks like we will discuss at the executive tomorrow. At an online press conference, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said that if the government did not agree to put the whole of his region into tier 2, it should consider placing most of it in tier 2. He said: If the government does not want to put Greater Manchester as a whole in Tier 2, particularly given the fact a couple of our boroughs are above the national average or close to it, we do still believe there is a very strong case for a substantial part of the city region to be placed in tier 2. We would ask the government to give regard to the fact we have been under restrictions for four-and-a-half months, that would mean five months by the next review period. In a good HuffPost article Paul Waugh argues that, since Dominic Cummings quit as the PM’s chief adviser, Boris Johnson seems to have discovered the art of compromise. Johnson may also have embraced the importance of consultation too. Asked at the Welsh government press conference if he had noticed any change in the willingness of the UK government to operate on a four-nations basis since Cummings left Downing Street, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: I’ve no way of linking what has happened to any particular individual or event but the facts are simply that over the last month we have had a more regular and reliable pattern of engagement with the UK government. Regularity of engagement leads to better sharing of information, better understanding and better decision-making. The government’s Christmas travel tsar, Sir Peter Hendy, has told MPs he does not expect there to be overcrowding that prevents social distancing on public transport during the five-day Christmas window. Giving evidence to the Commons transport committee, Hendy, who is also chair of Network Rail, said: Market research suggests that ... 76% of people are not intending to travel and, of those that are, 80% are planning to travel by car, and ... actually quite a lot of that car travel will be on Christmas Day. And I think, as a consequence, we’re quite well placed for the public transport modes to operate, so far as long distance travel is concerned, entirely within social distancing because we can reserve it. And as far as urban transport goes, I think, I think it isn’t likely to be much different from where it’s been in the past few months which is, in my observation at least, widespread adherence to social distancing rules ... I’m not envisaging terrible scenes either in train stations, bus stations or elsewhere, of people breaking social distancing rules. The statistics on travel plans quoted by Hendy appeared to be drawn from YouGov polling last week which found that the busiest day for outbound travel would be on Christmas Eve and the busiest day for return travel would be 27 December. Hendy told the committee his message to the travelling public would be “be careful ... stay local if you can but the most important part of the message is to book public transport early”. At the Scottish government briefing, Nicola Sturgeon also revealed what she described as a “one-off blip”, whereby an overnight upgrade configured Scotland’s contact-tracing app in an overly sensitive way, meaning that hundreds of people will have received notification to self-isolate when they don’t need to. She said that around 900 notifications had been sent out, rather than the average of 250. She urged anyone who received a message from test and protect between 0.01am on Monday and 8.30am on Tuesday to call the contract-tracing centre for confirmation. But Twitter suggests that contact tracers are simply telling individuals to “make their own judgment call”. Boris Johnson is likely to be saying more about Christmas at a press conference he is holding at Downing Street at 3.30pm. Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, will also be attending. At PMQs Boris Johnson implied that the four nations had agreed upon a joint position over Christmas in their talks this morning. He told MPs: As of today that just this morning there is unanimous agreement across all the UK government, across all the devolved administrations – including members of all parties, including [Keir Starmer’s] own – that we should proceed in principle with the existing regulations because we don’t want to criminalise people’s long-made plans. Subsequently it has emerged that this was a rather selective description of the situation. Although the legal framework allowing people a five-day limited exemption from normal Covid rules has not changed, the Scottish and Welsh governments have issued different guidance. Here is our latest story summing up the situation. At his coronavirus briefing Mark Drakeford, the first minister of Wales, confirmed that further joint advice from the four nations would be published later covering Christmas. He said: In the few short weeks since we made this decision, the situation has changed drastically as coronavirus has gripped. Later today, we will publish further joint advice across the UK, explaining that a smaller Christmas is a safer Christmas. Here in Wales over the Christmas period the clear message from the Welsh government is that only two households should meet. That is how serious it is in Wales. Pressed over whether this was a rule or advice, he said: “The message is the same.” He clarified that a single person household would be able to join two other households. Drakeford denied there was “bickering” at the four nations meeting on the Christmas rules this morning. He said it was a “very sober reflection on the level of challenge we are facing.” Explaining the decision to close non-essential retail businesses after the end of trading on Christmas Eve, Drakeford said: The modelling does demonstrate that if we were to have a position in which large numbers of people come together for Boxing Day sales, then that’s another form of mixing. But asked why hospitality was not being shut down now given the seriousness of the situation, he said: There’s more than one form of harm from coronavirus. We know that many people who live alone arrange their Christmas by booking a meal on Christmas Day, so that they can be in the company of other people. I wanted to be able to honour that so that those people do not face an even bleaker Christmas, even more alone than they otherwise would be with all the other harms that come from that. Everything we do is a balance between one form of harm and another. Allowing hospitality to continue to 6pm on Christmas Day protects the plans that people have made - particularly those who are lonely and isolated - and allows the industry itself to come to an orderly close. The latest edition of the Guardian’s Politics Weekly podcast is out. For one moment, forget about the trouble with tiers, and bother with Brexit. Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot look through their hypothetical crystal balls to delve into the many possibilities of what might have happened if a major political moment went another way. What if ... Gordon Brown had called an election in 2007? What if ... Cameron had won the referendum? And what if ... Scotland had voted yes to independence? How bad does a government have to perform before it loses critical popular support? That is an interesting question at any time, a particularly pertinent one for the UK in 2020, and more germane than ever after Sir Keir Starmer used what will probably be the last PMQs of 2020 to hammer Boris Johnson over the flaws in his handling of the pandemic. It was one of Starmer’s best performance for a while, and he put the case for the prosecution clearly and compellingly. As he said at one point: This isn’t bad luck, it is not inevitable, it is a result of the prime minister’s choices. But if the prime minister disagrees with me, perhaps he can tell us why does he think that Britain, the 6th richest country in the world with all our brilliant scientists and amazing NHS, ends the year with one of the highest numbers of Covid deaths in Europe, over 64,000 - each one leaving a grieving family - and the deepest recession of any major economy? And as Johnson tried to claim that the government had a strategy that was working, Starmer undercut him with some facts. “In three out of four tier 2 areas infections are going up. In over half of the tier 3 areas infections are going up, exactly the concern I put to the PM two weeks ago when he said just back us anyway,” he said. Johnson has various response, some better than others, but none of them particularly persuasive. In response to Starmer’s opening question, he said that at the start of the pandemic he was following the advice of the scientists (which is broadly true, and should have been followed up with a question about why is is not doing so now). He boasted about the UK’s success medical successes. “Perhaps [Starmer] could tell me why it is that the UK is the first to produce a viable treatment for coronavirus in the form of dexamethasone, or the first country in the world to roll out a clinically-tested stage three vaccine?” He was probably at his strongest when criticising Starmer for attacking the planned rules for Christmas without being willing to say what he would advocate as an alternative. But Johnson also complained rather feebly about the opposition not being sufficiently supportive, which is normally the last line of defence when all others have failed. All this was relatively familiar, and given this is probably the last PMQs of 2020, it’s worth asking whether finding it hard to defend his record is damaging Johnson electorally. If the polls are anything to go by, the answer is - only up to a point. Here are the figures from the Ipsos MORI December Political Monitor showing Johnson’s satisfaction ratings, compared to other prime ministers. Johnson’s standing has fallen a lot this year, but it is picking up recently (perhaps because of the news about the vaccine, perhaps because the departure of Dominic Cummings and Lee Cain has left No 10 less dysfunctional) and the mistakes made in the handling of the pandemic have not damaged the government to anything like the extent Black Wednesday banjaxed John Major. Which begs the question why? There is a traditional view of electoral politics which says that administrations that govern well will be rewarded, and those that don’t will be voted out, but increasingly those who study these things have concluded that that’s not how it works. In Democracy for Realists, one of the best studies of this subject, Christopher Achen and Larry Bartels conclude: The primary implication of our analyses of retrospective voting is that election outcomes are mostly just erratic reflections of the current balance of partisan loyalties in a given political system ... Elections are capricious collective decisions based on considerations that ought, from the viewpoint of the folk theory [the idea that elections are about rewarding performance], to be largely irrelevant. This would explain why Starmer has made relative limited gains in the poll despite spending the best part of the pandemic exposing Johnson’s administrative failings so effectively. So what else can he do? His best moment at PMQs came when he weaponised Dominic Cummings. While the prime minister and chancellor are telling the Armed Forces, police officers, care workers and fire fighters that they will get a pay freeze, Dominic Cummings has been handed at least a 40,000 pay rise. How on earth does the prime minister justify that? This was the point at which Johnson seemed most vulnerable. Starmer does not always seem comfortable with personalised, aggressive mudslinging, but Tony Blair quite ruthlessly used sleaze against John Major (who by today’s standards ran a relatively honest and decent administration), and this might offer a way ahead for Starmer in 2021. And for Johnson? At the start of 2020 he promised that 2020 would be “a fantastic year” for Britain. He ended his exchange with Starmer saying much the same about 2021. It’s easy to mock, but cheer and optimism is a large part of what has made him popular with voters and in 12 months time he will probably be making yet more extravagant promises for 2022. At her lunchtime media briefing, Nicola Sturgeon set out new Scottish government guidance on festive gatherings, telling the public “the reality is that this Christmas can’t be normal”. She said that four nations discussions on Christmas relaxations were ongoing, and that she hoped there would be an agreement on a four nations basis. She emphasised that the reasoning behind the relaxation – that isolation at Christmas would cause harm, that some people would not be prepared to leave their loved ones alone and that it was better to give people clear boundaries – remained sound and that there was no intention to remove that flexibility. We don’t intend to take away the flexibility, that would’t be fair and at this stage isn’t realistic but we do intend to strengthen the guidance we give to people about how they make use of the flexibility. She said her government would be bringing out its own guidance later today - “which we hope will be agreed on a four nations basis” - but set out the following: Unequivocally, the safest way to spend Christmas this year is within your own household and within your own home. If you do consider it necessary to meet someone indoors from another household indoors, you should limit the time spent together, Sturgeon said: “The five-day period is a maximum not a target.” If you do form a bubble you should not meet up for more than one day and not stay overnight, and keep it as small as possible – three households is the maximum but two is better, she said. We will recommend against travel from high to low prevalence areas of the UK. And if you do intend to form a Christmas bubble you should be trying to reduce social contact now. If you are still swithering please decide against. Seema Malhotra (Lab) asks how it can be right that a parent who has to stay away from work because a child is self-isolating is not eligible for the £500 payments. Johnson says he appreciates the problem. He says the government will do its best to address it. But he suggests the roll-out of later flow testing (or rapid result testing) will provide the solution. And that’s it. PMQs is over. Brendan Clarke-Smith (Con) asks Johnson to congratulate a constituent who raised money for MND (motor neurone disease) research. Johnson says MND is a terrible condition, and he supports the constituent. John McNally (SNP) asks why the government is not doing more to support the bus building sector. Johnson says he has caused more buses to be built (as mayor of London) than any other MP. He is committed to rolling out 4,000 zero-emission buses, he says. Sharon Hodgson (Lab) says Centrica gas engineers in her constituency were told to sign new contracts or risk losing their jobs. She asks Johnson to condemn “fire and rehire” tactics. Johnson says workers should be treated with respect. He agrees with Hodgson in that respect, he says. But he says he also sees the advantages of having a flexible labour market. He wants to continue with that, he says. Johnson urges anyone offered the vaccine to take it. Ronnie Cowan (SNP) asks if the PM supports using drug consumption rooms in Glasgow to help tackle the drug death problem there. Johnson says he does not want to encourage more drug problems. He says most of the powers needed to tackle the problem are available to the Scottish government. Fresh lockdown measures are to be imposed in Wales beginning on Christmas Eve, the first minister, Mark Drakeford has announced. All non-essential shops, plus leisure and fitness centres and close-contact services, will shut at the end of trading on Thursday 24 December. Hospitality premises, including pubs and restaurants, will close from 6pm on Christmas Day. On 28 December, tighter restrictions for household mixing, staying at home, holiday accommodation and travel will apply. This new set of “level 4” restrictions will apply to the whole of Wales. The first minister also said: Here in Wales, the advice of the Welsh government is that only two households should come together to form an exclusive Christmas bubble during the five-day period. Drakeford said more than 2,100 people – equivalent to five full general hospitals – were in Welsh hospitals with Covid symptoms. The number of people in intensive care with coronavirus is at the highest level during this second wave – at 98. Joy Morrissey (Con) asks about a growth plan for Buckinghamshire and asks him to back “this bold bid for Bucks”. Johnson says the government has been discussing the plan with the council. Liz Twist (Lab) asks about a pub in her Blaydon constituency, a wet pub with a live music tradition. She says the compensation available will not allow it to survive. Johnson quotes support already available, but says the best thing would be for areas in tier 3 to reduce the virus through community testing. Anthony Browne (Con) asks about school funding for Cambridgeshire. Will he be Santa? Johnson says it is taxpayers who perform that role. He quotes figures for school spending. Alex Norris (Lab) asks if the PM is still committed to building the eastern leg of HS2. Or is this another broken promise? Johnson says the national infrastructure commission is saying other things can be done as well. But the ambition to build the eastern leg remains unchanged. James Davies (Con) asks if the government will boost spending on the life sciences. Johnson says the government is investing record sums in science R&amp;D. Johnson says the whole of the UK, including Northern Ireland, will participate in UK trade deals post Brexit. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, asks if the government will publish an economic impact assessment of Brexit. Johnson says the UK will prosper after January, whether there is a deal or not. Blackford says the government is imposing “economic vandalism” on Scotland. Johnson says it is the SNP that poses a threat to the Scottish economy. You can follow the briefing from the Welsh first minister Mark Drakeford here Starmer says Johnson is ignoring the medical experts. He says he often wonders where the PM gets his advice from. Now he nows; the official newsletter of the Wellinborough Conservative association. He quotes from it. You say the first thing that comes into your head. It’ll probably be nonsense, but it knocks your opponent out of his stride and takes away his headline. Starmer asks if Johnson is the author of this advice, or taking inspiration from it. Johnson says what people want from Starmer is any sort of view at all. He says the government will deliver a great 2021. Starmer says Johnson is just saying what he said in October. He says is it not smarmy lawyers criticising the Christmas plans; he says medical experts are warning of what might happen. Johnson says Starmer is not prepared to say what he really wants, which is to cancel Christmas. He says this morning politicians from all parties, including Labour (ie, the Welsh government), agreed to keep the rules. Starmer says Johnson is avoiding the issue. Cases are going up. Another problem is the loss of public trust. We all know the problem; the trip to Barnard Castle.And now we know that while public sector workers are getting a pay freeze, Dominic Cummings got a £40,000 pay freeze. How does the PM justify that? Johnson says Starmer trivialises the matter. He says he is not accepting what the public have done. Starmer is one-club golfer. He can only recommend a lockdown. Then he criticises the impact, Johnson says. Starmer says he was worried that tier 2 would not work. Rising case in tier 2 and some tier 3 regions have proved his point. He says Johnson said his plan would suppress the virus. But it is not. In half of tier 3 areas cases are going up. Does the PM not recognise that his latest plan has failed to control the virus and protect the NHS and the economy. Johnson says Starmer does not have his own plan. Then he says Starmer was the mastermind of the Labour firebreak in Wales. He says the government will continue to roll out the vaccine and community testing. He says Labour should support those. Starmer asks why Britain, the sixth richest country in the world, has one of the highest death tolls in Europe and the deepest recession. Johnson says Starmer has changed his tune. Why is the UK the first country in the world to roll out a vaccine? He says he has taken the tough decisions to beat the virus. He says he would take Starmer’s decisions more seriously if Labour had been able to decide if it supported or opposed the tiering system. Sir Keir Starmer asks if Johnson now accepts that his slowness to respond to the original outbreak led to more deaths, a longer lockdown and more economic damage. Johnson says he does not. He was following the scientific advice, he says. He says rates in some areas are now coming down. We will defeat the virus with the vaccine, tough tiering and testing, he says. He says Starmer should support the government instead of “carping”. Michael Fabricant (Con) says people have had a torrid year. They have a small break over Christmas. They need to be careful. But it would not be helpful if some “smarmy lawyer” (he is referring to Keir Starmer, presumably) were to call for the rules to be changed. Johnson says Fabricant is right. People have to take care. Some things are going well, he says, quoting the vaccination figures. But transmission can be asymptomatic. But people should exercise extreme caution. Boris Johnson starts by saying he has issued a written ministerial statement about the leak of the lockdown plans. He wishes happy Christmas to members of the emergency services, healthcare workers, and others working over the holiday. From Bloomberg’s Maria Tadeo The BBC’s Nick Eardley says the four nations of the UK agreed not to tighten the rules for Christmas in their ministerial call this morning. PMQs is starting soon. Here is the list of MPs down to ask a question. For the first time in its 70-year history, Unicef has launched a domestic emergency response in the UK to help feed children hit by the Covid-19 crisis. According to a report by Sky News, the UN agency responsible for providing humanitarian aid to children worldwide has likened the effect of the coronavirus pandemic on youngsters to that of the second world war. In May, a YouGov poll commissioned by the charity Food Foundation found that 2.4 million children (17%) were living in food insecure households. And by October it said an extra 900,000 children had been registered for free school meals. Unicef has now pledged a grant of £25,000 to the charity School Food Matters, which will use the money to supply 18,000 nutritious breakfasts to 25 schools over the two-week Christmas school holidays to help vulnerable children and families in Southwark, south London. Each box will provide enough food for 10 breakfasts. A housing algorithm for England that would have increased building in the Conservatives’ rural heartlands has been dropped by the government after an outcry from its own MPs, my colleague Haroon Siddique reports. Damian Green, the Conservative MP for Ashford and former cabinet minister, is among the Tories who has welcomed the news. Brexit has left 4,000 sheep stuck in Scotland, the House of Lords has heard. The Scottish black faced sheep were overwintering in Scotland but had been bought by Northern Ireland farming businesses in the autumn and were due to return to the region in the spring. However strict new rules in the Northern Ireland protocol requiring sheep to come from holdings cleared for scrapie prevent the transfer, Helen Roberts, development officer at the National Sheep Association, told peers on the environment sub committee. “It is quite a dilemma, because these rules have only just sort of come out,” Roberts told them. They also heard concerns that “up to 20% of dairy products” could be deemed unfit for sale in the EU if there are delays at the ports post Brexit. Peter Alvis, chairman of the Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers, told peers that short life cheese and other products were “not currently on the priority list” which is expected to include other products including “fish and chicks” - shellfish from Scotland and day-old chickens exported for egg farming in the EU. The committee also heard of a national shortage of vets to sign off the health certs needed for cross border agrifood consignments. The Scottish Seafood Association called on the government to pay for the health certs which cost £180 per consignment. A business with five customers would have to find nearly £1,000 per truck, Jimmy Buchan, CEO of the organisation, told peers. Around one in five people with coronavirus may go on to suffer long Covid, new data from the Office for National Statistics suggests. As PA Media reports, for the first time the ONS has published figures examining long Covid, finding that a fifth of people have symptoms for five weeks or more while around one in 10 are affected for 12 weeks or more. Overall, around 186,000 people in private households in England in the week beginning November 22 were living with Covid-19 symptoms that had persisted for between five and 12 weeks, the ONS said. When looking at symptoms among people five weeks after testing positive for Covid-19, the ONS estimated that 11.5% of respondents were still experiencing fatigue, 11.4% had a cough and 10.1% had a headache. Some 8.2% were still experiencing a loss of taste while 7.9% still had a loss of smell. This chart gives more details. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, will give the Welsh government’s briefing at 12.15pm, instead of health officials who were due to appear, the Welsh government has announced. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, told the Today programme this morning that he thought there was a “clear case” for his region to move from tier 3 to the less restrictive tier 2 in the review of England’s tiering allocations taking place today. He explained: We have seen steady decreases across all of our boroughs pretty much ever since the last tiering decision, to the point where we are now essentially below the England average across the 10 boroughs - we are at 150 cases on average per 100,000 people, England averages 180. We are below London and below Liverpool when they went into tier 2 originally. I accept the national mood has changed since those decisions were taken and I can also understand if the Government were wanting to err on the side of caution. There is a clear case for Greater Manchester, or a large part of Greater Manchester, to be placed in tier 2. In a subsequent interview with Sky News, Burnham claimed that many pubs and restaurants in his region would never reopen if it stayed in tier 3. He said: This review is probably not going to be repeated for another month, so whatever decisions are made today will be in place for a month. And if we get to mid January with Greater Manchester still in tier three, there’ll be plenty of pubs and restaurants that will never reopen. The government is supposed to be reviewing tiering allocations at least every fortnight, and even weekly according to one ministerial promise, but Burnham seems to be assuming that the holiday period will hold up this process. He is also probably right in assuming that the government will not want to relax rules straight after Christmas until it knows what impact household mixing over the holidays has had. Burnham may be disappointed by today’s decision. In his London Playbook briefing for Politico, Alex Wickham reports: “A government official tells Playbook they would be very surprised if anywhere goes down a tier, with most of the movement expected to be places going from tier 2 to tier 3.” The supreme court has overturned a February judgment that a third runway at Heathrow airport was illegal. It means the project can now seek planning permission, but the ultimate completion of the runway remains uncertain, my colleague Damian Carrington reports. Nadhim Zahawi, the vaccine deployment minster, says more than 137,000 people in the UK have now been vaccinated since the roll-out started a week ago. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is due to hold further talks with the leaders of the devolved administrations this morning about what rules will apply over Christmas but this morning at least we are getting clarity about what is happening in England. Yesterday’s talks broke up without any conclusion, or any formal announcement from any of the four governments represented. But overnight Downing Street has been briefing that Boris Johnson is determined to let England carry on with the five-day exemption from normal social distancing rules announced last month - despite health experts, the opposition and some Tory MPs saying these temporary rules are too lax. “We’ve set out the rules, people know what they are, it would be wrong to change them this close to Christmas when people have made plans,” a government source told the Daily Telegraph. This morning Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, confirmed that. He told Sky News: “Our position is clear that the legal framework will continue.” The means the rules for Christmas for England, which have been enshrined in law, won’t change. But Jenrick indicated that government guidance is changing. When the joint four nation approach to Christmas was agreed in November, Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, both stressed that it would be safer for families not to use the freedom to mix up to three households for five days that they were being allowed by law. UK ministers were generally more upbeat and less cautious, but now UK government messaging over Christmas is being Sturgeonised. This is what Jenrick told Sky News: We all need to use our own personal judgment thinking about our own families whether we have particularly elderly or clinically vulnerable relatives who might be round the Christmas table and also looking at the fact that the rates of the virus are rising in many parts of the country. Our position is clear that the legal framework will continue but because the infection is rising in many parts of the country, because we can see these international examples like Thanksgiving, it is incumbent on each every family across the country this morning and in the days ahead to have that conversation round the breakfast table, ‘Is this right for our family?’ This is a virus that thrives on social interaction so bringing more people together, even over this short period of time, is not cost-free. It will have consequences in terms of increasing the rate. It will rise. Jenrick also suggested that families could put off big gatherings until the next major holiday. But he put it more pithily, saying: Easter can be the new Christmas. The government plans to publish data on the number of people who have had Covid-19 vaccines as early as next week, PA Media reports. PA understands that agreement is currently being sought with the devolved nations to ensure any data presented is consistent across England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. It comes after government officials would not be drawn on how many doses of Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine are due to arrive in the UK and on what schedule. From the Sun’s Nick Gutteridge Tony Connelly, RTE’s Europe editor, says Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, was appealing to the European parliament to show some flexibility this morning. The parliament would have to approve a UK-EU trade deal. Because there is so little time, even if there is a deal, it may have to be applied provisionally, which would involve the European council agreeing to allow it to come into force from 1 January before the normal ratification process has concluded. (This Institute for Government briefing explains the process in more detail.) But the European parliament has asked for this not to happen because effectively it would sideline MEPs, who would find it hard to veto an agreement already in force. From Sky’s Europe correspondent Adam Parsons Here are the main points from Ursula von der Leyen’s comments to MEPs about the UK-EU trade talks. Von der Leyen, the president of the European commission, said she thought a “path to an agreement” now existed. (See 8.56am.) She said the two sides had made progress on state aid. She said: First, on the level playing field: our aim is simply to ensure fair competition on our own market, very simple. This is why we need to establish robust mechanisms. The architecture we’re working on rests on two pillars: state aid and standards. On state aid we have made progress, based on common principles, guarantees of domestic enforcement, and the possibility to autonomously remedy the situation where needed. She said there had been “a big step forward” on standards. On standards we have agreed a strong mechanism of non-regression: that’s a big step forward. That’s to ensure that our common high labour, social, and environmental standards will not be undercut. Of course, difficulties still remain on the question of how to really future-proof fair competition. She said “issues linked to governance by now are largely being resolved”. But she said disagreement about fisheries could still prevent a deal being agreed. She said: On fisheries the discussion is still very difficult. We do not question the UK’s sovereignty on its own waters, but we ask for predictability and stability for our fishermen and fisherwomen. In all honesty it sometimes feels like we will not be able to resolve this question, but we must continue to try and find a solution, and it is the only responsible and right course of action. She said the next few days would be decisive. The next days are going to be decisive, and I know I have said this before, and I know deadlines have been missed time and again. The clock puts us all in a very difficult situation, not least this parliament and its right to exercise democratic scrutiny and application. Good morning. Ursula von der Leyen, the European commission president, has been addressing the European parliament this morning and she was notably positive about the prospects of the UK and the EU agreeing a trade deal. There was a “path to an agreement”, she said. She told them: As things stand I cannot tell you whether there will be a deal or not, but I can tell you that there is a path to an agreement now. The path may be very narrow, but it is there, and it is therefore our responsibility to continue trying. The good news is that we have found a way forward on most issues, but this is now case of us being so close and yet being so far away from each other, because two issues now remain outstanding, you know them: the level playing field and the fisheries. I will post more from her speech shortly. The Independent’s Jon Stone has posted the full quotes on Twitter. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS is due to publish figures on the prevalence of long Covid. Morning: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, resumes a call with the leader of the devolved administrations about the rules for Christmas. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.15pm: Dr Andrew Goodall, chief executive of NHS Wales, and Judith Paget, chief executive of Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, hold a Welsh government coronavirus briefing. 12.15pm: Nicola Sturgeon holds her regular Scottish government coronavirus briefing. Ministers are also meeting today to review the tiering arrangements for England. We may get an announcement about any changes, although it could be delayed until tomorrow. Politics Live is now doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, like Brexit, and when they seem more important or more interesting, they will take precedence. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow."

          "headline": "Ditching Jenrick's 'mutant algorithm' is a win for localism",
          "bodyText": "Planning secretary Robert Jenrick’s climbdown over his planning white paper is welcome. Its core proposal for houses to be built according to a Whitehall formula – the so-called “mutant algorithm” – emerged in August reputedly at the bidding of the building lobby, eager to boost their development land-banks in the south-east. It has collapsed under a barrage of protest from southern Tory constituencies that faced being concreted over and northern cities that Jenrick was going to starve of housing subsidies. The reality of modern Britain is that the local is fighting back. It is no longer unusual for provincial counties and towns to be mentioned on the BBC. In one hour I recently heard Manchester, Leicester, Stratford, Hereford and Kent all demanding freedom to fix their own lockdown strategies. Others have sought to regulate their own schools or distribute their own furlough grants. But nothing has evoked greater fury than Jenrick’s stripping local councils of planning powers. The Jenrick formula demanded that every community in England build a precise number of houses dictated by Whitehall, irrespective of local wishes. It was rumoured to be rooted in the medieval principle that a “local need” for housing was determined by local births, marriages, divorces and deaths, as if today’s population did not travel. This was then adjusted by price to yield a “need” figure. The bias towards development in the south-east was massive. It decided house-building should decline by 28% in the north-east but rise by 633% in Kensington. Horsham was told to cram its entire past century of growth into the next 10 years. I am not aware of any country in the world, except possibly China, with so arithmetically top-down a plan. It would have made Lenin blush. Such an idea would not have passed first base under most prime ministers, if only for its political ineptitude. Policy to Boris Johnson is a matter of slogans. He appears not to have noticed that his cry of ““build, build, build” now contradicted his cry of “we must level-up the north”. Nor did he notice that he had opposed 514 homes in his own south-east constituency, including a 12-storey tower that he called “wholly out of character for the locality”. This was laughable, given his tower infatuation as London mayor. Jenrick now has two tasks. He has promised to bring some sanity to his housing formula. He would do better to scrap it altogether. Local people can best judge whether and where they want their communities to grow, and there is no evidence they automatically oppose it. Besides, they have some collective rights to decide such matters in a democracy. Subsidies should then be concentrated – as Jenrick now proposes – on the renewal of brownfield land especially outside the south- east. He should honour Johnson’s levelling up. He should worry less about his developers and look at the scandal of empty sites, under-occupancy and housing vacancy. The luxury towers, many foreign owned, that now line the Thames in London are reportedly half empty, but they will doubtless contribute to Jenrick’s 300,000 new “homes”. For most people a home implies a place someone lives, not a shell. Britain’s housing policy is chaotic. The rental sector requires urgent review. Property taxes are too low, renting is too insecure, but at the same time incentives to sublet empty space are inadequate. It is absurd that repairs and conversions attract full VAT while new-build is VAT-free. If Jenrick is bereft of good advice, ask the Germans or the Dutch. As for the future of British planning, it is still up for grabs. The reason for the most drastic reform of British planning in half a century was Jenrick’s allegation that “it takes an average of five years for a standard housing development to go through the planning system”. This developers’ gossip is simply untrue. The BBC’s Reality Check could find only five big developments that had taken that long, while Whitehall’s own figures showed that 89% of major applications were decided “within 13 weeks or the agreed time”. Delay was usually caused by developers themselves going to lengthy appeal. As for landscape conservation, the August white paper implied that, subject to central targets, areas of rural land could still be declared “protected”. The paper nowhere defined what should qualify. Meanwhile, outside these protected areas, almost any building is to be permitted without so much as planning permission. This is like arming the police and allowing them to shoot on sight. Most protests at the new system have pointed out that the current system is not broken, except insofar as it allows builders to build land banks against rising prices. This is already rampant. The CPRE claims land for 1.3m homes is lying idle, with permits already in place for more than half a million of them. A planning lawyer of my acquaintance considers the dropped proposals so vague that, far from Johnson’s “build, build, build”, they would have meant the opposite, “a lawyer’s paradise”. All is not bad. There is virtue in the white paper’s concept of zoning for different degrees of development. There is virtue too in its design code and calls for “more beauty”, though not a whisper about who should enforce it if at all. What is unarguable is that planning matters to the entire appearance of Britain. Bruised and abused over the decades, that appearance remains each generation’s lasting legacy to the next. Bad planning is for all time. Jenrick has spent the past year playing with dynamite. The former Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt accused him of nothing less than undermining local democracy. Now his humiliation of local government has exploded in his face. It shows that two can play at another Johnson slogan – “Take back control”. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "The world wasn’t prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic – and it still isn’t. Critical shortages of personal protective equipment and ventilators continue to put medical professionals and patients at unnecessary risk. Meanwhile, long wait times for test results contribute to viral spread. Yet throughout this year, promising scientific innovations have been developed that could help reduce deaths until everyone can get the vaccine. So why aren’t they available? A Covid test on your smartphone In late September, researchers at MIT announced that they had developed an algorithm that can accurately detect Covid-19 infections over the phone. When participants in their study produced a forced cough, MIT said their AI algorithm successfully detected 98.5% of Covid-19 infections with patients who have a cough and 100% of asymptomatic cases. If released in the form of an app, the technology could mean instant Covid-19 testing anytime, any place. As they wrote in their peer-reviewed article: “AI techniques can produce a free, non-invasive, real-time, anytime, instantly distributable, large-scale Covid-19 asymptomatic screening tool to augment current approaches in containing the spread of Covid-19. Practical use cases could be for daily screening of students, workers and public as schools, jobs and transport reopen, or for pool testing to quickly alert of outbreaks in groups.” The impact of this technology would be huge. Currently, test results can take a week to be processed. Testing delays and shortages are due to things like strains on the supply chain providing swabs and chemicals, as well as the pressures on lab technicians processing high volumes of tests. And the test only tells you if you were positive at the time, not whether you are positive now, which can lead to a false sense of security. A smartphone-based, instant Covid-19 test would be a game changer and would save countless lives. The developers say they intend to make the technology available as an app, pending regulatory approval, but there is no clear timeline for when it might be released to the public. (The team did not respond to a request for comment.) A reusable N95 mask We are all aware of the severe shortage of N95 masks – the gold standard mask for protecting people from viruses like Covid-19 – which have led to countless doctors and nurses dying because of a lack of personal protective equipment. The reason for the shortage? Strain on the supply chain producing the melt-blown masks that relies on expensive equipment to produce. In July, a group of researchers from MIT and Brigham and Women’s hospital received a flurry of media attention for their invention of a reusable, silicone-based N95 mask able to withstand repeated sterilization with high temperatures and bleach, making it ideal for hospital settings. This mask, which requires much less material than the standard N95 mask, could be easily manufactured in the United States. And, unlike the standard N95s, could be reused 100 times. (By the end of 2020, 3M will have manufactured 2bn N95 respirators to meet need, which will only worsen our plastic pollution crisis. A reusable mask would help avoid the mountain of waste that could end up in our oceans or our air after incineration.) According to Adam Wentworth, a research engineer working on the mask, they are still fundraising to create the final prototype. Whenever the fundraising is complete – there is no fixed deadline – they would have to submit it for approval by the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. This is a process that could take around six months, even with emergency prioritization. At this point, a Covid-19 vaccine is projected to become widely available before the mask does. By time it does. the pandemic may likely be over. Sewage testing for early-detection We know that people infected with Covid may carry the virus asymptomatically for two weeks before realizing they are sick. That means early detection methods are essential to mitigating spread. In May, Stat News, a medical news site, reported that testing sewage provided a promising way to detect Covid-19 cases a week early. And shortly after, Germany, Finland and the Netherlands announced they would start sewage surveillance as a way to spot Covid-19 cases. Senator Dianne Feinstein in July urged the Department of Health and Human Services to implement this technology on a national scale; however, adoption in the US has been slow. Several universities, including MIT, are already using wastewater testing to stay ahead of outbreaks on campus – the method helped successfully stem an outbreak at a University of Arizona dorm in August – but most communities are still not benefiting from a simple and effective early-detection tool that is proven to work. We know that we are entering the deadliest phase of the pandemic, with cases and fatalities exceeding previous peaks in the spring. With vaccines now being rolled out in the UK, China, Russia and other countries at record speed, the question is whether any of these technologies will be employed when they are most critical – namely now – or whether they will become widespread only as we emerge out of this global pandemic. One hopes that “warp speed” might not be limited to the vaccine but other technologies, too. But it doesn’t look promising. Adrienne Matei is a freelancer writer"

          "bodyText": "It’s just 10 days until Christmas and we are still none the wiser about almost anything to do with the coronavirus restrictions or Brexit. But then in the Commons we had two cabinet ministers whose sole purpose is to know nothing. And, what’s more, they are proud of it. You might have thought their sense of futility would have kicked in by now, but I guess they both still get a thrill out of playing with the electric windows in their shiny ministerial limos. First up was Alok Sharma, secretary of state for business, energy and industrial strategy, at departmental questions. Which is in itself an oxymoron as Sharma, one of the nicer ministers you could hope to meet, has never knowingly given a direct answer to anything. And today was no exception, as he had clearly decided, after waffling on for a few minutes about green energy that might happen in 2030 at the earliest, to give himself a break and let his junior ministers do most of the heavy lifting on Covid payouts and companies, such as British Airways, firing and rehiring employees. Sharma’s only vaguely tricky moment came when Ed Miliband, Labour’s shadow business minister, observed that the hospitality industry had been left totally unsupported now that 60% of the country was in tier 3. This seemed to take Sharma completely by surprise and all he could say was that the government had gone the extra mile to help them. The problem was that many pubs and restaurants had been too conscientious about making their premises Covid secure, which obviously counted against them as currently the government seems to be running a complicated algorithm where the worse you are at your job, the more money you get. Hence Dominic Cummings’s 40% pay rise. For his second question, Miliband moved on to Brexit. There were over 150,000 firms who still didn’t know what forms they would have to fill out in the new year because no one had a clue what the rules were. Other than that all lorries would have to be kept waiting for hours in an unfinished lorry park. This, too, came as a surprise to Sharma who now sounded like he was auditioning for an episode of Pointless Celebrities. “Businesses just want us to do our best,” he said hopefully, before sidestepping any details of what the government’s various options might entail. Because deep down in his subconscious, he has this gnawing feeling that in a few months time the shit will really hit the fan whatever deal or no deal is reached. Just as well no one has got round to telling him that the French are planning to blockade Calais. Still, Sharma comes across as an intellectual heavyweight compared to culture secretary, Oliver Dowden – a man with the hunted look of Foxton’s worst-performing estate agent, who was finally giving a statement, two years after it was promised, of what might appear in the government’s online harms bill. If and when it actually emerges as a white paper sometime next year. The statement was a mirror image of Dowden’s own psyche. Long on “ground-breaking” waffle but short of any real clarity. That something needs to be done about illegal content, disinformation and cyberbullying is not in doubt; it’s Oliver’s ability to deliver it that is the issue. Labour’s shadow culture secretary, Jo Stevens, made little effort to conceal her sense of she’ll believe it when she sees it. Dowden looked devastated by the lack of enthusiasm – he really was giving it 110% – and was close to tears, before some colleagues reassured him they were certain it would be a very, very good bill if it ever happened. There was rather more action away from Westminster, with the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal, stepping in to fill the indecision at the heart of government with a joint editorial begging Boris Johnson to rethink his plans to turn Christmas into a five-day free for all. Something which Keir Starmer was quick to follow up with his own letter to the prime minister, in which he pointed out the second round of tiering was going no better than the first and that it could be a good time to rethink the idea of hoping everyone would automatically behave sensibly over Xmas. And yes, he knew Boris had made a promise but people had long since stopped expecting him to keep promises. Up in Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon was making her own coronavirus statement to the Scottish parliament. While the main body of her speech was on the new variant of the virus – thanks for nothing 2020 – and on the moving of three regions up to tier 3, most MSPs were waiting to see if the first minister would go rogue and unilaterally declare the Christmas amnesty null and void. In the past, Sturgeon has not been afraid to go it alone by bringing in restrictions before the other countries of the UK, but this time she was content to hold fire. For the time being, at any rate. Sturgeon was the iron fist in the velvet glove, saying she was happy to work with all four nations but careful not to rule out the possibility of a change of course. It sounded very much like she would be leaning heavily on Michael Gove to have a rethink during their phone call later in the day. So we ended the day as we had started, with no one much the wiser. The government appears paralysed over Christmas. And in the absence of Boris yet to announce the Plan B we all know is probably coming, it looks like a wise move for the rest of us to make our own alternative arrangements."

          "headline": "UK coronavirus: four-nations Christmas talks to continue tomorrow amid concern over easing of rules - as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, has been chairing a meeting with leaders from the devolved administrations to discuss whether to change the special Covid rules agreed for Christmas. According to ITV Cymru’s Adrian Masters, another meeting is planned for tomorrow. And ITV’s Paul Brand says no decision has yet been taken. PA Media also report talks are expected to resume on Wednesday. A Welsh government spokesman said: “The leaders of the devolved administrations and Michael Gove met this evening to discuss the arrangements over the Christmas period. They will reconvene tomorrow to confirm the position.” The meeting was scheduled as the UK government came under increasing pressure to tighten the rules for the holiday period. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said Boris Johnson should order a rethink because taking the wrong decision now could have “severe” consequences. (See 1pm.) Two leading medical journals, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal, said allowing up to three household to mix over Christmas, as planned, would be a “major error that will cost many lives”. (See 10.45am.) Before this afternoon’s meeting chaired by Gove, Downing Street said the rules were being kept under constant review. Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, told MSPs that her government was considering whether the proposed rules should be tightened in the light of the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus, nine cases of which have been discovered in Scotland. (See 3.06pm.) But Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, told MSs (members of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament) that he was concerned that not allowing an easing of restrictions at Christmas could lead to a “free-for-all”. (See 2.28pm.) A YouGov poll suggests people think the government should abandon plans to relax the restrictions over Christmas by almost two to one. (See 5.30pm.) The London borough of Greenwich has been forced to back down over plans to close its schools early and switch to online learning following legal action by the government, which later revealed plans for mass testing in secondary schools across England from January. Fresh festive food worth millions of pounds – including whole turkeys, lobsters and truffles – could be heading for the bin as restaurants and bars in London and parts of the south-east move into tier 3 coronavirus restrictions from midnight. Pre-existing social inequalities contributed to the UK recording the highest death rates from Covid in Europe, a leading authority on public health has said, warning that many children’s lives would be permanently blighted if the problem is not tackled. The Bank of England has written to UK bank bosses telling them to review their exposure to losses that could emerge from businesses hardest-hit by Covid-19, as part of efforts to head off potential risks to the financial system. Boris Johnson wasted thousands of pounds of public money by ignoring formal advice to pay off a special adviser who was escorted out of Downing Street following a clash with Dominic Cummings. Dominic Cummings was handed a pay rise of at least £40,000 for his role as the prime minister’s top adviser, new figures suggest. The economic recovery from the Covid-driven recession will be hampered by a post-Brexit shortage of key workers including nursing assistants, senior care workers and dental nurses, the UK government’s migration advisers have warned. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. Education unions have objected to the suggestion that teachers should be involved in administering the lateral flow tests (or rapid result tests) being rolled out in all secondary schools in England from January. (See 12.26pm.) In its announcement the Department for Education said that, although staff would not have to give up time over the holidays to learn how to use the new tests, “existing staff meetings or inset days can be used for training as appropriate”. Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said that although these tests could be “potentially helpful”, they were “not a panacea”. In a statement he went on: The NASUWT will be seeking urgent further clarification from the DfE about how these tests are to be administered and by whom. The NASUWT is clear that it is not the responsibility of teachers or school leaders to undertake testing of pupils or employees and will be expecting the government to confirm that it does not expect teaching staff to carry out this work. And Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers union, said in a statement that the government should consider getting volunteers to administer the tests, not teachers. He said: Removing school staff from the classroom and retraining them to administer clinical tests is a deeply flawed proposal. Schools and parents alike will want every education professional focused on supporting pupils to catch-up on lost learning throughout the spring term. The government must look at alternatives to asking school staff to administer these tests. One solution could be to use the volunteers who signed up earlier in the year to support the NHS. They could be trained, accredited and insured and then sent in to support schools. This could then be expanded further if it was seen to be successful. According to new polling by YouGov, by a margin of almost two to one people think the government should abandon plans to relax Covid restrictions over Christmas. Some 57% of people said there should be no special arrangements for Christmas, while 31% said the rules should be loosened for five days over Christmas as planned. This is broadly in line with the findings of an Ipsos MORI poll on the same topic (see 3.55pm), although YouGov, which posed the question in a different format, found even less support for the Christmas mixing plan drawn up by the four nations of the UK. According to YouGov, support for tougher rules over Christmas than currently allowed is relatively consistent across region, class and gender. Labour supporters are more in favour of maintaining restrictions at Christmas than Conservatives, YouGov found. And Lib Dem supporters are most in favour (making them, on this, the most illiberal). According to the YouGov figures, opinion is most likely to vary by age. But even among 25 to 49-year-olds, the age group most in favour of relaxing the rules at Christmas, only 38% back the government plan, and 49% think it would be better to continue with the current, tougher rules over the holiday. All of this supports a theory my colleague John Harris floated on Twitter earlier. Huge disparities in the amount of classroom time pupils have received across England since schools re-opened in September have been revealed for the first time by stark new figures on school attendance. Attendance ranged from 37% in the Midlands borough of Sandwell to 92% in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, during one week alone, according to the first breakdown of missed school days by council area. The 10 boroughs in England where children’s education has been most disrupted since schools re-opened following six months of lockdown are all areas where deprivation is worse than the national average. In Oldham, one of the worst-hit areas, one headteacher said “self harm has gone through the roof” after almost 200 Year 11s missed five weeks of learning. Concern that schools in the worst-hit local areas are getting a “quadruple hit” was voiced by the children’s commissioner, Anne Longfield, who said that disruption to attendance and increased pandemic costs came on top of existing poorer educational outcomes and deprivation. The UK-wide coronavirus death toll has passed 81,000. The total number of Covid-related deaths across the UK as per the three statistical agencies, the ONS, National Records for Scotland and NISRA, which count all deaths where Covid is mentioned on the death certificate, now stands at 78,256. A further 3,031 deaths have occurred since these agencies last reported, bringing the overall Covid death toll across the UK since the pandemic began to 81,287. The figure is higher than the government’s Covid death toll of 64,908. The latter figure only covers people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. The UK government has updated its coronavirus dashboard. Here are the key figures. The UK has recorded 18,450 further cases. That is below yesterday’s total (20,263), but well above the daily total for a week ago today (12,282). Over the last seven days there have been 137,876 positive cases - a 29% increase on the total for the previous week, even though the number of tests being carried out has only increased 5.5% week on week. Hospital admissions are also going up. The most recent UK figure is for last Friday, when there were 1,637 admissions, and at that point week-on-week admissions were up 15%. The UK has recorded 506 further deaths. That is more than double the total for yesterday (232) but less than the total for a week ago today (616). Over the last seven days there have been 2,874 deaths - 4% down on the total for the previous week. NHS England has recorded 293 further coronavirus hospital deaths. There were 75 in the north-east and Yorkshire, 63 in the Midlands, 55 in the north-west, 35 in the south-east, 31 in London, 21 in the south-west and 13 in the east of England. The details are here. A week ago today the equivalent figure was 325. Despite the soaring rates of Covid-19 in Wales, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said 16% of acute beds in the Welsh NHS are not occupied. He said physical capacity was “stretched” but not to breaking point. But he has said the most pressing problem is staff numbers with 1,500 more NHS workers off than in September – the reason why some non-urgent operations are being postponed. “We simply don’t have staff in place to keep everything the health service wants to do going,” he said. Drakeford did not say whether he would take up the UK government’s offer to treat some non-Covid patients in England. (See 12.45pm.) Asked about the offer at first minister’s questions he said a mutual aid system had operated through the Covid crisis, which included Wales sending 11m items of PPE to England. This blog often starts in the morning with quotes from whichever minister was put up by No 10 to do the morning broadcast interview round. As my colleague Peter Walker reports, it’s almost never a woman. The chair of the exams regulator in England, Roger Taylor, is to stand down at the end of the year after what he described as “a very difficult summer”. Taylor was at the centre of the furore that followed the summer exams fiasco, and saw the government abandon GCSEs and A-level grades determined by Ofqual’s algorithm, in favour of school-assessed grades. As a blame-game got under way, the Guardian revealed that Taylor issued an ultimatum threatening to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, gave the exams regulator his full backing. While Taylor stayed on in the immediate aftermath, Ofqual’s chief regulator Sally Collier resigned soon after results were published in August. Announcing his resignation, Taylor said: After what has been a very difficult summer, I am leaving the organisation in good shape and in good hands. We have put in place measures for young people sitting exams in 2021 which represent the best approach in these difficult times. Taylor, who has been Ofqual chair since 2016, will be replaced temporarily by an interim chair, Ian Bauckham, who has been on the Ofqual board since 2018. If ministers from the UK government and the devolved administrations do decide to tighten the rules over Christmas, they will encounter little public opposition, a poll for Ipsos MORI (pdf) suggests. It says that while 39% of people think the Christmas rules are “about right”, 49% think they are “not strict enough”. Only 10% says they are “too strict”. Labour supporters (56%) are significantly more likely to say the rules should be stricter than Conservatives (41%). This is from Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, on Dominic Cummings’ huge pay rise when he worked for No 10. (See 3.34pm.) She said: Boris Johnson defended Dominic Cummings when he broke lockdown rules - then awarded him a £50,000 pay rise. Yet he’s freezing pay for key workers and refusing to give our care workers a pay rise to the living wage. Cummings’ bumper bonus is an insult to key workers denied the pay rise they deserve. It’s another example of how under this government it is one rule for the Tory Party and their friends and another for the rest of us. Dominic Cummings was handed a pay rise of at least £40,000 for his role as the prime minister’s top adviser, new figures suggest. Cummings – whose trip to Durham during the height of the first national Covid-19 lockdown prompted an outcry – was paid between £95,000-£99,999 in 2019 but a report reveals his pay packet was bumped up to £140,000-£144,999 this year. The disclosure is included in the publication of a Cabinet Office report (pdf) which details the £9.6m total cost – including salary, national insurance and pension contributions – for 102 government special advisers – referred to in Westminster as Spads – from April 2019 to March 2020. Last month, it emerged that Cummings was leaving his No 10 post, as was his ally, the communications chief, Lee Cain. The Cabinet Office report states: “Lee Cain and Dominic Cummings are in the process of leaving their government posts and are not included in the above list. They are, however, included in the December FTE numbers. Both individuals were in PB4 and pay band £140,000-£144,999.” Meanwhile, the newly appointed No 10 press secretary, Allegra Stratton, who will be fronting televised Downing Street briefings next year, earns between £125,000 and £129,999, according to the report. In her statement to the Scottish parliament, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said that the rise in Covid cases, which is currently less severe in Scotland than parts of England and Wales, but also news about the new variant, made this afternoon’s four nations call about the Christmas rules “sensible”. She went on: I’m not going into it with a fixed view because I think it’s important we have that discussion across the four nations given family patterns across the UK, but I do think there is a case for us looking at whether we tighten the flexibilities that were given any further both in terms of duration and numbers of people meeting. She said that it would be preferable to come to a four nations agreement but said that, if that were not possible, “of course we would consider within the Scottish government what we think is appropriate”. Here is a summary of the main points in Nicola Sturgeon’s statement to MSPs about coronavirus. Sturgeon said the Scottish government was considering tightening the rules covering Christmas. (See 2.42pm.) She said nine cases of the new variant of the coronavirus had been discovered in Scotland, all in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. She announced the results of the latest review of the Covid levels. All 18 areas in level 3 would remain in level 3, she said. East Lothian, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire will move from level 2 to level 3, she said. Other areas in level 2 would stay there, she said, although she warned that Angus and Falkirk could return to level 3. She also said that the household mixing rules for Argyll &amp; Bute would be changed, so that the outer Argyll islands will covered by the same rules as other islands, and people on these islands will be allowed to meet in homes in groups of up to six, from a maximum of two homes. The full local protection levels are here. She said that, although this had been planned as the last review of what areas were in what levels before Christmas - in light of “volatile” case numbers in some areas - there will be another review next Tuesday. She said over the next two weeks the government would consider whether to change the restrictions that apply at each level. The conclusions would be announced after Christmas, she said. She announced the daily coronavirus statistics. There have been 845 new cases (which is 7.4% of tests carried out; there are 996 people in hospital, down 16 from the previous day; and there have been 24 further deaths. She said the Scottish government would publish its first weekly progress report on the vaccination programme tomorrow. In Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, has just told MSPs that her government is considering whether any “additional precautions are necessary” over Christmas in the light of what has emerged about the new variant of the coronavirus, which may be causing the virus to spread more quickly. She said she would be discussing this with the other four nation governments in a call this afternoon which she said she requested yesterday. A senior source at a London hospital trust expressed astonishment that the government was planning to relax the rules for Christmas and warned it would lead to “disaster”. The senior executive said: I know I may come across as a Scrooge when I say this but if we relax the rules, it will hurt badly. Travelling and mixing households are the right ingredients for disaster. We are already seeing the figures rising in London, things are already looking quite bad. Relaxing the rules will only make it worse. London will move into Tier 3 restrictions at midnight tonight. Hospitals will inevitably have to cancel surgery if the five-day Christmas release from the rules leads to even more beds filling up with people who have got Covid as a direct result of the temporarily permitted mingling, the executive added. We are doing our very best to keep all our services open but if we get more Covid-19 cases we may have to shut down some services again and this will be to the detriment of the country. I would like to see a more rational approach. These comments reflect widespread and mounting anxiety and alarm among hospital bosses that the Christmas plan is misguided and could leave hospitals struggling in January and February - which are usually their busiest months anyway - to cope with a new influx of Covid patients. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said harm will be done whether the four-nation Christmas arrangements are kept as they are or changed. Speaking in the Welsh parliament, he said: I will be discussing with Michael Gove whether the four nation agreement that we struck continues to have marginally more advantages than disadvantages or whether there is a different balance that we ought to strike. In either direction harm is done. The four nation agreement over Christmas was hammered out in detail over four meetings between the nations. It was a hard-won agreement. I will not lightly put it aside. The choice is a grim one. I have read in my own email account heart-rending pleas from people not to reverse what we have agreed for Christmas. People who live entirely alone who have made arrangements to be with people for the first time in months and who say to me this is the only thing they have been able to look forward to. Yet we know that if people do not use the modest amount of additional freedom responsibly then we will see an impact on our already hugely hard-pressed health service. The choice is an incredibly difficult one. At the moment we have a four nation agreement. We will look at the figures again together. Drakeford seemed to still be backing the four-nations arrangement. He said: Modestly increased amount of freedom for people is preferable to a free-for-all in which we see a situation in which people aren’t willing to go along with what is proposed. Whichever way the governments of the UK resolve this issue it will be a very finely balanced set of judgements between different sets of harms. On Sky News Sam Coates, its deputy political editor, produced a useful list of the options available to Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, as they consider whether or not to rethink the rules for mixing over Christmas. He suggested there were five options. 1) Sticking with the rules as they are, but toughening up the advice that people should exercise restraint - and do less mixing than is allowed if they can. 2) Shortening the window during which mixing is allowed from its current five days. 3) Reducing the number of households allowed to mix from three to two. 4) Maintaining the mixing rules, but telling people not to travel outside their region. 5) Moving the holiday entirely to a different time of the year. The final idea seems the most unlikely, although it has been floated on social media. At the Downing Street lobby briefing, in response to questions about the the joint BMJ/HSJ editorial (see 10.45am), the prime minister’s spokesman said that the advice being given to people about mixing at Christmas was being kept under review. He said: We have set out the guidance for the Christmas bubbling arrangements. But ... we obviously keep all advice under constant review. In Whitehall-speak, when it is said a policy is being kept under review, that can mean anything from ‘We have no intention to change the policy at all, but we just want to sound reasonable’ to ‘There’s a U-turn coming shortly’. The spokesman’s comment at the briefing sounded a bit closer to the later than the former, but it was hard to be sure. According to PA Media, Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, will discuss the Christmas rules with the leaders of the devolved administrations later this afternoon. Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the Commons health committee, has just told Radio 4’s World at One that the government should listen “very, very carefully” to the arguments made in the joint BMJ/HSJ editorial saying the government should abandon plans to allow social mixing over Christmas. (See 10.45am.) He said: To go into the start of January, which I remember from my own time as health secretary is always the nightmare period for the NHS, with the same number of beds taken up by Covid as was the case in the peak of this April, would be a very, very dangerous and precarious situation. But, when asked if he was saying that Boris Johnson should definitely change the rules now for Christmas, Hunt just said that he would say do this if Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, called for it. But he admitted that he did not know what advice they were giving. At the No 10 press conference on Monday, Whitty admitted that Christmas was a period of greater risk, but he defended the four-nation rules, saying they sought to strike a balance between minimising risk and accommodating people’s desire to see relatives. The eye-catching fines proposed by the government’s new online harms bill, which could be as high as £5bn for a company the size of Facebook, led the headlines, but the detail of the legislation has left some concerned that it could have unintended consequences. The legislation, which is being presented before the House of Commons today, explicitly excludes journalism from its coverage – a point that had concerned some news organisations who worried that the presence of comment sections on their websites could leave them open to swingeing fines. But it provides no such shield for news outlets acting off-platform, on Facebook, Twitter or other social networks. There, the platforms could face fines if they fail to censor news articles, Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group, warned. He said: Once news content is posted to social media, it will not be possible to separate commentary from the news content. If commentary is censored, or circulation reduced, then the same is true for the news content. It seems unlikely that a solution can be found. Once the door is open to regulate online speech through a state regulator, it is only a matter of time before the same question opens regarding the press. Killock also flagged another sort of mission-creep in the bill: social networks have no indemnity for content which is shared in encrypted channels that they cannot monitor. That raises the prospect of WhatsApp facing the decision of either turning off its encryption in order to moderate conversations, or pulling out of the UK entirely – and the company has hinted it would prefer the latter if it came down to it. Encrypted communications have been a frustration for the Home Office ever since the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which theoretically gave the government the power to compel decryption – a power that it has not yet used, for fear of triggering a standoff it may not win. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has welcomed the decision to roll out rapid result tests in all secondary schools in England from January. (See 12.26pm.) He said: Alongside council leaders, I’ve been calling for this to stop the virus spreading and to save lives. Despite the efforts of teachers and school staff, we’ve seen a worrying rise in cases among young people. This will help keep education open safely in the new year. Labour has called on the government to rethink its decision to allow households to mix over five days at Christmas, saying the consequences could be unthinkable. In a letter to the prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer urged Boris Johnson to convene Cobra, the government’s emergency committee, and said Labour would support the government if they were to change the rules. “This is a critical moment for our country. The failure of your tiered system to control the virus leaves us with precious little headroom,” Starmer wrote. “Put simply, if you take the wrong decision now, the ramifications for our NHS and our economy in the new year could be severe.” Here are extracts from the letter. It has become increasingly clear over recent days that the tier system you introduced two weeks ago has failed to control transmission of Covid-19. Sadly, it does now appear that the government has - once again - lost control of infections, putting our economy and our NHS at grave risk in the new year ... I welcomed the fact that the government had sought a four-nation approach on the arrangements over the Christmas period. I understand that people want to spend time with their families after this awful year, but the situation has clearly taken a turn for the worse since the decision about Christmas was taken. It serves no-one for politicians to ignore this fact. It is my view that you should now convene Cobra in the next 24 hours to review whether the current relaxation is appropriate given the rising number of cases. If you conclude with government scientists that we need to take tougher action to keep people safe over Christmas, then you will have my support. Any further tightening of restrictions will obviously be deeply disappointing to many across the country. Many will have already started planning for Christmas and would have held on to the prospect of a happy day with family and loved ones to get us through these tough months. But the public do not want false reassurance, warm words or ducked challenges from their prime minister. They want leadership. This is a critical moment for our country. The tiered system has not kept the virus under control and has left us with precious little headroom. Put simply, if you take the wrong decision now, the ramifications for our NHS and our economy in the new year could be severe. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and Simon Hart, the Welsh secretary, have written a joint letter to Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, offering to treat patients needing non-urgent operations in England. They have made this offer because some health boards in Wales are considering postponing these procedures because of the pandemic. Sky’s Sam Coates has the letter. An academy chief accused of a deliberate strategy of exclusions has been challenged by MPs on her fitness to be the new children’s commissioner, with the Tory chair of the Commons education committee expressing concern that she owed her success to a “survival of the fittest” tactic. Grilled by MPs ahead of taking up the watchdog role next year, Dame Rachel de Souza insisted that her experience of dealing with high rates of exclusions “and putting them right” made her the right person for the job. She added meanwhile that she would have strongly sympathised with the view that it should have been compulsory for disadvantaged children to be enrolled in schools during the first lockdown. “Thinking of how hard people worked for compulsory education in the 1980s, to see schools closed in my lifetime is, I think, an absolute disaster,” said De Souza. On low attendance rates among vulnerable children during the first lockdown, she added that “a bit of me would have loved it to be compulsory.” The founding chief executive of the Inspiration Trust, which runs 14 academies in East Anglia, has been criticised over high numbers of permanent exclusions in the past. There were 21 fixed-period exclusions at the trust’s eight secondary schools for every 100 pupils last year, a figure double the national average. Robert Halfon, the committee chair, asked how she could reconcile that track record with the commissioner’s role of being a champion for disadvantaged children and those with special needs, who were more likely to be excluded. He told her: I just have a worry that you have had great success ... but it’s also that it’s been about survival of the fittest. De Souza said she would embrace the role, adding that her trust had pulled together and achieved a position of “zero exclusions”. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has announced that every secondary school and college in England will be able to use later flow tests (the ones that deliver rapid results) from January to test pupils and staff. In a news release the Department for Education says: Building on the success of testing pilots in schools and colleges over the past few months, from January all staff in secondary schools and colleges will be eligible for weekly rapid tests as part of an initial rollout. Students will be eligible for daily testing for seven days if they are identified as a close contact of someone who has tested positive. Under current guidelines, up to a whole school bubble has to self-isolate if one student or staff member tests positive. From January, those in the same bubble not need to self-isolate if they agree to be tested once a day. This will improve attendance and ensure young people can benefit from face-to-face teaching as much as possible. Staff will also be eligible for daily testing if they are identified as a close contact. Roughly one in three people have the virus without symptoms so could be spreading the disease unknowingly. Asymptomatic testing helps to identify positive cases more quickly, and break chains of transmission. Special needs schools will also get the tests. Testing will then be rolled out for primary schools “as quickly as possible over the spring term”, the department said. Williamson said this was “a milestone moment” for schools. He said: Testing on this scale brings real benefits to education, it means more children, teachers and staff can stay in their classes in schools and colleges without the need to self-isolate. The department said “guidance, training materials and webinars” would shortly be made available for schools, so they know how to use the tests, and test kits will start arriving in schools and colleges in the first week of January. It also said that staff or pupils who do not want to undergo daily tests because they have been identified as a close contact of someone testing positive will be able to self-isolate instead, as now. The department says pilots of this system had shown that it enabled staff and pupils who would otherwise have had to self-isolate to remain in school. School staff will not be expected to work on the new arrangements over the Christmas holidays, the department said, and schools will be reimbursed for “reasonable administrative costs such as staff time”. The prevalence of coronavirus in some parts of England, including London, began to rise in late November, data reveals, suggesting people started to relax their guard before the second lockdown ended. The React-1 study, which is based on swab tests from randomly selected people across the 315 local authority areas in England, has been carried out every month since May, with the latest results – round seven – based on swabs taken from almost 170,000 people between 13 November and 3 December. Interim results, for 13-24 November showed a national prevalence of 96 people per 10,000 – about 30% lower than between 26 October to 2 November, when 132 per 10,000 people were thought to have Covid. But such gains appear to be eroding: the team found the sharp decline was no longer present in the second half of the latest round, covering 25 November and 3 December. “What we’ve seen here is a levelling off [at a national level],” said Prof Steven Riley, professor of Infectious Disease Dynamics at Imperial College London and a co-author of the study. However the national mixture marks geographical differences: while prevalence fell across England between round 6 and the first half of round 7, albeit to a greater extent in the north than the south, it did not continue to decline in all parts of the country. Instead prevalence began to rise towards the end of lockdown in some areas, including parts of London . “We do know from mobility data that things picked up over that latter period,” said Prof Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme, and chair in Epidemiology and Public Health Medicine at Imperial College London. “We know how the virus is transmitted, it is more contact – more close contacts – which cause that rise in transmission.” The results are likely to be of particular concern, given that Christmas is just a couple of weeks away – a time that often involves mixing between generations within families. “I think people do understand they are taking a risk [if they mix],” said Riley. “What these data show is the risk they are taking has increased.” Boris Johnson has announced that he is visiting India in January. It is his first major overseas visit since becoming prime minister 17 months ago (there have been Brexit and Covid) and he will become only the second British PM to attend India’s annual Republic Day parade in New Delhi. The first was John Major in 1993. In the No 10 news release, Downing Street also confirms that India has been invited to attend the G7 summit that Johnson will host next year, along with South Korea and Australia. This is from my colleague Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor. Yesterday Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, took legal action to stop Greenwich council in London closing schools early ahead of the Christmas holidays. Sally Weale and Ben Quinn covered the story last night. Danny Thorpe, the Labour leader of Greenwich council, has this morning released an open letter to parents saying that, while he disagrees with Williamson’s decision, he does not think it would be justified spending public money fighting it in the courts. So he is asking schools to stay open, he says. But, in his letter, Thorpe also defends his initial proposal, saying the situation in the borough “continues to worsen”. He says: On Friday the weekly figures were grim. Officers advised me that new cases in Royal Greenwich “are significantly higher than we have recorded on previous weeks, an approximate 40-50% increase”. At that time, there were 3,670 children in self isolation and 314 teaching staff … That information continues to worsen. On Monday, an additional 498 children went in to self-isolation and the latest data we have showed a further rise in numbers. The figures showed that in Royal Greenwich our rates of infection were increasing more quickly than the London average and we were 12th out of the 32 London boroughs in terms of the infection rates across the city. Perhaps it’s a shame that Williamson’s direction to the council will never be challenged in court. According to the FT’s legal commentator David Allen Green, the education secretary’s legal arguments are so poor that “if I were still a government lawyer I would have been embarrassed to have prepared this for a minister”. Here’s a tweet from him with a link to his blog explaining why. Businesses in Northern Ireland have proposed more than 10,000 redundancies since March, a record number that reveals the dramatic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the region’s economy. The total number of proposed redundancies for the past 12 months was 10,720, more than double the number recorded in the previous 12 months, according to official statistics. Companies proposed 1,370 layoffs in November, an increase on October. Northern Ireland’s unemployment rate is now 3.9%. This is still below the UK’s rate of 4.9% but Northern Ireland lags the rest of the UK in per capita income and productivity, leaving it more vulnerable to shocks from the pandemic and Brexit. Ulster Bank’s chief economist, Richard Ramsey, said weak order numbers signalled little improvement in private sector activity in the short term. “With the end of the Brexit transition rapidly approaching, the implications of a UK-EU deal/no-deal will have a major bearing on business performance and confidence in 2021 and beyond,” he said. In a joint editorial, the British Medical Journal and the Health Service Journal, two of the most respected health publications in the UK, have urged the government to abandon plans to allow households to mix at Christmas. The editorial says allowing up to three household to mix over Christmas, as planned, would be a “major error that will cost many lives”. It says: Members of the public can and should mitigate the impact of the third wave by being as careful as possible over the next few months. But many will see the lifting of restrictions over Christmas as permission to drop their guard. The government was too slow to introduce restrictions in the spring and again in the autumn. It should now reverse its rash decision to allow household mixing and instead extend the tiers over the five-day Christmas period in order to bring numbers down in the advance of a likely third wave. It should also review and strengthen the tier structure, which has failed to suppress rates of infection and hospitalisation. This joint editorial is only the second in the more than 100-year histories of the BMJ and HSJ. We are publishing it because we believe the government is about to blunder into another major error that will cost many lives. If our political leaders fail to take swift and decisive action, they can no longer claim to be “protecting the NHS”. It says that when the Christmas rules were agreed at the end of November, it was assumed that, as a result of the lockdown, Covid-related demand on the NHS would be decreasing in the run-up to Christmas. But instead it is rising, the editorial says, and it says hospitals in England are on course to have 19,000 Covid patients by New Year’s eve – roughly the same number as at the peak of the pandemic on 12 April. England went into lockdown on November 5 and the number of inpatients with Covid-19 began to fall, down to 12,968 on December 5. If this rate of decline had continued, the English NHS would have been on course for just under 11,000 Covid-19 inpatients on 31 December. However, in the past two weeks, despite most of the country being in tiers 2 or 3, numbers of inpatients have started to rise again. By December 14 (the latest data available) Covid bed occupancy had climbed back to 15,053. Unless something happens to change this trajectory, hospitals in England will have just short of 19,000 Covid patients on New Year’s Eve. This figure, derived by extrapolating a straight line from December 5 to December 14 through to December 31, would be almost exactly the same as the 18,974 peak of the first wave on April 12. And it says the main impact will be felt by non-Covid patients. A significant third wave could wipe out almost all the reductions in waiting times for elective procedures achieved in the past 20 years. Average waiting times are on course to reach 12 months by March next year. This will take years to recover from, at the cost of much suffering and loss of life. There is a full text of the editorial, signed by Alastair McLellan, the HSJ editor, and Fiona Godlee, the BMJ editor-in-chief, at HuffPost here. Today’s ONS figures for England and Wales show a slight fall in Covid-related deaths (see 10am), but overall deaths in the week ending 4 December were still 15% higher than would usually occur in the same week when compared to the five-year-average. The number of registered deaths was higher than normal in all English regions and Wales for the fourth week in a row. The largest increase on the five-year average was in Yorkshire and the Humber. Here is the chart showing all deaths by region, compared to the five-year average (the broken grey line). And here are the regional excess death figures for the week ending 4 December. Of those 2,835 deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 4 December mentioning Covid on the death certificate, in 2,469 cases (87.1%) it was recorded as the underlying cause of death. Three-quarters of deaths involving Covid-19 were in people aged 75 years and over. The Office for National Statistics has published its weekly death figures for England and Wales. It covers the week ending 4 December (the week ending the Friday before last – or week 49, in ONS jargon). Here are the key points. Covid-related deaths in England and Wales fell at the start of December for the first time in three months. There were 2,835 deaths in the week ending 4 December where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, accounting for 23% of deaths in England and Wales. That was 205 fewer than the previous week, and the first decrease in Covid-related deaths since the week ending 4 September. Covid-related deaths in England alone also fell at the start of December for the first time in three months to 2,623. Covid-related deaths fell in all English regions except for the West Midlands, the east of England and London. Covid-related deaths in Wales fell for the second week in a row in the week ending 4 December. Excess deaths – the number of deaths above the five-year norm for this time of year – were running at 15% in the week ending 4 December. The number of people being made redundant in the UK soared to a record high in October amid the second coronavirus wave and as the government scaled back its furlough scheme before an 11th-hour extension, my colleague Richard Partington reports. Good morning. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has been touring the broadcast studios this morning and he has been urging the government to rethink its decision to relax Covid restrictions over Christmas. This is what he told the Today programme: We heard from Matt Hancock [the health secretary] yesterday that it appears the government is looking at this again. I would encourage them to do so if they are. The concern is this - the rules have been relaxed for five days, allowing household mixing for up to three different households and inevitably when people are in their own households, they tend to be less vigilant. And my concern is that many people may have the virus and not realise it. They could pass the virus on to older relations. And he went even further on Sky News. When the presenter, Niall Paterson, invited Khan to be a “Grinch” and to say that it would be best to cancel Christmas, and to close the five-day window opened by the government, Khan replied: You’re not being Grinch at all. I think what you’re doing is following the science. And actually what we’ve seen across the Europe, and across the world, is those countries that are more effective at dealing with this virus having shorter more restrictive measures that help health and wealth. So look at Germany and the Netherlands; they’re not for relaxing the rules over Christmas allowing three households to mix with unlimited numbers. Khan studiously avoided saying what he would like the rules for Christmas to be. But in saying that they should be tighter than currently planned, he is only echoing what scientists, medics and some Conservative MPs are saying. This is likely to be an increasingly difficult question for the government over the next few days. According to today’s Daily Mail splash, urgent talks on this are already underway in Westminster. Of course, this is not just a UK government decision. The four nations of the UK agreed a common approach because families travel across the country to meet up at Christmas. But when the rules were announced Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, and Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, were notably cautious, stressing that what people were allowed to do and what people should do were not the same. At the time UK government ministers were less downbeat, although that is now changing. Downing Street is saying it has “no plans” to change the rule, although it is not firmly ruling out tighter restrictions. The Welsh government said yesterday that, notwithstanding the four nations approach, it might have a rethink. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 9.30am: The ONS publishes its weekly death figures for England and Wales. 10pm: Gordon Brown, the former Labour prime minister, gives a speech to a Child Poverty Action Group webinar. 12pm: Downing Street holds its daily lobby briefing. 12pm: The Department for Education publishes its latest school attendance figures. 12.30pm: Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, makes a Commons statement about the online harms bill. As my colleague Alex Hern reports, social media companies will need to remove and limit the spread of harmful content or face fines of billions of pound. 2.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, gives a statement to MSPs about coronavirus. Politics Live is now doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, like Brexit, and when they seem more important or more interesting, they will take precedence. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow."

          "bodyText": "Not content with ambitions to limit judicial review, “update” (that is: weaken) the Human Rights Act, and pass laws that would insulate various agents of the state from accountability for human rights violations, the government is now, according to press reports last week, planning to introduce a new law that will limit our right to protest. For a government that claims to be concerned about free speech and “cancel culture”, cracking down on protest isn’t a great look. Without the text of the proposals, we don’t know for certain how far it will go. Reports suggest it will limit the physical locations, such as near parliament or newspaper distribution plants, in which protest is allowed to take place; and that it will seek to ensure protesters aren’t “blocking democratic functions from happening”. This is a not hugely subtle sleight of hand that ignores something very important: protesting is integral to democracy. Protest is a fundamental right, protected in domestic and international law, which the government and public authorities have a duty to facilitate. It is an essential tool for expressing dissent against those in power, and one of the ways that we join forces with one another to effect social, political and economic change. The plans are very likely to undermine our ability to collectively express dissent, which has been more crucial than ever this pandemic year. Let’s be clear: Liberty has always supported proportionate action to protect public health, and much of our work recently has focused on ensuring that the people most likely to be hit hard by the pandemic are prioritised in the government’s response. At the same time, the magnitude of the limitations on our freedom implemented by politicians this year cannot be overstated. In 2020 each of us has faced criminalisation for leaving the house without a “reasonable excuse”. Police have used surveillance drones to shame people walking in national parks. And countless people have been wrongly criminalised under the rushed and draconian Coronavirus Act, which also contains powers to force people to quarantine, close our borders, and even postpone some elections. And in all of this, parliament has been sidelined, with some lockdown laws, which have regulated aspects of our daily lives to a minute degree, coming into force at the stroke of a minister’s pen, with parliament given an opportunity to vote only weeks later. It isn’t just the government response to the pandemic that has given people cause to protest this year. This summer saw a global uprising against the killing of George Floyd by American police, and more broadly in support of black people’s rights to live flourishing lives. In the UK, against a backdrop of disproportionate police use of force and powers such as stop and search, the deaths of black frontline workers such as Belly Mujinga, and longstanding racism in the criminal punishment system, people mobilised in 260 towns and cities up and down the country, rallying to insist that black lives matter. Across the board, the response from the government and police has raised cause for serious concern. Scores of people have been arrested for taking to the streets to protest against lockdown restrictions. Protest organisers who have done their best to comply with pandemic restrictions, such as carrying out a risk assessment, have been cowed into not going ahead. And during the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the summer, the home secretary, Priti Patel, claimed that these protests were illegal, and many demonstrators were subject to aggressive police tactics such as kettling. A report by Netpol found that the policing of the Black Lives Matter protests was symptomatic of institutional racism. These attacks on the right to protest are not unique to the pandemic: in 2019, the Metropolitan police unlawfully used an injunction to ban protest during the Extinction Rebellion demonstrations. Leaving heavy-handed pandemic provisions and unlawful actions to one side, the UK’s legal environment is already heavily weighted in favour of the authorities when it comes to protest. Police have extremely wide-ranging powers to control or ban protests, and to arrest those who stray from conditions the police impose. These latest proposals tip that balance even further towards the authorities. Being able to challenge the government and other public bodies is the lifeblood of our democracy, and in a year that has seen spectacular curbs on our liberties, it’s more important than ever. Threatening the right to protest is just another way this government is trying to limit our ability to stand up to power, alongside weakening our human rights framework and the ability of the courts to hold it to account. We could be disheartened, but instead we should look to the many powerful protest movements that have persisted nonetheless – from school climate strikers, to opponents of the exam “mutant algorithm”, to people fighting for racial equality. It’s up to all of us to protect our hard-won freedoms: 2021 is going to be hard enough for the government – it should drop this protest bill before it sees the light of day. • Gracie Mae Bradley is the interim director of Liberty"

          "bodyText": "This blog is now closed. Follow our continuing coronavirus coverage here: Families and loved ones will be reunited when the first travellers from New Zealand since the Covid-19 crisis arrive in Queensland without the need to quarantine. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk opened the border to NZ residents from 1am on Saturday, with the first flight expected to land in Brisbane about 10.45am. “I know that is going to mean so much to families that have been missing loved ones for such a long time,” she said. The decision to lift travel restrictions for travellers from NZ came after the country clocked up 28 days without a locally acquired virus case. While people from NZ can now enter Queensland freely, they will still have to go into managed isolation or quarantine when they return home. Palaszczuk said she was optimistic the NZ government would soon remove mandatory quarantine requirements for arrivals from Australia. Queensland is also set to open to travellers from Adelaide from 1am on Saturday, meaning all Australians will be able to freely enter Queensland for the first time since March. There were more than 200,000 Kiwis living in Queensland in the 2016 census, making them the largest group of foreign-born residents in the state. With the easing of coronavirus health restrictions, Queensland will also allow socially distanced dancing at indoor venues from 1am on Monday. New South Wales has again reported no new locally transmitted cases of Covid-19. There were six cases in the state’s hotel quarantine. Cowie acknowledges Victorians may be feeling “anxious” to see new Covid-19 cases after “a very difficult year”. He assures Victorians that “all steps are being taken, all resources are being mobilised” to ensure the positive cases remain only in hotel quarantine. Victoria is understandably a little jumpy about the hotel quarantine system, and Cowie is stressing that positive results were “anticipated”. He’s running through the way the scheme works, and explaining that when new arrivals appear at Melbourne airport they are either sent to hotel quarantine or to a health hotel if they have symptoms. At least some of these five cases were initially in hotel quarantine before testing positive. The five positive cases returned from “a range of countries” but Cowie won’t go into details. Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, Prof Ben Cowie, is addressing the media after five new cases of Covid-19 were found in hotel quarantine. They are the first cases of the virus recorded since hotel quarantine resumed in the state on 7 December, and the first cases in Victoria in 42 days. He says that as of 11pm last night, Victoria had accepted 735 people into hotel quarantine since it resumed. Of those, 680 are in quarantine while another 55 are in the specially set up “health hotels”. The five positive cases are two men in their 30s and 50s, and three women in their 20s, 30s and 50s. He says all of them are being cared for in the health hotels. “They will remain there until they are cleared both from a clinical perspective for their own welfare and from a public perspective when they no longer present any risk of transmission of Covid-19 in the community,” Cowie says. A website set up to allow Victorians to access regional travel vouchers crashed within minutes on Friday, AAP reports. Business Victoria says 40,000 vouchers offered as part of the first round of the state government’s Regional Travel Voucher Scheme have run out. Holidaymakers hoping to snap up one of the Victorian government’s $200 regional tourism offers prompted the application website to crash within minutes on Friday morning, having opened at 10am. Those intending to spend two or more nights in regional Victoria between Saturday and 22 January 2021 were able to apply. Business Victoria said the website received 800,000 visits by Friday at 5pm. Eligible destinations under the $28m scheme, announced as part of a $300m state budget tourism package last month, include the Yarra Valley, Mornington Peninsula and Bellarine Peninsula. “If those $200 vouchers mean people stay an extra night, maybe go to a local pub or restaurant. That’s all about wages and spending and investment,” Premier Daniel Andrews said on Thursday. The US government has exercised its option to purchase an additional 100m doses of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate, bringing its confirmed order commitment to 200m doses. In a statement to investors, Moderna said about 20m doses of the vaccine would be delivered “by the end of December 2020”. The remaining 80m will be delivered in the first quarter of 2021, while the additional 100m announced today would come in the second quarter of 2021. New Zealand and the Cook Islands have agreed to a travel arrangement between the two nations. NZ Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown have instructed officials to put in place measures to safely recommence two-way quarantine-free travel in the first quarter of 2021. “The arrangement recognises the special ties between New Zealand and the Cook Islands. It will allow people to travel more easily between our two countries, while acknowledging that the priority remains to protect our populations from Covid-19,” Ardern said. Brown noted the free movement between NZ and the Cook Islands is central to their close relationship and integral to the Islands’ recovery from the coronavirus. “This arrangement is the next step towards resuming many aspects of life in the Cook Islands that have been disrupted by Covid-19, including access to health and education, and reuniting family and friends,” he said. Brazil reported 53,030 additional confirmed cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours and 646 deaths from Covid-19, the Health Ministry said on Friday. The South American country has now registered 6,834,829 cases since the pandemic began, while the official death toll has risen to 180,411, according to ministry data. Brazil has the world’s second highest death toll behind the US and the third highest case count behind the US and India. Victoria’s resumed and revamped hotel quarantine system will face its first test after recording five new cases of Covid-19. They are the first cases recorded in hotel quarantine since the state once again began taking overseas returnees on 7 December. The state has now gone 42 days without a case of community transmission of the virus. Good morning (or afternoon, or evening, depending on where you are reading) this is Michael McGowan in Sydney taking over the global Covid-19 blog. Australia is pinning much of its hope on the British-developed AstraZeneca/Oxford University Covid-19 vaccine, purchasing an additional 20m doses of the product after trials of a domestically produced vaccine were cancelled. On Friday the Australian government announced further trials of the Australian-led Covid-19 vaccine in development by the University of Queensland and pharmaceutical company CSL would be abandoned, after some participants in early trials returned false-positive HIV tests. While there was no risk of HIV to the trial participants, researchers said the false-positive results would have required significant changes to well-established HIV testing procedures to accommodate rollout of the vaccine. The news is a major blow for Australia’s hopes of securing a vaccine, but the government quickly announced it had secured enough doses of AstraZeneca’s promising vaccine to serve the entire population. The country’s health minister, Greg Hunt, said Australia was still in a “strong position” to roll out Covid-19 vaccines early next year, despite the termination. “Just to let you know, all up, the Australian vaccine portfolio – 53.8 million AstraZeneca units – that’s enough to cover the whole of population,” he said. Scientists have linked the most severe form of Covid-19 with five genes that affect lung inflammation and the body’s ability to fight off viruses. Their findings, from a study of 2,700 Covid-19 patients in intensive care units across Britain, point to several existing drugs that could be repurposed to treat people who risk becoming critically ill. The genes – called IFNAR2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9 and CCR2 – partially explain why some people become desperately sick with Covid-19, while others are not affected, said Kenneth Baillie of Edinburgh University, co-author of the study published on Friday in Nature. The new information should help scientists design clinical trials of medicines that target specific antiviral and anti-inflammatory pathways. Among those with the most potential, Baillie said, should be a class of anti-inflammatory drugs called JAK inhibitors, including Eli Lilly’s arthritis drug baricitinib, which has been found to help hospitalised pneumonia patients in combination with Gilead’s remdesivir. The World Health Organization warned that Christmas celebrations could turn to “sadness” if people fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 during the festive season. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the number of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic was surging and urged people to think very carefully about their holiday season plans. Brazil’s health ministry is studying 58 suspected cases of Covid-19 reinfection after confirming the first case of a person getting reinfected with coronavirus, a ministry spokeswoman said. The first case was a health worker in the northern city of Natal, a 37-year-old woman who tested positive in June and again 116 days later in October, the ministry said on Thursday. Indoor dining restrictions will be reinstated indefinitely in New York City, governor Andrew Cuomo announced as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continue climbing in the city and throughout the state. The UK reported 424 new Covid-related deaths on Friday, as the number of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital increased week on week. Portugal reported 95 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Friday, its worst daily toll since the pandemic started. The country of just over 10 million people has now reported 5,373 deaths and a total of 340,287 infections, up by 5,080 cases from Thursday. The level 3 coronavirus restrictions placed on the city of Edinburgh in Scotland have not been suspended by a judge, who decided the Scottish government had a right to consider factors other than data. Rapid coronavirus tests rolled out in Liverpool in England missed more than half of those who had Covid-19, preliminary data suggests. There were no cases of severe allergic reactions to Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate during clinical trials, a Pfizer executive said at a regulatory conference. Switzerland has ordered restaurants, bars and shops to close down from 7pm across much of the nation, the government said on Friday, as the country continues to face a persistently high level of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Scientists have identified mutations in five genes associated with the development of life-threatening illness in patients with Covid-19. There were no cases of severe allergic reactions to Pfizer Inc and partner BioNTech SE’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate during clinical trials, a Pfizer executive said at a regulatory conference. A late-stage trial testing the potential vaccine excluded participants who had a prior history of severe allergic reactions to any vaccine or to the constituents of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, said Dr William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development. We’ve not had any anaphylactic episodes related to the vaccine,” Gruber said during a panel meeting of independent advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The trial included about 6,000 participants respectively in both the vaccine and placebo groups with a history of a range of allergic conditions like pollen allergy, food allergy, all the way up to anaphylaxis, Pfizer executive Susan Mather said. Anaphylaxis is an overreaction by the body’s immune system that could sometimes be life-threatening. The comments follow British medicine regulators’ advice that people with a history of significant allergic reactions do not get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, after two people reported adverse effects. The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to issue an emergency use authorisation for the two-dose vaccine as soon as Friday, according to the New York Times. Once authorised, the first Americans could be immunized as soon as Monday or Tuesday, with healthcare workers expected to be among the first in line. The level 3 coronavirus restrictions placed on the city of Edinburgh in Scotland have not been suspended by a judge, who decided the Scottish government had a right to consider factors other than data. Lord Ericht passed a judicial review on the motion from KLR &amp; RCR International Ltd &amp; Others after hospitality businesses in the city warned of the further impact the measures could have. At a remote hearing on Friday, Dean of Faculty Roddy Dunlop QC, on behalf of the petitioners, told the judge the level 3 decision made for Edinburgh by Scottish government ministers was “flawed” and did not reflect Public Health Scotland advice or case figures. James Mure QC, representing ministers, said while the data was there to inform the decision-makers, there was “no simple algorithm” to determine levels and the indicators used “may change over time”. In his judgment, Lord Ericht said: “The current coronavirus crisis has brought difficult challenges. “It has brought particularly difficult challenges to the hospitality industry. I have been provided with information and affidavits about the devastating effect on the businesses of the petitioners and the consequences for their survival if they have to operate on level 3 rather than level 2 restrictions over the festive period.” The president of the Senegalese Football Federation (FSF), Augustin Senghor, said he feared for sport in his country due to coronavirus restrictions. On Thursday, the west African state announced that the ban on public gatherings, including sports training, will remain in place. “It’s clear that if it’s put in place or renewed, it’s a death warrant for Senegalese sport,” Senghor said on the FSF’s Facebook page. “One year or more without playing sport in a country becomes worrying. We need to play because it’s good for public health and our young people,” he added. Senghor also questioned why some countries which have been hit harder by the pandemic have allowed sport to continue. Senegal has declared 16,173 cases of Covid-19 with 334 deaths from the virus. Rapid coronavirus tests rolled out in Liverpool in England missed more than half of those who had Covid-19, preliminary data suggests. A document released by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) on Friday shows the tests missed about 51% of all cases. The paper considered by Sage on 26 November said that two days earlier the Liverpool Health Protection Board had decided to pause plans to use the Innova lateral flow test to allow care home visits because they were not accurate enough. One week later the government started sending out the tests to England’s biggest care homes. On 5 December the chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace defended the uses of the tests, despite concerns around the accuracy. Dr Susan Hopkins said the tests had enabled them to find many cases of infection in people without Covid-19 symptoms that would otherwise have been missed. She explained the programme was about case detection, and people with a negative test were not being told they did not have the disease. Instead it was identifying those who do have Covid-19, and telling them to isolate. Prof Richard Tedder, senior research investigator in medical virology, Imperial College London, said: “The data presented on the performance of the Innova lateral flow assay for detecting Sars-CoV-2 clearly indicate in this study that when compared against a benchmark molecular test such as a quantitative PCR the lateral flow test is very very much less sensitive, detecting only about half of the known positive samples subjected to testing.” Britain’s Prince William and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, took their three young children to a special pantomime performance on Friday to meet and thank healthworkers, delivery drivers and volunteers for their efforts during the pandemic. Prince William delivered a short speech to thank the workers from across Britain who had supported communities and battled to keep the country operating earlier this year. The couple embarked on a short national tour earlier this week to meet and thank frontline workers, care home staff and teachers for their efforts during the pandemic. On Friday the couple arrived walking down a red carpet with their three young children – George, Charlotte and Louis – who stopped to watch actors dressed as elves waving and juggling. They later watched the performance staring the actor and comedian Julian Clary and singer Elaine Paige. The World Health Organization warned that Christmas celebrations could turn to “sadness” if people fail to keep up their guard against Covid-19 during the festive season. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the number of deaths in the coronavirus pandemic was surging and urged people to think very carefully about their holiday season plans. “The festive season is a time to relax and celebrate but... celebration can very quickly turn to sadness if we fail to take the right precautions,” he told a news conference. As you prepare to celebrate over the coming weeks, please, please consider your plans carefully. If you live in an area with high transmission, please take every precaution to keep yourselves and others safe. “That could be the best gift you could give - the gift of health.” Tedros said there had been a 60 percent increase worldwide in deaths from the respiratory disease over the past six weeks. However, some continents are witnessing bigger death toll surges than others, said Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead on Covid-19. She said there had been nearly a 100 percent increase in the number of deaths per week in the WHO’s Europe region over the past six weeks, a 54 percent increase in the Americas and 50 percent in Africa. “This virus is still circulating. Most of the world remains at risk,” she said. Some Spanish ski stations, including exclusive Baqueira Beret favoured by the royal family, are set to open from next week while observing nationwide coronavirus restrictions. Ski resorts have become a divisive issue in Europe as some countries like France, Germany and Italy have shut them after some ski stations became Covid-19 breeding grounds last winter, helping the early spread of the illness in Europe. Privately owned Baqueira Beret, in the Pyrenees near the French border, said on its website it will open on Monday, though it will limit the number of skiers to guarantee social distance. “The starting shot of the winter 2020-2021 will be fired on December 14,” the resort said on Friday. Spain’s Sierra Nevada resort in Andalusia said it will open to skiers next Friday. Switzerland has said it will open its ski resorts. Austria announced this month that skiing will be allowed from December 24th but hotels will stay closed until January 7th and visits from abroad will likely be much reduced given quarantine requirements for people from countries with more than 100 cases per 100,000 - which include Germany, France and Italy. Pyrenean microstate Andorra, whose economy relies heavily on winter sports, has not set a date yet for opening resorts but it will not be before January. French Prime Minister Jean Castex said after ordering resorts in his country closed that police would make random border checks to prevent people leaving the country to go skiing in neighbouring countries. Castex said after meeting with ski station representatives on Friday that the government was considering opening the resorts from January 7. Spain’s Aragon region, which also borders France, has not decided when - or if - the slopes will open before Christmas. Brazil’s health ministry is studying 58 suspected cases of Covid-19 re-infection after confirming the first case of a person getting re-infected with coronavirus, a ministry spokeswoman said. The first case was a health worker in the northern city of Natal, a 37-year-old woman, who tested positive in June and again 116 days later in October, the ministry said on Thursday. The re-infection was confirmed by the FioCruz biomedical research center in Rio de Janeiro, it said in a statement. So far 58 suspected cases of re-infection have been reported and are being studied, the spokeswoman said. The cases involve people who tested positive and their re-infection must be confirmed as a separate infection and not the re-appearance of the same infection, she said. The FioCruz researcher who did the genetic sequencing of the infection of the case in Natal, Paola Resende, said it looked like the woman did not generate enough anti-bodies to avoid getting infected again more than 90 days later. Resende told Reuters that the woman was infected by a separate strain of coronavirus the second time. The pathogen of the sample collected in June belonged to the B.1.1.33 strain and the October sample was from the B.1.1.28 strain. Both had already been detected in Brazil,” she said. Indoor dining restrictions will be reinstated indefinitely in New York City, governor Andrew Cuomo announced as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations continue climbing in the city and throughout the state. As of Monday, only takeout orders and outdoor dining will be allowed in the city, one of the world’s great cuisine capitals, the governor said at a news conference in Albany. The Democrat had been hinting at a clampdown on indoor dining for a week, saying he was waiting to see if hospitalization rates stabilized. They have not, and Cuomo said that despite the economic pain to one of the city’s biggest and most vital industries, he needed to act. “In New York City, you put the CDC caution on indoor dining together with the rate of transmission and the density and the crowding, that is a bad situation,” he said. The UK reported 424 new Covid-related deaths on Friday, as the number of coronavirus patients admitted to hospital increased week on week. The government’s Covid dashboard showed: 21,672 people tested positive in the last 24 hours. 1,622 people were admitted to hospital overnight. 10,194 people were hospitalised with Covid in the last week, 560 more than the previous week (a rise of 5.8%). There were 1,267 Coronavirus patients needing help breathing with a mechanical ventilator on 10 December. 119,025 people tested positive in the last week, a 17.7% increase from the previous week. 2,906 people died within 28 days of a positive Covid test last week, 5.3% fewer than the previous week. Between 23 March and 7 December 2020, there have been 232,898 people who have had to go into hospital with coronavirus. Between 31 January and 11 December 2020, there have been 1,809,455 people who have had a confirmed positive test result. France reported 13,406 new coronavirus infections on Friday, fewer than Thursday’s 13,750 but well above the 11,221 reported last Friday, while intensive care cases dropped again and are now well below a government target. After falling for weeks following the November lockdown, early December’s partial easing has led to an increase in infection rates and the daily count has not dropped to the 5,000 set by the government as a precondition for further loosening. But the number of people in intensive care - the most important measure of a health system’s ability to deal with the disease - dropped again by 75 to 2,884 and is now well within the government target level of 2,500 to 3,000, health ministry data showed. The total case count since the start of the pandemic rose to 2.35 million, while the number of deaths rose by 627 to 57,567. Friday’s reported toll included 304 hospital deaths, compared to 292 on Thursday, and a three-day batch of 323 retirement home deaths. On Thursday, the French government postponed a further planned easing of lockdown measures by three weeks and said that an 8pm curfew from15 December would remain in place for New Year’s eve but will be waived for Christmas. In London, police have criticised “selfish” people for holding parties, large weddings and unlicensed music events as the city faces rising coronavirus cases. High infection rates mean the UK capital could be headed for tier 3 restrictions. London has increasing infection rates, according to the latest official figures. In an effort to tackle the Covid spread in London, thousands of extra tests are being made available for schools in areas of concern. The mayor, Sadiq Khan, who has said London going into tier 3 would be “catastrophic” for hospitality in the capital, has introduced new measures “to try to turn the tide of rising case numbers”. These include expanding community testing with 10 extra mobile testing units and up to 30 additional police officers this weekend. Downing Street has warned Londoners to be “vigilant” to control the spread of the virus. A No 10 spokesman said: “We would encourage people to remain vigilant and to adhere to local restrictions and to follow the social distancing rules that are in place.” The Metropolitan police said almost 40 attendees at a wedding had been reported for fines earlier this week in an area with a high infection rate, and that the organiser now faces a potential £10,000 fine. The force said its officers have also broken up unlicensed music events and made arrests at protests, as well as at central London shopping areas where people have failed to follow the regulations. A small number of arrests were made after hundreds of young people were photographed gathering outside the world-famous Harrods department store last Saturday, the first weekend since England’s national lockdown was lifted. The deputy assistant commissioner Matt Twist, the Met’s lead for Covid-19 operations, said: “It is really saddening that in the week a vaccine finally began its rollout to the most vulnerable, offering a ray of hope to us all, that we are facing the possibility of tougher restrictions. “But I’m afraid the infection rates show not all of us are being careful enough.” He said “collective actions” in the days and weeks ahead “will have very serious consequences” and warned that if people do not change their behaviour now “then people will die who could have otherwise lived – it’s that simple”. He added: “We will not allow the irresponsible and selfish actions of a few jeopardise the safety of the entire city, but we also urge everyone to ensure they too are taking personal responsibility to do all they can to protect themselves and their community.” Speaking at a session of the London assembly, the police commissioner, Cressida Dick, praised the “heroism and dedication” of Met officers in the face of challenges caused by the pandemic. “My officers obviously don’t know when they go into a house whether someone has had Covid,” she said. “They have been dealing with the deceased, sadly, to support families where people have died of Covid. “It’s been a very different year for us in the way in which we work.” Portugal reported 95 deaths linked to Covid-19 on Friday, its worst daily toll since the pandemic started. The figures — from the national DGS health authority — came a week before the government is expected to re-evaluate plans to ease restrictions over the Christmas period. The country of just over 10 million people has now reported 5,373 deaths and a total of 340,287 infections, up by 5,080 cases from Thursday. After a relatively mild first wave, cases rose sharply in the second, though they have eased slightly recently. The number of infections per 100,000 people measured over the past 14 days is, at 533, more than double that in neighbouring Spain, data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control showed. The government said on Saturday it would ease coronavirus rules over Christmas to let people visit loved ones, but added it would keep checking the data and reevaluate its plans on 18 December, Reuters reported. A further 275 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 43,812, NHS England said on Friday. Patients were aged between 34 and 99. All except eight, aged between 60 and 95, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between November 1 and December 10. Scientists have identified mutations in five genes associated with the development of life-threatening illness in patients with Covid-19. UK researchers said their work, published in the journal Nature, sheds light on the mechanisms that underpin severe coronavirus symptoms and could lead to potential new drug treatments for the disease. Dr Kenneth Baillie, the project’s chief investigator and senior research fellow at University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute, said: “This is a stunning realisation of the promise of human genetics to help understand critical illness... “Our results immediately highlight which drugs should be at the top of the list for clinical testing. We can only test a few drugs at a time, so making the right choices will save thousands of lives.” Dr Baillie and his team performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 2,244 critically-ill patients with Covid-19 from 208 intensive care units (ICU) in the UK. GWAS is a commonly used study design which allows scientists to identify which genes are involved in human disease. Working with experts from the GenOMICC consortium, a global collaboration looking into the links between genetics and critical illness, the researchers compared the genetic information of Covid-19 patients in ICU with samples provided by healthy volunteers from other studies. The team found that variations in five genes - Ifnar2, TYK2, OAS1, DPP9 and CCR2 - was associated with the development of severe illness in Covid-19 patients. The scientists said that they were able to pinpoint two molecular processes – antiviral immunity and lung inflammation – associated with the genes. Innate antiviral defences are known to be important early in the disease while the inflammatory processes triggered by the infection are a key feature of severe Covid-19, the researchers said. But the team said the research was not aimed at predicting who is likely to get critically ill with Covid-19 but focuses more on finding “biological clues that will lead us to effective treatments”. Restrictions on non-essential travel between Mexico and the US could be extended until 21 January, following a proposal by the Mexican government. Mexico has proposed to the US that restrictions on non-essential travel at their shared border be extended for another month as authorities continue to grapple with the coronavirus pandemic, the Mexican foreign ministry said on Friday. Drugmakers GlaxoSmithKline and Sanofi have said their potential Covid-19 vaccine won’t be ready until late next year because they need to improve the shot’s effectiveness in older people, AP is reporting. The companies said early trials showed the vaccine produced an “insufficient” immune response in people over 60 because it didn’t contain enough of the material that triggers the production of disease-fighting antibodies. They said they plan to reformulate the vaccine and do more testing, which is likely to delay approval to the fourth quarter of 2021 from the middle of the year. “The results of the study are not as we hoped,” Roger Connor, president of London-based GSK Vaccines, said in a statement. The delay is a setback for plans to vaccinate large numbers of people around the world amid a pandemic that has already taken more than 1.5 million lives. GSK and Sanofi plan to produce up to 1bn doses of their Covid-19 vaccine annually, and they have signed agreements to supply millions of doses to the US, European Union, Canada and developing countries. The difficulties underscore the challenges scientists face as they race to develop Covid-19 vaccines, condensing a process that usually takes years into a matter of months. Public health experts say several vaccines will be needed to end the pandemic, because of the challenges in rapidly producing and distributing enough doses to vaccinate billions of people. Companies in the US are considering various options to get employees back to work after the Covid vaccine has been rolled out, Reuters is reporting. Options on the table include giving workers a choice between a free vaccine and a cash bonus if everyone gets inoculated, to being reassigned or even losing your job. Keen to avoid a backlash or violating the law, companies are discussing options with lawyers, health care experts and polling their workers to gauge when to offer carrots and when to use a stick. Workplace programmes could come following US approval of the first vaccine this week. But a Pew Research poll shows 21% of Americans are firmly opposed, with 60% likely to get a shot. Among big employers starting to formulate policies are oil giant Chevron Corp, auto maker Ford Motor Co, retailer Target Corp, restaurant chain Ford’s Garage, the United Steelworkers union, and refiners’ Marathon Petroleum and Citgo Petroleum. Their efforts are preliminary given FDA vaccine approvals remain outstanding. Experts say that private employers could set up mandatory vaccinations so long as they exempt workers with religious and medical conditions, while the direct threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic will allow mandatory programs to win approvals soon. Australia has cancelled the production of a locally made vaccine against Covid-19 after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis, Reuters is reporting. The government has instead securing additional doses of rival vaccines. Antibodies generated by the vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland (UQ) and biotech firm CSL, one of four candidates contracted by the Australian government, were found to lead to some false positive HIV test results, the makers said. While the vaccine had elicited a “robust” immune response to the novel Sars-COV-2 virus without serious adverse effects in a Phase 1 trial with 216 participants, re-engineering a fix could take another 12 months, they said. CSL and the Australian government had together decided to stop Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. “While this is a tough decision to take, the urgent need for a vaccine has to be everyone’s priority,” said UQ professor Paul Young. CSL, which had a contract to produce 51 million doses of the UQ vaccine, will instead produce an extra 20 million doses of the Oxford vaccine being developed with Britain’s AstraZeneca, taking the total to 53 million. The government said it has also secured additional doses of Novavax vaccines. Australia also has a contract for 10 million doses of a vaccine being developed by Pfizer, with regulatory approval expected by January 2021. All school pupils aged 14-16 in Sweden’s capital Stockholm will switch to remote learning for the rest of this year to help stem a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the first time Sweden, known as one of the rare Western countries to eschew mandatory lockdowns and masks in response to the pandemic, has recommended distance education for significant numbers of secondary school students. “We must drastically reduce our contacts, so unfortunately I am forced to recommend that (Stockholm region) municipalities end on-site teaching for students in advanced stage education starting on Monday,” regional infections control chief Maria Rotzen Ostlund said in a statement. Stockholm has been the Swedish region hardest hit by the Covid-19 respiratory disease, accounting for more than a third of the Nordic country’s death toll from the virus. A further 7,370 new coronavirus cases were registered nationwide on Friday, Health Agency statistics showed, down from 7,935 new infections recorded on Thursday. An additional 160 deaths were reported, one of the highest daily numbers since the start of the pandemic, taking the total to 7,514. Sweden’s death rate per capita is several times higher than that of its Nordic neighbours but lower than several European countries that opted for lockdowns. Covid has opened up - and exacerbated - all sorts of divides in societies around the world. In England, there has been a deepening of longstanding north-south divisions, which has seen most of the north put under the tightest Covid restrictions and most of the south spared the same pain. Today the UK government announced a targeted testing drive for secondary school and college students in parts of north-east London, Essex and Kent. London and Essex are in tier 2, while Kent is in tier 3, the highest level of restrictions. Most of the north of England is still in tier 3 but the offer has not been extended to schools there. Nor was the offer there in October and November, when rates there were the highest in the country — at one point in mid-November one in four children in Hull were off school because of outbreaks. Jonathan Reynolds, the MP for Stalybridge and Hyde in Tameside, Greater Manchester, which has seen the highest Covid death rate across the whole pandemic, said teachers were “livid” at the government’s southerncentric approach. He said the region had bid for school testing kits, but wasn’t automatically offered any, as in London and the south-east. The Guardian asked the department of health and social care (DHSC) why London and the south-east seemed to be getting preferential treatment in terms of school testing allocation, and received this response: The evidence shows us there is a clear rise in cases in secondary school age children in these areas and we must act to target these rates - about one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms and will be spreading it without realising it. Our recent pilots in Liverpool have shown rapid testing is effective and can help us quickly assess where the virus is spreading most and take action to stop it in its tracks. Local Authorities in tier 3 can apply for national support and funding for community testing to target high case rates.” Local authorities in tier 3 areas, the highest level of restrictions, have been invited to apply for the new six-week community testing programme to complement wider local strategies to tackle the virus, and drive down submissions. Since mid-November Directors of Public Health across the country have been able to receive 10,000 rapid tests to cut transmission rates, applying tests how they see fit in their communities. The reproduction number, or R value, of coronavirus transmission across the UK is now between 0.9 and 1, the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) said. Last week, the R number was between 0.8 and 1. R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. An R number between 0.9 and 1 means that on average every 10 people infected will infect between 9 and 10 other people. Meanwhile, the R value in England is between 0.8 and 1, but Sage said it is not confident that R is below 1 in all English regions, particularly in London and parts of the South East. Switzerland has ordered restaurants, bars and shops to close down from 7pm across much of the nation, the government said on Friday, as the country continues to face a persistently high level of Covid-19 infections and deaths. The government said regions less badly hit by the pandemic would still be allowed to have locations open until 11pm, in the measures which go into effect on Saturday. The exception would apply to cantons that had a virus reproduction rate below 1 and an infection incidence below the national average over at least a week. The measures, decided after discussions between the government and local authorities, also affect events and cultural activities which have been restricted to groups of five people. “The level of infections with the coronavirus remains high and in some cantons is rising again,” the government said in a statement. “Hospitals are close to their limits and health personnel are under pressure. The situation is disturbing.” On Friday, authorities reported 5,136 new cases and 106 more deaths in Switzerland and neighbouring principality Liechtenstein. Switzerland has been trying to steer a middle course between shutting down the economy and preventing the spread of the virus. But so far the strategy has had mixed results, with the number of infections much higher than during the first outbreak in March and April. Infection rates have once again begun to rise, after a drop off since early November. The new restrictions, which come into effect on Saturday, run until 22 January. In-person Christmas shopping has begun in earnest for many Scots today as non-essential shops across the west of the country emerge from near lockdown restrictions today. At her lunchtime briefing, Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, pleaded with the public to exercise caution. “The very, very last thing we want to see is overcrowding,” she said, emphasising that those in the surrounding areas should not be travelling into Glasgow to do their festive shopping, given the ongoing ban on travel between level 3 local authorities. The chief constable, Iain Livingstone, said Police Scotland’s starting point over the festive period would be “explaining the rules and encouraging people to comply”, but added that the force had issued 90 fixed-penalty notices for breach of travel restrictions since they came into force last month. Sturgeon was also challenged on the recent decision by the Welsh government to move to online learning until Christmas, as well as the move from the Glasgow association of Scotland’s largest teaching union, the EIS, to ballot teachers on strike action over classroom safety concerns. Sturgeon said there was a “material difference” in the prevalence of the virus in Wales, which is three times that in Scotland right now, but added that, as in England, there were plans to have further testing in schools. Calls are growing for Germany to go into a tighter lockdown as the country’s disease control centre reported record daily increases in coronavirus cases and deaths. The Robert Koch Institute said the country’s 16 states reported 29,875 new cases of Covid-19, breaking the previous daily record of 23,679 cases reported the day before. The number of deaths from the virus rose by 598, to a total of 20,970. The previous daily record of deaths was 590, set on Wednesday. “There clearly need to be extra measures, and I want to say as health minister that they are needed sooner rather than later,” Jens Spahn said. “We wouldn’t be able to forgive ourselves if this Christmas became above all a festival for the virus,” he added. “And if we’re honest, the virus doesn’t take much account of whether we’ve all finished our Christmas shopping or not.” Restrictions implemented at the beginning of November closed restaurants, bars, leisure and sports facilities but schools and non-essential shops have remained open. The latest polls show nearly 50% of Germans back tougher restrictions, while 35% support the current lockdown measures. There have been protests against the regulations that have garnered much attention, but polls show less than 15% of Germans think they are too strict. My colleague Angela Giuffrida in Rome has just published this excellent exclusive report. It reveals how the World Health Organiztion has been accused of conspiring with the Italian health ministry to remove a report revealing the country’s mismanagement of the first Covid wave. The percentage of people testing positive for Covid-19 in England has continued to decrease according to the weekly infection survey from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). An estimated 481,500 people within the community population in England had Covid-19 in the week of 29 November to 5 December 2020, equating to one in 115 people (95% credible interval: one in 120 to one in 105). Though rates decreased in most English regions, the proportion of people testing positive in London has increased and there are early signs of increase in the east of England. Other findings from the ONS include: In the most recent week, the percentage of people testing positive has decreased in older teenagers and young adults, those aged 25 to 34 and 50 to 69; rates continue to be highest among secondary school age children. The percentage of those testing positive has increased in recent weeks in Wales , with the ONS estimating 25,600 people in Wales had Covid-19 last week, equating to 1 in 120 people. The percentage testing positive in Northern Ireland continues to decrease in the most recent week; the ONS estimates that 7,800 people in Northern Ireland had Covid-19, equating to 1 in 235 people. The percentage testing positive in Scotland has remained relatively stable in recent weeks; during the most recent week (29 November to 5 December 2020), the ONS estimates that 43,300 people in Scotland had Covid-19, equating to 1 in 120 people. Katherine Kent, co-head of analysis for the Covid-19 Infection Survey, said: The evidence for England continues to show an overall decline in the level of infections, though we have recorded an increase in London and may have begun to see an increase in the East of England. Rates have declined in both older teenagers and young adults and remain highest amongst secondary school children. Across the UK, it’s a mixed picture. Infections appear to be increasing in Wales whilst remaining stable in Scotland. Northern Ireland is continuing to see falling infection rates.” The self-isolation period for contacts of a positive coronavirus case will be cut from 14 days to 10, the UK’s chief medical officers have announced. Those required to quarantine after returning from countries which are not on the travel corridor list will also see their isolation period reduced, in an approach agreed by all four nations. Health chiefs said in a joint statement that following a review of the evidence, they were “confident” that the self-isolation period could be shortened. This reduction already applies in Wales following an announcement by the Welsh Government earlier this week, while it will take effect in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland from Monday. The new rules will apply to all those who are currently self-isolating, including those who began doing so before Monday. Businesses across Northern Ireland reopened on Friday after a two-week circuit-breaker lockdown but infection and death rates remain high, fuelling fears of a swift resurgence of the virus. Shops, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and gyms can reopen and normal church services resume. Pubs that do not serve food remain shut. The region recorded 14 coronavirus-related deaths on Thursday. There were 67 deaths in the past week, up seven on the previous week, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 1,099. Officials also recorded 441 new cases on Thursday and said community transmission remained high, with the R value at around 1, meaning an infected person on average passes the disease to one other person. Hospitals are at 101% occupancy. The region’s chief scientific adviser, Ian Young, said compliance with the circuit-breaker had been disappointing. Some ministers in the Stormont executive are nervous the disease will roar back. “If there is a festive free-for-all with public health advice ignored, then it will cost lives and place unbearable pressure on our hospitals,” said Robin Swann, the health minister. “We must avoid these catastrophic consequences.” Arlene Foster, the first minister, defended the easing of restriction and said authorities would closely monitor the R number. “We have made provision that people can get together over Christmas but they should do so in a safe way, and just because we say you can doesn’t mean that you have to, and that’s very key.” The UK’s AstraZeneca will investigate combining its experimental vaccine with Russia’s Sputnik V candidate, it has said, in a move Russian scientists have suggested could sharply boost efficacy. The developers of Sputnik V suggested on Twitter last month that AstraZeneca try the combination, saying: Sputnik V is happy to share one of its two human adenoviral vectors with AstraZeneca to increase the efficacy of (the) AstraZeneca vaccine. Using two different vectors for two vaccine shots will result in higher efficacy than using the same vector for two shots. On Friday, AstraZeneca said it was considering how it could assess combinations of different vaccines, and would soon begin exploring with Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, which developed Sputnik V, whether two common cold virus-based vaccines could be successfully combined. Data published in a journal this week showed that AstraZeneca’s vaccine, being developed along with the University of Oxford, has average efficacy of 70.4%, based on a pooled analysis of interim data from late stage trials. Russia has claimed Sputnik V is 92% effective at protecting people, according to interim trial results. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund, which has funded Sputnik V, said: This shows the strength of Sputnik V technology and our willingness and desire to partner with other vaccines to fight against Covid together. Indonesia has reported 6,310 infections and 175 deaths, the largest number of fatalities in a day, data from the country’s taskforce show With Friday’s data, Indonesia’s total number of cases rose to 605,243, while the number of deaths rose to 18,511, both are the highest tallies in Southeast Asia. Russia, which began vaccinating vulnerable people in Moscow on Saturday, has resisted imposing a strict lockdown as it did in the spring, relying on targeted measures instead, though the Kremlin says places like St Petersburg are nearing a “red line”. Some critics have called into question the official death toll, pointing to the significantly elevated number of excess deaths during the pandemic. There were almost 50,000 more deaths in October compared with the same month last year and, with a total 205,456 deaths, October accounted for more deaths than any other month in 10 years, according to the state statistics service Rosstat. Moscow rolled out its Sputnik V vaccine to doctors, teachers and social workers last weekend and a senior official said on Thursday that vaccinations would begin across the country by the end of the week. There are concerning signs of a possible resurgence of infections in the UK, where a member of the government’s scientific advisory group, Sage, has warned people to respect social distancing measures. Speaking in a personal capacity, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter told the BBC: The downward trend that happened after the higher tiers and lockdown has now stopped, cases are going up. [There are] 350, 400 deaths a day in the UK – that’s about 10,000 a month. And these are real deaths. These are extra deaths that would not have happened normally. They are from Covid, they are not just with Covid. I am sure people wanted a downward trend before Christmas to produce a, kind of, buffer before the Christmas season, because there is bound to be some effect. Now, I wouldn’t want to say what the size of that effect is going to be because it depends crucially on people’s behaviour. And, how much they obey the rules and are sensible. Asked why there would be a Christmas impact on Covid, he said: Because there will be more travel. People will be mixing. And we can just see how behaviour just influences things. This could be just a blip, and it might not be that big, I wouldn’t want to say. I think we need to look beyond that towards the whole winter, I think. We can’t make this disappear and we can’t let it get out of control. And, it won’t get out of control... that won’t be allowed to happen. So, it’s keeping a lid on it. Germany must go into a hard lockdown immediately to slow the spread, its interior minister Horst Seehofer has said, as the chancellor and the heads of the German states prepare to discuss further measures. He told Der Spiegel magazine: The only chance to regain control of the situation is a lockdown, but this must happen immediately. If we wait until Christmas, we’ll have to struggle with high numbers for months. The nation reported its worst daily numbers of infections and deaths on Friday. Russia reported 613 deaths in the last 24 hours on Friday; its worst daily toll so far. That takes its official cumulative death toll from the pandemic to 45,893. Authorities confirmed 28,585 new infections nationally, including 7,215 in Moscow, pushing the national case total to 2,597,711. The main priority of the UK government is to keep children in school, its culture secretary Oliver Dowden has said. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, he said: We are doing everything we can first of all to prioritise kids remaining in schools, and the vast majority of children remain in schools. And, secondly, to ensure that schools continue to be a safe place – and I pay tribute to teachers and head teachers and all the work they have done. When asked why England wasn’t following Wales lead and closing schools, he said the government’s testing plans had the objective of keeping pupils in education through mass testing. The German chancellor Angela Merkel and the premiers of the nation’s 16 federal states will discuss new anti-pandemic measures on Sunday, the government of the southwestern state of Baden-Wuerttemberg has said. It added that a “hard lockdown” until at least 10 January was necessary in the state to bring down the number of infections. Germany reported its worst daily numbers of infections and deaths on Friday. The European Union’s most populous nation went into a partial lockdown early last month, closing restaurants and bars and limiting the number of people allowed to meet. But schools and shops have remained open. Merkel has urged German states, which are responsible for most disease-control measures, to introduce tougher measures before Christmas, but has met resistance. However, most state governments agree on introducing tougher measures after Christmas. The French culture minister Roselyne Bachelot has requested an extra €35m (£31m, $42m) to help cultural venues that will not reopen as planned on 15 December, as France seeks to stave off a third wave. She has told BFM Television: We already provided €7.5bn in aid to the sector. I told the prime minister that we would need an extra €35m to help the sector go through the end of the year. I know I will get that. France will not reopen museums, cinemas and theatres next week as planned because infection rates are not falling as fast as the government hoped, the prime minister Jean Castex said on Thursday. Hong Kong’s government has secured millions of doses of vaccines for delivery as soon as January, the territory’s leader Carrie Lam has announced. Assuming we adopt the two-dose regime, we need to procure 30m doses, and I’m happy to report that ... we have made a breakthrough and reached an agreement with two manufacturers. Lam said Hong Kong has signed advance procurement orders with the mainland Chinese pharmaceutical firm Sinovac, as well as Pfizer, to supply 7.5m vaccines each. The first batch of 1m doses will arrive early next year, she said. Officials are also on the cusp of securing a deal with AstraZeneca for 7.5m doses of its vaccine and are striving to secure a deal with a fourth supplier. Our next step is for the HKSAR government to be fully prepared to provide vaccination for the public. Based on WHO advice “and common sense”, elderly people – especially those in residential care homes – would be prioritised; alongside healthcare workers, chronic patients and care home staff. This accounts for about 3 million people. Lam said advance orders mean those delivered may not have gone through all clinical trials or received approval yet. This is unlike normal procurement procedures. The policy objective is to provide free vaccines for the 7.5m people in Hong Kong. This was why they are procuring different options from at least two manufacturers, she said. Swissmedic has said it received additional details from companies on their vaccines that would enable it to issue authorisations quickly once sufficient data on safety, efficacy and quality were available. However, it added: “An emergency approval for vaccines is not a legal option in Switzerland,” the agency said, ruling out what it called “premature vaccinations” for the Alpine country. The world’s eyes are on the UK as the first country to approve and roll out a vaccine – from Pfizer and its partner BioNTech. Switzerland said this month it has signed a contract to deliver 3m doses of the same vaccine. It has also signed agreements with Moderna and AstraZeneca. An emergency approval for vaccines is not a legal option in Switzerland, the nation’s agency for therapeutic products has said. Swissmedic works closely with international partner authorities and reviews all applications for Covid-19 vaccines as a matter of urgency and in a ‘rolling’ procedure. Hello, I’m taking over from Helen Sullivan and will be with you for the next few hours. If you’d like to get in touch, your best bet’s probably Twitter, where I’m KevinJRawlinson. A couple of pulled apart liquorice allsorts; laboratory sample tubes; several wooden blocks that cost US$225 – in 2020, anything can be a nativity. This week the internet gathered around to puzzle over a festive selection of “minimalist nativity sets” discovered by a Twitter user Kirby Jones, in a post that has been liked nearly half a million times. The four sets discovered by Jones inspired others to post their own favourite odd nativities – fitting for a year in which the coronavirus pandemic means Christmas looks very different. In one a science-themed version, an angel’s halo was made from the cap liner of a cryotube. In others, Poker chips and cacti played the three wise men. In what one user claimed was “accidental minimalist activity”, but could have been a holy apparition – a toilet roll symbolised the newborn Baby Jesus, who slept in the heavenly peace under the watchful gaze of two cans of toilet spray. In other minimalist nativities, the role of Baby Jesus was performed by an old slice of apple, a bottle of pills, a miniature jar of raspberry jam, Pikachu, a purple earplug, salt, and a grape: An experimental Covid-19 vaccine developed by Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline showed an insufficient immune response in clinical trial results, the French drugmaker said on Friday, a blow to efforts to fight the pandemic, Reuters reports. The two companies said they planned to launch another study next year, hoping to come up with a more effective vaccine by the end of 2021. The news comes as a disappointment for a crop of vaccines under development that rely on more conventional proven designs as the shot developed by Pfizer and BioNTech using breakthrough technology gets rolled out across Britain. Friday’s results, Sanofi said, showed “an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen.” Phase III studies were expected to start this month. Sanofi said it would launch a phase 2b study in February of next year instead after a recent challenge study in non-human primates performed with an improved antigen formulation demonstrated better effects. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: FDA panel approves Pfizer vaccine. A panel of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted overwhelmingly to recommend emergency-use authorization of a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and its German partner, BioNTech SE. Canada could start vaccinations within days. Canada on Wednesday approved the use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE and vaccinations are expected to start next week with high-risk people such as healthcare workers receiving the first doses. Rebound in carbon emissions expected in 2021 after fall caused by Covid. Greenhouse gas emissions, which plunged by a record amount this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, are set to rebound next year as restrictions are lifted further and governments strive to return their economies to growth, according to a global study. Biden advisor delivers stern Christmas warning. A top coronavirus adviser to President-elect Joe Biden delivered a stern holiday message to Americans on Thursday - “no Christmas parties” - and warned they face a Covid-19 siege for weeks to come despite the latest moves toward US government approval of a vaccine. South Korea mobilises military to help frontline workers. South Korea will mobilise military forces in the capital Seoul to help frontline health workers deal with a surge in coronavirus, with 689 new cases reported on Friday, and as the death toll and number of patients in critical care rose. Advisers to Mexican health regulator to review Pfizer vaccine on Friday. An advisory committee for Mexican health regulator Cofepris will review Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine application on Friday, a health official said, as the country registered another 11,897 coronavirus cases and 671 more deaths. Australia terminates vaccine deal with after false positives for HIV. The Australian government has terminated its agreement with Australian biotech company CSL Limited to supply 51m doses of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland, after vaccine trial participants returned false positive test results for HIV. An experimental Covid-19 vaccine of Sanofi and Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline showed an insufficient immune response in clinical trial results, the French drugmaker said on Friday, a blow to efforts to find ways to fight the pandemic, Reuters reports.

The eureka moment that helped Masahiro Hara perfect the Quick Response, or QR code, sprang from a lunchtime game of Go more than a quarter of a century ago. He was playing the ancient game of strategy at work when the stones arranged on the board revealed the solution to a problem troubling the firm’s clients in Japan’s car industry – and which is now being repurposed as a weapon in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. As an employee of the automotive components firm Denso Wave, Hara had been fielding requests from factories to come up with a better way to manage their inventories of an ever-expanding range of parts. Workers wanted a less labour-intensive way to store more information, including kana and kanji characters, but the barcodes then in use could hold only 20 or so alphanumeric characters of information each. In some cases, a single box of components carried as many as 10 barcodes that had to be read individually. Having helped develop a barcode reader in the early 1980s, Hara knew the method had its limitations. “Having to read so many barcodes in a day was very inefficient, and workers were tired of scanning boxes multiple times,” Hara, now a chief engineer at the company, said in an online interview from its headquarters in Aichi prefecture, central Japan. “We had been making barcode readers for 10 years so we had the knowhow. I was looking at the board and thought the way the stones were lined up along the grids … could be a good way of conveying lots of information at the same time”: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 29,875 to 1,272,078, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Friday. The reported death toll rose by 598 to 20,970. Following that news, Australian prime minister Scott Morrison says Covid-19 vaccines will be approved on ‘an Australian timetable’ after a vaccine developed at the University of Queensland was cancelled when participants returned false positive test results for HIV. While the UK and US have approved a vaccine by Pfizer, Morrison says Australia won’t be rushed into a decision. ‘We want to ensure that Australians, and I think all of us feel very strongly this way, have full confidence, absolute full confidence that when it gets the tick they can get the jab,’ he says: The Australian government has terminated its agreement with Australian biotech company CSL Limited to supply 51m doses of a Covid-19 vaccine being developed by the University of Queensland, after vaccine trial participants returned false positive test results for HIV. Australia had hoped the protein vaccine would be available by mid-2021. Phase one clinical trials in humans began in July in Brisbane, with phase two and three clinical trials due to commence in December. It is one of four vaccines secured by the Australian government: Mexico’s coronavirus spokesman said Thursday the country’s median age of death from Covid-19 was a shockingly young 55, as compared to an average of 75 in many European countries, AP reports. Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell said that nonetheless, Mexico’s future coronavirus vaccination program would target the oldest Mexicans first. López-Gatell said the country’s high rates of obesity, diabetes and hypertension explained Mexico’s lower average age of death. He said Mexico has among the highest rate of obesity in the world. López-Gatell said Mexico’s approval for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine could come Friday. But he said all acquisitions of vaccines would be at the federal level, and that individual state governments could not purchase their own. That came after one opposition-party state governor said some fellow governors were weighing acquiring vaccines on their own. Mexico has seen a total of 1,217,126 test-confirmed coronavirus cases and 112,326 confirmed deaths, although official estimates of deaths are closer to 150,000. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been named Time magazine’s person – or persons – of the year for 2020 for their performance in the US’s pandemic election: The magazine said: “Together, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris offered restoration and renewal in a single ticket. And America bought what they were selling: after the highest turnout in a century, they racked up 81 million votes and counting, the most in presidential history, topping Trump by some 7 million votes and flipping five battleground states.” An advisory committee for Mexican health regulator Cofepris will review Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine application on Friday, a health official said, as the country registered another 11,897 coronavirus cases and 671 more deaths. Cofepris’ New Molecules Committee will meet at noon for the review, which deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell described as similar to the meeting of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration on Thursday. The US advisory committee voted overwhelmingly to endorse emergency use of Pfizer’s vaccine, paving the way for the FDA’s authorisation. “The moment of launching the vaccination in Mexico is coming closer,” Lopez-Gatell told his nightly news conference on Thursday, without specifying when Cofepris could make a final determination. Pfizer submitted details about its vaccine to Cofepris last month. Mexico’s government has already inked an agreement with Pfizer to acquire 34.4 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, with the first batch expected to arrive this month. Mexico has recorded 1,217,126 coronavirus cases and 112,326 deaths. Officials say the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher. In the US, the speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives died of Covid-19, a medical examiner ruled Thursday, a day after the Republican’s unexpected death, raising concerns that other members of one of the world’s largest legislative bodies might have been exposed at their swearing-in last week, Reuters reports. Dick Hinch, who was sworn in 2 December as leader of the state’s newly Republican-led, 400-member Legislature, died Wednesday. He was 71 and had been starting his seventh two-year term in the state House. His death was announced Wednesday night by his office, which did not give details of what it called “this unexpected tragedy.” Hinch is the first New Hampshire speaker to die during the session, according to House Clerk Paul Smith. The swearing-in of the House and the 24-member state Senate was held outdoors at the University of New Hampshire because of the coronavirus pandemic. Hinch was photographed wearing a mask, though it did not cover his nostrils. More than a quarter of House members, most of them Democrats, skipped the ceremony after learning the day before that several Republican lawmakers had tested positive for the virus after attending a Nov. 20 indoor GOP caucus meeting where many attendees weren’t wearing masks. The British government’s test-and-trace programme to combat Covid-19 has repeatedly failed to meet targets for delivering test results and contacting infected people despite costs escalating to £22bn, a damning official report has revealed. The National Audit Office (NAO) has found that the centralised programme is contacting two out of every three people who have been close to someone who has tested positive, with about 40% of test results delivered within 24 hours, well below the government’s targets. The report said a target to provide results within 24 hours of in-person testing deteriorated to a low of 14% in mid-October before rising to 38% in early November. Call handler contracts for those working on test and trace were worth up to £720m but many staff had very little to do, auditors said. By 17 June, the utilisation rate – the proportion of time that someone actively worked during their paid hours – was 4% for health professionals and 1% for call handler staff, the report shows: South Korea will mobilise military forces in the capital Seoul to help frontline health workers deal with a surge in coronavirus, with 689 new cases reported on Friday, and as the death toll and number of patients in critical care rose. Reuters: Of the new cases, 673 were locally transmitted, which brings the total tally to 40,786, the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency said. The death toll increased by eight to 572 deaths. The surge in cases has delivered a blow to South Korea’s vaunted pandemic-fighting system which successfully used invasive tracing, testing and quarantine to avoid lockdowns and blunt previous waves, and keep infections below 50 per day for much of the summer. The authorities scrambled to build hospital beds in shipping containers this week to ease strains on medical facilities stretched by the latest coronavirus wave. The number of patients in serious or severe conditions have grown near 170, prompting the health authorities to seek more beds nationwide. Calling the current wave a critical crisis, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said he will dispatch around 800 military, police and government workers in every district of the greater Seoul area to help track down potential patients. Frontline workers and medical staff are struggling each day to conduct endless epidemiological investigations, testing and securing insufficient beds, as the confirmed cases grow in various areas including the metropolitan Seoul area, Chung told a government meeting on Friday. “In the end, in order to tamp down this wave, it is key to seize the victory in virus-prevention efforts in the greater Seoul area,” said Chung. The majority of the new cases have been reported in the capital city of Seoul, the neighbouring port city of Incheon, and Gyeonggi Province, which is home to 13.5 million people and surrounds both cities. Looking back at 2020: a year like no other A look back at how the Guardian covered a year that began with the outbreak of a pandemic, witnessed global anti-racism protests after the killing of George Floyd, and ended with the voting out of President Donald Trump: Have you made a nativity set, no matter how simple (or complicated)? Let me know on Twitter: A panel of outside advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted overwhelmingly to recommend emergency-use authorization of a vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and its German partner, BioNTech SE. The FDA is expected to grant approval within days, paving the way for a mass inoculation campaign unparalleled in US history to be launched as early as next week. The advisory panel is due to review a second vaccine from Moderna Inc next week. A top coronavirus adviser to President-elect Joe Biden delivered a stern holiday message to Americans on Thursday - “no Christmas parties” - and warned they face a Covid-19 siege for weeks to come despite the latest moves toward US government approval of a vaccine. “The next three to six weeks at minimum ... are our Covid weeks,” Dr. Michael Osterholm, a member of Biden’s coronavirus advisory board, told CNN. “It won’t end after that, but that is the period right now where we could have a surge upon a surge upon a surge.” Osterholm stressed that it would be several months before the nation sees widespread availability of vaccines, the first of which cleared a key US regulatory hurdle on Thursday. Nevertheless, Osterholm said sizeable quantities of vaccines would not be available to the public at large before March or April. Healthcare workers and nursing home residents are likely to be designated as first in line for the shots. Osterholm’s blunt admonition came as Covid-19 caseloads soared higher, straining healthcare systems in cities and small towns across the country and leaving intensive care units in hundreds of hospitals at or near capacity. He urged Americans to do their utmost to slow the contagion by limiting social interactions to members of their immediate households, and above all, “No Christmas parties.” “There is not a safe Christmas party in this country right now,” he said. Greenhouse gas emissions, which plunged by a record amount this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, are set to rebound next year as restrictions are lifted further and governments strive to return their economies to growth, according to a global study. The UK showed the second biggest fall in emissions globally, down 13% for the year compared with 2019, with only France showing a larger drop, of 15%. The plunge reflects the prolonged and severe lockdowns in both countries, with surface transport particularly affected: In 2020 Pantone’s colour of the year choice, Classic Blue, proved eerily prescient. Announced weeks before the first Covid-19 cluster was discovered, it is a shade used for medical scrubs around the globe. Perhaps knowing that lightning is unlikely to strike twice, for 2021 the US-paint brand’s team of trend forecasters have selected two shades – Ultimate Grey and Illuminating – the second time they have done so in the Colour of the Year’s two decade history. Used by fashion, graphic and interior designers, the Pantone Institute’s colour matching services are a resource for predicting palettes that might prove popular with consumers. Their colour of the year choices are often contentious. This year, the combination has been likened to the shades of hi-vis vests, road markings and “screaming sickly urban melancholy, a brutalist facade, cold sunshine and cement”. Vogue described it simply as “really weird”: Canada on Wednesday approved the use of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc and its German partner BioNTech SE and vaccinations are expected to start next week with high-risk people such as healthcare workers receiving the first doses. Canada would receive 30,000 doses next week and up to 249,000 by the end of the year. The following are the current plans by the 10 provinces and three territories to start inoculations: Immunisation in Canada’s worst-affected province may start on 14 December at two nursing homes. The initial batch is expected to be 4,875 doses. Canada’s most populous province and the second-worst affected province will start immunisation on 15 December. It expects to receive 6,000 doses on Monday that it will split between two cities, the head of the province’s vaccine deployment program said. Another 90,000 doses are expected by the end of December. Hello and welcome to today’s live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. My name is Helen Sullivan and I’ll be bringing you the latest Covid news from around the world for the next few hours.

The initial batch is expected to be 4,875 doses. More on this shortly. Meanwhile the global coronavirus infections total is nearing a staggering 70m. US records more than 3,000 Covid deaths a day for the first time. The US recorded its highest level of coronavirus deaths in a single day on Wednesday, just two weeks after the Thanksgiving holiday period when health experts warned Americans not to travel or gather. London has highest Covid-19 case rate in England. London had the highest prevalence of Covid-19 cases in the week to 6 December, Public Health England (PHE) said, raising the prospect the capital will be moved into the strictest level of restrictions in the coming days. Spain’s March-May Covid-19 death toll nearly 70% above official count - stats institute. Spain’s coronavirus death toll between March and May was almost 70% higher than the official count at the time, data from the National Statistics Institute showed, prompting the opposition to complain of a government cover-up. Africa disease control head calls on rich nations to share excess Covid-19 vaccine doses. Countries that have ordered more Covid-19 vaccines than they need should consider distributing excess doses to Africa, the head of the continent’s disease control body said. Decomposing mink in Denmark ‘may have contaminated groundwater’. Decomposing mink buried in mass graves in Denmark after being culled because of coronavirus fears may have contaminated the groundwater, local radio has reported, as parliament announced a commission to investigate the government’s actions. Berlin wants to close shops and extend school holidays to fight case rises. Berlin’s mayor, Michael Müller, said he would seek the approval of the city’s parliament next Tuesday to close stores apart from supermarkets until 10 January, and also to extend the school break until that date or put lessons online for a week. Welsh secondaries and colleges to shut on Monday to stem Covid spread. Secondary schools and colleges in Wales will move to online learning from Monday in a “national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus”, the country’s education minister has said. Israel abandons Covid-19 curfew plan ahead of Hanukkah. Israel reversed plans to impose a night-time curfew meant to prevent a new wave of coronavirus infections, minutes before the start of a Jewish holiday. Canary Islands removed from UK travel corridor list. The Canary Islands have been removed from the UK travel corridors list, meaning people arriving in the UK from the popular Spanish islands from 4am on Saturday must self-isolate. Rich countries leaving rest of the world behind on Covid vaccines, warns Gates Foundation. It could be too late for any kind of fair distribution of coronavirus vaccines because of the deals already made by rich countries, according to Mark Suzman, chief executive of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation."

          "headline": "The magnifying glass: how Covid revealed the truth about our world",
          "bodyText": "What might be the enduring symbol of the coronavirus that turned our world upside down in 2020? Might it be those Thursday evenings of spring and summer when, at the stroke of 8pm, Britons overcame the national traits of embarrassment and reserve and ventured out on to the doorstep to applaud doctors, nurses and key workers, banging saucepans and nodding to neighbours in a synchronised “clap for carers”? Or might it be the first sign that trouble was coming this way, that footage of Italians singing to each other from their balconies in a ritual that seemed as exotic, distant and unlikely then as the very notion of a “lockdown”, back before that dramatically punitive word lost its sting? A chequerboard computer screen of faces as Zoom became the prime means of face-to-face contact with those who didn’t live under one roof? The smaller, quieter sight of families visiting grandparents but getting no further than the garden path, toddlers waving through the glass at elderly relatives? Or maybe something hopeful, perhaps one of those moments from the last weeks of the year that seemed to promise an ending, as scientists announced their breakthrough in finding a vaccine. It could be the pictures of Maggie Keenan, aged 90, becoming the first person in the world to get the jab. Or if a bleaker snapshot was more fitting, it might be an image of an event that recurred throughout 2020: the sparsely attended funeral, mourners kept distant from each other if they were allowed to be present at all. Or the priest in Burnley breaking down in tears as he described bringing food parcels to families so poor, their deprivation deepened by the pandemic, that the children would rip the bags open to get at the food before he’d even got through the door. Perhaps the lasting motif will not be a scene but an object. Say, the simple face mask, an item that once seemed alien and even frightening but is now commonplace, even if it never quite stopped looking and feeling strange. Maybe it will be those signs that were tied to lamp-posts or marked out on paths in public parks, reminding us to keep 2 metres apart. Alternatively, it could be a gesture, the elbow bump that gained currency when the crisis first hit. Or maybe the symbol that will linger will be the graphic rendering of the dreaded virus itself, an attempt to make the invisible visible: that cartoonish image of a spiked ball, like a festive orange studded with cloves. But there is another, less literal candidate. It would be apt because it would remind us what the coronavirus did to us and to our world. A fitting symbol of this global pandemic would be a magnifying glass. For while the virus ended and upended so many lives, and spawned a whole new vocabulary – social distancing, furlough, herd immunity, R number, circuit breaker, bubble, unmute – it did not remake the global landscape so much as reveal what was already there, or what was taking shape, just below the surface. It amplified it, sometimes distorting it, sometimes illuminating it in alarming detail. Covid‑19, the disease that was first reported to the World Health Organization one year ago this month, served as a lens through which we were able to see our politics, our planet and ourselves with a new and shocking clarity. It made 2020 a year of revelation, even if what was uncovered was not nearly as new as we might imagine. Perhaps that was most apparent at the top. Even as the virus forced billions to cover their faces, it ripped the mask from so many of our leaders. Naturally, the most lurid case was that of Donald Trump. At the end of last year, plenty of sage observers of the United States – including one, Prof Allan Lichtman, whose model had correctly predicted every election since he devised it nearly 40 years ago – believed that 2020 would see Trump elected to a second term. The economy was thriving and, despite all of Trump’s excesses, the signs were strong that he would elbow his way to victory. But Covid magnified Trump, enlarging his faults so they became too frightening to miss. It showed him as lacking even the most rudimentary empathy: not once did he channel the anxiety or grief that his nation was feeling, even as the US death toll rose and rose. It showed him to be dishonest, insisting that the virus was about “to disappear”, like “a miracle”, that it would “go away” when the weather got warmer, that it was “fading”, that America was “rounding the corner” even though the infection rate was scaling new heights. And it showed him to have contempt for facts and science, regularly contradicting and undermining the doctors leading the US response to Covid, including the veteran specialist in infectious diseases, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the defining faces of 2020. Trump urged his supporters to “liberate” themselves from lockdown, even as the disease was running rampant. At one point, Trump suggested Americans should fight the virus by injecting themselves with bleach. Convinced that a thriving economy would see him win in November, he was determined to pretend that life could function as normal, that masks and distancing were for cowards and losers. Even when he was infected and hospitalised in October, after a maskless super-spreader event at the White House, that remained the message. His most devoted followers swallowed it because, for four years, they had swallowed everything, trusting him more than any expert or authority – more than their own eyes. Of course, none of this came as news to anyone who had been paying attention. The callousness and the disregard for facts had always been true of Trump and the post-truth, anti-science information cocoon he had built for his devotees, a place where they might huddle together and stay warm. But Covid illuminated those traits of Trump’s more brightly, more lethally, than ever before, just as it confirmed the riven state of contemporary America – a country where even the wearing of a mask could become a cultural and political signifier, revealing on which side of the great divide you stood, red or blue, Donald Trump or Joe Biden, conspiracy theory or science. And so Americans kept dying, the daily death toll rising above 3,000 in early December – each day a new Pearl Harbor, a new 9/11 – the total on course to reach 300,000 by year’s end. The economy went into reverse and Trump’s ratings refused to rise. Even in a year when Democrats in general slipped back, performing less well in 2020 than they had in the midterms of 2018, Trump lost an election he had once looked set to win. The pandemic had undone him. Under the lens of Covid, he had withered. Trump was only the most garish example of a pattern that became identifiable across the globe. The populist loudmouths, the braggarts whose stock in trade was railing against the experts, imagining themselves to be free of the laws of factual reality, fared badly against a threat as real as the virus, a menace that could not be talked away with a rally, an insult or a joke. Several contracted it themselves, Boris Johnson and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil succumbing early. But their countries struggled too. Both Britain and Brazil won unwanted places in the mortality top 10, measuring total deaths by coronavirus relative to population size. At the time of writing, Britain ended the year as the fifth most lethal country in the world, thanks to a death rate of 873 per million people. Germany, led by the research chemist Angela Merkel, was in 56th place, with 200 deaths per million. Again, none of this was exactly novel. Even before the pandemic struck, it was clear that Merkel and others valued quiet, technocratic competence while Johnson’s administration was built on slogans and myths, rhetoric and promises, prizing chummy loyalty over the hard graft of good governance. But Covid put that contrast in lights. Johnson and his team handled the crisis with an ineptitude stunning in its consistency. Even while Italians were screaming from their rooftops that the virus was coming our way and that we had to lock down, Johnson was still bragging about shaking hands and giving the green light to mass gatherings, whether at football matches, pop concerts or the Cheltenham Gold Cup – events that were all later linked to spikes in infection. Everyone with a GCSE in science knew that lockdown would have to come sooner or later, but the government chose later – a delay that, had it been avoided, would have saved at least 20,000 lives, at least according to Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London. Even once the lockdown came, there were curious blind spots. It was not total: up to 20 million air travellers flew into the UK during that first wave, unhindered by even the most basic checks. And despite government promises of a “protective ring” thrown around care homes, the opposite was true. Elderly people were discharged from hospitals and back into care homes without being tested, so seeding a pandemic within the pandemic. * * * Britain was slow to get hold of the personal protective equipment it needed, shelling out some £17bn in a supermarket sweep in which millions was funnelled to companies with no track record in the field but with the advantage of friends in high places. In November, the National Audit Office revealed the existence of a “VIP lane” for those would-be suppliers lucky enough to have a friend in parliament or in ministerial office. If you were so blessed, you were more than 10 times likelier than a regular bidder to hit the jackpot and bag a lucrative government contract. Again, to learn that Britain is a chumocracy where it pays to know the right people was hardly a stunning surprise. But Covid left no doubt. It was the same story with the “test and trace” saga. Having abandoned community testing, flirting instead with the notion of herd immunity, the government then had to catch up. But the record was, once more, one of cronyism and failure. Testing apps that failed to work; tracers hired with next to no training, left idle and unused for shift after shift; a computer system that offered people tests at the opposite end of the country; stats that suggested a mere 11% of those contacted went ahead and isolated for 14 days. It was called NHS test and trace, trading off the public affection, even reverence, for the National Health Service – a civic religion whose status was magnified in this year of the pandemic – but the work was contracted out to private firms such as Serco and Sitel. Through it all, Johnson – a leader for sunny days who found himself facing a hurricane – tried to dodge his duty to deliver bad news. Again and again, he served up false cheer. In March he said we would “send coronavirus packing” within 12 weeks. In July, he said it would all be over by Christmas. In mid-October, he rebuffed Labour calls for a second, circuit-breaking lockdown, adamant that such a move would be a “disaster”. But by Halloween he was back on TV, announcing – guess what – a second English lockdown. It worked so well that whole areas of the country emerged from it only to be placed into a higher “tier” than the one they were in before. Ahead now is a five-day easing of restrictions for Christmas, but that relaxation was never related to any letup in the virus itself. Rather, it was born of the sense that if tighter restrictions remained in place for the holiday season, they would just be ignored. Better to adapt the law than for the law to be an ass. Many Britons, like their counterparts in the US, spent much of 2020 lamenting their misfortune in being saddled with such woefully inferior leadership at a time when they were reminded anew how much quality at the top matters. They eyed the likes of Merkel or Jacinda Ardern in New Zealand – steady, sober, serious – just as they marvelled at the competence on display in South Korea, Vietnam or Taiwan, where the total number of deaths were 526, 35 and seven respectively (and remember, the virus struck South Korea early). The contrast with their own, supposedly “world-beating” administrations was stark. As if to fill the vacuum, leadership came from other quarters, some of them unexpected. In the first lockdown, it was not the prime minister, itching to channel Winston Churchill, who found the right register but rather the woman whom Churchill had once served as prime minister: namely, the Queen. In a rare TV address to the nation, she promised that “We will meet again”, a nod to wartime and to Vera Lynn that simultaneously warned the country that this was as mortal a threat as war, and reminded us that we’d got through worse. Next in line was someone more than 70 years younger. Somehow it fell to Manchester United’s striker Marcus Rashford to articulate the sentiment that a moment of peril demanded more from us, that we had to look after each other better. His campaign for the extended provision of free school meals in England to the poorest and hungriest children spoke to Britons’ better angels, and forced a government U-turn – twice. The coronavirus also placed a magnifying lens over one fact that was true but perhaps not quite so vividly clear before the pandemic: that this is a disunited kingdom. That was conspicuously true in a practical way: thanks to devolution, the UK became a patchwork of differing rules and regulations, so that the once-mundane business of social interaction depended on which of the four nations you were in. While a pint in a pub might be legal in England, you had to check whether it was permitted in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The rule of six might allow you to host a gathering of six relatives plus a baby on one side of the border, but the baby might count as one of the six on the other. Of course, devolution had been a fact of British life since 1999. But never was the variance between the UK’s constituent nations so manifest or so intrusive into quotidian life. Still, those were hardly the divisions that mattered most. Inequality is so entrenched, it can feel like a law of nature. Even so, the coronavirus lens managed to magnify it in new and sharp ways. US politicians like to speak of the difference between jobs where you shower before you go to work and jobs where you shower once you get home. In the age of Covid, that distinction between white- and blue-collar labour found a new form: those who could work from home, and those who couldn’t. A gulf rapidly opened between those who complained about Zoom fatigue, laughing about dressing to impress above the waist while wearing leisurewear below, and those who had no such option – those whose places of work were shut and who suddenly feared for their livelihoods. The former saw no hit to their income: on the contrary, now that their outgoings were sharply reduced, their finances became plumper – in the first half of 2020, UK household savings rose by £100bn. For some in that category, lockdown meant baking sourdough bread, learning a language or pausing to smell the roses. But for those on the other side of the WFH divide, especially those with jobs in retail or hospitality, contingent on actual places being open to actual people, lockdown meant waiting on furlough payments and government support, knowing that eventually the help would run out. It meant families living on top of each other, often in cramped flats that suddenly felt twice as small now that everyone was kept at home. It meant keeping children, at home from spring to autumn, from climbing the walls. * * * This was a global picture, the virus widening the chasm between the richest and poorest. The wealthiest got even wealthier. For the billionaire class, 2020 was a banner year, their fortunes topping $10.2tn (£7.6tn) in the summer – a giant increase on the year before, according to data from the Swiss bank UBS. The face of that enrichment was Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, whose pockets were filled by the pandemic and the dependency on home delivery it induced. In 2020 he became the first human being to have a personal fortune in excess of $200bn, that sum swollen every time someone, somewhere, preferred to click rather than don a mask and walk to a shop. And yet 2020 was also the year Britons used food banks in record numbers and the year when thousands of cars lined up in Dallas, Texas, queueing to get help at a “food distribution event”, with some 25,000 waiting in line on a single day. Underemployment, a lack of good, secure, well-paid, full-time jobs, had long been a problem in the UK and across the industrialised west. Covid magnified that into something even bigger: mass unemployment, on a scale unseen for decades. As Britain braced for the most severe economic contraction since the “great frost” of 1709, it was those with least who were hit hardest. According to the Legatum Institute, nearly 700,000 people, including 120,000 children, were driven into poverty in the UK by the pandemic. And because poverty is about flesh and blood, not just pounds and pence, that had lethal consequences. An analysis described by the BBC found that “the death rate from all causes between April and June in the most deprived areas was nearly double that of deaths in the least deprived parts of England.” The divide cut across multiple lines. It was regional, with north hit harder than south: that BBC study found that most of the top 10 towns and cities with the highest death rates were in northern England. It didn’t help that much of the north had to endure tougher, tier 3 restrictions for months on end without, at least according to the region’s leaders, the financial help that might have eased the pain. It was gendered. Though men seemed much likelier to die from Covid, it was women who were taking more of the strain. One survey found women reporting higher levels of anxiety over the virus than men, while later research produced the doubtless related finding that women were working harder and longer, now often doing their regular jobs from home as well as increased childcare. It concluded that women were 43% more likely than men to have increased their hours beyond the standard working week. The result: a rise in mental distress. And it was generational. The old suffered most directly, of course, as it was the over-85s who were most vulnerable to the disease: more than nine in 10 UK deaths from Covid were among those over 65, with the average age of the dead over 80, according to the Office for National Statistics. But although the young paid less of a mortal price, their lives were badly shaken. It might be the babies whose first months were deprived of the usual socialisation of seeing other babies. It could be the children who were home-schooled, the lucky ones treated to lessons in half-remembered maths from bleary-eyed parents coupled with the blessed relief of a Horrible Histories video, the less fortunate given next to no education from March to September so that a London School of Economics study in October warned of “permanent educational scarring” among a cohort of students who had lost time and teaching they would never get back. Even among those less lastingly damaged, the cancellation of exams may have brought a fleeting surge of relief, but that soon gave way to a sense of unfinished business: they had been denied the closure of completion. Sixteen-year-olds had lost out on the post-exam summer that represents a coming of age: those sweet weeks of abandon and the first taste of adulthood. Eighteen-year-olds saw university places, and the dreams that went with them, slip through their fingers. Both were subject to the whims of an algorithm that, before its calculations were discarded – in yet another government cockup – looked with favour on children lucky enough to go to schools that had done well in the past, especially private ones. The coronavirus lens magnified a pattern of British life that predated the disease, a pattern indeed that predates us all: to those with much, more shall be given. Those already at university found themselves either sent home or locked up, while graduates were pushed out into a job market that had rarely looked colder or more deserted. One recruiter reported a 60% fall in the first half of the year in advertised roles for those with a degree. The wider picture was not much better. Sixteen- to 24-year-olds accounted for almost 60% of the total fall in employment during the pandemic, with youth unemployment on course to hit 17% by the end of this year. That’s partly because of the jobs that young people do: under-25s were much more likely to work in areas hit by social-distancing requirements, hospitality the most obvious. But it was also further confirmation of a trend in British life visible long before the coronavirus: saddled with student debt and thwarted by the shortage of affordable housing, the young are becoming the poor relations of their parents. Even inside companies, you could see it with awkward clarity: Zoom calls where older staff had a backdrop of a study in a spacious house, talking to younger colleagues perched on the end of a bed in a rented room. Coronavirus was unforgiving like that, magnifying the blemishes on the skin of our society, showing up the deep lines that divide it. And given that it did that for regional, class, gender and age divisions, it was scarcely a surprise that it exposed racial inequality too. Among men in England and Wales, those of black African background had the highest Covid-related rate of death: 2.7 times higher than that of white males. Among women, the highest death rate was among women of black Caribbean background, almost twice that of white women. There was no escaping it. Covid killed black and minority ethnic people in disproportionate numbers. Was there a physiological or even genetic explanation for that, perhaps rooted in a greater incidence among BAME communities of pre-existing conditions such as respiratory illness, heart disease and diabetes? The ONS put greater weight on matters of geography and income: where people lived and how much they earned. Experts pointed to the fact that black and Asian people were disproportionately likely to be in public-facing jobs – in hospitals and care homes, on buses and trains – or in multigenerational households, where they were at greater risk of being exposed to the virus. Strictly speaking, it was a separate matter, unrelated to Covid, but it was grimly fitting that the other great upheaval of 2020 – the Black Lives Matter protests, where crowds gathered across the world, in city centres that had, until then, been empty, their faces covered by masks – had a slogan that carried an unintended echo of coronavirus and the way it kills. The phrase in question consisted of George Floyd’s last words, as he was beaten to death by Minneapolis police: I can’t breathe. Of course, the racial injustice highlighted by the BLM movement had always been there but it’s just possible that a global crisis somehow provided the space in which people could at last look it in the eye. The first phase of the pandemic brought grief and loss to many hundreds of thousands across the world – a tally of death that would eventually rise beyond 1.5m – but in among the fear and the stress, it also imposed a rare and unfamiliar pause. An old refrain, resonant because of its futility, is “Stop the world, I want to get off.” Covid seemed to offer that opportunity: for a while, the world came to a stop. It coincided with an uncommonly beautiful British spring. For those lucky enough to have outdoor space – a garden, a balcony, a patch of green – it felt like a chance to take a breath. People marvelled at the natural world they had previously ignored – plants or trees they had rushed past on their daily commute which, now that they took a daily walk around the neighbourhood instead, they saw, as if for the first time. A social media staple of the period was a photograph of a rare bird or unfamiliar animal spotted roaming deserted city streets, along with the caption: “Nature is healing.” It wasn’t a wholly fatuous claim. City centres previously choked with traffic were now easier on the lungs. You’d look upward and see skies clear of aircraft: passenger air travel was down 90% year on year in April and down by 75% even in August, when lockdowns had eased and millions would normally be thinking of a holiday. A pair of environmental scientists found that the pandemic response had significantly improved air quality in different cities across the world, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, lessened water and noise pollution, and contributed towards a possible “restoration of the ecological system”. Of course, there was a downside: an increase in medical waste, including plastics used for PPE, gloves and, inevitably, masks. Still, the year of the virus provided a glimpse of how things could be different. Those environmental researchers wondered if “the global response to Covid-19 also teaches us to work together to … save the Earth from the effects of global climate change”. Mike Clemence of the pollsters Ipsos reported that UK alertness to climate change – rising anyway since 2013 – increased by another five points this year. He picked up from his focus groups the view that 2020 might become a precedent, “a demonstration that large-scale social changes can be made pretty quickly – if people work with the government towards the same, simple goal”. It’s a hopeful thought. If we could show the same focus in facing down a persistent and gradual threat, the climate crisis, as we did in dealing with a sudden, immediate one, who knows what might be possible? The lens of coronavirus showed up a great deal that was already happening in our world, but it also magnified much about ourselves and the way we live. Trends that predated the pandemic were accelerated. Working from home was already on the rise, but it went from being an exception to the rule. Many white-collar staff and professionals suspect they might never again return to the office or, if they do, it will be for only a day or two a week. The default expectation that work means a commute to sit in a big room, surrounded by others staring at the same computer screens you could all be staring at in your homes – that expectation has surely gone for ever. Every company that got through the pandemic in one piece made the case for the burial of the office: by managing without it, they proved its dispensability. Some organisations have already sold up or cancelled the lease they had on premises, concluding they won’t be needing them any more. People were increasingly shopping online before 2020, and that trend too gathered pace: it’s estimated that the pandemic accelerated the shift from physical stores to digital shopping by about five years. You could see the evidence in the December collapse of Debenhams or the Arcadia group that included Topshop – and in the streets where once thriving shops were boarded up. The combined effect of those two trends, their tempo turned to a gallop by Covid, could be a wholesale remoulding of British towns and cities, whose centres were shaped over centuries to host work and commerce. Both those activities were already making their steady migration into our homes, but the pandemic gave them an extra shove. In 2020 we got a glimpse of a strange future: the high street deserted, while residential roads thronged with delivery drivers bringing to our door the things we used to go out to buy or consume with other people. Pubs were already closing at speed – 20 a week in 2019 – but the rolling waves of Covid restrictions, forcing pubs to close their doors for months at a time, proved too much even for many of those who had, until then, clung on. The result was a secondary pandemic – of loneliness. The war against the virus deprived people of elemental human contact; the phrase “social distancing” became all too real. After just a week of lockdown, the proportion of Britons reporting a bout of loneliness rose from one in 10 to one in four. And that, in turn, fed a deep hunger for togetherness. It was apparent in those first weeks of spring, when the sun shone and there was a sudden and welcome outbreak of community spirit, incarnated by that weekly round of 8pm applause. You could taste a solidarity that we might have heard about from parents or grandparents but had only rarely experienced for ourselves. For a while, there was a feeling – however brief or illusory – that we really were all in it together. You were locked down, but so was your boss and so were the most famous people in the world – some of them posting excruciating video messages to prove it. Perhaps that was why there was such a fierce reaction to Dominic Cummings and his violation of lockdown regulations, later justified with a comically unapologetic performance that centred on a claim to have driven to a Barnard Castle beauty spot solely to test his eyesight. It wasn’t just that Cummings had broken the rules; he had broken something we’d come to cherish: a sense of collective endeavour. He made those who had stayed at home and stayed away from their loved ones – even in their last, dying hours – feel like fools, suckers who had taken their leaders’ word at face value, not realising what the powerful had always known: that rules are made to be broken. Small wonder that public compliance after the Cummings affair never again reached the level it had achieved before. Scholars called it the Cummings effect. The bitterness of that betrayal will fade, not least because by year’s end Cummings had gone. But how much of the sentiment that made it sting – that sense of shared destiny and shared effort – will endure? Britons will surely remember the gratitude they felt for the nurses, doctors and care workers who protected them when coronavirus was still such a mysterious menace, when we didn’t know how – or how easily – we might catch it, or how deadly it could be. But the extension of that admiration for other key workers who were keeping the country going, perhaps that was more fragile. That the chancellor felt able to impose a public sector pay freeze in November on all but NHS and care staff suggested he, at least, had drawn that conclusion. Even so, the pandemic did allow us to learn again what we value most. Along with healthcare workers, scientists were the year’s heroes – a reminder that, when it comes to life and death, and despite Michael Gove’s notorious 2016 declaration, the country had not had enough of experts. On the contrary, we couldn’t get enough of them – urging them, begging them, to come up with a vaccine which, incredibly, they did, and with unprecedented speed. We learned who we are by what we missed. Life without even the possibility of a trip to the pub; a night of laughter at the theatre; tears at the cinema or the thrill of live music; an afternoon shouting yourself hoarse at the football; a quick chat over a drink or a long meal with friends; a few hours with your parents or your children; or a simple, wordless hug – that kind of life was hollow and hard. We longed to know those pleasures once more. The pandemic took away so many lives, but it also reminded us what life is for: the simple joy of being with other people, close enough to touch and be touched. Like a magnifying glass placed over each one of us, the virus revealed what is our greatest weakness but also our most precious strength: our need for each other.

          "bodyText": "In the fall of 2018, I released a research report warning of a growing trend of far-right radicalization on YouTube. Specifically, I identified a loosely connected network of reactionary YouTubers, ranging from mainstream conservatives and libertarians all the way to overt white supremacists and neo-Nazis, who were all broadcasting their political ideas to young audiences. Tethered together by a shared opposition to “social justice warriors” and the mainstream media, they frequently collaborated with each other and amplified each other’s content. In the process, they made it extremely easy for a viewer to move bit by bit into more extremist content. The following March, I watched in horror along with much of the rest of the world, as a white supremacist gunman killed 51 people and injured 40 more at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, New Zealand. Throughout the chaos of the day, researchers parsed his manifesto and found that under the layers of irony and memes, the message was quite clear. He had been radicalized to believe in the Great Replacement, a white nationalist conspiracy theory that claims that white populations are being purposefully replaced with (often Muslim) immigrants. The shooter’s manifesto clearly spelled out his racist and Islamophobic beliefs, but it provided scant information on how he came to embrace them. On Monday, with the release of the Royal Commission’s inquiry into the attacks, we got a fuller picture: the Christchurch shooter was radicalized on YouTube, by many of the propagandists myself and other researchers had warned about. So why didn’t YouTube take action sooner, and what should they be doing now? There are a million different ways YouTube could have been, and could be now, taking action. They could enforce their terms of service more aggressively, or make those terms more robust. They could make changes to their algorithm so it stops recommending ever-more-extreme content. They could de-prioritize borderline content that acts as a first step to radicalization. They could refine their content moderation algorithms to catch content more effectively. And, in fact, YouTube consistently claims it has done many of those things. And yet, there is often a great disconnect between what actions YouTube says it is taking and what users and creators actually experience. This is in part because these actions mean little if the platform has no clear idea of how it defines hate speech, extremism, harassment or borderline content and what values it seeks to uphold in its actions. Indeed, YouTube has often backed itself into a corner by attempting to stay as “apolitical” as possible and turning deeply value-based judgments into the parsing of minor details. In an attempt to avoid accusations of politicized censorship, the platform has frequently tied itself up in knots, focusing their decisions on the smallest technicalities when determining whether a piece of content has violated its terms. The great irony is that by attempting to stay apolitical, YouTube consistently makes the political choice not to care about or protect vulnerable communities. It can tweak its algorithms and update its policies as much as it likes, but it won’t truly address the underlying issues until it makes a firm commitment to protect Muslim creators and users of YouTube and to stop the spread of Islamophobia on their platform. This does not just mean stating this commitment clearly, although that would be a reasonable first step. (YouTube could, for example, follow the example of the New Zealand prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, and apologize for the role it played in facilitating the terrorist attack.) It also would mean devoting significant resources to it and framing their approach to content along those lines. Because, despite YouTube’s claims to be taking hate speech seriously, Islamophobia is still alive and well on the platform. Ben Shapiro, the conservative pundit who frequently promotes Islamophobic ideas, is thriving on YouTube, with almost 2.5 million subscribers and an additional 2.4 million on his outlet the Daily Wire. Stephen Crowder, a controversial creator with more than 5 million subscribers has claimed that “Islamophobia is a perfectly rational ‘phobia’,” among similar statements. This propaganda is coming not only from small, fringe creators but from some of the biggest political commentators on the platform. In the end, YouTube’s approach strangely mirrors that of the New Zealand government in the lead-up to the attack. Muslim community members interviewed for the commission’s report said they had been raising the alarm about rising Islamophobia to the government but that no one listened. As one Muslim New Zealander said, “The events of the day were presaged by so many tell-tale signs of its coming, all of which were evident and all of which were ignored by those who had power to act.” Instead, the government was hyper-focused on potential terrorist threats from Muslim individuals, leading one interviewee to say that “they were watching us, not watching our backs”. Likewise, social media platforms such as YouTube have consistently taken swift and decisive action against Isis recruitment channels and other threats they see coming from Muslim extremists while simultaneously allowing widespread Islamophobic content to thrive. For YouTube, just like the New Zealand government, the question is if they can watch the backs of Muslims instead of simply watching them.

          "headline": "Boris Johnson's year of U-turns: from Covid tests to free school meals",
          "bodyText": "He walked triumphantly back into No 10 wielding an increased majority a year ago to chants of “Get Brexit done”. But the tune soon changed and Boris Johnson has gone from “Mr Brexit to Mr U-turn”, in the words of one German newspaper, as he has lurched from disaster to disaster. Here we trace the winding road of his government’s many U-turns. Mass community testing 12 March 2020 One of the earliest and perhaps most damaging of the volte-faces of Johnson’s government was the decision to end the mass testing programme despite advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) that it was vital. Instead, Johnson announced that health workers would focus solely on testing those already in need of hospital care. The decision appeared all the more bizarre because the previous day NHS England had announced a “significant expansion of coronavirus testing” and insisted that the demand for tests had never exceeded its existing capacity. Announcing the decision, Johnson said: “I must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time.” The visa surcharge 21 May 2020 Johnson backed away from a policy that would have required people coming to the UK to work for the NHS to pay a health surcharge of hundreds of pounds, after criticism from his own party that it was “mean-spirited and immoral”. The prime minister waved away Labour pleas to exempt NHS staff – many of whom are on the minimum wage – from the charge, claiming it would contribute about £900m per year. The IFS later estimated that he had inflated the figure by an order of magnitude. The next day, shortly before he was due to take part in the weekly clap for carers that critics said betrayed his hypocrisy, Johnson backed down. Proxy voting 3 June 2020 The government resisted calls to allow proxy voting, insisting that shielding MPs be paired with an opponent who agrees not to vote to even things out. But only a day later, Boris Johnson relented under heavy criticism. Marcus Rashford’s free school meals campaign 16 June 2020 Downing Street was determined not to budge from its position of refusing to help feed hungry children outside of school term time in the face of a popular campaign led by the Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford – and signalled the strength of feeling by sending ministers out to do a round of media interviews. The next day, Johnson claimed to have only just learned what his own office had been doing and reversed the policy. He thanked Rashford for helping bring it to his attention, and the footballer later became an MBE. The NHS app 18 June 2020 In April the health secretary Matt Hancock, trumpeted plans for an NHS mobile app that he said would be “crucial” to stopping the virus spreading. Trials were undertaken and ministers continued to insist on pursuing the project, on which millions of pounds are believed to have been spent. Months later they finally acknowledged that warnings that the system would not work had been right all along and that the UK would now have to wait for an app being developed by major technology firms. It took until September for the UK to be equipped with a tool that Hancock had said was crucial in April. Face coverings in shops 14 July 2020 The government insisted in June that it was not necessary to make face coverings mandatory in shops because people would not be in close proximity for long. In July, ministers decided it was necessary to make face coverings mandatory in shops in England. Huawei ban 14 July 2020 Two in one day. Boris Johnson had refused to heed Washington’s warnings that Huawei posed a threat, signalling in January that he was minded to allow the Chinese firm to work on the UK’s 5G infrastructure. But he backtracked and it was announced that Huawei kit would be stripped out of the 5G phone networks by 2027. Exam results in England 15 August 2020 “Let’s be in no doubt about it, the exam results that we’ve got today are robust. They’re good, they’re dependable for employers,” Boris Johnson told the nation. His education secretary, Gavin Williamson, who had ignored warnings about the suitability of the algorithm used to produce them, added that there would be “no U-turn, no change”. Two days later the government U-turned, announcing there would indeed be a change. Face masks in schools 25 August 2020 Days before secondary schools in England were due to reopen, Johnson scrapped his government’s plan to advise against wearing face masks. That came only hours after one of his cabinet ministers had publicly insisted there were no plans to scrap the policy. Scores of headteachers had already stopped listening to Johnson’s advice and were planning to allow or encourage their pupils to wear face coverings in the communal areas of schools. The eviction ban 10 September 2020 Fears that an “avalanche” of homelessness could push up Covid infection rates forced a partial rethink of government plans to end a ban on evictions that was introduced during the first national lockdown. England’s second lockdown 31 October 2020 Scientific advisers recommended a two-week national “circuit breaker” lockdown for England in September. But Boris Johnson was resolute in his defiance, spending a month telling the country that to follow the advice would mean economic disaster. In October he announced a month-long national lockdown, saying “no responsible prime minister” could ignore how bad the situation had become. Furlough scheme extension 5 November 2020 The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, seen as a conservative voice on spending, had been looking to wind the furlough scheme down. But he was forced into a series of embarrassing climbdowns as the scale of the second coronavirus wave became apparent. Perhaps the most notable was the announcement that the scheme would be extended until March 2021. Marcus Rashford’s free school meals campaign – again 8 November 2020 The prime minister was bitten, yes. But he was not shy. Once again he stood defiantly against Rashford’s campaign to get the government to keep helping to feed children from poorer backgrounds during school holidays. Once again, he was forced into a U-turn. After spending weeks insisting he would not put up the money this time, ministers announced a £170m winter grant scheme for families struggling as a result of Covid-19."

          "bodyText": "The Australian government tabled world-first media legislation in parliament on Wednesday that will force Google and Facebook to negotiate a fair payment with news organisations for using their content in Facebook’s newsfeed and Google’s search. The Australian law is separate to a recent deal Facebook made to pay mainstream UK news outlets millions of pounds a year to license their articles, but has a similar motivation. The social network signed the deals as it faces the threat of a government crackdown over its dominance of online advertising. Why was the law necessary? The law has been designed to address the loss of advertising revenue from traditional media companies to the digital behemoths: for every $100 of online advertising spend, $53 goes to Google, $28 to Facebook and $19 to everyone else. The loss of advertising revenue has been partially offset by subscriptions but it hasn’t been enough to stem the cuts to newsrooms, journalists leaving the industry and media outlets going broke and closing. Meanwhile Google and Facebook are doing very well: Google made $4.3bn in advertising revenue in Australia last year and Facebook made $0.7bn, according to documents filed with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. Newspapers say Google makes money from news and analysis provided by media organisations, and users would find Google and Facebook much less helpful if no news appeared on their feeds or in their search results. The draft code was made more urgent as it was released in the midst of the pandemic, as News Corp Australia stopped printing 60 of its local newspapers and regional newspapers in Victoria, some older than 100 years, shut suddenly as advertising revenue dried up overnight. The code aims to ensure that news media businesses are fairly remunerated for the content they generate, helping to sustain public interest journalism in Australia. Why has it taken so long? It’s been three years since the government asked the competition regulator, the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission, to inquire into the impact of Facebook and Google on the state of competition in media and advertising. Its 18-month inquiry found a bargaining power imbalance between news media organisations and the large digital platforms, and recommended that codes of conduct be negotiated to govern their commercial deals. The ACCC released a draft code and media companies and the platforms were asked to comment. Was the proposed code welcomed? The recommendation was welcomed by media companies and advocates of public interest journalism. But Google and Facebook feared it would set a global precedent. The world is watching Australia’s landmark legislation. Facebook threatened to block Australians from sharing news and Google ran a campaign against the draft media code arguing it was unfair. Google took the extraordinary step of encouraging its users to fight the proposed legislation with yellow warning signs that said “the way Aussies search every day on Google is at risk from new government regulation”. Google also took the campaign to YouTube, telling creators to swamp the ACCC with objections. The prime minister stepped in and warned them against employing “coercion” in their opposition to his plans. The Treasury Laws Amendment (News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code) Bill 2020 was finally tabled by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, in the last sitting week of 2020. How will the code work? Media companies are encouraged to make commercial deals with Facebook and Google outside the code. But the code gives them a framework to bargain and reach a binding agreement. If they can’t agree, an arbiter will implement the “final offer arbitration” model to determine the level of remuneration. The digital platforms will have to give the media 14 days’ advance notice of deliberate algorithm changes that affect news media businesses. To keep bargaining costs low for smaller companies, the digital platforms can make standard offers, or media companies can bargain collectively. Can Google and Facebook just refuse to negotiate? If they do, they will pay a penalty of $10m, or 10% of annual Australian turnover, or three times the benefit obtained, whichever is the greater. But the stiff penalty only applies if they breach the key provisions of failing to negotiate or take part in arbitration in good faith; failing to comply with an arbitration decision; or engaging in retaliatory action against news media companies. Which media companies will be eligible for payments? While News Corp Australia has campaigned aggressively for the code, it has the broad support of the industry including Guardian Australia. Nine Entertainment, publishers of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age, are on board as is Seven West Media, Australian Community Media, regional and small publishers. A late change was made to the code to add the ABC and SBS, after the Greens said they wouldn’t support the legislation unless the public broadcasters were included. Will the code affect me when I am reading news on Facebook or searching for news on Google? No, the public won’t be aware of any differences. A recent Guardian Essential poll found that a majority of Australians wanted the government to regulate the digital giants, and voters also supported moves to make Facebook and Google pay for mainstream media content. The latest fortnightly survey of 1,034 voters showed three in five Australians (59%) agreed that Facebook and Google had too much power and should be regulated by the government, with 13% of respondents disagreeing with that proposition. Has the code been watered down after lobbying by big tech? Not really. The ACCC chair, Rod Sims, said he was pleased to see the final legislation and he supported what was tabled in parliament. Facebook successfully argued that Instagram should not be included in the code, and it also acknowledges that Google sends traffic to media companies. “The aim of the code is to address the uneven bargaining position between Australian news media businesses and the big digital platforms who have clear market power,” Sims said. “It would be good to see commercial agreements between platforms and news media businesses taking place outside the code process. Arbitration is a last resort, and exists to strengthen the media businesses’ bargaining position. “The ACCC has been fully involved in the preparation of and consultation on the legislation and supports what has now been introduced.”"

          "bodyText": "Labor will respond to the media bargaining code’s release just before question time. The government is releasing the information today - but there will be no vote this week - it will go to committee. With that, we’ll close the blog for today. Thanks for reading, and thanks to Amy Remeikis for helming it today. She’ll be back tomorrow morning. Here’s what happened on this Tuesday 8 December: Australia’s international border will remain closed until March, after health minister Greg Hunt extended the biosecurity act emergency declaration. The ban on cruise ships will also be extended. The government announced its media bargaining code, which will require Facebook and Google to pay news companies – including the ABC – for the use of their journalism. It was confirmed that Scott Morrison does not yet have a speaker’s spot at a global climate summit this weekend, despite telling parliament he intended to use an appearance at the event to “correct mistruths” about his government’s record. The suicide rate for Indigenous people rose 49% in the past decade, according to a new report. Two defence force pilots ejected from an RAAF jet as it crashed just before take-off in Queensland. Both were unharmed. Labor will support the government’s plan to let super-unions break apart in “exceptional circumstances”, shadow industrial relations minister Tony Burke says. In the UK, Margaret Keenan, a 90-year old grandmother from Coventry, has become the first person to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Australia has currently secured enough doses of the vaccine for 5 million people. Independent senator Rex Patrick has tabled a bill today to ban the importing of goods made by the forced labour of Uighurs in China. The bill would stop Australia importing any goods made in the Xinjing province of China, or goods from other parts of China produced “using forced labour” as defined by Australian criminal law. Patrick said in a statement that the “next step” would be for it to be considered by the Senate’s foreign affairs, defence and trade legislation committee. He said he would refer it to the committee on Thursday. The Chinese Communist regime’s persecution of the Uyghur people is undeniable. More than 1 million people have been rounded up and put in internment camps across Xinjiang and subjected to gross human rights abuses. Hi all, it’s Naaman Zhou here, taking over on the blog for a short while. Earlier, we brought you the breaking news that a jet crashed earlier today in Queensland, shortly before take-off. The update is that two crew members were ejected from the RAAF Super Hornet jet as it crashed before taking off at the Amberley air base in Queensland. “The aircrew of that aircraft are safe and no other personnel were involved in the incident,” a defence department spokeswoman said in a statement. Footage obtained by Nine News showed the crew landing in their parachutes and the jet with its cockpit jettisoned. The cause of the accident is unknown and an investigation is under way, AAP reports. Naaman Zhou will take you through the next part of the day. I’ll be back early tomorrow morning – thanks for joining me for the parliament day. Take care of you! The parliamentary security committee is reviewing the surveillance legislation bill: The Morrison government is facing calls from within its own ranks to tread carefully now that it has the power to veto certain types of international agreements, with a backbencher warning that “it should only be used minimally”. Amid widespread speculation the government has Victoria’s Belt and Road agreement with China in its sights, and with Beijing previously signalling such a veto would exacerbate existing tensions with Australia, the Senate today ticked off on the final of two bills setting up the new powers. The Coalition MP and former Australian diplomat Dave Sharma said that while he would not comment on whether the Victorian deal should be torn up, he made this broader point about the new power: I think it should only be used minimally. Speaking at an event hosted by the China Matters thinktank, Sharma said it was important that the federal government had this new power to review state, territory, council and public university agreements with foreign government entities. He said the passage of the laws would lead to “a period in which state and territory governments and others basically open their books as they list everything” – and he predicted that the federal government’s subsequent review would find “overwhelmingly” that the majority of them were in Australia’s national interest. Speaking at the same China Matters event, Labor MP Tim Watts said his party had offered bipartisan support to the new powers, but encouraged the foreign minister to use that power responsibly, calmly and with careful consideration. Watts said: It shouldn’t be a media-led strategy. When contacted for comment about the potential targeting of the Belt and Road deal, a Victorian government spokesperson said: This remains a matter for the federal government. Our trade relationships – with our biggest trading partners and our smallest – are about supporting Victorian businesses and creating Victorian jobs. The Victorian parliament is also sitting – AAP has an update on the covid fines issued by the state: The Victorian government is rejecting calls to waive an estimated $3 million in Covid-19 fines handed to thousands of teenagers, despite many coming from disadvantaged backgrounds. The Covid-19 Fines Community Lawyer Working Group, a coalition of 10 community legal centres, estimates at least 2,000 children aged 14 to 17 have been fined in Victoria for coronavirus breaches during the pandemic. In state parliament on Tuesday, Greens MP Tim Read asked attorney general Jill Hennessy if the fines would be renounced. She said: The government has no intention of withdrawing fines that have been lawfully imposed. It’s a long night for the Senate. Just a point regarding that Joel Fitzgibbon spray on China policy (the Labor backbencher argued Malcolm Turnbull had shifted Australia’s posture towards China from one of deep engagement to one of “collective containment and strategic competition”): Scott Morrison has made clear several times in recent months that Australia does not seek to contain China and does not see it as a strategic competitor. That outlook differs from that of Australia’s American ally. The prime minister has also called for high-level dialogue with China and has played down the idea that there is a simple “reset” available in the relationship. China, meanwhile, has called on Australia to take “concrete” steps aimed at putting the relationship on a better footing. According to an embassy official, that would begin with Australia making clear it sees China’s rise as an opportunity, rather than a threat. Labor’s campaign to try to define Scott Morrison (you may have heard the “always there for the photo op” line repeated over and over and over again) is really ramping up. Larissa Waters moved this motion in the Senate today (as reported) and it didn’t get the support from Labor (which voted against suspending standing orders). But it looks like getting a second chance at life. Labor, which voted against it this morning, has given notice it will be moving a motion very similar – in fact almost word for word – tomorrow: That the Senate: (1) notes: (a) the prime minister told parliament on 3 December 2020 that Australia would be participating at the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December 2020 and that “it will be a great opportunity to correct the mistruths … that are often presented”; (b) the Climate Ambition Summit co-host and COP26president Alok Sharma has stated that “announcements must show genuine progress from existing policies and Paris targets” and that “there will be no space for general statements”; and (c) reports today in the media that Australia does not have a confirmed speaking role at the summit; and (2) calls on the prime minister to attend the house by 2pm Tuesday 8 December to make a statement to advise the house whether Australia is speaking at the Climate Ambition Summit and table any correspondence with the summit organisers relating to whether Australia is speaking at the summit. Paul Karp has a little more on the detail on the IR bill Christian Porter has put forward – as always, the devil is absolutely in the detail: Workers would face pay cuts under a dramatic move by the government to suspend the better-off-overall test for two years, unions have warned. Sections of the industrial relations omnibus bill, seen by Guardian Australia ahead of their release on Wednesday, propose allowing the industrial umpire to register pay deals where “appropriate” in “all the circumstances” – even if they leave workers worse off. The secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sally McManus, said it would be “absolutely outrageous” if the government attempted to suspend the better-off-overall test, and one in four Australian workers could face wage cuts. The Labor backbencher Joel Fitzgibbon has accused Scott Morrison of overreacting to the Chinese foreign ministry official’s tweet about Australian soldiers in Afghanistan, and said his response was part of a pattern of the prime minister “dog-whistling” to a domestic audience on China. Fitzgibbon, who has long been one of the harshest critics within Labor of the Coalition’s approach to China, stepped up his criticisms in an interview with ABC TV this afternoon. Fitzgibbon contrasted Morrison’s absence from the cameras on the day the Brereton report into Australian special forces was released with the prime minister’s rush to condemn the tweet and demand an apology from China. Fitzgibbon said: This is a prime minister who is driven by polling. And this is what’s got us into trouble. This has been a dog whistle, harvesting domestic votes here at home at the expense of our trading relationship. That’s the first step – stop doing that – because it’s now costing a lot of Australians jobs, not just meat producers, many others, including coal mines in my own electorate. Fitzgibbon said “poll-driven Scotty from Marketing” had also prioritised playing to a domestic audience “at the expense of our most important trading relationship”, by going out in front of the world and calling for an independent inquiry into Covid-19. Earlier, Fitzgibbon suggested the problems with the relationship were “a problem of Scott Morrison’s own making”. Patricia Karvelas asked whether it was accurate to blame Morrison for the entire problem in the relationship. An undeterred Fitzgibbon said: I think he shares the blame with Malcolm Turnbull. Fitzgibbon contended that the relationship had been “in freefall” since about 2017. He argued that was associated with Turnbull shifting Australia’s posture towards China from one of deep engagement (including the signing of the free trade agreement) to one of “collective containment and strategic competition”. That was backed up “with some pretty gratuitous language towards China and fiddling with, you know, thresholds for the Foreign Investment Review Board discriminating against certain countries, including China”. Governments of all political persuasions for decades have dealt with the challenges of China – and there are many – without destroying our relationship, including our trading relationship. But this has not been the form of this government, and this government must now fix this problem. The Victorian government has responded to the Guardian’s request for comment over Launch Housing’s pause on exiting rough sleepers from the homeless hotels program. A spokeswoman for the department said Launch was sufficiently funded to pause exiting people until late January, at which point it would begin finding alternative accommodation for many rough sleepers and continue hotel accommodation for those eligible for the “from homeless to homes” program until April. She said Launch had not requested additional funding for the program so far. Guardian Australia is seeking to confirm this with Launch Housing. Joel Fitzgibbon has moved on to Australia’s relationship with China having been “in freefall” since 2017 (under Malcolm Turnbull) and says Scott Morrison has continued damaging that relationship. “A problem of his own making,” Fitzgibbon says of Morrison’s reaction to China, later accusing Morrison of “over reacting” to an “offensive tweet” Joel Fitzgibbon is on the ABC speaking about his new “friendship group” we reported on earlier. He has established a parliamentary friends of defence awards and honours. He says he sees the group as “better explaining the Brereton report recommendations”. Australian Associated Press can register for the code, Paul Fletcher says. It is currently not included in the legislation. But the interview ends early, as Fletcher has to run to a division in the house (corporations amendments bill, dealing with the corporate insolvency reforms). Paul Fletcher is speaking to the ABC about the media bargaining code. He says there has been nothing said in private about either Facebook or Google dropping Australian content because of the code - although Facebook has made public threats to drop content if it has to pay for it. That same rain trough over that part of the world has come down south enough to give firefighters on K’gari (Fraser Island) a little relief, with the fire helping efforts to defeat a bushfire that has been burning for almost two months now. It’s not out, but it had come close to a township and the rain is helping to control it in that area. In “how’s the weather today?” stories, we have this from AAP: Thirteen children and two adults have been taken to hospital after a lightning strike in central Queensland. The group suffered tingling symptoms after a nearby lightning strike in Clinton about 1.30pm on Wednesday, Queensland Ambulance Service says. They were taken to Gladstone Hospital in stable conditions. A band of heavy thunderstorms are currently showing on the Bureau of Meteorology radar over the Gladstone region. Why should we be paying attention to the New Zealand royal commission into the Christchurch terror attack? Those brave souls hoping to hop on a cruise ship come 18 December, when the federal government’s ban was set to end, will be sorely disappointed to hear that the ruling has been extended by another three months. This ban came into effect in the early weeks of the pandemic as a number of cruise ships were shown help spread Covid-19 around the world, including the ill-fated Ruby Princess, which created a massive virus cluster across Australia in March. Health Minister Greg Hunt has just announced cruise ships – known for being rapid incubators for Covid outbreaks – will be now banned from operating in Australia until 17 March. His office released a statement this afternoon: The recommendation from government to the governor general to extend the emergency period was informed by specialist medical and epidemiological advice provided by the Australian health protection principal committee (AHPPC) and commonwealth chief medical officer. The AHPPC has advised the international Covid-19 situation continues to pose an unacceptable public health risk. The extension of the emergency period for a further three months is an appropriate response to that risk. The extension of this ban will be considered and formalised by the governor general, David Hurley, this week. This ruling is part of a larger decision to extend the “human biosecurity emergency period” under the Biosecurity Act 2015. This will also include limitations on outbound international travel and restrictions on the operation of retail stores at international airports. The release noted: The Australian government is working closely with state and territory agencies and the cruise industry, to develop a framework for the staged resumption of cruise ships in a manner that is proportionate to the public health risk. It’s worth noting that very few cruises were actually scheduled for the end of the year in Australia, but companies have been selling tickets to a number of cruises in early March. This included an international 10-day Carnival cruise from Sydney to New Zealand on 15 March. And the official announcement on the biosecurity emergency declaration has also been released: The human biosecurity emergency declaration ensures the government has the powers to take any necessary measures to prevent and control Covid-19, and protect the health of all Australians. These powers have been used on a limited basis following expert medical advice. The emergency period, which has been in place since 18 March 2020, is now set to cease on 17 March 2021. The recommendation from government to the governor general to extend the emergency period was informed by specialist medical and epidemiological advice provided by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) and commonwealth chief medical officer. The AHPPC has advised the international Covid-19 situation continues to pose an unacceptable public health risk. The extension of the emergency period for a further three months is an appropriate response to that risk. The proposed extension will be considered and formalised by the governor general this week. The existing restrictions that sit under this emergency declaration would remain in place to minimise the risk of introducing and spreading Covid-19 in our community. These include: Limitations on the movement of cruise vessels. Limitations on outbound international travel. Restrictions on the operation of retail stores at international airports. These restrictions are reviewed regularly and take into account the latest expert medical advice. They can be amended or removed at any time based on the expert medical advice. In case you missed it: The Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi has also responded to the New Zealand royal commission findings on the Christchurch terrorist attack: This was a terrorist attack committed by an Australian man who the report says was “driven by an extreme rightwing Islamophobic ideology”. Any denial or obfuscation of this simple fact is an insult to the victims. The report’s findings and recommendations should be taken with utmost seriousness in Australia, where the terrorist lived for most of his life. There are lessons here for the way we approach terrorism, security, online extremism, racial and religious hatred, social cohesion, and gun control. I urge the prime minister to engage with the Australian Muslim community and carefully interrogate what needs to change in Australia. The terrorist engaged with known far-right and white supremacist groups in Australia, some of which remain active in various forms. One of them forced me to cancel an anti-racism event in Newcastle last year due to their planned disruption. Far-right extremism is not only still present in our country, it is growing. Australia is yet to reckon with being the country that raised the Christchurch killer. The government must take responsibility for the rise in rightwing extremism reported by Asio. The senator also says all the policy recommendations in the report should be taken seriously by the Australian government. Greg Hunt opens his press conference by saying the nation is “on track” to be all opened to all Australians by Christmas. He then gets to the the ‘but’. The but here is that the virus is still running rampant overseas. “The international world remains a challenging and dangerous environment,” he says. The biosecurity act emergency declaration is being continued – that means the international border stays closed. It’s been extended until March 2021. International cruise vessels, outbound international flights and airport retail stores fall under the restrictions – any outbound (or inbound) travel remains “limited”. Homeless service provider Launch Housing has paused exiting rough sleepers from hotels until the end of January to allow time to seek funding clarity from the Victorian government. After Covid-19 was declared a pandemic the state government announced it would double crisis funding to $6m to help homelessness agencies find temporary housing for those sleeping on the streets of Melbourne. The government promised the program would be extended until April when more than a thousand private properties would be subleased for rough sleepers, however, this did not cover all rough sleepers and last week housing service providers running the program, such as Launch Housing, began exiting people from the hotels to other accommodation or boarding houses. This was highly contentious given concerns about the quality of some boarding houses and confusion over who was eligible to stay in a hotel until April. On Tuesday Launch Housing emailed all staff alerting them that they had “decide not to initiate any more planned exits from emergency accommodation” for clients in the homeless hotels program. In the email, seen by Guardian Australia, Launch Housing stated that the number of appropriate housing alternatives was now “very minimal”. A spokesperson for Launch Housing confirmed the pause to Guardian Australia and said it would give service providers time to gain clarity on government funding and the scale of the “from homelessness to homes” program to move rough sleepers into head-leased apartments. The Renters and Housing Union, which has been advocating for rough sleepers inside hotels, says it supports the decision. “This is the result of rough sleepers and support workers taking a risk by standing together without the support of our employers/housing providers or the Victorian government,” a spokesperson for the union said. The Guardian has contacted the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services for comment. You can read the Guardian’s previous reporting on the topic here: We are just waiting on the press conference with Greg Hunt and Paul Kelly – as we reported earlier it will be about delaying the return of the domestic cruise ship industry for another three months. Cruise ship operators had hoped to get back on the water in December. Given borders have only just opened domestically, a delay is not surprising. Question time ends. Bill Shorten to Scott Morrison: The prime minister said in answer to an earlier question, the government stopped the robodebt scheme when it was found not to be sufficiently legal I think, or words to that effect. So prime minister, when did the government know, robodebt was defective? Was it after the 76 administrative appeals tribunal cases in 2017, or was it after the threats of of self-harm on 14 occasions in 2017, or was it legal action by those people that government was ripping off that forced it to stop the scheme? Morrison: Mr Speaker, I wouldn’t be the first person that the member has verballed before, so I don’t accept how he characterised my statements. He asks Stuart Robert to take the question. Robert repeats the line that “as soon as government came to the conclusion that the use of average income was not sufficient government moved quickly ...” Again, it wasn’t income averaging that was the problem. It was the removal of humans from the process, which meant debts were raised SOLELY by income averaging. There were no checks – just an automatic rollout of the debt notice. That happened under the Coalition. The other issue was the reversal of the onus of proof – people had to prove they didn’t have the debt by chasing down payslips and payment notices from years and years ago, rather than the government prove they did have the debt. That is the reason it was found unlawful. Robert (who the government thought had the best week he has had all year, last week, if that gives you any indication of how the government views this) can talk about income averaging until I am blue in the face, but that wasn’t the issue. It’s being deliberately slippery with the truth, and those who were haunted by robodebt deserve better. Scott Morrison says he respects Russell Broadbent, and they have had disagreements before, but he believes the NDIS changes will have a net benefit. Stuart Robert agrees. Ged Kearney, who asked the question about Broadbent’s intervention, seems unimpressed. The health minister, Greg Hunt, and acting chief health officer, Prof Paul Kelly, have announced a press conference for 3.30pm. It’s on the human biosecurity emergency declaration. Vince Connelly continues to deliver dixers like a group of cats have found a human suit and are still working out how hands work. Anthony Albanese asks Scott Morrison when he is going to take responsibility for robodebt – given he was the social security minister when humans were removed, treasurer when he said it would recoup $2bn in savings, and prime minister when it was found to be unlawful and $1.2bn was paid to those who had suffered. Morrison sticks to income averaging was used for years, and the government, when it found out there was a problem, “changed it”. “When you find there is a problem, you fix it, you solve it, and you make it right,” Morrison says, neglecting to mention it was only fixed after several warnings, including the government’s own legal advice, had been ignored, multiple administrative appeals tribunal cases found against it, a court case and a class action was announced. Bill Shorten asks Stuart Robert to agree to the court’s ruling in the Amato robodebt court case. You can find Victoria’s legal aid explanation on that here. The question uses the year – 2019 – so Stuart Robert starts detailing the class action ruling of 2020. Shorten has a point of order on that – he says he was asking about the Amato case (which found debts raised solely on income averaging were unlawful and reversing the onus of proof on people to prove they didn’t have the debt was also unlawful). Christian Porter pops up to say the question didn’t ask about the Amato case, and it is not up to the government to write the opposition’s questions for them, so Robert can answer, addressing it on a different court case. (There was no finding of liability as part of the class action court case.) Peter Dutton gets a dixer on his portfolio today – for the first time in a little bit. It’s about the latest national security laws the government wants (and will get, despite Labor’s concerns over some aspects of the bill, even if the government doesn’t change the bill). Bill Shorten asks Scott Morrison about robodebt. The PM sticks to Stuart Robert’s lines from last week – that income averaging was a long-used policy, and the government has addressed the issue. While question time continues, we have an update on China’s latest move on Australian beef. Overnight Chinese authorities announced the suspension of import permits for a sixth Australian red meat processing business, as mentioned in our ongoing coverage of the China-Australia tensions. Australia’s agriculture minister, David Littleproud, has since issued a statement confirming that the General Administration of Customs China (GACC) advised Australia’s post in Beijing late yesterday afternoon that Meramist Pty Ltd – based in Caboolture, south-east Queensland – had been suspended. “I understand that we will be receiving formal notification from Chinese authorities regarding the reasons for the suspension of the meat establishment. The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment will investigate any non-compliance with Chinese import requirements and respond to GACC with the objective of having the suspension lifted as soon as possible.” Littleproud ended his statement with the following look-on-the-bright-side observation: “Despite the suspension of a number of meat establishments in 2020 there remain 36 meat establishments registered to export to China.” Related, as Karen Andrews keeps using the market research term ‘comeback’ and Australia’s space industry – I feel like launching myself into space, every time I hear that word now. Karen Andrews notes Rowan Ramsey’s use of the term ‘comeback’ in his dixer. And note it she should – it has cost the government (and therefore you) a lot of money. You’re just not allowed to know how much. The transcription service is still down, so it is a bit of a whoosh-whoosh with questions and answers today, I am afraid. Julie Collins has a question on aged care home packages for Scott Morrison – and how many letters have been sent to people who have died, telling them their increased home care package has been approved. Morrison says the government is adding additional places to the aged care at home care packages and is waiting for the aged care royal commission next year. He does not answer the question. Tony Burke has a point of order, asking him to address the question on how many people have died waiting for approval – and then received letters? Tony Smith says the prime minister is in order. Morrison again says the government is increasing the in-home aged care places, and is also working on growing the workforce. Jim Chalmers to Josh Frydenberg: Has the average wages growth got better or worse in the six years since the Liberal government last froze the superannuation guarantee? Frydenberg: Well, I can inform him that under the Coalition, we have seen the real minimum wage increase, whereas under the Labor party we saw it decrease, Mr Speaker. Three out of the last six years. And what we have seen with wages growth is around the 20-year average of 0.7%. But Mr Speaker, if the member for Rankin is referring to wages growth, and also superannuation, he should look at the comments by the governor of the Reserve Bank. He pointed out very clearly when it came to increases in superannuation that it was a trade-off with wages. We are looking to get more Australians into work. That’s how we’ll increase their wages. Josh Frydenberg is still treating dixers like a really lame perfect match. “Not only a good guy, he ran a Good Guys franchise.” Member for Longman, come on down! Bob Katter has the independent’s question and it is about when Australia will become ‘self-sufficient’ and also about the Qantas job losses. Christian Porter recounts that old adage of the easiest way to become a millionaire is to start as a billionaire and buy an airline, and then moves into how well Qantas has dealt with its difficult decisions. He says the government does not control Qantas, nor can it tell it how to run its business. Anthony Albanese asks why the government, which has overseen record low wage growth, is now coming after people’s superannuation. Scott Morrison again accuses Albanese of having a “problematic relationship, Mr Speaker, with telling things as they are”. Labor laughs, given Morrison just had to correct the record on Kevin Rudd: In response to the earlier question, I’m very happy to correct some of your position as a serial offender of this, Mr Speaker, but he doesn’t have the same honesty to correct himself with things that are patently untrue. Morrison continues: We gave Australians a choice that they needed, and a choice that they chose to exercise is to speak up, in this country. What the Labor party doesn’t understand is that the earnings and savings of Australians belong to them. They do not belong to the industry fund managers, Mr Speaker. Or, Mr Speaker, the bank fund managers. It’s their money. And if they needed it during the pandemic. Then we were happy to help. ... At the last election, the Australian people said no to Labor’s higher taxes. They said we don’t want to wake up to the large bill that would have been put on them that they could not afford and the bill under this leader of the opposition, Mr Speaker, would be just as high, if he ever got the opportunity to lead this country. The Tveeder transcription service crashes just as Michael McCormack gets a dixer. I know the feeling. Jim Chalmers to Scott Morrison: How can Australians trust this government’s claim that his industrial relations changes will boost wages when this government in its eighth year has only presided over flatlining wages? Morrison: (still very cranky) The [mispronounces shadow treasurer] seems to be ... I’m terribly, sorry, Mr Speaker, I mispronounced the shadow treasurer’s name. That must be such an offence to him. He is so sensitive. This is the same shadow treasurer who when he was a member ... [it sounds like he says ‘cried in Kevin Rudd’s office’] ... We know how sensitive he is but coming back to the serious issue, not the ego of the member for Rankin, Mr Speaker, which has its own reputation. He goes on to spruik the government’s record and echoes many of the talking points from his speech to the party room. Scott Morrison takes a dixer and mispronounces a few words – seems like he is still cranky from the first question. Hi all. Paul has brought you up to date on the vaping conversation in today’s Coalition party room meeting. There was also a small discussion about energy policy, which sounds a lot like the conversation about energy last week. Two Nationals, David Gillespie and Barnaby Joyce, were critical of the New South Wales government’s plan to roll out more renewables in the grid. (Last week it was Joyce, Matt Canavan and Craig Kelly). There was also a desire expressed that the government use carryover credits from the Kyoto period. This concession should not be “given away”. I’m told Scott Morrison listened to the contributions (just for the record, the PM was absent from last week’s party room because he was still in quarantine at the Lodge and there were technical problems). Morrison addressed the point about carryovers. He said Australia had earned the credits legitimately. The credits were real and a reflection on Australia’s overachievement. The government had made “no announcement” yet about whether it would use Kyoto credits to meet Australia’s 2030 target, but if that’s where we ended up, if we could meet the 2030 target without deploying carryovers, then that would reflect Australia’s strong performance, the prime minister said. It is straight into it. Richard Marles to Scott Morrison: Why did the prime minister try to deflect attention from the thousands of Australians stranded overseas by misleading this House when he wrongly asserted former prime minister Kevin Rudd had travelled in and out of Australia while the borders were closed. Why is this prime minister playing politics while 39,000 Australians are stranded overseas and won’t be home for Christmas? I don’t think Morrison was expecting this as the first question – he is angry as he answers this. Morrison: And last night I wrote to you, Mr Speaker – and I would table the matter, it’s a matter of Hansard anyway and it’s there for all to see – to correct the record with what I said in this House yesterday. ... The interjection has come from the leader of the opposition why I didn’t come in here. Because I was chairing the national security committee of cabinet, Mr Speaker. ... Mr Rudd is a very important previous prime minister. ... I take that interjection, Mr Speaker. If the leader of the opposition wants to have an each way bet on national security he can, Mr Speaker. But this prime minister never will. And Australians know all about that, Mr Speaker. So, Mr Speaker, I am happy to apologise to Mr Rudd. I wasn’t aware of that occasion. I was otherwise informed and I happily corrected the record, very happily corrected the record to Mr Rudd. I am always happy to treat former prime ministers with the utmost respect and they deserve that respect. I was making no reflection on Mr Rudd yesterday at all. I was making a reflection on the deputy leader of the opposition who sought to come into this place and attack another former prime minister in Mr Abbott, Mr Speaker, who it turns out was one of more than 95,000 people who received independent exemptions to leave the country, Mr Speaker. And if Mr Rudd indeed wished to leave the country and he sought to make such an application for an exemption, I have no doubt he would be treated with the same independence that former prime minister Mr Abbott was treated with by the border force commissioner and indeed, Mr Speaker, the former and longest serving minister for affairs Mr Downer. And I’m happy to apologise to Mr Rudd, but I tell you what, when it comes to ... Mr Rudd, the Liberal party cannot compete with those opposite, Mr Speaker. The member for Watson accused him of chaos, lacking temperament and inability to make decisions. The member for Gorton accused him of treachery, Mr Speaker. Now, Mr Speaker, if anyone owes Kevin Rudd an apology ... Anthony Albanese: While I’d be quite happy to have a debate with the prime minister about loyalty to people when in office as prime minister, quite happy to, this is not relevant. This is about as relevant as when he stabbed Malcolm Turnbull. Tony Smith: He certainly was drifting from the question, and I’d invite him to come back to the question or wrap up his answer. Morrison: Thank you, Mr Speaker. So simply the point is obvious Mr Speaker – if Mr Rudd was to seek an exemption to leave the country it would seem those on that side of the House would be the first to seek to approve it in the way that they spoke about Mr Rudd when he was even in this chamber standing at this dispatch box as prime minister, Mr Speaker. But I understand the leader of the opposition’s affection for Mr Rudd because he has the Rudd force field around him in the protections that were put in place to keep this leader of the opposition in his job. Lucky Albo. ... I withdraw that last element, Mr Speaker. Michelle Rowland says Labor will be looking at the media bargaining code through the Senate committee process. Jim Chalmers is responding to the government’s announcement of the media bargaining code: When it comes to this news media code, the government has been dithering and delaying and stuffing around for a year now. It was this time last year that the government said that they would act to level the playing field between the tech platforms and the news media organisations. By April, they were saying it would be finished by July. By July, they were saying it would be finished soon. And last month, Josh Frydenberg said it would all be done and dusted business this month. None of those things turned out to be true. This is another stunning example of a government that chases headlines, but just doesn’t deliver. Time and time again we’ve heard from the treasurer, in particular, big promises, big announcements about finalising this deal and getting it legislated before the end of the year and yet we still haven’t even seen the legislation that the ministers were talking about a short time ago. It’s been a year that this has been on table and still we haven’t seen the legislation. Now, on our side, Michelle [Rowland] and I – and the whole Labor team – have said we are prepared to support, in principle, efforts to ensure that the playing field is levelled between the tech platforms and the news media organisations. We do want to see quality journalism properly paid for in this country. We do want to make sure that regulation keeps up with technological change in this really sensitive and really important part of our economy. But all of this uncertainty that’s been created by the big announcements and no delivery has been difficult for business. It’s been a difficult enough time for business as it is without all of the regulatory uncertainty which is created by a government, which makes announcement after announcement and then can’t even deliver the legislation on the Tuesday of the last week of the parliament. The final Coalition party room of the year was dominated by a debate on vaping. The health minister, Greg Hunt, and the TGA are pushing to move to a prescription-only model by mid-2021, and senators Hollie Hughes and Matt Canavan have been dissenting from that position in a Senate inquiry into e-cigarettes. In the party room there were 10 contributions in favour of legalising vaping (and against the prescription-only model), including Hughes, Canavan, Trent Zimmerman, Tim Wilson, Perrin Davey, Barnaby Joyce, George Christensen and Eric Abetz. Hughes and Canavan put forward a compromise position that would allow people to seek a prescription from their doctor but preserve the ability to personally import vaping fluid. It sounds like that might be the direction of their inquiry report, due by 18 December. Andrew Hastie made a cautious contribution that noted the overlap in the US between the pro-vaping and pro-marijuana lobby. “Vaping is fine, but drugs are bad m’kay” seems to be the tenor of the contribution. Davey’s contribution was emotionally powerful – she recounted her father’s experience of cutting down from 30 cigarettes a day to two a day and vaping, which allowed him to have an operation doctors had previously refused. Hunt did not reply to the contributions – but Scott Morrison rounded out the debate by noting that both he and Hunt were listening and were sensitive to MPs’ and senators’ views. Unclear whether that was merely a head-pat or foreshadows changes to government policy. The cashless debit card debate is being rushed through today. It’s the downhill slide into question time – we will bring you the wash-up of the party room meeting before we all head in there though. Andrew Giles has also made a 90-second statement – this one on the New Zealand government decision to accept all the royal commission into terrorist attacks on Christchurch mosques: Prime Minister Ardern delivered an apology to all those affected and recognised that an apology isn’t enough, by committing to implement all 44 recommendations. Australia too, must do more than offer condolences. We must recognise that an Australian terrorist committed these atrocities – an Australian that was radicalised here on our soil. In this place, we are charged with keeping all Australians safe. It pains me to read in the report that Muslim New Zealanders felt unsafe prior to the murders. We must recognise that Australia is not immune to terrorist attacks from home grown rightwing-extremists. This must be a call to action. To say no to hate, and to recognise the grave threat posed by rightwing extremism. The report also finds and I quote: Efforts to build social cohesion, inclusion and diversity can contribute to preventing or countering extremism. And that ... “having a society that is cohesive, inclusive and embraces diversity is a good in itself.” Powerful words that we in Australia must also reflect on and commit to. Here is how the government has explained the media code: The Code will support a diverse and sustainable Australian news media sector, including Australia’s public broadcasters, by: • encouraging the parties to undertake commercial negotiations outside the Code; • enabling digital platforms to publish standard offers, which provides smaller news media businesses with an efficient pathway to finalising agreements with digital platforms; • establishing a negotiation framework under the Code that allows both parties to bargain in good faith and reach binding agreements; • ensuring that an independent arbiter is able to determine the level of remuneration that should be paid under a fair and balanced final offer arbitration model should the parties be unable to reach agreement; and • setting clear and workable minimum standards for digital platforms including requiring 14 days advance notice of deliberate algorithm changes that impact news media businesses. The Code will initially apply to Facebook NewsFeed and Google Search. Other digital platform services can be added to the Code in future if there is sufficient evidence to establish that they give rise to a bargaining power imbalance. The Code will be reviewed by Treasury one year after its operation to ensure it is delivering outcomes that are consistent with the Government’s policy intent. We’re told vaping was an issue of considerable debate at the final Coalition joint party room meeting of the year. Cameras were allowed in for Scott Morrison’s speech, but in the closed session 10 Coalition members spoke about vaping, all but one of whom backed made it reasonably available to Australians. In speeches, Michael McCormack thanked regional communities for the way they had managed Covid-19 issues. He urged colleagues to use recess to promote infrastructure projects. Josh Frydenberg joked about the PM’s missteps in pronunciation of barre and the subsequent photos that could not be unseen. More seriously the treasurer said the country could not afford widespread wage subsidies for too long but must transition to targeted support. Tim Watts would be making his apologies to Tim Minchin, having taken inspiration from Minchin for his 90-second statement to the parliament just then: I really like Christmas It’s sentimental, I know, but I just really like it I’ve heard prime ministerial promises But I just don’t believe every stranded Australian Will be home by Christmas, to be honest And I’ve heard all the usual excuses And redefinitions of waiting list places While Australians wait for spaces in quarantine places and beg the PM to be the leader that he’s meant to be But there are still thousands of Aussies who can’t get a flight And they’re losing their jobs and their homes while they fight Just to come back to the country they call home I know they really don’t like it There’s just 17 days remaining And with a fortnight of quarantine between them And their families they have just three days to get home, or … They won’t be seeing their dad Their brother and sisters, their gran and their mum They won’t be drinking white wine in the sun The Senate agreed to the government motion to hear all the bills in this session (32 to 29), then held a separate vote on whether to include the cashless debit bill, which it also won 32 to 29. So the Senate will deal one way or the other with the cashless debit card extension this week – but we’re still not clear on who will win the substantive vote. While this press conference on the media code continues, Marise Payne has issued a statement welcoming the new foreign veto powers. The foreign minister said the new powers – which allow the federal government to review and potentially cancel international agreements reached by state and territories, local governments and public universities with foreign governments – were “necessary to appropriately manage and protect Australia’s foreign relations and the consistency of our nation’s foreign policy”. Payne appeared to be making conciliatory noises to state and territory governments, saying those governments “play a very important role in advancing Australia’s interests globally” and she looked forward to working with them.” From trade and economic cooperation, to cultural collaboration, to university research partnerships, States and Territories build links that support Australia’s economy and project our values abroad. This legislation provides a mechanism for States and Territories to consult with the Commonwealth on that international engagement. It also establishes a public register to provide transparency about State and Territory foreign arrangements. But Payne defended the need for the new laws, saying the world was increasingly globalised and states and territories were “engaging more frequently at high levels with foreign governments and their entities, with tangible impacts on Australia’s foreign relations”. “This increased engagement, and the growing strategic complexity of the 21st century, brings greater risks, requiring more consultation and due diligence to ensure States and Territories are aligned with the commonwealth’s foreign policy.” She said a new “Foreign Arrangements Taskforce” had been established in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to implement the legislation. It’s been a three-year consultation period – and it is not over yet. It still has to pass the Senate. Plus, Facebook and Google have to agree to it – they can still decide to just not use the content (as Facebook threatened) because once it is in Australia, it can spread across the rest of the tech giant’s markets as well – including the US and Europe. So what is the bottom figure here? How much will media companies receive to have their content used? Well, the government isn’t getting into that. It has set up a framework of regulation for the bargaining to take place within – but the negotiations are for media companies to work out themselves. Google and Facebook have also won a concession in how much notice they have to give on algorithm changes – it has moved from 28 days to 14 days. Paul Fletcher: We restricted it to conscious changes to algorithms that would have a significant impact on ranking, rather than the continuous sort of machine learning progress of algorithm changes, which happens continuously. So, where they have made fair points, we’ve responded. I might say we’ve also responded to fair points made by the news media businesses. So, the code has evolved. The version that will be introduced into the Parliament tomorrow by the Treasurer reflects the consultation with all parties, and we believe it’s an appropriate framework against which commercial negotiations can occur between the platforms and Australian news media businesses. YouTube and Instagram are not included in the code, Josh Frydenberg says: As treasurer, I have the authority to designate a service. That will be subject to this code. And I will be designating Facebook and Google. The Google Search and Facebook news feed. The basis for that designation is the unequal bargaining position between the parties. And to make that designation I take advice from the ACCC, from Treasury and others. Obviously that advice came in the form of an 18-month inquiry that has found that to be the case. “The world is watching what is happening here in Australia,” Josh Frydenberg says of the code. It’s the first attempt to make Google and Facebook pay for the news content they use. The tech companies have pushed back – hard – originally saying they just wouldn’t use Australian news content, which then robs publications of an audience. But when the content is there for free (as in the companies don’t pay to use it) then media companies lose money to pay for the people making the content (like me and my colleagues). Josh Frydenberg said the code will be introduced to parliament tomorrow. But it won’t be rushed through the parliament. Paul Fletcher and Josh Frydenberg are up. As expected, the public broadcasters are in – that was a key sticking point for the Greens and Labor’s support. But the tech giants get some of what they wanted as well. I’ll bring you the key points. Meanwhile, the media bargaining code – which centres around new digital platform laws over what journalism tech giants like Google and Facebook can use – is due to be unveiled in the next 20 minutes or so. Social services minister Anne Ruston has moved a motion in the Senate for a long list of government bills to be heard in this session. Although it is a procedural motion applying to a long list, the debate centres around the extension of the cashless debit card. President Scott Ryan reminds senators it is “not the time for substantive debate”. On the substantive bill, the votes are very tight, Labor and the Greens need Jacqui Lambie, Rex Patrick and Stirling Griff to all vote to block the bill – and it looks like Patrick, still undecided, is the deciding vote. Pauline Hanson has confirmed One Nation will be voting with the government for an extension – arguing if the procedural motion doesn’t get up the cashless debit card will expire on 1 January. Hanson accuses Sarah Hanson-Young of being “touchy” when she objects to the accusation Labor and the Greens are standing up for people to spend welfare on alcohol and “get inebriated”. The Senate moves on. And there you have it – Rex Patrick’s amendment fails. Meanwhile, the New Zealand government has accepted all the recommendations put forward by the royal commission which examined the Christchurch terror attack. Labor is pushing for a parliamentary inquiry into rightwing terror groups in Australia. On the Senate numbers, the government needs three of the five corssbenchers to win a vote - if Jacqui Lambie has switched, that gives them the numbers The amendment at issue is one proposed by Rex Patrick – and which passed the Senate last week – to ensure the foreign minister’s decisions to strike down international agreements are subject to judicial review. The Greens senator Janet Rice said: “Not insisting on this one amendment makes a bad bit of legislation even worse.” Labor’s Penny Wong has some sharp words about how the government had handled this foreign veto bill. Wong said Labor had consistently indicated from the day it was announced (without Labor being informed, she noted) that it supported the objectives. Wong said the substantive bill had already passed the parliament last week but the related amendment – consequential amendments – was now being discussed. The issue, Wong said, was “whether or not there should be some oversight of the minister’s decisions”. “We have repeatedly offered to engage with the government in relation to this bill, and to my mind and what I would say to this chamber – this is one of the problems with the way this govt seeks to deal with some issues of foreign policy.” Wong said the government did “not know how to be bipartisan” on such issues. She said Labor had invited conversations with the minister, Marise Payne, but Payne had spoken to her “not once” on this bill. Wong said she thought the minister “ought to have the political maturity” to engage with the other party of government. She wanted to register her disappointment. “I find it mystifying frankly.” Wong said she understood the crossbencher Jacqui Lambie had changed her position on judicial review since last week. Labor would continue to support the amendment that Rex Patrick had moved to ensure the bill was not excluded from judicial review. Payne said the government had not accepted that amendment, for reasons she spelled out last week. She said Dfat had conducted over 60 consultations with stakeholders affected. She said the bill included scrutiny and accountability provisions, including a public register on international agreements for the first time. She said the government had agreed to last week’s amendment that there also be an annual report to parliament about the operations of the new law. And the Greens’ suspension effort in the Senate has failed. Now we’re on to consequential amendments related to the new foreign veto powers. The foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, has moved that the Senate does not insist on amendments the House disagreed with. The Greens senator Janet Rice said she was “very disappointed” at the attempt to wind back modest checks and balances that were added to a rushed bill. Rice raised the question of what was the point of the senate and of the detailed debate last week. The Labor caucus has met for the final session of the year. Anthony Albanese told the troops 2020 had been a difficult year for the world, and he acknowledged the contribution of state Labor premiers in managing the pandemic. He noted that Australia had the same problems now as we faced going into the pandemic – particularly the problem of insecure work. The Labor leader referenced a wasted recovery, and noted the recovery was leaving some Australians behind. Referencing people stranded overseas, Albanese said they were left behind and stuck around the world. Morale isn’t high in Labor ranks after a grinding, difficult year in opposition, but Albanese told MPs: “We can go into 2021 with great confidence. Our support has grown over the last 12 months, which is extraordinary given the pandemic”. Labor has signalled it is likely to support the Morrison government’s proposals to allow trade unions to break up. There was some discussion about that in the caucus. The shadow workplace relations minister Tony Burke said Labor was inclined to support the proposal if the scope of the trigger to break up was narrow: in cases of unlawfulness or illegality. Labor would seek to amend a more broad ranging trigger. There was also a discussion about the safety of parliamentary staff, which was triggered by Milton Dick asking what discussions were underway with the government. (Obviously the actual trigger was the recent Four Corners program). The shadow special minister of state Don Farrell responded, providing an update, saying it was up to the government to review provisions for MOPs employees. The New South Wales senator Deb O’Neill also contributed to the discussion. Supporting an independent complaints mechanism for parliamentary staff was floated during the discussion. South Australian premier Steven Marshall is easing restrictions a little further: Paul Fletcher and Josh Frydenberg have announced a media conference for 1.15pm – the media bargaining code is about to be released (they have been the ministers leading the consultations). The Senate has opened with the Greens pushing for a suspension of standing orders regarding what they described as Scott Morrison’s “potential misleading” of the lower house about the climate ambition summit. The Guardian reported overnight that Morrison does not yet have a speaker’s spot at a global summit this weekend despite telling parliament last week he intended to use an appearance at the event to “correct mistruths” about his government’s heavily criticised record on emissions reduction. Greens senator Larissa Waters said the rest of the world understood that Australia was a “laggard” on climate action, and her party was “pretty confident that Australian won’t be invited to speak” at the climate action summit this weekend. She said standing orders should be suspended, because the issue was about “whether the prime minister has misled the parliament in his response to Greens leader Adam Bandt about whether we’re invited or not”. Waters wants the minister representing the prime minister to attend the Senate at 2pm and make a statement on whether Australia is speaking at the climate ambition summit, and to table any correspondence on that point. Waters said the Greens had received information that “correspondence has been sent” specifically disavowing what Morrison had told the lower house regarding the climate action summit. She did not provide further details. Government minister Anne Ruston told the Senate the attempt to suspend standing orders reflected “a total disregard of other members of this chamber” and the regular order of business. Ruston said: “We will not accept, we will not accept this absolutely blatant attempt to disrupt the order of business in this place.” It doesn’t look like the Greens have Labor’s support to suspend standing orders, so it’s likely to fail. For more on this issue, see the story by my colleagues Adam Morton, Katharine Murphy and Jessica Elgot: Looks like the de-merger bill has all the support it needs to easily get across the line, as Paul Karp reports: Labor will support the government’s plan to facilitate super-unions to break apart in “exceptional circumstances”, Tony Burke has said. The shadow industrial relations minister confirmed on Tuesday morning that the shadow cabinet had approved draft legislation to expand the three-year window for amalgamated unions to demerge. With opposition support the bill could pass as early as this week, allowing the break-up of the Construction Forestry Mining Maritime and Energy Union in the new year and isolating the militant maritime and construction divisions, including the Victorian construction secretary, John Setka. Bill Kelty, the former Australian Council of Trade Union’s secretary and elder statesman of the labour movement, has also given his blessing, telling Guardian Australia there was “nothing wrong with divorce – even the Catholic church is accommodating it these days”. Here is that motion Larissa Waters was tweeting about: I seek leave to move the following motion – That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Melbourne from moving the following motion: That the House: (1) notes: (a) the Prime Minister told Parliament on 3 December 2020 that Australia would be participating at the Climate Ambition Summit on 12 December 2020 and that ‘it will be a great opportunity to correct the mistruths … that are often presented’; (b) the Climate Ambition Summit co-host and COP26 President Alok Sharma has stated that ‘announcements must show genuine progress from existing policies and Paris targets’ and that ‘there will be no space for general statements’; and (c) reports today in the media that Australia does not have a confirmed speaking role at the summit; and (2) calls on the Prime Minister to attend the House by 2.00 pm Tuesday 8 December to make a statement to advise the House whether Australia is speaking at the Climate Ambition Summit and table any correspondence with the summit organisers relating to whether Australia is speaking at the summit. The Greens are following up on the story we published a little earlier, asking for clarity over Scott Morrison’s participation at the climate summit hosted by the UK on 12 December. Tim Smith is making sense. It really is the season of surprises. Via AAP: Outspoken Liberal MP Tim Smith has urged his party to support new laws before the Victorian parliament that will outlaw gay conversion therapy, describing the practice as “demented”. The party is expected to finalise its position on the legislation on Tuesday, at its first in-person party room meeting since the start of the pandemic. Five backbenchers had reportedly demanded leader Michael O’Brien hold the meeting in person rather than via Zoom, so they could express their discontent about the party’s direction. Ahead of the meeting, former federal Liberal vice-president Karina Okotel emailed all 31 Liberal MPs, arguing against controversial treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy. But she described the government’s proposed ban on “prayer-based practice” as a threat to religious freedoms. Smith said Okotel was trying to “browbeat” MPs to oppose the laws. He said the party should not allow a conscience vote on the matter. “This is pretty cut and dry. You are what you are. I read reports about people praying, or some such to stop people from being gay or some rubbish. I mean this is nonsense,” Mr Smith told reporters outside parliament. “You know I prayed 20 years ago that I’d be six foot four, well I’m five ten. “This is actually quite insane. It’s demented. You are what you are … We are all made in the image of God. Can I make that point as a very, very bad Anglican.” NSW has recorded a zero day in terms of locally acquired cases – there have been six people in hotel quarantine who have tested positive. The independent senator Jacqui Lambie has warned the government to “back it off” on a proposal to strip special forces troops who served in Afghanistan of their meritorious unit citation in the wake of the Brereton report. The proposal, first flagged by the chief of defence, Angus Campbell, was designed to ensure collective accountability across the special forces for the alleged war crimes in Afghanistan. Lambie, speaking alongside veteran and advocacy campaigner Heston Russell in Canberra, said the decision was shameful and premature, given no one had been found guilty of any offence. “This is very bullish, very bullish of the CDF, the minister of defence, and the prime minister. Quite frankly, if you gave a stuff about veteran suicides, you’d back it off. You’d back it off.” Russell said the prime minister asked the Queen to sign off on a regulatory change in July allowing the governor general to remove medals on the recommendation of the CDF or the defence minister. A government spokesman has reportedly said the regulatory change had been in motion since 2015, but Russell said that did not “pass the pub test”. The Brereton report found Australian special forces soldiers were involved in the alleged murder of 39 Afghan civilians or detainees. All the killings were said to have occurred outside of the heat of the battle. In a testy exchange with reporters at parliament house this morning, Russell, a former special forces soldiers who served in Afghanistan, questioned what was meant by the “heat of the battle”. He was asked about vision showing an Australian special forces soldier shooting a cowering Afghan civilian in a field at point blank range. “That situation in particular is indeed an allegation that I am going to afford the presumption of innocence, as opposed to the snapshot version put forward to the media,” he said. Russell said Australia, unlike American or British troops, did not bomb villages in pursuit of individuals listed on target lists. Instead, Australia sent out soldiers to capture or kill them under legal authority to avoid collateral damage to civilians, he said. He ended with: But most importantly, colleagues. I said we would keep Australians together. We are together as a team, and I believe we are together as a nation. Australians have cleaved to each other this year. They have shown tremendous acts of kindness and sacrifice and devotion. And so as we come to the conclusion of this parliamentary year, let us think of all those Australians who quietly go about their daily lives, who quietly go about running their businesses and are thankful they still have one. They are thankful that those employees who are, I believe, often, if not their greatest joy in running their own business, to see someone who was given a livelihood by the work of their hands. What a great thing that is. What a great thing that is. That’s what our policies support – employees, employers together creating enterprise that create livelihoods and choices for Australians. That sits at the heart of our Liberal and National ethos. So let’s take that, stronger, safer together into the New Year. It will carry us into the plans as we roll them out for the recovery as it continues. And there’ll be no shortage of challenges next year. The challenges of aged care – significant, but we will meet them. The challenges of our region and our, and the international uncertainties that are out there, the challenges of rolling out vaccines, the challenges of regional Australia, the challenges of ensuring that we get young people into jobs, in particular, that the skills training reforms are realised, that the heavy industries that sit around in our country get the energy they need to continue to be viable and create those jobs and the livelihoods they have sustained for generations. That’s the certainty a Liberal-National government provides at a time of great uncertainty. And all of you have played an extraordinary role in achieving that this year. Morrison: But it’s not over yet. It’s a long way from over yet. Of course, the comeback has begun, but the recovery has still quite a journey ahead of us. And so, colleagues, what you have done to enable the Government, to be that certainty for Australians in a time of great uncertainty, I don’t want you to underestimate. The support that you have provided to me and to Michael and to Josh as we have brought our cabinet together and our ministry and our executive together and brought all of you together, brought the states and territories together, brought industry, brought employers, employees, representatives and others together. The support that you have provided to me, in particular, I’m deeply grateful for. You have enabled this government to be what it absolutely had to be for Australians this year and we must continue. We must continue, as we have this year, as we move into next year. That stability, that unity of purpose, the selflessness of government, that is incredibly important. The humility of government is one that looks at what the needs of our community are, not what our interests are. And that is a mark of our government as well as being an ambition of our government at the same time and that’s what we must continue to strive to meet as we go into next year, thinking of always why we are here. It’s never about us. It’s always about those we have come here to serve. The last party room meetings of the year tend to be like the last school assembly – lots of looking back, looking forward, and twirling towards freedom. Here is what Scott Morrison had to say to his colleagues: Colleagues, this year has been like no other. Of course, for all of us, but more importantly and most significantly, for Australians all around the country. Their experiences have been different. But the one thing that has been constant, has been a trial for them. It has been hard and over the course of this year, Australians have probably looked to, and relied upon the strength and stability and unity of their government, more so than they have for many generations. They posed that question to us when this hit, and they looked to us to stand by them and see them through what for many has been the hardest year of their lives. And as I have moved around and as you have moved around in your community, their answer and response to us has been; you have. But our response to them is simply to say thank you, because we know that the great strength of Australia is in its people and we know that the response that we have provided this year has not been about us. It’s been about them. It’s been about supporting them in their plans, in their resilience and what they were seeking to do to keep their businesses together, their families together, their communities together, their lives together. And they had a plan for doing that and we backed those plans in. And despite the challenges of this year, I believe Australia is stronger today than it was a year ago. And I believe Australia will be stronger again next year. Because Australians have been tried and Australians have passed the test and we have played our role in supporting them in that great challenge this year. Property prices increased by 0.8% in the September quarter, the ABS reports: All capital cities apart from Melbourne recorded a rise in residential property prices in the September quarter 2020. The rises in residential property prices were led by the Sydney (1.0%) and Brisbane (1.5%) property markets. Property prices fell 0.3% in Melbourne. House prices rose 1.4% in Sydney and 1.6% in Brisbane, while attached dwelling prices rose 0.2% in Sydney and 1.3% in Brisbane. Head of Prices Statistics at the ABS, Andrew Tomadini, said: “Results for Sydney and Brisbane are in line with housing market indicators. New lending commitments to households, auction clearance rates and sales transactions all improved during the September quarter. “Property prices continued to fall in Melbourne in the September quarter, due to the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions. Melbourne house prices fell 0.3% and attached dwelling prices fell 0.2%.” Through the 12 months to the September quarter 2020, residential property prices rose 4.5%, with rises in all capital cities except Darwin. It should come as no surprise that alcohol lobby group Alcohol Beverages Australia is not impressed with the new drinking guidelines, which recommend people drink less. CEO Andrew Wilsmore has released a statement: “Australians should have no faith in these guidelines when they have cherry-picked a number for a woman who drinks three days a week as the advice for all Australians. This is a serious departure from previous guidelines which provided recommendations for an individual drinking across all days of the week. Had the NHMRC not set out to deliberately lower the guidelines it would be advising men they could be consuming up to 20 drinks a week if they spread their drinking out over seven days.” If you haven’t had a chance to read this story, you probably should: Scott Morrison does not yet have a speaker’s spot at a global climate ambition summit this weekend despite telling parliament last week he intended to use an appearance at the event to “correct mistruths” about his government’s heavily criticised record on emissions reduction. A government spokesman on Monday night said Australia had been invited to take part in the 12 December summit “both personally by [British] prime minister Boris Johnson during a phone call with prime minister Morrison, and again in writing by the leaders of hosting nations: the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Chile and also the United Nations”. But diplomatic sources have told Guardian Australia there had been debate among the co-hosts including Britain – which is hosting the next major climate conference in Glasgow in 2021 and has taken a leading role in calling on countries to do more – as to whether Morrison should be approved to speak at the summit given the widespread view Australia is a laggard on climate commitments. Save the Children wants to have youth voices heard in Australia’s climate policy debate, arguing young people are more impacted by the changes and deserve a louder voice. CEO Paul Ronalds said Australia had failed to take the views of its younger generations into account – and instead, sought to discourage them: No group is more vulnerable to impacts of climate change than children, yet Australia has not taken children’s views into account in making decisions about climate change. In fact, they have actively discouraged children from expressing their views by participating in advocacy actions like the School Strikes 4 Climate. The climate emergency is here and children’s voices must be heard given the immediate and long term impact it has for them. Changes in temperature, air and water quality and nutrition have severe and long-term impacts on a child’s health, development and well-being. The devastating Black Summer bushfires highlighted the horrific impact that disasters can have on children’s physical and mental wellbeing.” The UK Covid vaccination program is being rolled out from today (which has been labelled V-day). It’s the first country to begin using the Pfizer vaccine, after its regulators approved it last week. Over 80s and health and care staff are first. More than 60,000 people have died after being infected with Covid since the beginning of the pandemic Australia will begin its program (at this stage) from March. There are more than 4,000 alcohol related deaths in Australia each year. Alcohol is also responsible for about 70,000 hospital admissions. It makes sense the experts are looking at how much is safe for us to drink. And a reminder – they are talking about standard drinks – not the glasses you pour. So that is a shot of spirits. A standard glass of wine is about 1.5 drinks. A sparkling wine glass is 1.8 (I’ve done my RSA more than once). A beer is about 1.4 drinks. It quickly adds up. More people than you would know struggle with alcohol. And before the libertarians wind themselves up about wowsers, they are guidelines, not orders. You do you, but just think about what you’re doing. And in Victoria (also via Adam Morton) Victoria’s publicly-owned forestry agency has been allowed to restart logging in bushfire-ravaged east Gippsland despite a warning from a regulator there was a risk of “serious and irreversible damage” to the state’s biodiversity. A report released under freedom of information laws show the state’s conservation regulator twice wrote to VicForests during and after last summer’s catastrophic bushfires advising it should apply the “precautionary principle” when logging in the area. Meanwhile, the planet has just recorded its hottest November on record. Adam Morton wrote about Australia’s record-breaking spring a little earlier this month. The whole planet experienced increased temperatures, according to the EU’s Climate Corpernicus project. Apple is seeking to have an Australian court case brought by the makers of Fortnite over the 30% cut it takes on app store purchases stayed, claiming the developer contract signed in California prevents Epic Games from taking legal action elsewhere. Fortnite was kicked off the Apple App Store and the Google Play store this year after seeking to circumvent the payment systems used in order to prevent both companies taking a slice of each payment made by Android and iOS users in the game. Epic Games has since launched legal action against Apple in the US and Australia, and in Australia is claiming the ban is misuse of Apple’s market power. In a case management hearing for the battle between the two tech giants in the federal court on Tuesday, Apple indicated it would attempt to stay the case, citing the agreement between the two companies. But the court heard that competition law in Australia may mean the case could still be heard here. Lawyers for Epic Games indicated they wanted the case heard in March, meaning the case would be heard before the US case, due for May. Justice Nye Perram set tentative dates for the hearing of the case as either 23 March, 2021 or 16 April 2021, and disclosed he was an iPhone user: It’ll come as no great surprise to you, I have an iPhone and I have an Apple Pay account. I don’t think that creates any difficulties. Given that I had to put another blanket on my bed the other night, made worse after leaving Queensland’s glorious mid-30 temps … Yes. K’gari – Fraser Island – is still burning. It’s been almost two months now. AAP has an update: Residents of The Oakes, about a kilometre south of Happy Valley on Fraser Island, were late Monday night told to leave via Eastern Beach as soon as possible. “We are hoping to have another 19 aircraft, including ... two large air tankers in use today as soon as we can get them in the air,” Queensland Fire and Emergency Services QFES co-ordinator Brian Cox told Nine’s Today show on Tuesday. “We anticipate that around 7am this morning. “We have already got ground crews there as we speak helping that particular township.” Mr Cox said Monday’s intensive air and ground firefighting operation had borne fruit and effectively contained a fire to the north of Happy Valley. “We saved the town,” he said. The fires, which began in October, have burned through around half of the heritage-listed Fraser Island, also known as K’gari, and are burning in three areas. People at the Kingfisher Bay resort and village on the island have also been told to prepare to leave as a fire to the east of the area threatened to get worse. On Monday, about 90 firefighters and 24 water-bombing aircraft were trying to beat back the flames. The NSW Rural Fire Service large air tanker, the Marie Bashir, is helping with water-bombing efforts on the island. The laws to decriminalise public drunkenness were tabled in the Victorian parliament today but they won’t take effect until 2022. The delay has been built in to give time for a health-based response to public drunkenness to be trialled, resourced and rolled out statewide. According to a report released late last month, that could include sobering-up centres and ramping up Aboriginal health centres in remote communities to provide more alcohol and drug services. The eventual aim is that police will have no role, or a very minimal role, in responding to public drunkenness unless there is an imminent and serious threat of harm to the intoxicated person or another person. The reform was introduced in response to the death in custody of the Yorta Yorta woman Tanya Day, who died due to a fall in police custody after being arrested for sleeping drunk on a train. A coronial inquest found that Day was “not treated with dignity and humanity” by supervising police officers, and concluded that her death “was clearly preventable had she not been arrested and taken into custody”. Public drunkenness is now a crime under sections 13 to 16 of the Summary Offences Act 1966, covering the offences of being drunk in public and drunk and disorderly. The summary offences amendment (decriminalisation of public drunkenness) bill 2020 will remove those offences. The 2020-21 state budget included $16m for a trial of a health-based response. The health minister, Martin Foley, said: We will build a health model that is culturally safe and appropriate – informed by the communities who this law has impacted the most. Kevin Rudd has re-entered the chat. The final party room address is taking place in the Great Hall – partly for social distancing reasons, and also partly for the photo op. The final joint party room meeting of the year address is all about how well the government has done in shepherding Australia through the pandemic, so far (with the usual there-is-still-a-long-journey-ahead caveats) It’s party room time, and Scott Morrison has let the cameras in to the joint-party room meeting to catch his opening address. He missed last week’s because he was still in quarantine at the Lodge. Sky is broadcasting the speech – and also catching the MPs who are a little late, coming into the room behind the PM. As someone who sees time as a very fluid construct, I sympathise. The Liberal Bass MP, Bridget Archer, could have brought about an end to the cashless welfare card legislation yesterday if she had voted against the bill, instead of abstaining from voting. Archer gave a strong speech last week laying out why she was against her party’s policy, which gained a lot of attention. But she was absent during the vote yesterday. A tied vote usually ends with the status quo continuing – it is practice that the Speaker does not use the casting vote to create a majority where there isn’t one. The status quo in this case would mean the bill would have been defeated. The Labor MP Brian Mitchell said it was the communities impacted by the bill who would really suffer: I just wanted to say this issue isn’t about Bridget Archer, this is about the people who are most affected by income management. So I come here more in sorrow than anger. Bridget gave a really impassioned and quite beautiful speech when she articulated a lot of things, I think many of us felt about why this bill should not proceed. And I’m frankly just really disappointed that where she had the opportunity to kill this bill in the House of Representatives, Bridget Archer’s vote would have killed this bill in the House of Reps, and she didn’t stand by the courage of her conviction that she articulated quite beautifully. So this isn’t about Bridget Archer, this is about the people who are now affected by a very punitive income management regime. The Labor MP Pat Conroy is in not having any of it this morning. The Shortland MP was asked whether Scott Morrison should have given an apology in person, after wrongly claiming Kevin Rudd had received travel exemptions during the pandemic. Conroy was one of the MPs sent out to chat about Labor’s narrative today – here is some of what he said about the prime minister: Mr Morrison could have owned up to the fact and just gone into parliament and spent 30 seconds correcting the record and apologising. Instead, because the guy is a gutless coward, he sent a letter to the clerk at about eight o’clock last night. That is not befitting the leader of this country. It just shows that he is all about politics. He’s all spin and there’s no substance there. Linda Burney spoke to Sky News this morning about the cashless debit card bill. As we reported yesterday, it will come down to the crossbench and, in this case, one vote – Rex Patrick’s. Yesterday he said he still had some questions. Burney was urging him to listen to the people he had spoken to about what making the card permanent would mean: And I have to say on your program this morning, that I am not sure how Mr Patrick will vote. I will say though, that he’s taken the time to go and talk to people. He’s been to the Northern Territory, and he’s also been to Ceduna in South Australia. This card is punitive. People don’t want it. And it is absolutely a decision that the government has taken without any evidence. And I think that’s really key. Without evidence, the government has decided they’re going to go on this mad romp. And the question really is, and I’ll put this in front of you – the question really is, is this a precursor to a national rollout of welfare, mandatory welfare management for people who are in receipt of essential security payment? The childcare group G8 Education is the latest big Australian company to admit to systematically underpaying its employees. The company has this morning told the ASX it has underpaid up to 27,000 employees for the past six years and it would cost as much as $80m to repay them. It said it had discovered the underpayment after a review undertaken with the assistance of the law firm Allens and the accountancy firm PwC. The attorney general, Christian Porter, has introduced legislation that (among other things) would make wage theft illegal, but it would be unlikely to capture what’s happened at G8 because it would only criminalise deliberate underpayment, not stuff-ups. G8 says the underpayment was “inadvertent” and has reported itself to the Fair Work Ombudsman. Its chief executive, Gary Carroll, said the company unreservedly apologised to every underpaid staff member and pledged they would get “every dollar” they are owed. It’s not the only problem facing the company – it’s also the target of a shareholder class action, filed by the law firm Slater &amp; Gordon, over its woeful profit results, and the former chair Jenny Hutson is also being prosecuted by Asic over alleged dishonesty during a corporate takeover back in 2015. She’s fighting the charges. There is a new “parliamentary friends” group in town. Joel Fitzgibbon and Phil Thompson (the “friends” bit comes from being bipartisan) have started a parliamentary friends of defence honours and citations group. There is already a parliamentary friends of defence – Pat Conroy and Vince Connelly. The new friends group is designed to help people better understand the honours and awards defence personnel receive, and why. There are parliamentary friendship groups for almost anything – including soil. You can find the list here. The numbers to watch in Victoria will be locally acquired, now that the state has rejoined the local quarantine program. The zero in total streak will be broken, so it will be local cases we are focusing on. Earlier, Dave Sharma said the debate about China often fell into overly simplistic categorisations – either full engagement with China involving “some element of capitulation” or the alternative of “containment and hostility”. The situation was a lot more complex, he said, noting that China represented a quarter of the world’s population and deserved to have a say in how the world is run: We can’t shun China, we can’t lock China out of the world economy. While Sharma did not think China would ever be a fully paid up member of the liberal international order, the world must find a way to work with Beijing on issues like climate change, public health and arms control. Sharma said Australia should recognise it was “a particular focus of China’s statecraft and diplomacy right now” but was not the only country to have faced pressure. He believed the People’s Republic was worried about “the demonstration effect” to other western nations if Australia stood firm and refused to be intimidated, coerced or bullied. He pushed back at commentary that sometimes implied there was some “easy reset” available to Australia as it dealt with China. “It’s not the case,” Sharma said, arguing there were “very profound structural reasons” behind the tensions. For more on what Tim Watts and Sharma have argued, you can see our preview story here: The Labor MP Tim Watts says it’s hard to know what the Australian government’s plan is for dealing with a changing China. Speaking at a China Matters breakfast event alongside the Liberal MP Dave Sharma at Parliament House this morning, Watts said the government too often seemed more interested in the “lure” of domestic politics or media headlines. As an example of foreign policy being seen through domestic politics, Watts cited the idea of moving Australia’s embassy in Israel that was announced during a byelection (that would be the Wentworth byelection that Sharma contested). Watts also cited the report that Marise Payne, the foreign affairs minister, had called for an international Covid-19 inquiry because she wanted an announcement for during her scheduled interview with the ABC’s Insiders program in April. Watts said the opposition wanted to be constructive but added: “Bipartisanship is a two-way street and requires engagement from the government to make a reality.” He added: “We need leadership and we need a plan.” This would make sense, given that domestic borders have only just reopened. Canada has criticised Beijing for spreading “inflammatory material and disinformation” about Australia as it declared it would keep working with Canberra on issues related to China. Over the past week Guardian Australia has contacted a range of embassies and governments seeking their response to the issue that brought relations between China and Australia to a new low last week. Christelle Chartrand, a spokeswoman for Global Affairs Canada, responded this morning with the following comments: We were shocked to see the fabricated image posted by a Chinese government official. The dissemination of such inflammatory material and disinformation is beneath the standards of proper diplomatic conduct. As both 5 Eyes allies and as liberal democracies, Canada and Australia are collaborating very closely on important issues related to China. Canada continues to engage with China with eyes wide open while defending our interests and standing up for our values. China rebuffed Scott Morrison’s demand for an apology over a tweeted image depicting an Australian soldier cutting the throat of a child in Afghanistan but a number of countries, including the UK, the US, France, Germany, New Zealand – along with the EU – offered public statements condemning the tweet. Japan’s embassy also reaffirmed trade should not be used as a political tool. The Chinese government has accused Morrison of overhyping the issue for domestic political reasons and to distract from the war crimes allegations against Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. Many of the statements issued by Australia’s allies or partners point to Australia’s commitment to full and transparent investigations into those allegations. Scott Morrison may have written a letter apologising for claiming Kevin Rudd had received travel exemptions during the pandemic (Rudd hasn’t left Queensland since March) but Tony Burke thinks he needs to go further and actually verbalise the apology. He just stopped by for a quick doorstop interview: The prime minister has got a problem with the truth. He’s got a problem with the truth. And whenever he sees an opportunity for a political fight, he just instinctively goes there. That’s what happened yesterday. He didn’t like the question, he made clear he didn’t like it. So he had to have a political attack, even when it wasn’t true. That’s who our prime minister is, that’s who Mr Morrison is. Now for a long time it’s been the tradition that if you make an error in the parliament, you report and apologise for that error in the parliament. I remember sitting in the chamber during adjournment debate when John Howard walked back down to explain he misheard a question on climate change, what he said was incorrect and he corrected the record. But Mr Morrison usually has a view that the rules that might have been good enough for John Howard, he’s too good for. So we’ll see how he handles that. The correct thing to do is to have the decency to go back to where you made the error in that room and apologise. A Caboolture meatworks, Meramist, has become the sixth Australian beef supplier to be cut off from China. No reason has been given for cutting the Queensland company off. New South Wales residents can fly to WA without quarantine from today. Same with those in Victoria. It has been a very, very long wait for those people, so we’re absolutely thrilled for everyone who is about to be reunited. South Australians will move to WA’s “low risk” category from Thursday – for which entry is allowed but quarantine is mandatory. Queensland will open its border to Adelaide residents from Saturday – which means Queensland will have joined the jurisdictions with freedom of movement to all Australians, domestically. Labor wants an inquiry into rightwing terrorism in Australia. Kristina Keneally said Australia was the “only Five Eyes country that has not listed any right-wing extremist groups as terrorist organisations, even though countries such as Canada and the UK have listed groups that have local chapters here in Australia”. So she wants a bipartisan parliamentary committee to examine it: ASIO Director-General Mike Burgess said in February that Australia’s primary terrorist threat remains Islamic extremism, but that right-wing extremism is growing and that there are groups and people around Australia saluting Nazi flags and gathering weapons. ASIO has also indicated publicly, in recent months that a right-wing extremist attack in Australia is possible and that right-wing extremism now accounts for over 30-40% of its counterterrorism work. On Friday, the Australian Federal Police confirmed they are watching the right-wing extremist threat carefully, that young Australians are being “aggressively radicalised” through right-wing extremism, and right-wing extremists have more ready access to weapons than Islamic extremists. Australia cannot ignore this rising terrorist threat. An inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is an appropriate start. One of the security guards who helped prevent international travellers who accidentally escaped quarantine in Sydney from entering Melbourne has spoken out, detailing the bizarre experience to the Age. Peter Mikha was the duty manager in Melbourne airport on Saturday afternoon when one of his guards called him on the radio and said he had found two German travellers who were confused and looking for where to quarantine. Until yesterday Melbourne had not accepted any returned international travellers since July. A NSW police officer allegedly believed the travellers had an exemption and ushered them towards the domestic terminal to fly to Melbourne rather than sending them to ahotel to isolate for two weeks. Mikha said he was in disbelief when he was told they were in Melbourne airport. “He said, ‘I’ll ask them again and I’ll confirm 100%.’ They still advised him it was definitely no quarantine in Sydney,” he told the Age. “If [the travellers] didn’t find the right person to talk to they could have been directed anywhere.... When [the other guard] advised me, he was shocked as well, he didn’t realise this was possible.” This bungle caused 170 people who flew to Melbourne with the pair to isolate. The travellers have so far returned negative tests. Victoria’s hotel quarantine program restarted on Monday. The Herald-Sun has reported today that one of the first new international travellers is already symptomatic, potentially ending the state’s 38-day streak without any cases (locally acquired or otherwise). Families have called for a royal commission into veteran suicides – something Jacqui Lambie has been fighting for, and Labor is now on board supporting – but the government is not budging. But Christian Porter has announced the national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention legislation will be strengthened: Amendments to be introduced into the Senate this week will: further reinforce the independence of the National Commissioner; confirm the National Commissioner’s role extends to considering attempted suicides and other lived experiences; incorporate a requirement for a review of the National Commissioner function after three years; acknowledge the valuable contribution that families and others affected by deaths by suicide will make to the National Commissioner’s work, where they wish to contribute; confirm the National Commissioner’s ability to make recommendations about support services for families and others affected by a suicide death. According to the AIHW, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are now less likely to die of cardiovascular disease. In 2006 the age standardised death rate for cardiovascular disease in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 323 for every 100,000. In 2018 it was 229 for every 100,000. Cardiovascular disease is the second leading cause of death among Indigenous people, causing 23% of deaths. In 2016 16% of all Indigenous Australians aged two and over had a cardiovascular condition, and rates of cardiovascular disease among Indigenous adults are double those of non-Indigenous adults. The AIHW report, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health performance framework, attributed the reduced death rate from cardiovascular disease to falling rates of smoking – the number of Indigenous people who smoke daily has fallen and the number of Indigenous teenagers who have never smoked has risen – as well a significant increase in the number of patients hospitalised for procedures involving coronary heart disease. In other good news, immunisation rates are up significantly. Some 97% of five-year-old Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are fully immunised — that’s a higher rate of vaccination than the general population. The suicide rate for Indigenous Australians has increased by 49% over the past decade, according to a report released overnight by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The report found rates of suicide among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peopels had grown from 18 for every 100,000 in 2006 to 24 for every 100,000 in 2018. Rates of hospitalisation due to intentional self-harm have also skyrocketed, increasing by 120% for Indigenous women and girls between 2004-05 and 2017-18, and by 81% for Indigenous men and boys over the same period. Rates of hospitalisation after an assault also increased by more than 60%. And rates of imprisonment for Indigenous adults increased by 61% over the past decade, compared with a growth of 36% in the imprisonment rate for non-Indigenous adults. In 2018 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were jailed at 12 times the rate of non-Indigenous people. The rate at which Indigenous children were held in youth justice detention did fall in the seven years to 2018 but 47% of all kids in detention are Indigenous. And the household income for Indigenous Australians has increased in real terms from $544 a week in 1996 to $802 a week in 2016 — meaning that it took 20 years to catch up to the average non-Indigenous household income, which was $801 a week in 1996 and $1096 a week in 2016. The report was released on the heels of a Productivity Commission report, which contained the same depressing statistics. But the AIHW report also contained some good news, which I’ll explain after the jump. One down – three to go. Parliament ended yesterday with Scott Morrison writing to the Speaker to apologise for telling parliament the former prime minister Kevin Rudd had left the country during the pandemic and returned, in response to a Labor question about stranded Australians –and Tony Abbott’s travels. That won’t be the end of the issue. There are still thousands of Australians trying to get home, and Morrison had set the goal of having people home by Christmas. More people have been added to the queue since he made that pronouncement but there are still people on the list who have been trying to get home since before he set the target. You don’t have to look far to see stories of heartbreak and desperation from people who have been trying to get their families home but keep finding themselves bumped from flights. International arrivals started back in Melbourne yesterday and today planes begin arriving Adelaide again, which will help bump up the caps on arrivals the states have imposed but still leaves thousands of people on wait lists for flights. Expect to hear more on that today. It’s party room meeting day, which means we’ll get some more legislation from the government – among those bills will be the media bargaining code, which is aimed at making the tech giants pay for the journalism they use. Josh Frydenberg briefed backbenchers on the bill yesterday. SBS and the ABC are now included but Google and Facebook have won some concessions too. We haven’t seen the detail – that will come today – so we don’t know whether it has reached a point that Labor and the Greens will support it, which would ease its transition through the Senate. We’ll keep you updated on that and everything else that happens today. You have Amy Remeikis with you (Mike Bowers is still on assignment) and Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Daniel Andrews in Canberra, with the rest of the Guardian brains trust at your disposal. Let’s get into it."

          "headline": "TikTok investigating videos promoting starvation and anorexia",
          "bodyText": "TikTok has launched an investigation and banned some search terms after the Guardian found harmful pro-anorexia content was still easily searchable despite measures taken by the social media company to prohibit the advertising of weight-loss products. The video app – one of the most popular in the world with more than 800 million users, almost half of whom are between the ages of 16 and 24 – has imposed new restrictions on weight-loss ads after criticism for promoting dangerous diets. But harmful accounts that promote potentially life-threatening eating disorders were still easy to find. While the company had blocked some hashtags, putting the same words into a search for profiles brought up dozens of accounts promoting eating disorders. Those searching for content via hashtags can also get around restrictions by using slight misspellings or variants on common terms. After being presented with the findings, TikTok launched an investigation and said it had taken action to ban harmful phrases across all search verticals, including when searching for users. One account showed messages from a girl saying she wanted tips on losing a lot of weight, in a healthy or unhealthy way. Another account said: “This is a warning if you don’t like stuff about starving leave please.” Another user asked people to follow for “low calorie” safe food when you don’t want to purge, a form of an eating disorder that involves self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or medications. TikTok said it had banned six accounts flagged to them for violating the community guidelines on posting content that promotes eating habits that are likely to cause health problems. Dr Jon Goldin, vice-chair of the child and adolescent faculty at the Royal College of Psychiatrists, described the findings as “deeply disturbing”. He urged social media companies to do more and said regulators needed strong powers to sanction inaction. Ysabel Gerrard, a lecturer in digital media and society at the University of Sheffield, said: “It takes little more than 30 seconds to find a pro-eating disorder account on TikTok and, once a user is following the right people, their For You page will quickly be flooded with content from similar users. This is because TikTok is essentially designed to show you what it thinks you want to see.” TikTok’s For You page is a feed of videos – not always from people you follow – recommended by an algorithm based on your history. People have reported being served up accounts that regularly post about eating disorders, weight loss or diets. Gerrard said that since the first wave of press coverage about pro-eating disorder content on TikTok, the company had taken steps to address the issue by banning ads for fasting apps and weight-loss supplements. “I applaud the company for making it. However, there are some more things that TikTok urgently needs to do to make the platform even safer,” she said. She added that restricting the “results for hashtag searches is not enough, and hashtag searches might not even be the way users find new content anyway.” At present, TikTok doesn’t send resources to people in the UK searching for pro-eating disorder terms. “It simply says ‘no results found’ or directs you to the platform’s community guidelines – their rulebook for user behaviour,” Gerrard said. She acknowledged that removing content was tricky. “In particular, TikTok would need to be careful when limiting search results for usernames because some accounts might be pro-recovery, and there’s plenty of evidence to tell us how helpful social media can be for people with eating disorders.” Tom Quinn, director of external affairs for Beat, the UK’s eating disorder charity, said: “So-called ‘pro-ana’ or ‘pro-mia’ content can be very attractive to people affected by eating disorders and has the potential to be devastating.” Quinn said they had shared their concerns with TikTok, and the company had been receptive to hearing from people with experience of eating disorders in order to make their platform safer. “We welcome the steps they have taken against advertising weight-loss products, and we urge them to take further action against harmful content,” he said. The Conservative MP, Damian Collins, the former chair of a parliamentary committee charged with investigating social platforms, said it was not clear howTikTok’s algorithm worked. “It’s amazing how fast TikTok has grown … I would like for them tackle this [pro eating disorder content] and explain what policies they will be put in place to more effectively spot and not promote harmful content.” A spokesperson for TikTok said: “As soon as this issue was brought to our attention, we took action banning the accounts and removing the content that violated those guidelines, as well as banning particular search terms. As content changes, we continue to work with expert partners, update our technology and review our processes to ensure we can respond to emerging and new harmful activities.”"

          "bodyText": "My eye was caught by the title of a working paper published by the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER): How to Talk When a Machine Is Listening: Corporate Disclosure in the Age of AI. So I clicked and downloaded, as one does. And then started to read. The paper is an analysis of the 10-K and 10-Q filings that American public companies are obliged to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 10-K is a version of a company’s annual report, but without the glossy photos and PR hype: a corporate nerd’s delight. It has, says one guide, “the-everything-and-the-kitchen-sink data you can spend hours going through – everything from the geographic source of revenue to the maturity schedule of bonds the company has issued”. Some investors and commentators (yours truly included) find the 10-K impenetrable, but for those who possess the requisite stamina (big companies can have 10-Ks that run to several hundred pages), that’s the kind of thing they like. The 10-Q filing is the 10-K’s quarterly little brother. The observation that triggered the research reported in the paper was that “mechanical” (ie machine-generated) downloads of corporate 10-K and 10-Q filings increased from 360,861 in 2003 to about 165m in 2016, when 78% of all downloads appear to have been triggered by request from a computer. A good deal of research in AI now goes into assessing how good computers are at extracting actionable meaning from such a tsunami of data. There’s a lot riding on this, because the output of machine-read reports is the feedstock that can drive algorithmic traders, robot investment advisers, and quantitative analysts of all stripes. The NBER researchers, however, looked at the supply side of the tsunami – how companies have adjusted their language and reporting in order to achieve maximum impact with algorithms that are reading their corporate disclosures. And what they found is instructive for anyone wondering what life in an algorithmically dominated future might be like. The researchers found that “increasing machine and AI readership … motivates firms to prepare filings that are more friendly to machine parsing and processing”. So far, so predictable. But there’s more: “firms with high expected machine downloads manage textual sentiment and audio emotion in ways catered to machine and AI readers”. In other words, machine readability – measured in terms of how easily the information can be parsed and processed by an algorithm – has become an important factor in composing company reports. So a table in a report might have a low readability score because its formatting makes it difficult for a machine to recognise it as a table; but the same table could receive a high readability score if it made effective use of tagging. The researchers contend, though, that companies are now going beyond machine readability to try and adjust the sentiment and tone of their reports in ways that might induce algorithmic “readers” to draw favourable conclusions about the content. They do so by avoiding words that are listed as negative in the criteria given to text-reading algorithms. And they are also adjusting the tones of voice used in the standard quarterly conference calls with analysts, because they suspect those on the other end of the call are using voice analysis software to identify vocal patterns and emotions in their commentary. In one sense, this kind of arms race is predictable in any human activity where a market edge may be acquired by whoever has better technology. It’s a bit like the war between Google and the so-called “optimisers” who try to figure out how to game the latest version of the search engine’s page ranking algorithm. But at another level, it’s an example of how we are being changed by digital technology – as Brett Frischmann and Evan Selinger argued in their sobering book Re-Engineering Humanity. After I’d typed that last sentence, I went looking for publication information on the book and found myself trying to log in to a site that, before it would admit me, demanded that I solve a visual puzzle: on an image of a road junction divided into 8 x 4 squares I had to click on all squares that showed traffic lights. I did so, and was immediately presented with another, similar puzzle, which I also dutifully solved, like an obedient monkey in a lab. And the purpose of this absurd challenge? To convince the computer hosting the site that I was not a robot. It was an inverted Turing test in other words: instead of a machine trying to fool a human into thinking that it was human, I was called upon to convince a computer that I was a human. I was being re-engineered. The road to the future has taken a funny turn. What I’ve been reading Classic Joan Why I Write by Joan Didion is an absolute gem from the archives of The London Magazine. Ill-advised ventures Charles Duhigg has written an article in the New Yorker called How Venture Capitalists Are Deforming Capitalism, in which he uses WeWork as a case study in 2020s madness. Basically, it’s the Boo.com de nos jours, but with contemporary twists on insanity and greed. The trouble with Dom What Dominic Cummings never understood: impatience isn’t a substitute for policy.

          "bodyText": "One of the many festivals that’s switched to digital this year, the Place’s Korean dance showcase gives eclectic insights into South Korea’s thriving contemporary dance scene. The only full performance included (and it’s just 20 minutes) is Shin Changho’s Beyond Black, for Korea National Contemporary Dance Company. It’s as much a philosophical proposition as a piece of dance. The question: could AI create dance as well as humans can? Decades ago, Merce Cunningham was using computer programs to generate choreography, so it’s a fair guess the answer is yes. Currently AI can choreograph only by “learning” movement from humans – although that will apparently change by 2045 when computer intelligence surpasses all human learning and the robots take over. In the meantime, AI program Madi “watches” Shin’s dancers and translates their joints and limbs into dots and lines, then extrapolates the algorithms to generate infinite ways to “place dots and lines in unique patterns”, some of which the dancers relearned from the computer to perform in Beyond Black. You wouldn’t know the movement’s origin, although you could find something quirkily robotic in its isolations, like signals being sent to different limbs in turn, but there’s nothing mechanical about its rough-edged, human performance. Whether people or machines create the steps, it’s the humans dancing, and watching, who make the meaning. For a wider view on what’s happening in Korean dance, there’s a collection of six short films. I liked Seungjung Seong’s Zzz, with dancers throwing themselves artfully around an apartment trying to catch an imaginary mosquito, and the clever Bookanima by Shon Kim, a flipbook-style animation using instructional illustrations of different dance styles: ballet, modern, jazz, tap, breaking. A voiceover from jazz master Luigi outlines his philosophy: “Never stop moving.” Joowon Song’s film A Town with a Blue Hill is a grower. It’s a bit like a surreal Scooby Doo, young people in brightly coloured clothing on a naive adventure. They explore and play in run-down streets on the edge of a built-up city, trying to hold on to childhood innocence and imagination against the tide of “progress”. Bö Lee’s White Cane is also set in the streets, filmed in a Kenyan market with dancer Steve Ongeri taking the sensations from around him – cloth brushing against his face, grain falling through his fingers – back to the studio to make new movement. The festival also features four documentaries, produced with the Korean Cultural Centre. They’re not very slickly made, but they offer an interesting snapshot of four female choreographers’ work and lives. Three are in the contemporary field: former Hofesh Shechter dancer Jin Yeob Cha, London-based Sung Im Her and Kim Bora of Art Project Bora, with recurring themes including feminist dance and working through the pandemic. The fourth is a little different, profiling K-pop choreographer Bae Yoon Jung. The K-pop dance moves come across as mostly cute, sexy and easily copyable, made to flood the global internet, but the backstage view of the business is an education. We see Bae calling a meeting of fellow choreographers to discuss copyrighting their work and whether choreographers should need a licence to practise. Then there’s the fame machine that is the K-pop academies where future “idols” train. “I hope the teacher will give us stern instructions,” reads the translation of one hopeful. Fascinating. • A Festival of Korean Dance 2020 is online until 9 January"

          "bodyText": "Musicians are revolting. They’re rising up around the world to draw attention to the microscopic earnings they make from streaming. Songwriters, artists, players and producers of every kind have started scrutinising the industry, calling for reform, transparency, fairness and rights. It’s dead exciting. You see, during lockdown, a chorus of freshly grounded musicians took to social media to share their stories of paltry remuneration. Using the hashtags #BrokenRecord and #FixStreaming, they and their fans turned the spotlight away from themselves and on to the industry. Four hundred masked orchestral players even took part in a recital-cum-protest in Westminster Square in central London on 6 October. The noise got so loud it caught the ear of parliament: the digital, culture, media and sport select committee opened an inquiry into the fairness of the “streaming economy”. The pandemic obliterated festivals and gigs, meaning we were forced to survive on streaming income alone. As a cocky northern lass, I thought I’d be OK: “C’mon Nadine, you’ll be all right, you’ve been nominated for a bloody Mercury prize, you’ve over 100,000 monthly Spotify listeners. You’ll make the rent.” I was foolish. The situation was such that I temporarily had to move back in with my parents over the summer. Not the worst thing to happen, but still not a great look for a thirtysomething pop star. Like most of my musician friends who rely on gigs, I found myself in dire straits. (If only I actually were in Dire Straits.) Streaming only really works for superstars and super record labels. Instead of receiving a direct amount per sale, as with downloads or physical purchases, it’s a “winner-takes-all” system. The way it works is the combined revenue of every streaming subscriber is divided by by “market share”. For example, suppose Bruno Mars releases an album and – rightly, because he’s amazing – Bruno appears on the surface of every phone, on every playlist, pushed by every algorithm. He could potentially end up with 5% of the whole world’s streaming money. Or, to be accurate, his record label will pocket that 5%. Bruno might see about 20% of that if, and only if, he’s repaid his recording costs. Pre-digital artists may be on pre-digital deals, so they may see nothing. Even before Covid, the major labels were making almost $20m a day from streaming. And this year has seen a a huge increase in streaming subscriptions, as fans turn to platforms such as Apple Music and Spotify to help ease their locked-down minds. The three major music groups, Sony, Warner and Universal own about three-quarters of the music ever made so, by this system, they’ll pocket about three-quarters of streaming revenue every month. Independent or self-releasing artists share the rest. For all the promise of digital democratisation of music, the opposite appears to be happening. For an independent artist with a dedicated audience, the system doesn’t work. And neither does it work for loyal fans. If you are a dance fan, jazz fan, or metal fan, the artists you love and listen to are unlikely to see a penny of your subscription. Streaming is the future, but to deliver a rich and culturally diverse musical future, non-mainstream music needs to be able to keep its head above water. This is especially true as radio and TV continue to morph into streaming platforms. A playlist on the BBC Sounds app doesn’t pay performers in the way the same song on BBC radio would. What can we do to fix it? Last week, I appeared beside Guy Garvey of Elbow, Ed O’Brien of Radiohead and Tom Gray of Gomez, to give evidence in front of the DCMS inquiry. It was terrifying. Music and politics rarely come face to face. Musicians are supposed to rail against politicians, not testify in front of them. But now we’re asking the government to intervene and correct the streaming market where it’s failing. Guy, Ed, Tom and I suggested the government grant musicians rights to income from streaming, so they can earn a percentage from every stream regardless of the system. The same is already true of TV and radio broadcasts, so it’s hardly a revolutionary idea. It works well. The government could also look into the market dominance of the major music companies. One much-debated remedy the committee of MPs seemed interested in is changing the way the streaming economy pays. Making it “user-centric” rather than based on market share. So, if you listen to jazz, your money would go to the people who create, produce and distribute jazz music. Sounds fair? Music needs to be wild and varied, it needs to be inventive and original, and it needs to be economically sustainable. Streaming, as it currently is, provides less than a trickle for the workers who make it. Reform is needed so it can grow into a river from which the musicians of today and tomorrow can drink. • Nadine Shah is a Mercury prize-nominated singer-songwriter.

          "headline": "Essential poll: two-thirds of Australians say government should regulate Facebook and Google",
          "bodyText": "A majority of Australians want the government to regulate the digital behemoths, and voters also support moves to make Facebook and Google pay for mainstream media content, according to the Guardian Essential poll. The latest fortnightly survey of 1,034 voters shows three in five Australians (59%) agree that Facebook and Google have too much power and should be regulated by the government, with 13% of respondents disagreeing with that proposition. A similar percentage (57%) believes Facebook and Google should be required to pay media outlets for distributing their news content, with 15% disagreeing. Voters were also asked whether websites should face limitations on the amount of personal information about users they collect (73% agreed with that proposition), and whether they thought systems that monitor web activity to target advertising and communications to users should be illegal (63% supported that idea). The Morrison government is expected to use the final parliamentary sitting fortnight to introduce legislation giving effect to a new code forcing Google and Facebook to pay for the value they receive from the distribution of Australian journalism. The proposal is expected to be introduced to parliament next week. Responses to questions in the Guardian Essential poll suggest men are more worried than women about the power of the digital platforms. Government regulation as a corrective was supported by a majority of Coalition (65%), Labor (58%) and Greens (60%) voters, and people intending to vote for someone other than the major parties (64%). The proposal to make the platforms pay for news content was also backed by a majority of voters across the cohorts (64% of Coalition voters, 53% Labor, 56% Greens, and 54% of people intending to vote for someone other than the major parties). The proposed code aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants, and force Google and Facebook to pay for the value they receive from the distribution of Australian journalism. It would also require Google and Facebook to provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. If they failed to comply, they could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. The original draft of the code excluded the publicly funded broadcasters ABC and SBS. The recent addition of the public broadcasters is one of the significant changes treasurer Josh Frydenberg made to the mandatory news code ahead of its tabling next week. Labor, the Greens and several crossbenchers pushed the Coalition to include the ABC and SBS in the interests of helping gain broad cross-party support for the legislation. On Thursday, the Nobel Prize-winning American economist, Joseph Stiglitz and Anya Schiffrin, director of technology, media and communications at Columbia University, will participate in a webinar organised by the Australia Institute to consider Australia’s media bargaining code. Peter Lewis, the director of Essential Media Communications, and director of the Australia Institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology, said the results of this fortnight’s survey showed voters would support proactive moves by governments to regulate the platforms. “What is heartening is that there is growing consensus across the political spectrum that redressing the power imbalance with these platforms is good for democracy,” Lewis said. “With politics around the globe falling prey to disinformation, division and distortion through social media, this is a critical intervention to maintain viable, independent and diverse media outlets”. Lewis said the Australian proposal was a first, and an important one. By pursuing the code, the Australian parliament would “establish a world-leading framework to sustain the public square”."

But ultimately it’s not so much a glitch in the algorithm as a glitch in the simulation. There are so many scams and deepfakes floating in the feed. When you make a risque joke about period panties, Thinx replies. One subtweet and you’ve elicited the attention of a bored social media manager. They’re desperate to loop you into a post-relevant conversation about a forgotten brand from 2015. These little micro-viral moments remind you that no one is in The Loop any more. There are simply too many loops going on at once. You get this feeling most intensely when you’re somewhere like Dimes Square in New York or Soma in San Francisco –hot little brand crucibles. “You don’t listen to X podcast?” “You don’t get ads from this brand?” The people that populate these little scenes are incredulous because you, a visitor, have, if only for a moment, popped their little reality distortion field. On a road trip to see Cher in Vegas some years ago, I started complaining about Allbirds. I had been working at an ad agency in Playa Vista and the sustainable and washable wool sneakers were all but ubiquitous. Strategists loved them, because strategists love these succinct little brand stories. Sustainable wool farming in New Zealand. My friends, both fashion industry veterans, were unnerved by the ungainly orthopaedic forms. They were even more unnerved by the immediate introduction of Allbirds ads into their carefully curated feeds. Our little educational conversation had created a chink in their armour and exposed them to the unfathomable desires of others. Back in Los Angeles, I pitch an idea for a new research study: Red, Weird, and Blue. In my mind, this is a rough schematic of America. It’s not one culture, but two duelling megaplexes. CNN and the New York Times tag-team Fox News and Breitbart. They’re locked in an existential battle to create a 21st-century monoculture. Meanwhile, a variety of subcultures percolate in between. This is what Joe Biden means when he says the election is about “changing the channel”. He’s asking America to cancel its cable subscription to Fox News. Politics is probably where the effects of our democratised reality distortion fields can be most immediately identified. The popular idea that social media is to blame for all the craziness is somewhat true. It has broken down the barrier between our inner lives and outer selves, theoretically making us porous to nefarious influences. QAnon, Russiagate, and all manner of other conspiracy theories posit there is some evil nexus – someone, somewhere pulling the puppet strings – which exactly is, of course, what the conspiracy theorists most like to debate. Are things being controlled by the Kremlin? An anonymous conference room filled with Bilderberg attendees? That kitsch Egyptianate temple in the Virgin Islands? The answers are probably a bit more banal than flat Earthers would like. It’s the Facebook campus in Menlo Park. Everyone is a bot on someone else’s timeline, a fly in someone else’s ointment. Our celebrity politicians are merely participating in the greatest reality show on Earth. The famed descent down the golden escalator was a publicity stunt for an NBC show, The Apprentice. He was following in the footsteps of Ronald Reagan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, La Cicciolina, Beppe Grillo, Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Meghan Markle. A storied history that dates back to JFK trouncing Nixon in the 1960 presidential debates. Nixon refused to wear stage makeup and suffered dearly for it. They say that in ancient Rome, prostitutes and actors were not allowed to vote and hold public office. Today, everyone knows that those who can’t entertain, can’t campaign. The media eyes Yeezy’s Larp presidential bid warily. “Vision 2020” walks the line between fake it ’til you make it and, well, just faking it. Social media made all the world a stage, making the conversion of everyday life into a reality TV complete. Thus, we’re all a bit fake right now. Playing our bit parts in the grand drama of life, dreaming of being upgraded to an understudy, and maybe, if we play our cards right, scoring a leading role.

          "bodyText": "Having risen to fame on its superhuman performance at playing games, the artificial intelligence group DeepMind has cracked a serious scientific problem that has stumped researchers for half a century. With its latest AI program, AlphaFold, the company and research laboratory showed it can predict how proteins fold into 3D shapes, a fiendishly complex process that is fundamental to understanding the biological machinery of life. Independent scientists said the breakthrough would help researchers tease apart the mechanisms that drive some diseases and pave the way for designer medicines, more nutritious crops and “green enzymes” that can break down plastic pollution. DeepMind said it had started work with a handful of scientific groups and would focus initially on malaria, sleeping sickness and leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease. “It marks an exciting moment for the field,” said Demis Hassabis, DeepMind’s founder and chief executive. “These algorithms are now becoming mature enough and powerful enough to be applicable to really challenging scientific problems.” Venki Ramakrishnan, the president of the Royal Society, called the work “a stunning advance” that had occurred “decades before many people in the field would have predicted”. DeepMind is best known for its run of human-trouncing programs that achieved supremacy in chess, Go, Starcraft II and old-school Atari classics. But superhuman gameplay was never the primary aim. Instead, games provided a training ground for programs that, once powerful enough, would be unleashed on real-world problems. Protein folding has been a grand challenge in biology for 50 years. An arcane form of molecular origami, its importance is hard to overstate. Most biological processes revolve around proteins and a protein’s shape determines its function. When researchers know how a protein folds up, they can start to uncover what it does. How insulin controls sugar levels in the blood and how antibodies fight coronavirus are both determined by protein structure. Scientists have identified more than 200m proteins but structures are known for only a fraction of them. Traditionally, the shapes are discovered through meticulous lab work that can take years. And while computer scientists have made headway on the problem, inferring the structure from a protein’s makeup is no easy task. Proteins are chains of amino acids that can twist and bend into a mind-boggling variety of shapes: a googol cubed, or 1 followed by 300 zeroes. To learn how proteins fold, researchers at DeepMind trained their algorithm on a public database containing about 170,000 protein sequences and their shapes. Running on the equivalent of 100 to 200 graphics processing units – by modern standards, a modest amount of computing power – the training took a few weeks. DeepMind put AlphaFold through its paces by entering it for a biennial “protein olympics” known as Casp, the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction. Entrants to the international competition are given the amino acid sequences for about 100 proteins and challenged to work them out. The results from teams that use computers are compared with those based on lab work. AlphaFold not only outperformed other computer programs but reached an accuracy comparable to the laborious and time-consuming lab-based methods. When ranked across all proteins analysed, AlphaFold had a median score of 92.5 out of 100, with 90 being the equivalent to experimental methods. For the hardest proteins, the median score fell, but only marginally to 87. Hassabis said DeepMind had started work on how to give researchers access to AlphaFold to help with scientific research. Andrei Lupas, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in Tübingen, Germany, said he had already used the program to solve a protein structure that scientists had been stuck on for a decade. Janet Thornton, a director emeritus of EMBL’s European Bioinformatics Institute near Cambridge, who was not involved in the work, said she was excited to hear the results. “This is a problem that I was beginning to think would not get solved in my lifetime,” she said. “Knowing these structures will really help us to understand how human beings operate and function, how we work.” John Jumper, a researcher on the team at DeepMind, said: “We really didn’t know until we saw the Casp results how far we had pushed the field.” It is not the end of the work, however. Future research will focus on how proteins combine to form larger “complexes” and how they interact with other molecules in living organisms."

          "bodyText": "The news that France’s court of appeal has ruled in favour of the French Competition Authority’s order that Google must negotiate payments with publishers for linking to their content has provoked predictable howls of outrage from the tech industry and their more sympathetic commentators. “This,” observes Benedict Evans, the analyst recently returned from a big Silicon Valley venture capital firm, in his invaluable weekly newsletter, “is a fascinating logical fallacy – it makes perfect sense as long as you never ask why no one other than Google pays to link either and never ask why it should only be newspapers that get paid to be linked to.” The only place where the news of the French decision seems to have been greeted with enthusiasm is Australia, whose Competition and Consumer Commission (ACC) is putting the finishing touches to a mandatory news code that will be introduced to parliament before the end of the year. This code will, like the French ruling, force Google and Facebook to negotiate payments with Australian publishers for using their content. The tech industry – or at any rate the surveillance capitalism wing of it – is not just outraged by the effrontery of the regulators, but also genuinely baffled by it. To the denizens of Silicon Valley, it makes no sense: after all, they see print publications as defunct because the business model that supported them has been undermined by the way the web snaffled most advertising revenue. Besides, who wants to read papers in an era when people get much of their news and other information online? Indeed, often the only reason people know about a news story is because Google has pointed them to the publication in which it appeared. So, concludes Mr Evans, characterising the need for compensation as a matter of copyright and competition, as the French and Aussies are doing, is “intellectually dishonest: this is a targeted tax of a politically unpopular company to subsidise politically connected companies”. Quite so. But buried deep in this mindset are two fundamental misconceptions. The first is its implicit determinism. The Silicon Valley credo is the doctrine that technology drives history and society’s role is to adapt to it as best it can. It’s a narrative suffused with Joseph Schumpeter’s idea that capitalism progresses by “creative destruction” – a “process of industrial mutation that continuously revolutionises the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one”. This was the philosophy famously articulated in Mark Zuckerberg’s exhortation to “move fast and break things”. And implicit in it was the assumption that society’s only role on this voyage to tech nirvana is to pick up the pieces on the way. So how dare Australian and French regulators have the temerity to put up roadblocks on this inspirational journey. The second critical flaw in the tech narrative is its indifference to the requirements of democracy. One of the lessons we have learned over a couple of centuries is that functioning societies need free media – free in the sense of liberty rather than free beer. I hold no brief for newspapers, per se, or for many conventional media organisations, but I think it’s unquestionable that the survival of liberal democracy requires a functioning public sphere in which information circulates freely and in which wrongdoing, corruption, incompetence and injustices can be investigated and brought to public attention. And one of the consequences of the rise of social media is that whatever public sphere we once had is now distorted and polluted by being forced through four narrow apertures called Google, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, services in which almost everything that people see, read or hear is curated by algorithms designed solely to increase the profitability of their owners. One sees the effects of this transformation of the public sphere at all levels, but one of the most disturbing is in the decline of local newspapers. In many regions of democratic states what goes on in the courts, council chambers, planning committees, chambers of commerce, trade union branches, community centres, sports clubs, churches and schools now goes unreported because local newspapers have gone bust or shrunk to shadows of their former selves. Citizens of most UK towns and cities now have much less information about what’s happening in their localities than their grandparents did, no matter how assiduously they check their Facebook or Twitter feeds. And the quality of local democratic discourse has been accordingly impaired. The tech companies are not wholly to blame for these changes of course. But they have played a significant role in undermining the institutions whose business model they vaporised. Looked at from that perspective, it seems wholly reasonable that societies should require social media companies to contribute to the support of news organisations that democracies require for their functioning and survival. Mr Evans’s complaint that the French and Australian codes represent a “tax” is accurate as far as it goes. The only things wrong with it are that the proceeds should be funnelled to local news organisations as much as to the big newspaper groups and that it should be allied to measures to ensure that Google and co pay taxes proportional to the revenues they extract from the countries where they operate. In the case of Australia, for example, Google paid paid just A$133m on revenues of A$1.2bn. Which rather puts their complaints about having to pay peanuts to publishers into perspective.

          "bodyText": "Ocado’s warehouse in Erith, 15 miles east of London on the Thames estuary, is staffed by 1,050 “personal shoppers”. Outnumbering them are 1,800 robots the size of small washing machines. You see them by climbing to the top level of the vast warehouse – at 564,000 sq ft, it is more than three times the size of St Peter’s in Rome – where a sign tells you that photography is strictly prohibited. The online supermarket is paranoid that rivals will glimpse the technology it believes to be revolutionary. From the viewing platform you can watch these metal cubes endlessly whiz around, moving thousands of plastic crates as if they were playing an enormous game of chess. You occasionally sight bottles of bleach or rosé, packets of noodles and dog biscuits, before they are sent down to a lower level. “I find it quite mesmerising, like robotic ballet,” says Mel Smith, CEO of Ocado Retail, the UK arm of the business. “The day I decided I wanted this job was when I went to [the warehouse] and thought, this is absolutely the future.” Smith is a plain-speaking, cheery New Zealander who joined just over a year ago from Marks &amp; Spencer. She was hired in part to oversee the potentially tricky move of Ocado taking on M&amp;S as its main supplier, after its longstanding relationship with Waitrose turned sour. The day I visit, it is just 48 hours after Ocado switched to M&amp;S. A floor below the robots, Elizabeth, a personal shopper, is standing at pick station number 29. Her average “each” time – Ocado jargon for individual products – is flashed up on a screen in front of her: 6.7 seconds, beating the target of seven seconds. This is how long it takes her to reach into the crate that has flown down a shaft from the floors above, take a product – in this case a bag of Cafédirect Machu Picchu ground coffee – scan its barcode and place it in one of Ocado’s distinctive grey plastic bags. This is what makes the online retailer so different. If you place an order for a large shop from Tesco, Sainsbury’s or any of the other supermarkets, they will usually send a worker to walk along the aisles and pick your shopping in either an actual store or a so-called “dark store”, which caters exclusively to online shopping. Even if they are very quick, this is likely to take 20 minutes to half an hour. “There’s no way you can pick as quickly in store as here. Nothing like it,” says Simon Nottage, who runs the warehouse and is showing me around. He points to Elizabeth, who is now placing some cat litter into a bag: “This one station will do up to 400 ‘eaches’ an hour.” The next item is a bag of Marks &amp; Spencer Percy Pigs. “We’ve had a lot of those today,” Nottage says. In that first week of the switchover, Ocado distributed 150,000 packets of M&amp;S’s famous sweets. The switchover was expected to be the defining event for Ocado in 2020, until something cataclysmic happened. At 8.30pm on 23 March, Boris Johnson put the nation into lockdown. By 9.30pm that evening, Ocado thought it was suffering from a denial of service attack, when hackers try to disable a website by flooding it with traffic. “In that hour, we had over 800,000 authentications: that’s customers who put their username or password into the website to try and gain access to it – in one hour,” says Tim Steiner, Ocado’s chief executive and cofounder. “We had built a business with lots of clever features and functionality over 20 years to attract people in,” Steiner says. “We never thought that we needed to have crowd control on the outside. We weren’t selling the latest Nike trainer or Glastonbury tickets.” Back at the warehouse, Nottage, 49, seems unflappable, but admits that as the pandemic gathered pace in March, he became increasingly anxious. “Staff absences were huge at one point,” he says, with one in five workers off, because of either illness or shielding. Extra staff were rapidly hired to cope with Covid shortages and a surge in orders. For a few weeks in March and early April, trying to secure an Ocado slot became a Covid rite of passage. Shoppers set their alarms for the middle of the night in the hope that they could grab a rare delivery, or sat in a virtual queue for more than seven hours to get their hands on milk, bread and other essentials. At one point, Ocado closed down the website for 48 hours; it suspended its app for five months for most of its customers; some still can’t access it. With a fresh outbreak of panic buying at the end of September, followed by the Welsh firebreak and, in November, a second English lockdown, slots have once again become harder to secure. Lockdown changed everything – people who had only ever bought a book or some printer ink online suddenly needed to buy daily provisions over the internet. Smith says she watched with mounting fascination at how people’s shopping baskets changed. “My anthropological understanding of society has really shifted. First off, everyone went nuts for baked beans, tins, pasta, toilet paper. Then after that, everyone went virtuous, sort of Martha Stewart. There was a lot of yeast and home-baking stuff, educational stuff for the kids. Not long after there was a lot of alcohol and ice-cream. And then personal cleaning and grooming products, like deodorant and soap, fell off the cliff. I think people were staying at home and drinking a lot, and perhaps not adhering to their normal hygiene routines.” Now that England is back in lockdown, sales of chocolate, puddings and alcohol have surged. “This time around, we’ve ditched any pretence of being virtuous. Alcohol is even bigger than it was during lockdown one. Beer sales in particular have spiked.” How about deodorant? “Personal hygiene has not improved. People are basically living at home in their sweatpants.” Smith says Ocado’s Christmas slots, which usually take five days to be filled, were snapped up within five hours of being released in early October. “We released them at midnight and thousands of people stayed up to grab one.” Small turkeys – aimed at six people or fewer – have already sold out. Despite turning away hundreds of thousands of customers, the demand for Ocado’s service has seen its existing, wealthy shoppers buying more, both for themselves and family members, with average orders climbing from £105 to £180 at one point. This was much more than the average online supermarket shop, which hit £87 during the pandemic, according to Kantar, the research company, and considerably more than the average supermarket shop, which was £25. The supermarket industry as a whole increased sales by 13.2% during the six months to 6 October. Ocado’s sales increased by 43.7%. This increase has been dwarfed by the company’s share price rise. Shares have jumped by 121% since the start of the pandemic, and by the beginning of this month Ocado was worth £18bn, nearly as much as Tesco, Britain’s biggest retailer. A company that was once the butt of jokes about supplying only smug, middle-class Londoners with organic kale and harissa paste has become – along with Amazon, Netflix and Zoom – one of the global winners of Covid-19: a tech company promising to transform our lives and upend the established order. “I don’t think we’ll go back to what we were doing before with supermarket shopping,” Smith says. “Because once you’ve seen the light, why would you ever get into the car to go to the supermarket?” Last year just one in five Britons did an online supermarket shop; it is now one in three. Online grocery shopping is here to stay. There are some, however, who believe Ocado’s rise and astonishing valuation beggar belief. They say that its tortuous history, making a loss for 17 of its 20 years of operation, as well as its inability to handle a surge in new customers during the pandemic, means it can never become a serious rival to Tesco, let alone Britain’s answer to Amazon. Lockdown was its chance to prove the superiority of its robotic technology and win over hundreds of thousands of new customers, and to some extent, it blew it. More than that, the critics argue, online shopping is fundamentally an unprofitable business. *** The rise of Ocado is almost entirely down to one man: its chief executive Tim Steiner, 51, whom Smith, on more than one occasion, calls “a genius”. He has certainly been remunerated accordingly, paid £58.7m last year in salary and bonuses. A former banker, he has a reputation for being prickly. We speak over Google video call; he is in his Highgate home in London, wearing a grey T-shirt, with a scrupulously blank desk and unadorned wall. As he explains the company’s history, he does little to dissuade me that he has – as someone who used to work with him told me – “a mentality that the world and everyone is against him”, despite Ocado’s “20-year overnight success story”, as he calls it. He talks about “perennial detractors” who have always written the company off, analysts who “fail to understand” the magnitude of Ocado’s potential. Steiner set up the company with two friends, all then in their late 20s and working for Goldman Sachs: Jason Gissing, 50, and Jonathan Faiman, 51, Steiner’s friend from nursery school. “It was the first dotcom boom,” Steiner says. “Starting a business and scaling up was kind of the rage.” The business was founded in 2000 and called Last Mile Solutions (LMS). The idea was that it would team up with a supermarket chain and deliver their products to people’s homes – from a central warehouse using lots of technology. But they did not have a supermarket partner. Both Tesco and Sainsbury’s had already dipped their toes into online retailing, which left LMS with few options. “Waitrose approached us. In fact, it was Charlie Mayfield who called me,” Gissing recalls. “At the time he was working for the development director at John Lewis.” Mayfield, as Sir Charlie, would go on to become chairman of the John Lewis partnership. “John Lewis had a reputation at the time for being very conservative and not very dynamic,” Gissing says. But the company was keen to expand its Waitrose brand and wasn’t big enough to go it alone; it invested £35m in the business in return for a 40% stake. It cashed in the last of its stake in 2011, making a £220m profit, which seemed lucrative at the time. Had it held on to its original shareholding, it would now be worth around £7bn. By the time the company started delivering food to customers in 2002, it had changed its name. A branding company presented the trio with a list of 100 options. “There were names such as Bean Runner and Fruit Passion,” Gissing recalls. “Ocado was on there because it sounded a bit like avocado and was easy to spell. I said: ‘I like that one.’ And Tim said he liked it, too.” Ocado soon established itself as the quinoa classes’ supermarket of choice, helped by its policy of hiring polite delivery drivers who would unpack your shopping for you, if asked. Money was thrown at good customer service, too. With your fifth shop, you received a free bottle of champagne; any broken items were refunded and a voucher given as an apology. “I used to joke that it cost several million quid per delivery,” Gissing says. “Because we’d raised all this money, but made very few deliveries.” At the time the company floated on the stock market in 2010, it had never made a profit, though it was delivering around 80,000 orders a week. Philip Dorgan, then an analyst at the broker Ambrian Partners, memorably quipped: “Ocado begins with an ‘o’, ends with an ‘o’ and is worth zero.” Sir Terry Leahy, then chief executive of Tesco, dismissed it as a “charity”. To make matters worse, Faiman quit the company and would later fall out spectacularly with his cofounders after setting up a rival. There was an increasingly ill-tempered legal dispute, with mud thrown very publicly from both sides. Steiner refuses to talk about it, perhaps because the dispute is not fully resolved, but at one point when discussing how the three of them started the venture, he says “my friends”, before pointedly correcting himself and saying “my then friends”. As the losses continued to mount, John Lewis and Waitrose started to lose patience. Gissing says: “We were constantly fighting with John Lewis and Waitrose. It was like being in an abusive marriage at times.” The turning point was in 2013, when Ocado went behind Waitrose’s back and struck a deal with Morrisons – to supply warehouse technology and software to the Yorkshire supermarket. Waitrose was livid. From that moment the relationship between the two was irretrievable. But to Ocado the Morrisons deal was a godsend, not just raising more money, but also proving to its critics that other supermarkets were willing to pay good money for its knowhow and technology. Dorgan, the man who had written them off, says: “It removed any doubt that they could survive. It gave them credibility.” In the last few years, Ocado has struck deals with, among others, Casino in France, Sobeys in Canada and Kroger, the second largest supermarket in the US. These chains pay Ocado a licence fee for its robots and its software. At the moment this licensing revenue makes up less than 1% of Ocado’s total turnover, but that’s because most of these deals are at very early stages. Many of the warehouses are still being built, the robots yet to start whizzing around. For now, most of Ocado’s turnover comes from Ocado Retail – the vans delivering milk, hummus and ready meals to customers in England and Wales (it doesn’t stretch farther north than Sunderland). Confusingly, this UK business, run by Mel Smith, was split off last year into a separate joint venture, 50% owned by Marks &amp; Spencer – an arrangement it struck after the relationship with Waitrose collapsed. Steiner’s hope is that, over time, the UK joint venture will become a relatively small part of the total business, because the overseas licensing revenue will grow and grow. It will stop being a UK online supermarket and become a global technology giant. Earlier this month, Ocado spent $287m (£216m) buying two US robotics companies to help speed up automation in its warehouses – a move that boosted its share price, before news of Pfizer’s vaccine breakthrough sent it back down. “We’ve been investing in the future of distribution of groceries,” Steiner says. “And it is a £7.8tn market.” Yes, that’s trillion. Considering that Ocado charges overseas grocery chains a fee equating to about 5% of turnover, you can see why many people think it has hit the jackpot. The company would be taking a small slice of people’s weekly shop from Romford to Rio de Janeiro. Crucially, online shopping is quick. Smith reckons the average Ocado shopper spends just 14.6 minutes doing their online shop, compared with well over an hour driving to and pushing a trolley around a traditional supermarket. But does that swiftness remove something from the shopping experience? Not many consumers would want to return to the 1950s, when food shopping required a separate trip to the baker, the butcher and the greengrocer; but when Ocado and other online food shops allow you to buy exactly the same order as last week with the click of a button, do we end up boxed into algorithm-designed consumer stereotypes – destined always to have chicken kiev on a Monday and mushroom risotto on a Tuesday? “My view is that 70% or 80% of what people put in their basket is something they habitually do,” Smith says. “Something we need to do – and we are redesigning our website further – is to try to put more inspiration in your way, so you can buy something you’ve not seen before.” Ocado has an astonishing 58,000 items on its website – more than double what you could find in the very largest hypermarket – but how many of those do most customers ever buy? The site frequently flashes special offers on the screen or makes “recommendations” of new items. “But shoppers’ attention span online is quite short,” Smith admits. “They tend to only look at the first four things and if you’re not – as a supplier – in the search algorithm for the first four things, you don’t make it into the basket.” Supermarkets were once the gateway to a world of exotic ingredients and innovative products for the Delia Smith generation. Online grocery stores are unlikely to fully replicate that. Online shoppers have always been wealthier than average – the high minimum spend and delivery charges, coupled with the need to have access to broadband, mean not just Ocado, but also Tesco and Morrisons online have always appealed to customers with larger wallets. The winter lockdowns have only cemented this trend, according to Ocado. “Our most premium customers have four orders booked in advance,” Smith says. “They are obviously nervous about securing an order, so they have forward-planned – you would never have seen this a year ago.” To secure these deliveries, you need to put at least £40 worth of goods in each of your online baskets. And it is often filled with a single bottle of expensive champagne as a holding item – not always removed before the shop is completed. “Our aim is to be more accessible to a broader range of the population over time,” Smith says. For now, that will have to remain an ambition. Ocado’s customer base has not changed this year for the simple reason that it did not have the capacity to take on new customers. This sits at the heart of the Ocado conundrum. Its warehouses were already running at full capacity before Covid, processing a maximum of 450,000 orders a week. While Tesco could cope with a surge in demand by hiring (at some expense) thousands of new workers to go around supermarkets “picking” customers’ orders, Ocado could not. It needs to build new warehouses, which is a cumbersome process. The business was already in the process of expanding, taking its capacity to 655,000 orders, but this will take another 18 months. Critics of Ocado argue that it will always be more expensive for any retailer to deliver groceries to your front door than for you to get into your car and do your own shopping. The most profit Ocado has ever made was back in 2016, when it totalled £12m on turnover of £1.27bn. That’s just 1p profit for every £1 of washing powder or hummus sold. Tesco makes more than 4p per £1 in the UK. Steiner argues the economics were – for nearly a century – stacked in Tesco’s favour: it owned the supermarkets, from which it delivers its online groceries. Ocado had to build its warehouses from scratch. “If you and I were playing Monopoly, but I started out already owning half the sites on the board, with hotels on all of them, you could be Bill Gates or Larry Page or Jeff Bezos in intelligence, but you’re not going to win. Until someone changes the rules, you can’t win a game.” He argues the rules have changed – because he has changed them. Ocado’s warehouses are now profitable. And it won’t be long before it is cheaper for the robots, rather than you, to do your shopping. What then? Ocado remains a minnow compared with Tesco, in terms of how many customers it has, controlling just 1.7% of the UK grocery market compared with Tesco’s 27%. But Steiner believes there will come a time when the big, legacy supermarkets will go the way of so many high street fishmongers, bakers and greengrocers. Only a few more of us need to ditch our cars and start shopping online, and “that would destroy the profitability of most supermarket groups in the UK”, Steiner argues, with a blase ruthlessness born of nearly two decades of critics sniping about Ocado’s viability. Now it’s his turn to dismiss them. “It will be like Comet, Currys, Woolworths. Someone will go first. Not every store will disappear, but there will be a dramatic shift. As stores have to fight it out, and they deteriorate their service to try to be economical, they have fewer staff, the stock starts to look more tired, it’s not as fresh as it was – you can see an acceleration of channel shift.” He believes the online supermarkets, headed by Ocado, will be ready and waiting to take over. It seems outlandish. But so, too, was the idea that Tesco could ever become Britain’s biggest supermarket, or that Woolworths could disappear from our high streets. The British consumer is fickle, and never more so than now."

          "bodyText": "The University of Surrey has become the latest higher education institution to lower its entry requirements for next year in recognition of the disruption to education caused by the coronavirus crisis. Entry grades will be reduced by one grade for most undergraduate programmes starting in September 2021 to help relieve the pressure and anxiety faced by young people who will have had their learning significantly disrupted across two academic years. Last week the University of Birmingham also announced it planned to reduce entry requirements for 2021 by one grade, meaning pressure on other universities to follow suit is likely to grow. Lizzie Burrows, the director of recruitment and admissions at the University of Surrey, said: “We are taking this action now to relieve the pressure and anxiety facing this year’s applicants, as they experience ongoing disruption and uncertainty surrounding exams and assessment of their learning. “By taking this step, we can provide one additional element of certainty and reassurance that these students will be protected from unfair disadvantage as a result of the impact of the pandemic.” Degree programmes that are not included are regulated courses such as veterinary medicine, foundation year courses, four-year integrated master’s programmes and audition-based performance courses, which will retain the same entry requirements. Experts have said that GCSE and A-level exams should be replaced with teacher assessments next year because of coronavirus disruption. The Independent Sage group, chaired by former government chief scientific adviser David King, is calling for all primary school tests to be cancelled and for secondary school exams to be replaced with assessments by teachers with suitable moderation. In the Commons last week, the education minister, Nick Gibb, said the government was working to ensure 2021 exams were fair, but that more details would be published shortly. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, made a humiliating U-turn this summer over Ofqual’s “centre-assessed grades”, which had used an algorithm to moderate A-level teacher-assessed grades partly in recognition of schools’ historic performance and was widely seen to disadvantage higher achievers at lower achieving schools. Birmingham University’s vice-chancellor, Prof David Eastwood, last week said many prospective first years in the class of 2021 were likely to experience more than a year of interrupted learning by the time they sat their exams next summer. He said he hoped reducing the entry requirements would “alleviate anxieties”. Earlier this month, Wales called off end-of-year GCSE and A-level tests for students this academic year. The Labour-controlled government said it would work with schools and colleges to put in place teacher-managed assessments as it was the fairest way given that the time students spend in school or college could vary greatly. There have been calls for education institutions to work to lower grade requirements for disadvantaged students in particular, since many will have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus crisis."

          "headline": "Boris Johnson's 'mutant' planning algorithm could scar England for ever",
          "bodyText": "When Dominic Cummings stormed out of Downing Street earlier this month he left behind a time bomb more explosive than any pandemic recession or no-deal Brexit. Those pestilences will pass. If enacted, the Cummings-inspired white paper Planning for the Future will scar England’s face for ever. The paper promises to shift the appearance of England. It intends to throw open landscapes, especially across the south-east, to uncontrolled “build, build, build”. It will tip wealth yet further towards London and end any levelling-up of the north. It will abolish the ages-old distinction in British planning between built-up areas and the 70-80% of land that is still rural. It will leave poorer city centres to decline, result in villages doubling or trebling in size, and building dribbling from one town into the next. Fields and open spaces will disappear. The white paper was slipped out with a minimum of publicity in August by Boris Johnson’s housing minister, Robert Jenrick. It was based on that latest Whitehall fad, an algorithm, prepared by various construction and development lobbyists and targeted at encouraging building where it was “most needed”, an outrageous euphemism for “most profitable”. What has been dubbed the mutant algorithm has attracted the ire of the entire planning community and, more seriously for the government, of many Tory MPs who see their rural and semi-rural constituencies effectively being decontrolled. The unpublished algorithm – or is it a formula? – confuses housing need with demand reflected in price. Local planning authorities are told to zone some areas for “protection” – national parks, green belts and “outstanding” natural beauty areas – but elsewhere land is to be left free for building, with no need for specific planning permission. Planners expect that, among other results, this will put the overwhelming majority of farmland “into play”. One told me: “It puts every meadow under a death sentence.” No other modern country has decontrolled its land use to this degree. As for the levelling-down of the north, the policy is little short of sensational. It reportedly requires housebuilding in Newcastle to fall by 66%, Manchester by 37% and the north-east generally by 28%. In the south-east outside London, development would rise by 57%, and in Kensington the algorithm reportedly posits a ludicrous 633%. Building round Cotswold villages is required almost to double. The Local Government Association has professed itself baffled that Jenrick should so “seriously jeopardise levelling up”. The Royal Institute of British Architects predicts that the end of planning permissions will lead to “the next generation of slum housing”. The countryside charity CPRE could not see the point of cutting carbon emissions while directing housebuilding to new settlements reliant on cars, requiring “a massive loss of countryside”. The policy amounted to “build and be damned”. The planning lawyer and former supreme court judge Lord Carnwath has written to Jenrick protesting the document’s “levelling the foundations” of English planning, while “not beginning to make the case … for the disruption caused”. The boundary between landscape conservation and nimbyism has always been hard to draw, but it is vividly illustrated in the catalogue of ministerial hypocrisy on planning. As prime minister, Johnson has told his own constituency it “needs” 446 new houses, while as MP he has objected to a scheme for 514. He now intends to remove his liberty to object. Meanwhile the home secretary, Priti Patel, has objected to 225 houses in her constituency, defence secretary Ben Wallace to 210 in his and the Cabinet Office’s Michael Gove to 44 in his. One of Johnson’s many glib promises is to build 300,000 houses a year. This figure snatched from the air seems vaguely related to household formation, immigration and price, the latter two of which are now falling. The policy has nothing to say on vacancy rates, security of tenure, or the absurd VAT tax relief for new building but not for house conversion. It has nothing to say on the million unused planning permissions or on the regular claims that London alone has brownfield land for another million people – planned homes waiting to be built. As for England’s 280,000 homeless people currently in urgent need of social housing, forget it. In other words, this is government modelling at its dumbest. At the time of the 2012 Olympics, the English countryside ranked in polls as one of the things people most prized about England. Johnson and Jenrick do not care for this view. Those holding it are to be stripped of any control over the countryside, in deference to Whitehall and its Tory-donating developers. Land-use decisions cannot be quantified. A good planner – a near defunct profession in England – is charged with enacting Alexander Pope’s maxim that we should “Consult the genius of the place in all”. Democracy awards this consultation to the community, not to wealth. How communities shape and develop their neighbourhoods is the most sensitive of political decisions. It is also one of the few remaining areas of local democratic discretion in England. The reality is that Johnson’s targets and Jenrick’s models are meant to please the volume builders of rural executive estates. They do not care how land is curated, countryside protected and the north-south balance adjusted. They mock the idea that communities should “take back control” of their most precious resource, land. Fifty years ago, Britain had an admired global reputation for town and country planning. As in so many branches of our government, that reputation is collapsing. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist This story was amended on 27 November because a missing word in the sentence about VAT tax relief completely changed its meaning"

          "headline": "The mystery epidemic striking Nicaragua’s sugar cane workers – a photo essay",
          "bodyText": "For decades, a mystery epidemic has plagued young male labourers toiling in Nicaragua’s sugar cane plantations. The men start their work fit and strong, but after repeated harvests chopping cane under the tropical sun, they begin to suffer from nausea, back pain and exhaustion, get such severe muscle weakness that they can no longer earn a living, then end up dying of kidney failure, despite many being only in their 20s and 30s. In Chichigalpa, the centre of Nicaragua’s sugar cane industry, the mysterious illness accounts for half of all male deaths over the last decade. Just outside this “town of city and rum”, as it is known, one rural community has earned itself the moniker “La Isla de Viudas” – the Island of Widows. Patients in the dialysis clinic at Hospital España. Dr Nelson Garcia, bottom right, has 6,000 CKD patients, 60% of whom have CKDu Award-winning American photographer Ed Kashi first visited Chichigalpa in 2013 on assignment to document the plight of the region’s cane cutters. He was unprepared for the reality he found: “A funeral, literally every day, for a sugar cane worker who had died of this kidney disease.” He has since returned to Nicaragua and neighbouring El Salvador, as well as India and Sri Lanka, to cover the epidemic and scientists’ responses to it. Unlike chronic kidney disease, which is mostly seen among elderly people in urban areas, chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKDu) is believed to kill roughly 40,000 people a year, primarily from marginalised agricultural communities living along the equator. Neraldo Jardiel Cantillano Carrero, 30, receives dialysis at home. He was a sugar cane worker for two years Baffled by the ubiquity and intensity of CKDu in Nicaragua, researchers at first questioned whether the deaths could be put down to diet, toxins or dehydration, allowing sugar companies to deny any potential causal link between the disease and working conditions on the plantations. Now the science is underlining a clearer connection between heavy labour in high temperatures and incidence of CKDu. Research has shown that basic workplace improvements, such as regular access to water, rest and shade, can significantly decrease potential kidney injury among labourers. For the 2,500 field workers at Nicaragua’s largest and oldest sugar mill, Ingenio San Antonio (ISA), this is welcome news. Just five years ago, ISA was among a number of mills donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to research non-work related causes of CKD. Today ISA is at the very heart of an occupational health initiative that has the potential to substantially mitigate, if not eradicate, kidney disease among its sugar labourers. Sugar cane workers fill their water jugs and board buses at the start of their shifts The focus of the “Adelante” initiative is simple: to limit workers’ exposure to heat stress by introducing compulsory measures such as mandated shade, rest, water and electrolyte breaks. Data from the human rights and occupational health organisation La Isla Network, which is working with ISA to implement these interventions, found that an enhanced rest schedule and improved access to hydration and shade reduced kidney injury among labourers by 70%. The data also found that the labourers’ workload hugely matters: those with heavier loads were 12 times more likely to contract renal damage during harvest than those with a lighter load. Sugar cane workers in protective clothing arrive at the fields As the global climate heats up, the potential for damage to human health increases. Research has shown that extreme heat stress can lead to fatal heart attacks and other cardiovascular fatalities, as seen by the deaths of hundreds of migrant workers every year in Qatar. In Nicaragua, while other factors such as metals, pesticides or toxins may still contribute to CKDu, “the most affected workers are those that work in very hot climates and at the same time have an enormous physical workload,” says Dr Catharina Wesseling, an epidemiologist based at the Karolinska Institute of Sweden. Sugar cane workers have their temperatures taken; bottom left, a worker has a heart rate monitor fitted and, bottom right, a temperature gauge sits in a sugar cane field “You can see sugar cane workers as a sentinel population. They are working in the hottest climates and conditions possible and at the same time their energy expenditure is comparable to half marathon runners … or to [those engaged] in military operations, only they do [this work] every day,” says Wesseling. “So the combination of those two factors causes an excessive exposure to external and internal heat, and that causes dehydration and alterations of the whole renal system, and leads, in the end, to chronic kidney disease.” Workers cutting in burned fields wear dust monitors on their chests The men working on ISA’s plantations used to chop as many as 7 tonnes of cane each day for seven days a week, labouring up to 14-hours a day in 38C (100.4F) heat with few, if any, breaks. Now they are working just six hours a day for six days a week, taking rest periods of between 10 and 30 minutes every hour after work begins at 6am. Labourers have also been given special wicking shirts and PPE to keep them cool and protect them from injury. “Many mills and many companies will tell you today they have some sort of ‘water and shade programme’. But having [just any] ‘intervention’ does not mean you have a sufficient intervention,” says La Isla Network’s co-founder Jason Glaser, who is leading the initiative. Workers take a rest break under the shelter of a tent “It’s no different than if you had high blood pressure and you were only taking half of your medication. If you don’t have adequate timing of rest, shade, water or electrolytes, you will not keep your core temperature down, and you will still get kidney damage.” Although CKDu was first documented among sugar cane workers in Costa Rica in the 1970s, it is likely that the “mysterious” epidemic has affected plantation labourers ever since sugar cane was first farmed in the Caribbean in the 1600s. “If you look at the death records [of slaves forced to work on sugar plantations], their mortality was much higher, much younger than if you compare them with those of slaves in other forms of forced labour,” says Glaser. Workers on ISA plantations are now provided with PPE to prevent injury as well as special wicking shirts to keep them cool “There are other stories from the 1930s of men in Nicaragua dying before their 40s of ‘exhaustion’. In India, in plantations where they only cut two tonnes of sugar cane per day, we don’t see CKDu reported; but if you compare it to the lowlands of Mesoamerica, where they cut six tonnes per day in the high heat, you do. “In every place you look that has this algorithm [of high heat combined with heavy labour] – like brickmaking, construction or mining, in Central America, south-east Asia or India or Sri Lanka – you will see it.” In Nicaragua, where sugar accounts for 4% of GDP, CKDu is officially recognised as an occupational-related illness. But to qualify for benefits and specialist healthcare – which involves haemodialysis – patients must prove they worked for 250 weeks and became sick while working. The problem is that many labourers get sick within just two or three harvests, says Glaser, leaving them without access to treatment. The people of ‘La Isla de Viudas’ meet to raise money for their community-built and maintained water system, which provides clean water to 1,500 people Currently, there are no mandated, industry-wide occupational health protections for sugar cane workers. Bonsucro – the global sugar cane platform that maintains the most widely used standards for social and environmental sustainability in the industry, and which is also a founding member of the Adelante initiative – says it is a standard for all Bonsucro members (there are 135 mills in 19 countries) that field workers have access to “sufficient drinking water”. Yet what is deemed “sufficient” and what else might be “consider[ed] occupational risk such as heat stress and long working hours” must be determined by the mills themselves, says Bonsucro’s Latin America director Miguel Hernández. Over time, it may become a requirement that workers follow a specific rest schedule, dependent on the initiative’s findings, he added. The Adelante research is being logged into a database and shared with other mills and will eventually be rolled out to other countries such as Mexico and Costa Rica, say Hernández and Glaser. There is then potential that the findings could be used to improve working conditions in entirely different sectors, says Glaser, such as construction, mining and brickmaking. Maritza Zapata Gonzalez at her son Walter’s grave at Guadalupe cemetery. He died of CKDu a month ago. Maritza also lost her husband to CKDu For communities at the heart of this epidemic, the initiative has already made a profound impact. Chichigalpa native William Martinez, who lost various uncles, cousins, friends and his father to CKDu, has watched the disease “end the dreams of entire families”. Thanks to improved working conditions at ISA, medical interventions such as dialysis and field research allowing better insight into what might cause CKDu, plantation workers are now encouraging their children to go to school rather than replace them in the fields. “The psychological damage of knowing that someone in your family is sick is also decreasing,” says Martinez. “And that is an extremely important outcome.”"

          "headline": "Private schools record biggest rise in top A-level grades in England",
          "bodyText": "Private schools in England recorded the biggest increase in top A-level grades this summer, despite a government U-turn intended to make results fairer, official statistics have shown. Following the cancellation of exams due to the Covid pandemic, there was outcry when standardised grades given to A-level students on results day left pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds hit hardest. Private schools, meanwhile, increased the proportion of students achieving the top grades of A* and A twice as much as pupils at comprehensives, official data showed at the time. Days later the government, alarmed by growing discontent, decided to abandon the algorithm used by the exams regulator, Ofqual, to standardise A-level and GCSE grades, in favour of school-based assessments, also known as centre-assessed grades, or Cags. The switch resulted in a hike in results across the board for both A-levels and GCSEs, compared with previous years. However, government analysis published on Thursday showed that while all school types gained from the move to school-assessed grades, private schools gained the most – with A*s up 11 percentage points on the previous year. By comparison, state schools recorded an increase of six percentage points, while there was a four percentage point increase among students at further education and sixth-form colleges. A total of 60.9% of grades issued to pupils in independent schools were an A* or an A, up 16.6 percentage points on last year’s figure of 44.3%. In state schools the proportion of top grades increased by 12.7 percentage points, up from 23% in 2019 to 35.7% this year, and the average point score per A-level entry was 39.51, up from 33.77 last year. The data revealed female students fared better than their male counterparts, with more women awarded either A or A* in 2020. While all students were more likely to get top grades, increases were larger for women, reversing a small gender gap in achievement seen previously. New research by Ofqual concluded there was no evidence that either the calculated grades or the final grades awarded this summer were systematically biased against candidates with protected characteristics or from disadvantaged backgrounds, which was a major concern when exams were cancelled. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools and teachers in the independent and state sectors had done their best under extremely difficult circumstances to provide accurate grades. “It was never going to be perfect, and there was always bound to be some variability between centres.”"

          "bodyText": "We’ll leave it there for now. Here are the main events from today. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, voted in parliament while waiting for a Covid test result, it was revealed. Victoria handed down a big-spending state budget in a bid to kick-start the Covid-ravaged economy The SA pizza store worker blamed for the state’s outbreak says he’s ‘deeply sorry’. Queensland promised to open its borders to NSW on 1 December. NSW and Victoria recorded no new infections, with Victoria no longer holding any active cases. Malcolm Turnbull says Scott Morrison was “dazzled and duchessed” and went “full-in” with Donald Trump on foreign affairs and climate change, but now needs to change direction to avoid Australia being seen as a “Trump-lite refuge in the southern hemisphere”. Environment editor Adam Morton has the story. A timeline for your perusal. The Victorian state budget released today has given another insight into the prison system, with a key target on reducing the rate of offenders who return to jail not being met. Bail reforms introduced after the 2017 Bourke Street massacre are considered the catalyst for a significant increase in the Victorian prison population, although the budget noted that the government had expected a larger increase in the population were it not for Covid-19. But 44% of prisoners in Victoria were back behind bars within two years, an increase on last year’s rate and a failure to meet a target of 41%, the budget shows. “The 2019-20 outcome is higher than the 2019-20 target primarily due to an increase in prisoners returning to custody with shorter sentences and more prisoners returning to prison on remand within two years and subsequently receiving a sentence,” the budget states. The rate of return to corrective services within two years of discharge from a community corrections order, 17%, also failed to meet the government target and was higher than last year. The budget confirmed that the state government would report on the average daily number of Aboriginal children and young people (aged 10-17 years) in custody for the first time, with a target set of 16-20. The state detains Aboriginal youths at a rate about 10 times higher than non-Aboriginal youths. The state is exploring several changes to the justice system as a result of the pandemic, but no significant announcements regarding prisons were included in the budget. Gladys Berejiklian has been quite strident in her message to NSW citizens about following health authorities’ Covid-19 self-isolation guidelines. It’s all here in this 1.30 video. Guardian Australia has also confirmed the news that the NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, voted in parliament while waiting for a Covid-19 test result. Earlier today, the premier had told ABC News: I didn’t have any symptoms, no scratchy throat, [none] of the symptoms listed on the NSW Health website, but in an abundance of caution I had the test done that afternoon and was told I’d have a result within 90 minutes to two hours. I didn’t change my schedule, perhaps I should have. But the facts were an ordinary person probably wouldn’t have needed the test at all. Perhaps in hindsight I should have closed my door and not seen anybody for that 90 minutes to two hours, but I didn’t ... I accept that in hindsight I should have kept my door shut. Spurrier says: The important thing for everybody to know in South Australia is that everybody that needs to be in quarantine is in quarantine. So my role here is to protect the South Australian public, but my additional role is to make sure that the medi-hotel system is as good as it needs to be. The SA chief health officer, Prof Nicola Spurrier, is speaking to the media, following the news that two cases became infected while in isolation in a medi-hotel. Spurrier says there will be additional testing for staff and guests at the Peppers medi-hotel. She is being questioned about whether the guests caught the virus from a security guard or a cleaner, but she is declining to say. The removal of Indigenous children from their mothers is a “Catch-22” for women who come forward as domestic violence victims, an inquiry has heard. Thelma Schwartz of the Queensland Indigenous Family Violence Legal Service has told a disability royal commission hearing that in 2015 when she began in her role, failure to protect children from exposure to domestic and family violence was grounds for removal. A history of contact with the child protection system was also cited as a reason for child removal, Schwartz told the hearing in Brisbane on Tuesday, reports AAP. You can see that by coming forward and making the disclosure that you’ve been a victim, which is all of this advertising and the whole genesis of the Not Now, Not Ever report, this is now used as a Catch-22 for this mother and used against her to remove her kid. While language has become “more sophisticated” since a change in legislation in 2017, Schwartz said this pattern continues to be the case. It still comes down to exposure to domestic and family violence (and if) you were a child yourself who has been through the child protection system. Schwartz said typical ways of operating were “completely inadequate” in dealing with the over-representation of Indigenous people in criminal justice, juvenile detention and child protection systems. The opposition leader’s response. This is quite a development. Doha airport officers who ordered forced internal medical exams of female passengers after an abandoned newborn was discovered in a rubbish bin face possible three-year prison sentences. The physical examinations of Qatar Airways passengers bound for Sydney and nine other destinations triggered outrage in Australia. AAP reports Qatari prosecutors said an investigation had found some security officers “acted unilaterally by summoning female medical staff to conduct external examination to some female passengers, thinking that what they had done was within the law”. A spokesman for Australia’s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told AAP on Tuesday a progress report had been received in relation to the Qatari investigations. “The Australian government acknowledges the information provided by Qatar, and the finding of the public prosecutor that the boundaries of legal authority were exceeded,” the spokesman said. “Further details in relation to criminal charges are a matter for Qatari investigation agencies.” DFAT said the government expected a “just and proportionate accountability for those responsible”. “The Australian government has made clear to the government of Qatar that the treatment of the female airline passengers, and the examinations to which they were subjected, were grossly inappropriate and offensive.” It is expected the Qatar government will provide a further report on the incident and the measures taken to ensure it is never repeated. The abandoned newborn’s mother faces up to 15 years in prison if apprehended. The woman apparently flew out of the country before the baby was discovered. Prosecutors said DNA helped them identify her and the baby’s father. The Spanish national at the centre of a South Australian police investigation into his failure to disclose to contact tracers he worked shifts at the Woodville Pizza Bar has expressed his remorse for the lockdown in the state, and concern over the release of his personal information into the public domain. The solicitor acting for the 36-year-old man released a statement on Tuesday that he is “extremely remorseful and deeply sorry for any part his conduct played in any unnecessary lockdown actions. He did not foresee or intend that things might unfold as they have. South Australia’s six-day lockdown ended three days early after it was determined the man had worked shifts alongside a security guard at the Woodville Pizza Bar when he contracted Covid-19 and had not just caught it from a pizza box, meaning the spread of the virus was much less than authorities had feared. Guardian Australia reported on Monday the man has limited access to information due to being in quarantine and police seizing his devices as part of the investigation, but Scott Jelbert, principal at Camena, said in the statement today that some of the information being alleged about his client’s actions is “not fair, accurate or complete notwithstanding the state government’s comments”. And the man “is concerned he has been all but publicly named”. State authorities have released the man’s age, visa status, and nationality. “He is sincerely concerned about the impact of the lockdown on South Australians,” Jelbert said. “My client has not been charged with any breach of the law but in the circumstances, including that such charges may emerge, no further comment about those matters is appropriate at this time.” My colleague Daniel Hurst reports that Mathias Cormann’s bid to lead the OECD is facing domestic opposition. The Greens are now lobbying OECD nations to reject Cormann’s candidacy. Two more cases have been added to South Australia’s concerning coronavirus cluster, but officials say both people are already in hotel quarantine. The cases were found in two people considered close contacts who recently returned to Australia and were thought to have contracted the virus overseas. Their infections were revealed on Sunday and Tuesday. But SA Health says further genetic testing has now revealed the pair became infected while in isolation in a hotel previously linked to Adelaide’s Parafield cluster, AAP reports. Their cases take the size of the cluster to 29 but leave the total number of coronavirus cases diagnosed in SA at 557. “There is no additional risk to the public as the cases are linked to a medi-hotel staff member who has previously tested positive for Covid-19 and contact tracing has already been undertaken,” SA Health said in a statement. “As a precaution, we are undertaking additional testing at one of our medi-hotels for all staff and guests today.” A final update on the markets from AAP: Enthusiastic investors have helped the Australian share market close more than 1% higher after promising test results for coronavirus vaccines. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed up 82.5 points, or 1.26%, to 6,644.1 on Tuesday. The index remains at levels last reached in late February, before investors became nervous about the coronavirus. The All Ordinaries closed higher by 83.5 points, or 1.23%, to 6,855.5. All sectors were stronger. Energy was the standout sector, up by 3.48%. AstraZeneca became the latest major drugmaker to say its vaccine could be about 90% effective. Oxford University has reported a similar level of success. The Aussie dollar was buying 73.14 US cents at 1620 AEDT, higher from 73.13 US cents at Monday’s close. Tony Burke, Labor’s IR spokesman, is being interview on the ABC. He tells Patricia Karvelas news that five delivery riders have died on the roads in five months is “chilling”. When you think that the responsibility for their safety is being governed not by an employer but by algorithm, that’s why they’re working. How quickly they are expected to work, it is being governed by an algorithm. The government’s view has been, well, they’re not employees. If someone wants to work and the app they’re using is the pathway for the work, it is hard to see that they are somehow a proud independent contractor responsible for their own insurance and they’re expected to be up and running as though they’re a small business ... It’s not safe work. There is a customer demand. This industry will exist. It’s not safe and it needs to be. It’s not secure work and it needs to be. And we can’t have a situation where for the sake of convenience, we put up with there being a section of Australia’s workforce that effectively has no rights. Further to those comments from the RBA, my colleague Amy Remeikis has filed this story, which you should check out: The Reserve Bank says the lower Australian dollar, helped by its decision to enter into a $100bn bond-buying program, is supporting jobs. The RBA deputy governor, Guy Debelle, says the impact of the exchange rate coming down boosts domestic demand and puts people in jobs, AAP reports. “The biggest way of effecting economic outcomes is whether people have jobs or not, which I think is sometimes lost in this discussion,” Debelle told a webinar conference on Tuesday, explaining the Reserve Bank’s monetary policy actions this year. The bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing or QE, was announced earlier this month and came alongside a cut in the cash rate and other key rates to a record low 0.1% from 0.25%. Between mid-September and the November central bank board meeting, speculation of a move to QE saw the exchange rate depreciate by about 5%. “We’ve seen the exchange rate come down by a noticeable amount and enough to have an impact on the economy and have an impact on employment and people’s livelihoods,” he told the Australian Business Economists conference. More broadly, Debelle says the central bank’s stimulus measures, complementing the significant packages introduced by governments, have boosted the cashflow of households and business. “The lower borrowing rates will encourage businesses and households to borrow, invest and spend when they are confident about their future prospects,” he said. Jane Hume, the superannuation minister, is responding to former prime minister Paul Keating’s claim that the government timed the Retirement Incomes Review to coincide with the Brereton report. Hume says: I saw Prime Minister Keating’s interview last night and to be honest I thought it was full of conspiracy theories and that was only one of them. The Business Council of Australia is mostly pleased with the Victorian government’s budget. Though there is a note of caution on any “further burden on business, likely a reference to plans for a pilot to provide casuals and insecure workers with sick leave. Jennifer Westacott, the chief executive, says: The government’s focus on jobs will be welcome news to thousands of Victorians working fewer hours or not at all in the wake of severe restrictions over the past few months. Investments in infrastructure and social housing are good first steps towards supporting the critical construction sector and driving the economic activity that will create new jobs. These projects can help create jobs immediately and help position the state for the future. New spending to develop innovative models for apprenticeships and trainees as well as short-course micro-credentials could help displaced workers re-train and re-skill quickly for new industries and opportunities. We also welcome the government’s commitment to a wage subsidy, particularly targeting those hardest hit by restrictions and most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment. It is also good to see that Victoria has joined other jurisdictions with reforms to modernise road user charges to keep the system fair. Further to Andrew Hastie’s comments on the Brereton report, which we reported earlier, the WA Liberal MP has been on the ABC expanding on his call for greater parliamentary oversight of the military. He tells Andrew Probyn: Defence is a huge organisation. In order for parliament to exercise proper civilian oversight of the military you have to have a baseline understanding of the capabilities, the methods and the operations of the ADF. If we can’t talk about those things in public, we can’t talk about them at all. So we need to talk about them in a classified space and right now there is no such mechanism in the parliament to increase parliamentarians’ understanding of defence and therefore enable parliament to hold it to account. We didn’t have any significant debate about strategy inAfghanistan while we were there. We didn’t have that at all and that’s a problem. So we can’t ventilate everything in public. We can’t spill all our secrets into the open, but we can do so as my committee does, the intelligence committee does, behind closed doors in a protected classified space. That is what I am arguing for, a defence committee that can have those conversations with defence in a protected classified space governed by secrecy provisions. Scott Morrison and the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, swapped notes on Covid-19 situations in their two countries during a phone call this afternoon. A readout issued by Morrison’s office says the pair also discussed progress on vaccine trials and they “were encouraged by the more positive trajectory of their economies in the third quarter”. Widodo – who is due to host Morrison at an annual leaders’ meeting next year – described the Indonesia-Australia relationship as important for regional stability and prosperity. The two countries would look to increase cooperation including in the south-west Pacific, according to Morrison’s readout. The phone call follows a range of multilateral events over the past couple of weeks, including the East Asia Summit and Apec. Morrison’s office said the pair “agreed that these multilateral meetings had made useful contributions to regional security and prosperity” and they backed the newly finalised Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership – which includes China – as important for the region’s economic recovery. They also reportedly said they looked forward to more countries joining the rebadged Trans-Pacific Partnership in future. The Victorian Liberal opposition has responded to the state budget. The opposition leader, Michael O’Brien, said: Labor’s budget has run up the white flag on jobs with Victoria’s unemployment to remain higher than the national average for each of the next four years. One in five Victorians currently are out of work or underemployed. Despite the big taxing, big borrowing and big spending budget, our jobs crisis is set to continue. We need to revive our economy. Small business is the jobs engine of Victoria but it has been left out in the cold by Labor’s budget. True to form, Daniel Andrews’ arrogance has got the better of him by covering up project cost and timeline blowouts by simply deleting them from the budget papers. Daniel Andrews thinks he can throw other people’s money around to make up for the devastation caused by his second wave lockdowns. Victorians need jobs today, small businesses need the burden of taxes and charges to be lifted, but neither have been delivered in this budget. The former special air service troop commander and federal Liberal MP Andrew Hastie is calling for greater parliamentary and media oversight of the Australian military. Hastie has voiced personal grief and shame over alleged war crimes committed by Australian soldiers he served with in Afghanistan. The member for Canning in Western Australia wants greater media access to military operations overseas, reports AAP. We stage-managed Australia’s contribution to the Afghanistan war through a carefully crafted information operation. Perhaps with greater access for the Australian media, some of the events alleged by the Brereton report might never have happened. Hastie, who chairs a parliamentary committee on intelligence and security, wants to create a committee with powers to compel defence chiefs and bureaucrats. If we are serious about increased accountability and transparency, then we need proper parliamentary scrutiny of the Department of Defence and the Australian defence force Without it, our parliament cannot exercise proper civilian oversight of our military. The NSW opposition leader, Jodi McKay, says the premier’s explanation for failing to self-isolate after getting a Covid-19 test is unacceptable. She said Gladys Berejiklian must publicly clarify when she had the test and when she received her results. Berejiklian was present for the treasurer’s budget speech at noon last Tuesday as well as question time from 2.15pm, and again when a division was called at 5.40pm, reports AAP. McKay says: Did she have the results before that division or did she walk into that parliament, with 90-plus MPs, not knowing the result of that test. The opposition’s health spokesman, Ryan Park, said earlier that it was clear the premier “had a scratchy throat, which we all know is a symptom of Covid-19”. McKay added: She has tried to worm her way out of it but it’s black and white: the premier should have self isolated. The premier shouldn’t even have gone to work that morning. While the Victorian government has received widespread praise for its pledge to build 12,000 social and affordable homes, there have been still some criticism from public housing advocates. A key concern is that the homes will be managed by community housing providers, rather than public housing. In response to the budget, the Victorian Public Tenants Association says: We now understand that the new social housing dwellings to be delivered as a result of the big housing build will be managed by privately owned community housing providers and association. This is deeply disappointing given the essential safety net that public housing has provided to Victorians for generations. Currently each community housing provider has separate policies for key issues such as rent setting, and the sector has discretion to allocate properties more selectively than public housing allocations – which must always be based on urgency of need. Although 12,300 new properties is a historic commitment, the extent of Victoria’s social housing challenge means that this must be just the start. The association noted that a regulatory review of community housing had been announced. We intend to do our utmost to provide every assistance to that review panel, to ensure that all people on the waitlist have a fair opportunity to be allocated housing, and that rents for future social housing tenants remain genuinely affordable. The renowned political correspondent and columnist Alan Ramsey has died, aged 82. Ramsey is most remembered for his insightful and acerbic weekly columns in the Sydney Morning Herald, reports AAP. His journalistic career started in 1953 and spanned more than half a century. He served as a foreign correspondent for Australian Associated Press in Port Moresby and London before accompanying Australian troops to Vietnam in 1965. His fearless reporting on the war was widely respected and rankled military leaders. Ramsey joined the Canberra press gallery the following year and famously shouted “You liar!” at prime minister John Gorton during a parliamentary debate in 1971. He was deputy editor of the Australian for several years before joining the Sydney Morning Herald, where he spent his final 22 years in journalism before retiring in 2008. Ramsey was admitted to Australian media’s hall of fame in 2017. Tributes have poured in from people in politics and the media. “Vale Alan Ramsey. Uncompromising, formidable, informed, insightful. Always a match for the politicians – and they knew it,” Canberra political correspondent Michelle Grattan said. Broadcaster Phillip Adams described Ramsey as “journalism’s grumpiest old bugger”. The WA Liberals’ new leader, Zak Kirkup, is addressing the media – and making his opening pitch to voters ahead of the March election. This government has done a good job in shutting down our borders and responding to the virus. But all of us know that there is no plan going forward. We all know that there are very strong economic headwinds ahead of us that deserve a plan to make sure that all Western Australians’ confidence in a new Liberal government, to make sure they are gonna be looked after in the future and in the long term. Our priority is to keep Western Australians safe, to be smarter today for a better and a brighter tomorrow. And here’s that business card I mentioned earlier. Labor frontbencher Bill Shorten has backed Qantas’s move to require international travellers to provide proof they have received a Covid-19 vaccine. Shorten told reporters: Maribyrnong is an aviation electorate. Thousands of people in this electorate earn their living through the aviation industry. Alan Joyce is on the money. We should make sure that people have the vaccine before they go overseas. You know Qantas is $2bn down courtesy of Covid-19. Thousands of jobs have been lost; small businesses have been smashed. And of course, most tragically, hundreds of people have died. So simple message is: you don’t have to travel overseas; if you don’t want to have the vaccine, then don’t worry about going overseas. But we’re not going to go into another third wave merely because some people have some cranky views about being anti-vaxxer. So a very simple message to some of the anti-vaxxer brigade: it’s not compulsory to go overseas. No vaccine, no air ticket. Shorten chimed in a bit later asked Labor’s health spokesman Chris Bowen, whose position on the matter was more muted. Bowen said: Well, the vaccine won’t be mandatory as a matter of law. That’s now a bipartisan position. The prime minister did sort of toy with making the vaccine mandatory, but he dropped that decision. That’s the case in relation to the law and government policy. I completely understand where Qantas is coming from – they want to ensure the safety of their passengers. We want to see international travel as soon as it’s safe to do so and the vaccine will be an important part of that and I think Qantas deserves the bipartisan support of all involved in the efforts they take to ensure the health and safety of their passengers and, importantly, their staff. The former Labor leader and former shadow treasurer were together in Melbourne today. Campaigners have welcomed the Victorian government’s “nation-leading” pledge to offer extended care arrangements to every young person in the state on an ongoing basis. The $64.7m initiative, announced in the state budget, will provide an accommodation allowance to every young Victorian in out-of-home care until the age of 21. The Home Stretch campaign said it meant a young person could remain living with their kinship or foster carer if they wished, or moved to supported independent living arrangements. Support currently ends for most young people once they turn 18. The Home Stretch chairman, Paul McDonald, said: This announcement will transform the lives of vulnerable young people for the better, giving them options they would not have if their support had been terminated at 18 – as it is for the majority of young people across the country. This is a significant development. Alan Joyce, the chief executive of Qantas, says once a Covid-19 vaccine is a readily available, proof international travellers have received the jab will be a non-negotiable condition of flight. Matilda Boseley has the details. My colleague Calla Wahlquist has filed this report from the Victorian budget lock up. AAP has this market update. Investors have been pushing prices higher on the Australian stock market after more enthusiasm about possible coronavirus vaccines and Queensland officials relaxing border restrictions. The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index was up 77.5 points, or 1.18%, to 6639.1 at 1200 AEDT on Tuesday. The All Ordinaries gained 78.7 points, or 1.16%, to 6850.7. All sectors were higher, although energy was the only one with gains of more than 2%. It rose 2.77%. The WA Liberal party looks certain to have a new leader: first time MP Zak Kirkup. Kirkup, 33, is in the box seat to replace Liza Harvey as opposition leader. Harvey quit two days ago, four months ahead of the March election, amid poor polling. Kirkup’s likely ascent comes after his main rival, Dean Nalder, withdrew his candidacy, reports AAP. Kirkup is the Liberals’ health spokesman and will take the reins barring a last-minute challenge. He said on Monday: I think anyone should judge a person by their actions and not by their age. I’ve made it clear that there’s a real opportunity here for some hard work and energy to go into the team of the new possible Liberal leader. The Liberals have only 13 of the 59 seats in the parliament, and face an uphill battle at the March poll, given premier Mark McGowan’s record approval ratings. Kirkup holds his own seat, south of Perth, by a margin of just 0.7%, making it the tightest contest in the state. He joined the Liberal party as a teenager and has long been considered a future leader. As a child, he is said to have handed a business card to the then-prime minister, John Howard, in which he called himself a “future PM”. Some reaction to the Victorian budget. The Greens welcomed the massive boost to social housing and the investment in renewable energy through the plan for a big battery. Both were initially floated by the Greens, they said. They were disappointed with the lack of “broader tax reform”, such as changes to stamp duty. Emma King, chief executive of the Victorian Council of Social Service, said the budget would make “real inroads into poverty and disadvantage”. She welcomed massive spending on social housing and mental health, among other initiatives. The Victorian government has also announced a plan to build a contemporary art gallery in Melbourne. Called NGV Contemporary, it would be “the country’s largest gallery dedicated to contemporary art and design”, treasurer Tim Pallas said. Work on the $1.4bn project is expected to begin in 2022. Pallas said it was expected to create 5,000 jobs while being built, and attract 3m visitors a year. A key measure in the Victorian budget is a jobs tax credit to encourage businesses to hire new staff. The $880m scheme will provide businesses with a payroll of $10m or less with a non-refundable credit of 10 cents on every dollar spent on wages above the previous year’s wage bill. Effectively businesses will get 10% back on new wages, which Tim Pallas said would effectively reduce, or in some cases completely remove, their payroll tax bill. The government will also reduce the land transfer duty – stamp duty– on houses worth $1m or less and purchased between now and 30 June 2021. New builds will get a 50% reduction; existing homes a 25% reduction. There’s also a 50% land tax discount for new housing developments intended for renters and a $500m Victorian homebuyer fund, which will see the government contribute to the purchase price of a new home in exchange for a slice of the equity. The Victorian government has forecast a record deficit of $23.3bn and a massive increase to net debt to cover the cost of a jobs and infrastructure program to help the state recover from Covid-19. Gross state product is forecast to decline by 4% this financial year, in what the treasurer Tim Pallas told parliament was the biggest economic impact to the state in nearly a century. Pallas is delivering his budget speech in the parliament now, and said “now is not the time to deliver a budget in surplus”. Net debt is forecast to increase to $154.8bn in 2023-24, or 28.9% of GSP, forcing the Andrews government to abandon a 2018 commitment to keep net debt below 12% of GDP. “We are putting our credit rating to work when it’s needed most – to help Victorians now and into the future,” Pallas said. “We are borrowing to make the necessary investments to drive a quicker and stronger recovery.” He said the budget hinges on a jobs plan which aims to create 200,000 jobs by the end of 2022 and 400,000 by 2024. Some 125,000 new jobs are supported in spending that is either announced in or ongoing in this year’s budget, he said. Thanks Elias. Luke Henriques-Gomes here. I’ll be with you into the evening. First up, we’ll have some updates from Calla Wahlquist, who has been in the Victorian budget lock up. I’ll be passing the blog over to my colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes who will take you through the afternoon and news from the Victorian budget. Have a great afternoon, and now, over to you Luke. The inspector general of intelligence and security, Jake Blight, has revealed Australia’s spy agencies collected data in the Covidsafe contact tracing app in the past seven months. In his first report on the use of the data, Blight found Australia’s spy agencies had policies in place to ensure Covidsafe app data was not intentionally collected, but there had been “incidental collection in the course of lawful collection of other data” and that was permitted under the Privacy Act. The data was not decrypted, accessed, or used by any agency. Blight said Igis would have inspections in the next few months to ensure the data had been deleted, and none had been accessed. The legislation brought in to secure the Covidsafe app means only the system administrator or health officials needing to access the data for contact tracing have access to its data. Health officials in Victoria yesterday told a parliamentary inquiry that they had to stop using some of the data from the app at the peak of the second wave because it was unclear whether under the legislation health officials from other states who were helping Victoria with contact tracing were allowed to use the data. But it was only for a short period and as has been previously reported Victoria has not been able to identify any close contacts through data in the app that were not already identified through manual contact tracing, despite downloading data from more than 1,800 people’s devices. You shouldn’t be surprised to learn that Pauline Hanson – she of the “I didn’t flip-flop, I said no originally, then I said yes. Then I have said no, and I’ve stuck to it” fame – is attempting to cover off all sides of the superannuation debate. The One Nation leader supports a 0.5% increase to the super compulsory rate, but only if people don’t cash it all out and spend it on Landcruisers and caravans. If they do, then she wants the whole super scheme clarified. And if it turns out you can cash it out, then maybe a wage increase would be better. “While the money belongs to the employee, it wasn’t designed to be cashed out as a lump sum and blown, only to leave a person on a government pension for the rest of their lives,” she said. “People should not be encouraged to squander their superannuation. It defeats the purpose of the scheme. “If we don’t reclarify the purpose of superannuation now, we might as well just give these increases to people through their pay packets.” Everyone clear? Yup. It’s a bet both ways. Which is standard for One Nation. Sir Michael Fallon, a former British defence secretary, asked Scott Morrison how it would be possible to persuade China that it would be in its own interests to abide by the Law of the Sea Convention and independent rulings on its South China Sea claims. Morrison said this was “the $64,000 question, really”. It was very difficult to “understand the mind of China and their outlook, but it is our task to seek to do so”. Of course, there are tensions. I won’t deny that. But I do feel that many of the tensions are based on some misunderstandings. And I think one of the key misunderstandings is a level of confidence about what we see is the end result. Our end result from Australia’s point of view as I said, is not containment. Our end result is happy coexistence, respecting each other’s sovereignty and systems and being able to happily coexist in a mutually beneficial relationship. And I believe that’s where both parties of this relationship have a lot more work to do to get to that shared understanding of what we see the ultimate goal as being. Morrison suggested the incoming Biden administration may have an impact on the Washington/Beijing ties: “Perhaps the atmospherics of that relationship will change following the most recent election.” Scott Morrison says his government will remain “patient” and “consistent” as it seeks to navigate the current tensions with China. The Q&amp;A portion of the prime minister’s virtual appearance at a British thinktank event last night has arrived in journalists’ inboxes. As reported by Katharine Murphy overnight, Morrison called on major powers such as the US and China to try not to force their allies and partners into binary choices, as middle powers like Australia needed some more latitude or “room to move”. Morrison took a few questions after his Policy Exchange speech, including from Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the UK House of Commons foreign affairs select committee, who asked about how Morrison saw the UK’s role in working with Australia, Japan, India and others in defending the international order. Morrison claimed Australia’s policies when it comes to the rules-based order and the Indo-Pacific “are no different today than they were in John Howard’s time” – although he suggested there were “some things that have changed, of course, to our north”. Alluding to this year’s trade actions by China, Morrison said all countries should take seriously their obligations to comply with the letter and the spirit of World Trade Organization rules “because that’s what makes it all hang together”. “We’ve just got to be patient about this, and we just need to be consistent in holding to these positions and pursuing them in a way that seeks to get to where we all want to be at the end of the day.” The aim was to ensure countries in the Indo-Pacific could freely trade and enjoy economic growth and prosperity. China’s advance was “good” and it was not the objective of Australia or other regional players to contain China economically. It was important to be as clear in delivering that message as possible, including in partnership with like-minded countries like the UK. Health minister Greg Hunt spoke in between those press conferences from Queensland and South Australia and announced there are no Australians requiring ventilation for Covid-19. Hunt was speaking at ResMed, a ventilator manufacturer in Sydney, which had been working to boost Australia’s supply since concerns at the beginning of the pandemic there would not be enough ventilators for Australians. Hunt was also asked about vaccines, and revealed all is on track for the first cohort of Australians to begin receiving a vaccine by March next year. South Australian chief health officer Nicola Spurrier has said she hasn’t “popped the cork on the champagne bottle yet but the champagne is on ice” as the state announced one new Covid-19 case on Tuesday. Spurrier said the case is a close contact of a returned traveller who previously tested positive. It is a man in his 20s who is in a quarantine hotel, but it is unclear if he is a returned traveller or if this was locally acquired. Guardian Australia contacted SA Health to clarify this, but it was unable to provide more information. Spurrier said there are 27 cases linked to the Parafield cluster, and 39 active cases in SA. There is one person in hospital, a woman in her 50s. A 30-year-old man was recently discharged from hospital. Spurrier also said there are 4,100 close contacts, or contacts of close contacts, linked to the Parafield cluster who are quarantining. There were 6,822 Covid-19 tests taken in SA on Monday. “I haven’t popped the cork on the champagne bottle yet but the champagne is on ice. We haven’t finished the job yet and every South Australian still has their part to play,” Spurrier said. She also urged South Australians to begin wearing masks, even as restrictions eased. The South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, says authorities remain focused on lifting restrictions in the state by next Tuesday 1 December. I said yesterday what a difference a week makes. South Australia is continuing to rise to the challenge of this particular cluster and I believe that we are now in a very good position to stare down this second wave. This could have been a potentially catastrophic situation in South Australia but the swift and decisive action taken following that unequivocal health advice has put us in a very good position. The transition committee met this morning. They will meet again on Friday. We have our eyes firmly fixed on next Tuesday. We have signalled that, next Tuesday 1 December is the day that we will go back to where we were before the Parafield cluster and further lift those restrictions. We do not want to have any restriction in place for one day than we need to. There have been no new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in NSW in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday. There were six new cases in returned travellers in hotel quarantine. Queensland’s chief health officer, Dr Jeannette Young, also spoke about South Australia’s outbreak and what it would take for Queensland to fully reopen to people from SA. Young: They’ve had a really good, rapid response down there. So they had another case yesterday, which was eight days after that person had been exposed. We just need to wait for a little bit longer before we can decide what needs to happen. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian was “very positive” when she heard Queensland would fully reopen its border, according to Queensland’s premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk. “It is wonderful to be back in communication with the NSW premier,” Palaszczuk said, after weeks of tension between the two. “Now is the time, if you live in NSW, come to Queensland, start planning that holiday. We would love to have your business. It means jobs for Queenslanders. And as you know, Queensland, beautiful one day, perfect the next. Queensland’s deputy premier Steven Miles on the border relaxation: This is indeed a great day for Queensland ... a day I have been looking forward to for a very long time. I know it is a day that many Queenslanders and their family and friends, particularly in Sydney, have been looking forward to. Our tourism and hospitality sectors have struggled while some of our traditional sectors like mining and agriculture have held up throughout the entire pandemic, and this is a chance for particularly our tourism and hospitality sectors to get more people back to work. I know there are lots of Sydneysiders who have been wondering whether they could plan a Christmas holiday on the Gold Coast or Cairns or all of the wonderful places in between or north of there. Now we know that they can, and that means when they come here they will be spending money here, creating jobs here, helping businesses here, to get more people back to work. Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is speaking after meeting health authorities this morning, and says chief health officer Jeannette Young is satisfied NSW is safe. Palaszczuk: Dr Young is now satisfied that they have reached the over-28 days, so can I say to New South Wales: we welcome you to Queensland from 1 December.” She said Victorians will also be welcome to enter Queensland from 1 December, provided they meet the 28-day threshold, which will be achieved if the state record no new cases by tomorrow. Palaszczuk said she had let NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian and Victorian premier Daniel Andrews know. I hope this is welcome news. I think it’s great news in the lead-up to Christmas, but once again, that timely reminder for everybody:we need to make sure that we continue to keep up our social distancing. Michael Kaine, national secretary of the Transport Workers’ Union, is speaking about the death of a food delivery rider in inner Sydney on Monday, the fifth in two months. Kaine said he had previously urged industrial relations minister Christian Porter to set up an urgent inquiry into Uber Eats and gig delivery platforms, and is renewing his calls now. The fifth rider in total to have been killed on our roads in two months. This is carnage. That’s one every 11 days. These companies don’t care whether riders live or die. All they care about is getting food on time delivered. These companies don’t train riders. These companies don’t provide appropriate and proper protective equipment. These companies put these riders under incredible time pressures. They’re to answer a call for a delivery within seconds, and if they’re late by one or two minutes, then those riders can be kicked off the platform, often by an algorithm with absolutely no recourse. These riders have been the heroes of the pandemic. They have worked to deliver food to households and businesses as they’ve been locked down. It’s been an important part of the safety mix that has allowed us to have control over this virus. And they are treated like fodder. They are treated like machines. Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, is set to address media shortly. NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said she hopes to hear an announcement that the state will reopen its border to residents of greater Sydney. On Monday night New South Wales police confirmed that a food delivery cyclist was killed after being hit by a truck on an inner-Sydney street. It was the fifth death of a food delivery worker across Australia in the past two months. My colleague Naaman Zhou has been covering this issue, and has written this report: Sally McManus, the secretary of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, was on ABC News this morning talking about the Adelaide outbreak and insecure work in the pandemic. Guardian Australia’s Josh Taylor reports that the hotel quarantine worker at the centre of a police investigation into his failure to disclose to contact tracers he worked shifts at the Woodville Pizza Bar is unaware of the growing public focus on him as he remains in hotel quarantine. McManus, while acknowledging there was “a piece of the puzzle we don’t know” that police were investigating, said the episode had exposed issues with what quarantine workers are paid: What we do know is that one of the security guards who was working in the hotel was then working in the pizza bar, and then someone else contracted it off them. The big question really there is why was a security guard needing to work a second job in a pizza bar to string together a living wage? Why weren’t they given full-time hours at the hotel? Why weren’t they paid enough so they didn’t have to also work in a pizza bar? I think this is just a really basic thing we’ve gotta get right in all of those hotel quarantine areas. Insecure work is a threat. It will spread the virus if we don’t make sure that people have enough money to live and that they’ve got sick leave. McManus also said the security industry was “rife with labour hire” and that while it might not be possible to fix worker issues across the entire industry immediately, action should start by focusing on guards in the quarantine hotels: The fact that sometimes they don’t have proper qualifications, the fact they’re not giving people their basic rights like sick leave, means they’re less likely to get tested if there’s not automatic tests. It might not be such a big issue across the economy but at least in these hotels we should be plugging all those holes, because that’s the only way we’ll make sure that the virus doesn’t spread, if we are gonna still have people come back to our country. During her earlier interview about failing to self-isolate while waiting for her Covid-19 test result, Gladys Berejiklian again called on Annastacia Palaszczuk to fully reopen Queensland’s border to residents of greater Sydney. The NSW premier said she hoped her Queensland counterpart would announce the decision after she met health authorities today. Berejiklian told ABC News: I’d be absolutely thrilled if that was the case ... We saw yesterday the jubilation of our citizens who came across the border and New South Wales citizens that went to Victoria. The jubilation was heartwarming. The stress release was amazing and I want other people to feel that today and I hope, out of the goodness of their heart because there’s no scientific basis for having that border shut, and the benchmark they’ve set is way too high. And I hope when they open the border they’re determined to keep it open because we are going to get cases, we are going to get community transmission. Anthony Albanese has sought to play down the intensity of concern within his own party that Labor’s position on climate action is alienating mining and blue-collar workers. The federal Labor leader said disquiet about the party’s position “is a debate taking place by some in the media and taking place by some who refuse to acknowledge the reality”. He was speaking after the Queensland senator Murray Watt told a Rockhampton conference on Monday that the ALP “treasures” every job created in the mining sector and sees a future for coal exports. That speech was praised by his colleague Joel Fitzgibbon, who resigned as Labor’s resources spokesman out of concern his party’s position on climate action was too ambitious, after he almost lost his coalmining reliant seat of Hunter at the 2019 election. On Tuesday Albanese told ABC News that Labor’s climate policy was clear: We have a position of having zero net emissions by 2050. We have a very clear policy that sees that renewables are the cheapest form of new energy and that’s what the market is saying as well. This really is a debate taking place by some in the media and taking place by some who refuse to acknowledge the reality, which is the market is speaking and the market is heading towards renewables. It’s a matter of the role of government playing in that transition. Murray Watt’s position was precisely the same thing that I’ve been saying which is, he spoke about climate change being good for job creation. That doesn’t mean that our export industries are about to close. We’ll continue to export our resources. That will continue to provide an income for the country that helps to fund education and health. I say the same thing, as does Murray Watt, whether he’s in Canberra or in Queensland or in Melbourne or anywhere else: the fact is that climate change is real. Albanese also said further progress on the party’s climate action position would be determined at the coming national conference, and plans were being made to hold the two-day event via Zoom before Easter next year: I think it will be a success and will enable us to finalise the platform going forward of the Labor party. We are a democratic party. We’re an inclusive party and that will enable people to contribute. It’s a big day for Victoria, with the Andrews government handing down its budget. Guardian Australia’s Calla Wahlquist will be in the budget media lockup and will be bringing you everything you need to know. Daniel Andrews has spoken about Victoria’s zero active cases, saying he is “pleased” but the battle to contain Covid-19 is “far from over”. The premier said: We are pleased to confirm there are now zero active cases of coronavirus in our state. The one remaining active case has now been cleared of the virus and discharged from hospital. That’s great news for them and their family, and it presents us with an opportunity to yet again thank all of those nurses and doctors, hospital cleaners, ward clerks, ambos – the whole health team – for the amazing work that they’ve done throughout this global pandemic event. This is far from over. Even with this run of zero days, no active cases, very strong testing performance, and people who are just doing the right thing, playing their part, until a vaccine arrives this is something that’s going to be with us for the foreseeable future. After containing Australia’s largest outbreak, there are now no active cases of Covid-19 in Victoria. A Department of Health and Human Services spokeswoman told Guardian Australia on Tuesday morning the last Covid-19 patient was cleared of the virus on Monday. Gladys Berejiklian has acknowledged she breached NSW health requirements by failing to self-isolate while waiting to receive the results of a Covid-19 test she took on the state’s budget day last week. The premier fronted ABC News this morning to address the claims, saying she had no symptoms and only took the test out of an “abundance of caution” last Tuesday afternoon, so that she could reassure people asking why she was losing her voice that she had tested negative to Covid-19. NSW Health rules require anyone who has been tested for coronavirus to self-isolate until a negative result is returned. Berejiklian underwent a rapid test in her office last Tuesday and was present at the treasurer’s budget speech at noon, as well as question time from 2.15pm. This morning she said: I didn’t have any symptoms, no scratchy throat, [none] of the symptoms listed on the NSW Health website, but in an abundance of caution I had the test done that afternoon and was told I’d have a result within 90 minutes to two hours. I didn’t change my schedule, perhaps I should have. But the facts were an ordinary person probably wouldn’t have needed the test at all. Perhaps in hindsight I should have closed my door and not seen anybody for that 90 minutes to two hours, but I didn’t ... I accept that in hindsight I should have kept my door shut. Berejiklian went on to rule out changing the NSW Health requirements to self-isolate while waiting for a test, saying complacency was her “biggest fear”. I still haven’t hugged my parents, that is really hard, since February. I haven’t let anyone touch me, even though people run up to you in the middle of the street, and I’ve put my elbow out which is rude for me but I do that. It’s only because I am so vigorous against fighting against complacency that I took the test because I didn’t have a symptom. I knew my voice would be going and I wanted to say with confidence to people that I’ve had taken the precaution. Good morning, Elias Visontay here to take you through all the day’s news in Australia. Mathias Cormann’s travel around Europe to campaign for the top OECD job may be costing Australian taxpayers as much as $4,300 an hour. The Morrison government is supporting the former finance minister, who quit the Senate this month, in his bid for the job with the use of an RAAF Falcon. A third Covid vaccine candidate has produced up to 90% efficacy results at a fraction of the cost of those previously announced. The vaccine, developed in the UK by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, is also fridge-stable and easy to transport, unlike the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that require ultra cold storage. Another food delivery worker has been killed in Sydney in what is the fifth death among food delivery workers across Australia in the past two months. The movement to find independent challengers to Coalition MPs has spread beyond NSW and Victoria into South Australia, with Voices of Boothby emerging in the marginal Adelaide seat held by Nicolle Flint. Australia’s use of handcuffs to transfer asylum seekers to medical appointments is unlawful, inhumane, traumatising and illegally restricts access to healthcare, particularly for those with a history of mental illness and torture, a landmark new case alleges.

          "headline": "Tories call for inquiry into ‘bad data’ to justify rural housebuilding",
          "bodyText": "Conservative MPs have called for an inquiry into “bad” official population projections that are then used to justify the construction of thousands of homes on open fields. Tory backbenchers in Warwickshire claim that a population projection for Coventry exaggerates growth by up to 60,000 people over the next two decades, resulting in “major incursions into the countryside”, with areas including the Forest of Arden being zoned for housing unnecessarily. They are being backed by the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street, in a complaint to Sir David Norgrove, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, that “bad decisions – to irrevocably destroy historic countryside – are being made on the back of bad data”. Two local Labour MPs have joined the complaint, which is being coordinated by the Warwickshire branch of the CPRE, the countryside charity. The move opens a new front in the backbench rebellion against rural housebuilding and comes amid continued tensions between Tory councillors and MPs and the government over proposed planning changes which could make it easier to build houses in the countryside. Last weekend, the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, was forced into a U-turn on housing targets for some Tory shire heartlands in the south of England under pressure from backbenchers, including the former prime minister Theresa May and the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Jenrick announced an algorithm being used to set targets would be changed to allocate more homes in towns and cities and the north. Midlands MPs are calling for an inquiry into the population projections produced by the Office of National Statistics that they allege overestimate Coventry’s birth rate and underestimate its death rate. They also say it understates international emigration, particularly among students finishing courses. Merle Gering, a member of Warwickshire CPRE who carried out the statistical analysis, said it meant houses were being planned for “ghosts”. Their letter to Norgrove comes on the eve of a decision on a planning application for up to 2,400 homes on land known as Eastern Green to the west of Coventry, which until recently was part of the green belt separating the city from Birmingham. The population projections used to set the targets were produced in 2014. More up-to-date figures from 2018 were made available this summer, but the government is sticking with the earlier numbers to ensure “stability and certainty”, the ONS said. The letter, signed by the Conservative backbenchers Craig Tracey, the MP for North Warwickshire, Jeremy Wright, the MP for Kenilworth and Southam, and Mark Pawsey, the MP for Rugby and Bulkington, said: “The very high figures for Coventry have led that authority and neighbouring Warwickshire authorities to over-allocate land for housing in their local plans. This has resulted in major incursions into the countryside, both in Coventry itself and in those parts of Warwickshire immediately surrounding it. “Large amounts of the historic Forest of Arden – precious for history, biodiversity, landscape, heritage, flood control, recreation and providing the green lungs of a crowded urban area – have been removed from green belt in and around Coventry and allocated to unnecessary housing.” Similar issues have been raised elsewhere. Last year, Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, accused the government of making it impossible to reduce the amount of protected green belt allocated to housing through the use of old population growth figures, which are higher than the most recent projections. A spokesperson for the ONS said: “Projections aren’t predictions or forecasts and simply show the trajectory of the population or number of households based on a set of plausible scenarios of what could happen to births, deaths and migration. Projections are updated every two years to ensure they use the latest data and methods. New versions supersede old versions. “We are continuing to have conversations with residents and academics in Coventry and all of our methods have been explained to be fully transparent and helpful.”"

          "headline": "Is Gavin Williamson the worst education secretary ever?",
          "bodyText": "Since 1900, 44 men and nine women have had charge of English education. They included one duke, two marquesses, two earls, two viscounts and three hereditary baronets. Eight were old Etonians; four were old Harrovians; 10 went to state schools but only two, including Gavin Williamson, the present incumbent, to comprehensives. Only four had ever been schoolteachers; about twice as many were barristers. One (you know who) went on to be prime minister. Until recently, the job – not considered one of the great offices of state – rarely interested politicians of stature. Winston Churchill turned it down in 1905 because it involved “smacking children’s bottoms and blowing their noses”. It was a position mainly for has-beens, never-weres and political climbers who couldn’t wait to move on to something else. Another Tory education minister, Edward Wood (later the 3rd Viscount Halifax), was equally dismissive of education: state schools, he said, should train children up “to be servants and butlers”. Civil servants complained it was hard to discuss anything with him because he spent so much time hunting. Is Williamson worse? Or worse than another Tory predecessor, John Patten (1992-4), who called Birmingham’s then chief education officer, Tim Brighouse, “a nutter” and a “madman”, was sued for libel and had to pay substantial damages? Worse than Sir Keith Joseph (1981-6), who made it all too plain that he didn’t like the idea of state schools and once said “I wish we’d taken a different route in 1870”? Is Williamson worse, indeed, than any of his predecessors? Many think so. “What could have been in the prime minister’s mind,” tweeted Nicholas Soames, Churchill’s grandson and a former Tory minister, “… to appoint so mere, so unreliable, so wholly unsuitable a man?” “He’s fucking useless,” was the crisper verdict of an unnamed vice-chancellor, speaking to the Guardian. And: “Any minister who makes children cry is not in a good place,” said a Tory MP. All were referring to this summer’s A-level grading debacle. With exams cancelled because of Covid, Williamson decided that grades would be decided by a combination of teacher assessments and a mysterious algorithm that would correct for teachers’ over-optimism and generosity. When 40% of assessments were downgraded, some drastically, an outcry ensued, in particular because disadvantaged pupils were most commonly the losers. Williamson insisted there would be “no U-turn”. Two days later, he announced the re-instatement of the original teachers’ assessments, for GCSEs as well as A-levels, pleasing students and teachers but throwing universities, which had already filled many of their places, into crisis. It was A-level grading that also did for a Labour education secretary, Estelle Morris (2001-2), who had been popular and had seemed well qualified for the job. Not only had she taught for 18 years in a comprehensive, she had spent four years in more junior positions at the education department. Alas, she became embroiled in a complicated row over how 2,000 pupils were awarded the wrong grades. On that occasion, the losers were mostly pupils in fee-charging schools and the posher state schools. She resigned, saying she had not been “as effective as I should be” and wasn’t good “at strategic management of a huge department”. So her own account suggests she has a claim to be the worst education minister in history, but it’s probably fairer to say she was just the most self-critical. Either way, Williamson has more than A-level grades to his discredit. When schools closed in March, critics say, he failed to give them clear guidance on how to organise online teaching or cope with pupils whose homes lacked the necessary technology. Having told schools to re-admit some year groups in June while limiting class sizes to ensure social distancing, he failed to explain how they should do it. Now he insists that next year’s exams will go ahead as normal in England, albeit three weeks late (while in Wales they will not). So low is teachers’ trust in his competence and reliability, that nobody is confident they will. Williamson can plead that only one of his predecessors had anything like a pandemic to deal with. That was Herbert Fisher, president of the board of education (equivalent of today’s education secretary) for nearly six years from 1916. The Spanish flu pandemic raged in 1918-19 but, Fisher told the Commons, he had “not thought it necessary to issue any general advice” about closing schools. Nobody accused him of idleness or neglect. State education was then almost entirely a responsibility for local councils. Most secondary schools were run by churches or private foundations. Only when ministers accrued more power were they blamed for things going wrong. Over the past few months, Williamson may have wrecked the education and prospects of a generation of children. Sadly, there are many examples of ministers who can be accused of that. Lord Eustace Percy (1924-9) opposed raising the school-leaving age from 14 to 15, in effect delaying it until 1947. Florence Horsbrugh (1951-4) imposed spending cuts just as the post-war baby boomers started school, and did everything possible to prevent local authorities opening comprehensives. Mark Carlisle (1979-81) cancelled plans for GCSEs, at a time when teachers were almost unanimously in favour. All three were Tories, but the rejection of widely acclaimed proposals for A-level reform by Labour’s Ruth Kelly (2004-6) left in place a narrowly academic and specialised 16-18 curriculum that still, in the view of many critics, damages young people’s prospects. Labour’s David Blunkett (1997-2001), with his schemes for improved reading and numeracy, mostly did a good job for children but a calamitous one for adult learners. His individual learning accounts, intended to give poorly qualified adults modest sums to improve their skills, had to be wound up after fraudsters pocketed at least £97m of the £290m spent. Some business schools still use it as a case study in failure. The Tories’ Michael Gove (2010-14) handed over most secondary schools to academy chains, reconstructed the national curriculum and restored traditional written exams. In so doing, he demoralised teachers and angered parents to such an extent that his then close friend, the prime minister David Cameron, felt impelled to remove him. So Williamson has stiff competition for the “worst ever” title. Given time, he could yet improve his rating. “As education secretary, I will stand for the forgotten 50%,” he said in July, promising to put further and technical education, for students who don’t go to university and who express “talent and genius … by the hand and by the eye”, at “the heart of our post-16 education system”. If he pulled that off, he could secure a place among the greatest education ministers. But does he deserve that chance?"

          "headline": "Proportion of students in England awarded first-class degrees soars",
          "bodyText": "The proportion of students awarded first-class degrees in England has increased by almost 90% over the past eight years, with four in five graduates leaving higher education with either a first or a 2:1. Official figures show grade inflation has slowed over the past year, but the Office for Students (OfS), the higher education regulator for England, said it remained a “significant and pressing issue” that threatened to erode public confidence. The government has called repeatedly for a crackdown on university grade inflation, but, according to new data, the proportion of students with firsts has risen from 16% in 2010-11 to 30% in 2018-19, while the proportion of those gaining either a first or a 2:1 has climbed from 67% to 79%. The Department for Education called on the regulator to intervene where necessary. “The UK has a world-class reputation for higher education and it is vital that neither low-quality degrees nor grade inflation undermine standards,” a spokesperson said on Thursday. “It is unacceptable that the proportion of firsts continues to rise, despite repeated calls for action. Awarding powers should be used responsibly and we expect the Office for Students to take action where this is not the case.” The OfS acknowledged a number of factors, including improved learning and teaching, may have driven some of the year-on-year increases since 2010-11, but it said a significant proportion could still not be explained. Of the 29.5% of students who graduated in summer 2019 with a first, nearly half of the results could not be explained by changes in the graduate population, the OfS said. Some of the country’s most competitive institutions awarded the highest proportion of firsts, including Imperial College London, where 54.7% of graduates last year got top grades, while University College London awarded firsts to more than 40% of its graduates. Among the universities with the most striking increases were Anglia Ruskin, where the proportion of firsts jumped from 14.5% in 2010-11 to 36.7% eight years later; Bradford rose from 10.8% to 35.1%, and Kingston climbed from 14.6% to 33.6% The OfS analysis also showed that students entering university with A-level grades below DDD were almost four times as likely to receive a first-class degree in 2018-19 as their peers in 2010-11. Nicola Dandridge, the OfS chief executive, said the data showed the rate of increase had slowed compared with previous years, but there was still evidence of an unexplained increase in firsts at almost three-quarters (73%) of universities in England. “Unexplained grade inflation risks undermining public confidence in higher education, and devaluing the hard work of students. Degrees must stand the test of time, which is why the OfS will continue to address this issue at both a sector-wide and individual university level,” she said. “Where we have concerns about unexplained grade inflation at any particular university or college, we are prepared to intervene to protect the integrity of the degree awarding system for all students.” Universities UK, which represents 140 universities in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, said the sector had agreed a new set of principles for degree algorithm design this year, having overwhelmingly supported a sector-wide statement of intent on tackling grade inflation. “It is essential that degree classifications are meaningful for students and employers, and universities are taking action to improve transparency, fairness and reliability in the way they award degrees. We will be publishing a review of progress later this year exploring whether further action is needed.”"

          "headline": "University students feel bullied, tricked and imprisoned. They’re right to protest",
          "bodyText": "The government’s catastrophic handling of the pandemic is so comprehensive, so multi-faceted, that devoting sufficient attention to each scandal can be a challenge. Consider this one. Back in late August, when the daily average of coronavirus deaths was 10 – it is now more than 400 – the University and College Union (UCU) released a statement entitled “Universities must not become the care homes of a Covid second wave”. “The union fears that the migration of over a million student risks doing untold damage to people’s health, and exacerbating the worst health crisis of our lifetimes,” it warned. This was ignored. When, three weeks later, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) recommended a shift to online learning “unless face-to-face teaching is absolutely essential”, it was ignored, too. The result? The mass internal migration of young people to and from every corner of Britain, which helped fuel a second wave, and their near imprisonment in overcrowded accommodation. The consequences are grave indeed, not least for the wellbeing of a cohort of young people who have been robbed of their youth. Being a first-year university student during a pandemic was never going to be the booze-ridden, hedonistic experience enjoyed by past freshers, but consider what they have been put through. A 19-year-old humanities student, Josh, who uses they, suffered at the hands of this year’s great A-level palaver. “I was only marked down two grades [by Ofqual’s algorithm], though, so I wasn’t as unlucky as some people were,” they tell me. As demanded by government, they were herded to Manchester University with the promise of in-person socially distanced seminars (“that was our initial plan”, the authorities there tell me). To begin with, academic staff were indeed told to deliver in-person teaching. But, as UCU predicted, outbreaks of illness on campus inevitably forced all teaching online: and so it proved, as Josh’s university was afflicted with more than a thousand positive cases. “A lot of people feel lied and tricked into coming here,” they tell me. “We’re being treated as though we exist for profit, for money, and nothing else.” Students are away from home for the first time – some from abroad – without having being able to establish friendships and connections in the normal way as they endure isolation. “It’s getting to the point where it feels quite dangerous,” Josh explains. Manchester University tells me that “the mental health and wellbeing of our students is of the utmost importance to us,” pointing to services including online support. But when Josh looked for help from the student welfare officer, they tell me, they found an empty desk, a leaflet and a number for the Samaritans. (The university does not believe this to be a “true representation of our services”.) One Manchester student was found dead in halls last month – his bereaved father subsequently warning that if young people are locked down “with little support, then you should expect that they suffer severe anxiety”. You might expect Manchester University to have sympathised with the plight of its students. Instead it spent £11,000 constructing a fence around Josh’s halls: the university authorities later apologised for this, claiming that it had been erected in response to concerns about security raised by students and staff. When students have called for rent strikes – bear in mind that many students normally depend on now non-existent part-time jobs in order to survive – they tell me the have been threatened with fines. When students organised a protest on Thursday, several riot vans and the Tactical Aid Unit of local police showed up; students claim they were threatened with arrests and fines and were filmed going about their daily business while respecting regulations. (The university says it “worked collaboratively” with the police and note that the organisers “engaged with officers and agreed to hold the event in a safe way as to protect themselves and the wider public”.) As of Friday, several students are occupying a building in protest: their demands include that management meet students and the UCU, a rent reduction of at least 40% and increased support for students. One of them is 21-year old Mattie – studying disaster management, appropriately enough – who is very clear that the universities are “putting profit before people”, noting that first-year students in particular provide rent revenue to their educational institutions. A university spokesperson said: “We are already engaging with elected Students’ Union representatives about many of the issues being highlighted by the protesters.” The tone-deaf response of university authorities aside, a rational government would have learned from its disastrous mistakes, but we are ruled by no such thing. “We said in August that if you encourage over a million students to travel across the country without test and trace, you’ll create a second wave and that’s exactly what happened,” says the UCU general secretary, Jo Grady. But extraordinarily, she points out that the authorities are now planning a special week-long window for students in England to travel back home “like cattle” on limited public transport, and then repeat the farce of sending them back to university. The young have been clobbered for a decade, and this pandemic is no exception. The government’s treatment of students is a public health disaster and a mental health crisis rolled into one. A Conservative administration reliant on the support of older generations may consider the fury and anguish of its younger citizens to be politically survivable. But as the pandemic subsides, and some normality returns, it may find that the young are in no mood to either forgive or forget. • Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "Councils have warned that offices left empty by the coronavirus pandemic must not be turned into sub-standard “rabbit hutch” homes, after a government climbdown indicated a shift in housebuilding targets away from the southern shires and toward towns and cities. Thousands more homes are set to be built in urban areas, particularly in the Midlands and north of England after the government said it would adjust a housing targets algorithm that had sparked a rebellion from MPs and council leaders representing Conservative heartlands. Targets in areas such as Hampshire and Surrey were increased significantly, and now the Ministry of Housing, Communities &amp; Local Government (MHCLG) reportedly wants to make the system “fairer”. The move has raised fresh fears about the standard of housing that may result. Officials plan to use the new strategy to reshape town and city centres hit hard by the pandemic, repurposing some vacant offices and shops as homes. “We have opposed the algorithm on the basis housing has to be built where it is needed and councils are best placed to decide,” said David Renard, the Local Government Association’s housing spokesman. “It is helpful to focus on towns and city centres as we know retail is shrinking and we need to repurpose these places. At a high level this could be a good policy, but converting offices into poor-quality housing isn’t something we want to see.” Planning rules currently allow builders to turn offices into homes without planning permission, which has led to some cramped developments with tiny flats – sometimes with almost no natural light. Martin Tett, the leader of Buckinghamshire county council, said the permitted development right (PDR) must be scrapped in order to guarantee “decent” homes. “You can convert these [office blocks] into what have been described as ‘rabbit hutches’, so we need to get rid of the PDR and make everything subject to planning permission,” he said. The move to “rebalance” housing targets comes after a rebellion by Conservative county councils and backbenchers, including the former prime minister Theresa May and the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt. Bob Seely, the Isle of Wight MP, told parliament: “The biggest housing increases will be to rural shires and suburbs, and the biggest falls are in the urban north and Midlands.” The MHCLG confirmed the change, first reported in the Sunday Telegraph, which will lead to targets being adjusted to create a “fairer formula”. The move stops short of meeting demands from councils for the government to abandon the algorithm altogether and allow local areas to determine their own housing targets according to need. Andrew Howard, the managing director at the planning consultant BECG, said: “A U-turn now is better than the dead-end algorithm that so upset Tory heartlands. It was a poorly judged, quick-fix solution to a long-term problem. “The government needs to stop digging and take the time to reconsider this in the light of responses to the planning white paper. We need a home-building policy that delivers for the shires and our urban areas and also helps town centres and high streets that have been devastated by Covid.” There has been widespread anger at the government’s planning reforms, which also propose to reduce local decision-making on individual development proposals. The planning white paper sets out to give local people and politicians a say over strategic plans, but after that developers will be free to build. It also makes it easier for open land not currently protected as green belt, a national park or an area of outstanding natural beauty to be built over."

          "bodyText": "The English players suddenly disappeared in the final stages of the Indian Premier League. So it was quite an achievement for Jofra Archer to be given the Most Valuable Player award at the conclusion of the tournament. His side, Rajasthan Royals, an English enclave since Archer was accompanied there by Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Tom Curran, finished bottom of the table. How strange would it seem if the PFA’s player of the year played for Norwich City, who came last in the Premier League in the 2019-20 season? Archer won the award via some form of algorithm. So obviously there can be no arguments there. He accrued 305 points and was therefore ahead of Kagiso Rabada of Delhi Capitals, who came second (298 points), and Jasprit Bumrah who played for the eventual winners, Mumbai Indians (269.5 points). At last a formula has been concocted that seems to favour the downtrodden breed of pace bowlers rather than the fancy Dans up the order. Undoubtedly Archer performed superbly in the tournament even though he was on the losing side more often than not. He bowled fast and on target and was brimful of confidence throughout as his opponents grew ever more wary of him. The stats that are spewed out may well demonstrate this: 20 wickets in 14 matches, 175 dot balls (at last the dot ball has been properly recognised and celebrated), five catches, as well as five fours and 10 sixes with the bat. I have also been wary of individual awards in cricket (except, perhaps, when I’ve won them). The award of the MVP or the man of the match is supposed to add a bit of interest and glamour at the end of the game or tournament and this usually means that there is someone else for the broadcasters and media to talk to afterwards. But cricket is supposed to be a team game. It should not matter much who wins these awards. The IPL seems to have a formula for deciding the winner of such awards, which is designed to be objective since it is based on numbers. Often the criteria have been more subjective, especially in the distant past. I like this example: in 1983 Somerset played Sussex in the quarter-final of the NatWest Trophy at Hove and they bowled out their opponents for 65 in 40.4 overs, Joel Garner taking four for eight, Ian Botham four for 20. Arthur Milton, the former Test opener and right-winger (the last man to play cricket and football for England) was tasked with deciding the man of the match award. “I can’t separate the performances of Joel and Ian”, he announced at the end-of-game presentation, “so I’m giving the award to Trevor Gard”. Trevor was Somerset’s wicketkeeper, who had taken five catches in the innings. This was a typically deft decision by Arthur and a universally popular one. Peter May, then the Chairman of Selectors, trumped this at Lord’s after the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup final of 1984 between Lancashire and Warwickshire. Lancashire won a low-scoring contest by six wickets and May astounded everyone, including the recipient, by giving the award to John Abrahams, the Lancashire captain. Earlier in the day he had been dismissed for a duck, he had not bowled and he had taken one catch as well as dropping a sitter. However, he had won the toss. Sometimes these awards can cause mayhem. For a while in 1986 an Alfa Romeo saloon was the most famous car in New Zealand. Richard Hadlee had won it for being the International Player of the Year after the tour to Australia. The unwritten precedent was that any individual prizes should be put into the team pool but Hadlee wanted to keep the car and had it shipped back to New Zealand. This caused many ructions within the Kiwi dressing room and a famous stand-off between the captain, Jeremy Coney, and Hadlee ensued, which was most obvious throughout the Christchurch Test match of 1987 against West Indies. John Wright, the Kiwi opening batsman, has recalled one of his roles in that game. “I had to be a sort of go-between because they weren’t speaking to each other. I’d be asking Richard if he wanted to bowl another over and telling Coney that Richard wanted another gully – I felt like Henry Kissinger. It was absurd.” Hadlee took six for 50 in the first innings, with three of those victims caught by Coney in the slips, and New Zealand won by five wickets. There will not be the same friction in the England camp when the one-day side comes together for the tour to South Africa this week and no doubt the process of prize money distribution is precisely laid down. In recent times Eoin Morgan’s squad have contained an unusually tight-knit group of players who clearly enjoy one another’s company. Which is just as well. The likes of Archer, Buttler, Stokes and Sam Curran have been lurching from bubble to bubble for a long time now. Archer, with his well-deserved award tucked away in one of his cases, will be buoyed by his performances in the IPL, the format of the game in which he excels the most. Twenty20 is not easier than the other formats but it is simpler. The longer the game the more complicated it becomes. Archer knows that he has 24 deliveries to propel starting with a shiny new ball. And he knows how to do that with pace, venom and variety. Three more games (he is missing the one-day internationals in the second half of the South Africa tour) and maybe one more man-of-the-series award to stuff into his bag and he can put his feet up – for a week or two."

          "bodyText": "We’ve launched a new blog at the link below – head there for the latest: That’s where I’ll leave you for now. Thanks for sticking with me. Let’s recap on the developments of the past 24 hours. The global death toll climbed above 1.3 million and more than 53 million have been infected worldwide by Covid-19, as the virus runs rampant through America and Europe. In Australia, the news is much better. The state of Victoria again recorded no new cases and no new deaths for the 16th consecutive day. Victoria’s death toll from coronavirus remains at 819, while the total number of deaths from Covid-19 in Australia is 907. Australia’s two other most populous states, NSW and Queensland, also recorded no new locally-acquired Covid-19 cases. Ten people have died after a fire broke out in a Covid-19 intensive care ward in Romania, as prosecutors opened a criminal investigation into events. The blaze, which was “most likely triggered by a short circuit”, spread through the ward at Piatra Neamt Regional Emergency hospital on Saturday afternoon, critically injuring seven people. 462 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 in the U.K, raising the official death toll to 51,766. This number is up from 376 on Friday, government data shows. In Bristol, police made 14 arrests after protesters defied a ban on an anti-lockdown rally. One of the arrested men was Jeremy Corbyn’s brother, vision appears to show. Record high case numbers were recorded in Russia and Ukraine. Russia reported 22,702 new infections and 391 deaths. Ukraine registered 12,524 new cases. Poland recorded a record new 548 deaths and 25,571 cases. The record number of deaths takes Poland’s toll above 10,000. Iran has announced strict new lockdown restrictions from next Saturday, after recording 452 deaths, a near record. President Hassan Rouhani said non-essential businesses and services will be shut and cars will not be allowed to leave or enter Tehran and 100 other towns and cities Lebanon has started a new two-week lockdown after coronavirus infections crossed the 100,000 mark. Beirut’s roads were largely empty and police checkpoints were set up at several locations. Greece and Austria have set out plans to tighten lockdown restrictions. Austria is planning to impose a full lockdown from Tuesday. Greece has announced the closure of nurseries and primary schools until the end of November as its death toll surpassed 1,000. The Australian state of New South Wales has just released its latest Covid-19 data. It has again recorded no new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours. The state has reported nine cases in overseas travellers in hotel quarantine, which brings the total in NSW to 4,306 cases since the beginning of the pandemic. NSW conducted 17,226 tests reported, a slight increase on the prior day. The state’s health authorities are warning residents not to drop their guard. With the weather becoming warmer and people starting to attend more social gatherings, NSW Health is calling on the community to maintain the COVID safe behaviours that have been key to stopping the spread of the virus. Though there have been no locally acquired cases in NSW in recent days, now is not the time to drop our guard. Everyone needs to continue to be alert to the ongoing risk of transmission of COVID-19, to keep practising physical distancing and good hand hygiene, and most importantly to get tested and isolate if they feel unwell. Just back to Victoria, Australia, momentarily. The premier Daniel Andrews has flagged he will make an announcement on the wearing of masks next Sunday. That announcement could include allowing individuals who are walking alone to take masks off until they come into contact with others. That’s not for today. We will hopefully have a bit more to say about masks next week. The German government has released a tongue-in-cheek ad hailing an unlikely hero in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic: the humble couch potato. AP reports: The 90-second video posted online Saturday begins with an elderly man recalling his ‘service’ to the nation back when he was just a young student “in the winter of 2020, when the whole country’s eyes were on us.” “I had just turned 22 and was studying engineering,” he continues, “when the second wave hit.” With violins stirring at viewers’ heart strings, the setting switches to a scene of the narrator as a young man. “Suddenly the fate of this country lay in our hands,” he says. “So we mustered all our courage and did what was expected of us, the only right thing. We did nothing.” “Days and nights we stayed on our backsides at home and fought against the spread of the coronavirus,” the narrator continues. “Our couch was the front line and our patience was our weapon.” The ad ends with a government message that “you too can become a hero by staying at home.” Germany imposed fresh restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 at the start of November, shutting restaurants, bars and gyms, and setting limits on the number of people who can meet in public and private settings. Greg Hunt also repeated the federal government’s call for all Australian states and territories to open their borders by Christmas. What we do want to see is the borders open overwhelmingly by Christmas, we’d like to see all of them open, we know that [Western Australia] has a little bit further to go. But there is no advice from the Commonwealth chief medical officer that any state or territory should be closed to any other state or territory. Australia’s federal health minister Greg Hunt has just spoken in Canberra. He was asked about Australia’s efforts to return stranded citizens from abroad. He says Australia is exploring “green lanes” with other nations, an arrangement already in place with New Zealand. Green lanes are agreements that allow travel without quarantine. Hunt: We have the green lane with New Zealand and there’s the potential for other green lanes for countries where the medical advice is that they are considered overwhelmingly safe for bringing people to Australia without quarantine. That is something that will be used cautiously and carefully. He said Australia was working to begin to return international students also. But he said that would not be done in a way that displaces returning citizens. The prime minister has been absolutely clear that he would not detract from the ability to bring Australians home. The Victorian premier Daniel Andrews is speaking about the state’s continued success at containing Covid-19. Andrews says Victoria has now recorded 16 days without a new case. That’s a remarkable turnaround for the state, easily the worst hit jurisdiction in Australia. Andrews: Since yesterday, that 16 days with no new cases in our state. We have now received results from 3,398,653 tests since the beginning of the pandemic. That’s 8323 tests since yesterday. I want to thank those 8300 people are going and getting tested the day before. Getting tested is the critical thing. That allows us to have a complete picture, or at least the most complete picture of where this virus is, and to put a public health response around your family and then protect every family across the state, so we are very grateful and we say thank you to each and every one of those people. If there is one thing that people take away from the current positive news the notion of more than a fortnight now with no extra cases, the biggest and most important take to every single Victorian is, if you have symptoms, even the mildest symptoms, please go and get tested and get tested quickly. Hi everyone, It’s Christopher Knaus here, I’ll be live blogging the latest Covid-19 developments for the next little while. Just staying with Australia, for the moment. A key problem facing the nation is the repatriation of stranded Australians abroad. The education minister has just made an announcement about a related issue: how to return international university students to the nation. Education minister Dan Tehan has instructed states and territories to draw up plans for the return of international students, while staying within their quarantine caps. Tehan spoke to Sky News a little earlier: Our priority is returning Australians and that will continue to be the case especially in the lead up to Christmas But we have asked state and territory governments to submit plans to us as to how they can bring in international students back. The loss of international students has crippled Australia’s university sector, which is estimated to have lost up to 12,000 jobs. Hello everyone, I am off now. My colleague Christopher Knaus will be taking over the blog, so best to direct any tips his way. From Australian Associated Press: New South Wales contact tracers are racing to reach 455 travellers to Australia from New Zealand after a positive case was confirmed in Auckland. Those who have arrived in NSW from New Zealand since 5 November have been sent a message with NSW Health advice and are being contacted and alerted about a number of venues of concern in Auckland. NSW Health said in a statement no passengers arriving in Sydney from New Zealand on Friday evening reported having visited the locations and none had symptoms. “Airlines will ascertain if passengers have attended these venues before they leave New Zealand and if they have, they will be not allowed to travel,” the department said. NSW has now gone a week without a locally transmitted virus case but health authorities are still urging the community to keep getting tested. NSW will reopen its border with Victoria on 23 November. The southern state has recorded more than two weeks of consecutive zero-transmission days. For the 16th straight day in a row, Victoria is reporting a “donut day” – that is, a day with no coronavirus cases or deaths. It comes after the state tested 8,323 people. Victoria’s death toll from the virus remains at 819, while the total number of deaths from Covid in Australia is 907. Victoria has just three active cases of Covid. On Sunday, Allan Cheng, the deputy chief health officer, described the stretch of zero-case days as “about as good as it can get” but warned “there may still be the potential for hidden trains of transmission out there”. “And then obviously the potential for an incursion of cases from outside, from New Zealand or NSW.” The state government is pushing for more testing in Hume and Wyndham. Covid restriction in Victoria are set to ease further next Sunday, when contact sport will resume across the board, 50 people will be allowed to attend outdoor public gatherings, 10 people will be allowed to visit homes, and 100 people will be able to attend wedding and funerals. The border to South Australia will reopen on 1 December and to NSW on 23 November. Guardian Australia staff and Australian Associated Press French police broke up a house party that was attended by at least 300 people outside Paris on Saturday, describing the event as being “in total disdain for health rules”. Daily newspaper Le Parisien said police had to throw special grenades as intermediate weapons to break up the gathering in Joinville-le-Pont and escape. Authorities appealed to everyone who went to get tested quickly, as it emerged that at least one person at the party was infected with coronavirus. France is in the grips of a second lockdown, with hospitals having to delay some operations to tend to Covid patients because they are so stretched. An unexpected 10% rise in the five-day moving average of new coronavirus cases in Ireland threatens to reverse a recent sharp drop in the incidence rate of the disease, the country’s chief medical officer has warned. Following the re-imposition of stringent nationwide curbs, such as travel restrictions and the closure of non-essential retail last month, the 14-day infection rate more than halved to 130 cases per 100,000 people. The R rate also fell by more than half to 0.6 last month, leading health officials to predict cases were on track to fall below 100 per day by the time constraints are due to end on 1 December. However, infections have begun to tick up since then and the five-day moving average rose to 392 from 354 after the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) reported 456 new cases on Saturday. In a statement, Tony Holohan, chief medical officer, said: We have seen higher numbers in recent days than we expected based on the encouraging trends of the last three weeks. We are concerned that this progress is at risk. NPHET will continue to monitor the situation closely over the coming days. Romanian officials say a fire at a hospital treating Covid-19 patients has killed 10 people and critically injured seven others, the Associated Press reports. The blaze spread through the intensive care ward designated for people with Covid-19 patients at the public hospital in the northern city of Piatra Neamt, said Irina Popa, the spokeswoman for the local Emergency Situations Inspectorate. She said all of the people who died or were injured in Saturday’s fire except one were hospital patients. Romanian health minister, Nelu Tataru, told local media the fire was “most likely triggered by a short circuit.” Prosecutors said they would open an investigation to determine the cause of the fire, the country’s most deadly since 2015, when a night club in the capital Bucharest burned down and 65 people died. Piatra Neamt is about 353 kilometers (219 miles) north of Bucharest. A “critical incident” has been declared at two Lincolnshire hospitals following a surge in coronavirus patients within a week. The number of patients with Covid-19 at Lincoln County and Boston Pilgrim has risen from 56 on 6 November to 175. The facilities, which are now operating at the highest alert level, are cancelling training and study leave for non-clinical time, documents seen by the BBC’s Local Democracy Reporting Service indicate. In a statement sent to the BBC, Mark Brassington, deputy chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust, said: We have declared a critical incident at Pilgrim Hospital, Boston, and Lincoln County Hospital. The incident is being managed internally with support from our partners and patients should continue to attend appointments unless contacted directly. Some areas are either closed to new admissions or have restricted access. This is compounded by challenges with staffing due to a lack of availability of colleagues due to a number of factors. More than a billion Indians celebrated Diwali on Saturday despite mounting fears over a resurgence in Covid-19 infections, especially in Delhi, the capital. Here is more on how the Hindu festival of lights has adapted to the pandemic here: Vitamin D could be used as a way to prevent and treat coronavirus, with Matt Hancock, the health secretary, asking health advisers to produce new guidelines on its use. In a statement, a spokesperson for the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which sets NHS clinical guidelines, told the Guardian: Nice and PHE received a formal request to produce recommendations on vitamin D for prevention and treatment of Covid from the secretary of state for health and social care, Matt Hancock, on October 29. Italy has registered 37,255 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, the health ministry announced on Saturday, down from 40,902 on Friday. The ministry also recorded 544 Covid-related deaths, down from 550 the day before, Reuters reports. The northern region of Lombardy, centred on Italy’s financial capital Milan, remained the hardest hit area on Saturday, reporting 8,129 new cases against 10,634 on Friday. Sixteen people have been arrested after hundreds of protestors attended an anti-lockdown demonstration in Liverpool city centre. Merseyside police said they had taken the action because people were breaching public order and coronavirus rules that prohibit mass gatherings. Police have now introduced a dispersal zone within the city centre and south Liverpool until Sunday. In the UK, 462 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, bringing the official death toll to 51,766. This number is up from 376 the previous day, according to government data. There were 26,860 people in the UK that tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday, down from 27,301 on Friday. A further 304 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital, NHS England has announced. The patients were aged between 21 and 100 years old and all except nine had known underlying health conditions. The dates of death range from 10 September to 13 November 2020. NHS England provided this regional breakdown: East of England - 12 London - 14 Midlands - 77 North East &amp; Yorkshire - 79 North West - 87 South East - 17 South West - 18 Hello, my name is Yohannes Lowe. I’ll be taking over the blog now up until midnight. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter with any news tips between then. Austria will introduce a national lockdown on Tuesday in a bid to bring its soaring coronavirus infections under control, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has confirmed (see earlier). Non-essential shops will close and the current curfew from 8 pm to 6 am. will be expanded into an all-day requirement to stay at home, with specific exceptions such as shopping for essentials or exercise, Kurz said. People should work from home wherever possible, he added. The lockdown is due to last almost three weeks. Kurz said the measures had become necessary because Austria has seen 550 new cases of coronavirus per 100,000 inhabitants in the past week, a level 11 times greater than what authorities said would be sustainable. “If we don’t react massively, then there’s a great risk that the numbers will continue to rise or stay at a high level,” Kurz told reporters in Vienna. Here’s a summary of the latest developments: Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, has announced stricter lockdown restrictions from next Saturday. Non-essential businesses and services will be shut and cars will not be allowed to leave or enter Tehran and 100 other towns and cities. Iran announced 452 Covid deaths – a near record. Police have made 14 arrests after protesters defied a ban on an anti-lockdown rally in Bristol, in England. Those arrested included Jeremy Corbyn’s brother Piers, according to video footage. Lebanon has started a new two-week lockdown after coronavirus infections crossed the 100,000 mark. Beirut’s roads were largely empty and police checkpoints were set up at several locations. Russia and Ukraine have both reported record highs in daily cases. Russia has reported a record daily number of 22,702 new infections and 391 deaths. Ukraine registered 12,524 new cases. Poland has reported a record 548 new coronavirus deaths, taking the country’s total above 10,000. Poland also reported 25,571 new cases. Greece and Austria have set out plans to tighten lockdown restrictions. Austria is planning to impose a full lockdown from Tuesday. Greece has announced the closure of nurseries and primary schools until the end of November as its death toll surpassed 1,000. The development of an effective vaccine should not make people complacent about the spread of coronavirus in England, a government adviser has warned. Prof Susan Michie warned that the country was entering a “very challenging” fortnight. A group of religious leaders has launched a legal challenge against the decision to close churches for public worship in England and Wales during the second lockdown. More than 100 church leaders are seeking a judicial review of the decision by the UK government to ban people from worshipping together in England. Police have made 14 arrests after protesters defied a ban on an anti-lockdown rally in Bristol, in England. Avon and Somerset police warned officers would take action if an event organised by Stand Up Bristol went ahead. Despite the warning, about 200 people gathered on College Green before marching through the city centre. The force said 14 arrests had been made, including one for assaulting an officer. Read the latest on the Bristol protests here: Johnson &amp; Johnson and the US Department of Health and Human Services have expanded an agreement to support the next phase of Covid vaccine research and development, the company has said. Under the agreement the company will commit $604m and the department will commit about $454m to support the phase 3 trial. It will evaluate J&amp;J’s vaccine candidate as a single dose in up to 60,000 volunteers worldwide, the company said in a statement. The US set yet another daily record for new coronavirus cases on Friday, with more than 184,000, while Donald Trump promised imminent distribution of a vaccine – except to New York, which he threatened to leave out for political reasons – and the president-elect, Joe Biden, pleaded with Americans to follow basic mitigation measures. According to Johns Hopkins University, 184,514 new cases were recorded on Friday, up from 153,496 on Thursday. More than 10.7 million cases have been recorded in total and more than 244,000 people have died. Deaths are also increasing: 1,431 were reported on Friday, the highest toll in 10 days, though more than a thousand less than the highest such toll, from April. At the White House, in his first remarks since losing the election to Biden, Trump said he expected a vaccine developed by Pfizer to receive emergency use authorisation “extremely soon”, and to be available to the general population by April.

Callum Laidlaw admitted that his holiday contradicts local guidance. Travel is permitted to the Canary Islands, but Scottish government guidance urges against any non-essential travel outside of a level 3 area such as Edinburgh. The Philippine president, Rodrigo Duterte, has cleared his newly appointed police chief of any violation of rules when he celebrated his birthday in May during one of the world’s strictest coronavirus lockdowns, Reuters reports. In a national address on Saturday, Duterte defended Debold Sinas, promoted this week to national police commander, and noted his appointee’s achievements despite a social media stir over perceived special treatment. Sinas had led anti-drug operations in which thousands of people were killed. “If he has [committed] any offence, he is pardoned already. I do not see any wrongdoing with moral implications and malice,” Duterte said, adding that Sinas was not at fault for having been thrown a surprise party. Sinas has been under investigation by the justice ministry for celebrating his birthday with fellow officers in May despite coronavirus curbs and at a time when police were arresting thousands of people for quarantine violations. He has apologised for “causing anxiety to the public”. It was not immediately clear if Duterte’s comments meant those investigations were no longer active. The latest coronavirus figures from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have been published. Scotland announced 1,118 new cases, following a 1,357 rise in cases reported on Friday. There were 36 new deaths, compared with 56 deaths reported on Friday. In Wales, where a “firebreak” lockdown ended on Monday, Public Health Wales has reported another 20 deaths from coronavirus and a further 933 cases. In Northern Ireland, 1o more deaths were announced and a further 511 cases. The death toll from Covid-19 has surpassed 1,000 in Greece after a further 20 people succumbed to the virus. Most of the victims are believed to be in northern Greece, which soaring infection rates have made the country’s hardest hit area. In its daily briefing on Friday, the public health organisation, EODY, announced that 38 more people had died from the disease, bringing the total number of fatalities to 997. Most had underlying illnesses and were aged over 70, it said. The death toll climbed as Greece edged closer to comprehensive lockdown after the education minister announced that nurseries and elementary schools would join other educational institutions in remaining closed until the end of November. “It’s important to emphasise that the measures are of a purely precautionary nature,” Niki Kerameus told a press conference earlier on Saturday. To date a total of 69,675 coronavirus cases have been registered in Greece. The vast majority have been confirmed since the summer, when epidemiologists announced the arrival of the pandemic’s second wave. Amid the surge, growing numbers of doctors have expressed concern over the ability of the nation’s fragile health system to deal with coronavirus patients. In Thessaloniki, Greece’s northern metropolis, fears of overstretched intensive care wards buckling under pressure have mounted in recent days. In a bid to stem the spread of transmissions, the government has tightened restrictions (see earlier). Supporters of Donald Trump are expected to stage a rally in Washington today, in support of the president’s baseless claims that the election was stolen from him in key battleground states. Follow the latest on the rally and the battle against coronavirus in the US here: Families of care home residents in England have described the launch of a government pilot scheme to increase visits as “too little too late”. On Friday night, the government announced that family and friends of people living in care homes would receive access to regular testing to allow them to visit their loved ones. The pilot scheme will begin in 20 care homes across Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall on Monday, with plans to expand the policy to other regions by Christmas. While the move offers long-awaited progress for care home visitation rights, for some families, it has come too late. Maureen Abson’s father, a navy veteran with advanced vascular dementia who lived in a care home in Lancashire, died on Wednesday, aged 81. Abson described the pilot scheme as “ridiculous”.

In a letter to the Times, reposted by the British Retail Consortium, they pointed to a Sage paper which found that the closure of non-essential retail would have minimal impact on the transmission of coronavirus. It says: With less than two weeks to go until the Chancellor’s Spending Review it is vital that retailers get the clarity they need over the future. Christmas is fast-approaching and half of retail has been forced to shut – depriving these stores of around £2 billion per week in sales. November and December account for over a fifth of all retail sales and if all shops are not allowed to reopen by the start of December, many stores may never reopen putting hundreds of thousands of retail jobs at risk. A continued period of retail closure will see more shuttered high streets and many more job losses at the heart of the festive season. Government reports have noted that the closure of shops would have a minimal impact on the transmission of Covid. Retailers have invested hundreds of millions in making their stores Covid-secure, keeping both customers and staff safe. A north London gym owner is facing a £67,000 fine from his local council after refusing to close during England’s second national lockdown, saying he felt staying open was the “right thing to do socially, morally and scientifically”. Andreas Mishli, 34, said he finally shut his Zone Gym in Wood Green on Wednesday after police blocked customers from entering his premises. Haringey council is now seeking to obtain a closure order through the courts which it intends to enforce. The gym owner told the PA Media news agency: “I couldn’t actually find a reason why to not keep it open, other than there was legislation in place. “It felt like the right thing to do socially, morally and scientifically.” Germany is set to pay out €22bn of coronavirus relief aid during the first half of 2021, as the country looks to shield companies and self-employed people from the brunt of the financial impact of the country’s second wave. Separately, Germany’s November coronavirus aid package to compensate firms affected by lockdown measures will come to €14bn, sources close to the matter said. The government had initially expected to pay out €10bn this month. The new relief measures can grant companies up to €200,000 a month to cover fixed costs such as rent, while sole traders can get up to €5,000. It comes as new daily coronavirus cases in the country hit a record of 23,542 on Friday amid reports that its partial lockdown could be extended beyond the end of the month. The British Heart Foundation (BHF) has said there have been 4,622 excess deaths from heart and circulatory diseases in England between the start of the pandemic and mid-October. Amid the second coronavirus wave that has seen England lock down until early December, the charity urged people not to delay seeking treatment. The BHF attributed a number of potential factors to the rise in deaths, including: People putting off seeking care for fear of “putting pressure” on the NHS. People delaying seeking care for worrying symptoms for fear of contracting Covid-19 in health settings. Delays to surgeries and routine heart care. Hello, I’ll be taking over the blog for the next hour while Matthew Weaver takes a break. You can get in touch with me via Twitter DM or email with any news tips or suggestions for coverage. Thanks! Lebanon has started a new two-week lockdown after coronavirus infections crossed the 100,000 mark in a country where hospital capacity has become saturated, AFP reports. The capital’s roads were largely empty and police checkpoints had been set up at several locations, while the seaside promenade, often thronging on weekends, was deserted. The airport, however, remains open, as do essential businesses. Under the measures announced, only cars with certain number plates were allowed on the roads. A night-time curfew is to come into force from 5pm Lebanon, with a population of around 6 million, has been recording some 11,000 coronavirus infections on average each week, the health ministry said on Thursday. The number of coronavirus cases surged following the explosion at Beirut’s port on 4 August which killed more than 200 people, and overwhelmed hospitals with 6,500 wounded. The new restrictions are set to last until 30 November 30 but the authorities have said they could be extended, as they fear the health system would not be able to cope with many more cases needing intensive care. “The situation is critical and getting worse,” Said al-Asmar, a pulmonologist at the main public hospital in Beirut dealing with Covid-19 cases, warned on Friday. Sometimes, “patients need intensive care, but we have to leave them in accident and emergency,” the doctor at the Rafik Hariri Hospital told AFP. Iran will impose stricter restrictions from next Saturday, President Hassan Rouhani has said on state television as the country announced a near record rise in daily deaths. The toughest measures – classified by health officials as “red” or level 3 – will be imposed in the capital, Tehran, and about 100 other towns and cities, Reuters reports. Non-essential businesses and services will be shut and cars will not be allowed to leave or enter, the deputy health minister, Alireza Raisi, said in a televised media briefing. Iranian health officials have devised a colour-coding system that denotes the severity of the coronavirus outbreak in the country. “The goal is not to shut down people’s businesses, but we have to set limits,” Raisi said. Some 150 towns and cities are rated “orange” or level 2, he said. In these, one-third of employees can go to work whereas in 155 towns where the rating is “yellow” or level 1 two-thirds of the workforce can work from their workplaces. “Shutdowns are not limited to jobs, but also include universities, schools and training centres,” Rouhani said. “In the red and orange cities, training will take place remotely.” Iran’s health ministry has announced that a near daily record of 452 more people have died from Covid in the past 24 hours, taking the country’s death toll to to 41,034. Saturday’s increase in fatalities is just below the record 461 deaths announced on Friday. So far, every day this month Iran has recorded more than 400 new deaths from the virus. Spokeswoman Sima Sadat Lari also announced 11,203 new cases of infections. Here’s a round-up of the latest developments: Russia and Ukraine have both reported record highs in daily cases. Russia has reported a record daily number of 22,702 new infections and 391 deaths. Ukraine registered 12,524 new cases. Poland has reported a record 548 new coronavirus deaths, taking the country’s total above 10,000. Poland also reported 25,571 new cases. Greece and Austria have set out plans to tighten lockdown restrictions. Austria is planning to impose a full lockdown from Tuesday. Greece has announced the closure of nurseries and primary schools until the end of November. The development of an effective vaccine should not make people complacent about the spread of coronavirus in England, a government adviser has warned. Prof Susan Michie, warned that the country was entering a “very challenging” fortnight. A group of religious leaders has launched a legal challenge against the decision to close churches for public worship in England and Wales during the second lockdown. More than 100 church leaders are seeking a judicial review of the decision by the UK government to ban people from worshipping together in England. According to Johns Hopkins University, the world had its worst day of the pandemic on Friday. It noted that the deaths of 11,617 more people dead were announced and more than 666,000 new cases recorded in 24 hours. Donald Trump has insisted his administration would not order a lockdown despite rising infection rates and more than 100,000 new cases being recorded daily for the past seven days. The pandemic has killed more than 240,000 people in the US. Higher education experts in the UK are warning that the government may use the coronavirus crisis to turn struggling universities into polytechnics and cut student numbers. Ministers have appointed a board for the government’s “higher education restructuring regime”, which has been set up to help universities in financial trouble. Some academics are calling it an “economic hit squad”. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has calculated that about 13 universities risk going bankrupt during the pandemic, because their already weak finances make it harder for them to weather losses in their teaching, commercial and research revenue. In May, the government refused pleas from Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ body, for a £2bn bail-out package for universities. Instead, struggling universities can now seek a loan from its shadowy new “restructuring regime”. Read more here: Austria is planning to impose a full lockdown from Tuesday, a draft and summary of a government decree seen by Reuters has revealed. The current 8pm to 6am curfew will move to an all-day lockdown with non-essential shops closing, the text said. Secondary schools have already switched to distance learning, but schools for younger ages that are still open will do the same while providing childcare when necessary. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz was due to hold a news conference outlining new restrictions in the face of surging infections on Saturday afternoon. The government in Greece has announced the closure of nurseries and primary schools until the end of November, tightening a nationwide lockdown after a spike in cases, Reuters reports. Greece has fared better than many other European countries in tackling the coronavirus, mainly due to an early nationwide lockdown imposed weeks after the pandemic broke out in February. A gradual increase in infections since early October has forced authorities to reimpose restrictions and order a second nationwide lockdown, which expires at the end of November and includes a night curfew. On Saturday, the government tightened the measures further, closing primary schools and nurseries from Monday for two weeks until the end of the lockdown period. Distance learning has already been implemented in secondary schools and universities. Greece registered 3,038 new coronavirus cases on Friday. On Thursday, it recorded 3,316 new infections and 50 deaths, the highest daily tolls recorded during the pandemic so far. Malaysia has reported 1,114 new coronavirus cases, raising the total to 46,209 infections. The health ministry also recorded two new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities from the pandemic to 306. Officials in Lanzhou, western China, have said coronavirus has been detected on the packaging of a batch of shrimp imported from Saudi Arabia, Reuters reports. The Lanzhou municipal health commission said in a statement on its website that it had found one positive sample on Friday on the inner packaging of imported frozen shrimp from Saudi Arabia that had passed through customs in the coastal city of Tianjin. The cold storage plant in Lanzhou where the case was discovered had been temporarily closed, all employees of the plant had been tested, all food involved was sealed and the whereabouts of all food sold had been determined, the statement said. The commission said the shrimp had been purchased by Zhanjiang Guolian Aquatic Products, entered the country on 21 October and reached Lanzhou on 8 November. The positive sample in Lanzhou follows the detection of the virus on the packaging of a batch of Brazilian beef in Wuhan on Friday, and on Argentinian beef samples in Shandong and Jiangsu provinces this week. The World Health Organization says the risk of catching Covid-19 from frozen food is low, but China has repeatedly sounded alarms after detecting the virus on imported food products, triggering disruptive import bans. Poland has reported a record 548 new coronavirus deaths, taking the country’s total above 10,000. Poland reported 25,571 new cases, lower than THE record 27,875 recorded on 7 November. The health ministry said that as of Saturday, Covid-19 patients occupied 22,320 hospital beds and were using 2,126 ventilators, out of 35,182 and 2,805 available, respectively. Dominic Cummings’ lockdown journeys in the north-east “stank”, a Tory backbencher had admitted after supporting the UK prime minister’s former chief aide at the time. Crispin Blunt said Boris Johnson should not have supported Cummings after his controversial trips to Durham and Barnard Castle were exposed by the Guardian and the Daily Mirror. Blunt was not one of the 45 backbenchers who called for Cummings to go at the time, but speaking on Times Radio he admitted his behaviour “gravely undermined” the government’s message on coronavirus. Interviewed a day after Cummings left Downing Street with immediate effect, Blunt was asked if the PM was right to back the adviser. He said: With the benefit of hindsight, no. However, you’ve got to make a call about what is seen to be fair and proper in the circumstances and Boris made a call on that. I happened to agree with him [Cummings] because I saw his behaviour as being consistent with what we were trying to do, and what he was trying to do for his family was consistent with trying to protect the wider public and doing the right thing for his family. That is an individual issue. The politics of it obviously absolutely stank and once it had been alighted upon by people it was a very bad example and it gravely undermined, obviously because of the huge attention it received, trust in the government’s policy. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden has set up a 13-member coronavirus advisory board that will play a high-profile role in helping the Biden-Harris administration contain the coronavirus pandemic in the US as it enters its deadliest phase so far. “Failure is not an option here,” Dr Michael Osterholm, an epidemiologist at the University of Minnesota and a member of the advisory board, told the Guardian. “We have to do whatever we can to reduce the impact of the virus on our society.” The high-powered board, which includes a former US surgeon general, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, leading virologists and experts in bio-defence and the health of marginalised populations, is an about-face from the Trump administration. Read more here: Turkmenistan’s long-time leader, Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, has insisted his reclusive country had no coronavirus cases, state media reported on Saturday, even as he opened a new hospital for infectious diseases, Agence France-Presse reports. Berdymukhamedov hailed the country’s “big achievement” in avoiding the pandemic, in comments reported by the state newspaper Neutral Turkmenistan. “As a result of the preventive measures taken, no cases of coronavirus infection have been registered in the country to date,” Berdymukhamedov said. Hardline Turkmenistan and North Korea are among fewer than a dozen countries yet to declare a single coronavirus case. The other countries are Pacific island nations. The Solomon Islands, Marshall Islands and Vanuatu all declared their first cases in recent weeks but have avoided community transmission. Berdymukhamedov’s virus-free claim is his first since a visit in July by a World Health Organization delegation prompted the government to implement a national lockdown. Dissident-led media based in Europe have reported an explosion of coronavirus cases, but their websites are banned in the country, where there is no free press or political opposition. The WHO’s senior emergency officer for Europe, Catherine Smallwood, recommended during her visit that the government adopt measures “as if Covid-19 were already circulating”, but stopped short of publicly doubting the government’s virus-free boast. The hospital opened by Berdymukhamedov has a 200-bed capacity and can treat “viral hepatitis, infectious diseases of the upper respiratory tract … and diseases transmitted by airborne droplets,” Neutral Turkmenistan reported. The hospital’s equipment includes mechanical ventilators manufactured by the Swedish medical technology company group Getinge, according to the report. Family and friends of people living in care homes in England will get access to regular testing to allow them to visit their loved ones, the government has said. A pilot scheme will launch on Monday in 20 care homes across Hampshire, Devon and Cornwall. But the plan will be rolled out to other regions before Christmas, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. The tests – offered to one family member or friend for each resident – could put an end to “heartbreaking” restrictions on visits, when used in combination with other protective measures, such as PPE. The health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, said: I know how heartbreaking restricting visits to care homes has been, not only for residents – many of whom will feel disoriented and confused by the situation – but also their loved ones who aren’t able to simply hug each other to support them in this difficult time.” By respecting social distancing and staying at home as much as possible we will help reunite families and friends with loved ones in care homes as quickly as possible. Read more here: A group of religious leaders has launched a legal challenge against the decision to close churches for public worship in England and Wales during the second lockdown, PA reports. More than 100 church leaders are seeking a judicial review of the decision by the UK government to ban people from worshipping together in England. They are also challenging the Welsh government’s similar ban during its 17-day “firebreak” which ended earlier this month. The leaders claim the restrictions on public worship breach article 9 of the Human Rights Act on freedom to express religious beliefs. They also suggest the government failed to ascertain the extent to which leaving churches open for public collective worship would risk contributing to the spread of Covid-19. Pastor Ade Omooba, who is leading the legal challenge, said: We have been left with no alternative but to pursue a judicial review on this crucial issue and at this significant moment for the freedom to worship in church in this country. We call on the government to recognise the vital importance of church ministry and the principle of church autonomy from the state. The legal action follows the introduction on 5 November of the second lockdown, which prevents people gathering for public worship. Churches can still hold funerals, broadcast acts of worship and facilitate individual prayer. Before the second lockdown, more than 1,500 church leaders signed an open letter urging Boris Johnson not to go ahead with the gathering ban. Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali, a former bishop of Rochester, said: Church leaders recognise the seriousness of this pandemic, and that the government need to take the best scientific advice about the measures that are necessary to prevent the spread of the virus, especially to vulnerable groups. This task has to be held in tension with the ancient liberties of the church which have been won through hard struggle over the course of our history. These liberties include freedom of belief, expression and worship. The principle of the freedom of worship needs to be maintained and churches have been assiduous in maintaining safety in buildings and among worshippers. There is widespread unease among many church leaders about the lack of evidence and consultation regarding the ban on collective worship. Church leaders see collective worship, not as an optional extra, but as vital to the mental and spiritual health of believers, especially for the lonely and vulnerable. Like its neighbour Russia, Ukraine has also registered a record rise in Covid infections. Maksym Stepanov, its health minister, announced 12,524 cases in the past 24 hours, up from 11,787 reported on Friday. Stepanov also revealed on Saturday he had tested positive for Covid-19 “despite being careful and following all safety rules”. He said the new cases had taken the total number of confirmed infections to 525,176, with 9,508 deaths. “This is a war, every day the virus takes the lives of Ukrainians,” Stepanov told a televised briefing. The daily infection tally began rising in September, leading the government to decide to impose a national lockdown at weekends to try to curb the spread of the virus. But authorities in some cities have said they would ignore the government’s order as they seek to avoid worsening the economic situation in the regions. The prime minister, Denys Shmygal, said on Friday the government decision was binding, and Stepanov said the measures could help to preserve the country’s medical system. News about the development of a potential vaccine should not make people complacent about the continuing spread of the virus in England, as the country enters a crucial fortnight, a government adviser has said. Prof Susan Michie, part of the Covid-19 behavioural science team, a sub-group of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the next two weeks would be “very challenging”. Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, she said: “I think the next two weeks is going to be absolutely crucial. Partly because of the weather, partly because I think the promise of a vaccine may be making people feel complacent.” She warned: “The vaccine is very unlikely to come in until the end of the year, or beginning of next year. And that’s going to make no difference to the current second wave.” In a plea to the public, she added: Everybody has to really get all their resolve together to really pay attention to resisting any urges to break the rules on distancing, on visiting households; really pay attention to keeping indoor spaces ventilated, keeping surfaces and hands disinfected. Because that will maximise the chance that on 2 December, we’re in a position where we don’t have to continue the lockdown and, better still, to be in a position where they can spend Christmas and winter holiday times with loved ones rather than being isolated. One thing that is quite hopeful, is if you look at the data for Wales, and for Northern Ireland, in both cases really severe restrictions actually has brought the transmissions down. Now whether that will continue is another question. Russia has reported a record daily number of 22,702 new coronavirus infections, taking the national tally to 1,903,253. The authorities also reported 391 coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the official death toll to 32,834. The daily increase in deaths is slightly down on the 439 fatalities announced on Friday. This is Matthew Weaver taking on the global coronavirus blog from London. If you have any tips about the pandemic in your part of the world, please let me know: matthew.weaver@theguardian.com. A new circus company in the Czech capital that was eager to perform is doing five-minute shows on a stage behind a window, Associated Press reports. With all of Prague’s theatres shut down due to the coronavirus pandemic, La Putyka Circus adapted a practice that restaurants are using to stay in business. The circus invited spectators to watch its acts through a street-side “window of culture”, mimicking the takeaway windows some eateries opened while they were prohibited from serving customers at tables. The troupe did 10 performances on Tuesday and another 10 on Wednesday, each an original that differed from the others. Jugglers, acrobats and other company members remained inside the theatre, with a wall separating them from their audience. “This performance is for people addicted to live culture,” La Putyka’s director, Rosta Novak, said. “So they can get their dose of live culture, and then they can go back to their big cities, homes or jobs.” Confirmed coronavirus infections in the Czech Republic rose for over two months to record levels, but the numbers have started declining again. The health minister is expected to seek an extension of the state of emergency that enables the government to keep its public health measures in place. Public gatherings of more than two people are banned in the Czech Republic, if they are not family members. Along with theatres and restaurants, schools and many other venues are closed to contain the recent surge in reported infections. The rise in the youth unemployment rate caused by the coronavirus pandemic is terrible news for Britain’s young adults – and could have a lifelong impact on their financial security, wiping out a large portion of their pension benefits. Figures prepared exclusively for Guardian Money reveal how only a few years outside the workforce can have a dramatic effect on a person’s chances of building up a pension. Read more here: In case you missed it, this is the lay of the land around Europe (with a sprinkling of New York) from earlier today. We mentioned earlier that the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison had changed his travel itinerary next week, but still planned on heading to Japan. Perhaps he should stop in here for a bowl of ramen? I’ve seen a few people make this point, but it is incredibly stark: News broke earlier about North Dakota’s governor issuing a mandate for strict new Covid-19 restrictions in the state. Oregon’s governor made similar orders today, as case numbers in the United States continue to surge. It’s been a muted start to Diwali celebrations in India, with smog and Covid-19 combining to keep locals at home. OK, this might be a few days old, but it’s still a wonderful read and provides a great insight into the state of play in the UK, and what could be to come: Not strictly Covid-19 related (though everything sort of has something to do with the pandemic yes?) but there is expected to be clashes in Washington DC on Saturday (US time). Trump supporters will be voicing their concerns about the election result, and counter protestors are vowing to meet them head on. More here from the Washington Post. Here is how Western Australia’s daily newspaper marked the reopening of the state’s borders: Here’s what the prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, released on Thursday regarding those travel plans, which changed today at the request of Papua New Guinea: Next week I will hold important meetings with two of Australia’s closest friends in Tokyo on 17-18 November, and Port Moresby on 18-19 November. This will be my first meeting with the new Prime Minister of Japan, His Excellency Mr Suga Yoshihide. I’m honoured to be the first foreign leader to visit Japan to meet with Prime Minister Suga following his appointment. Our relationship with Japan over the past few years has gone from strength to strength. We are Special Strategic Partners, and we work closely together on trade, security, defence and technology issues. I look forward to continuing to deepen that partnership. Japan will play an important role in our economic recovery from Covid-19. I hope we can chart a course for the reopening of travel, and discuss ways to deepen our trade ties worth $86 billion, including under the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement. On the way back to Australia I plan to take the opportunity to see my friend the Hon James Marape MP, Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, our closest neighbour. We will continue our discussions about advancing our many shared regional and global objectives, ahead of a formal bilateral visit I hope to make next year. Australia, Japan and Papua New Guinea have managed the coronavirus incredibly well, and I am confident the precautions in place during this travel will minimise the risk of Covid-19 transmission. I will be strictly following health advice and quarantine requirements when I return to Australia, as will staff and officials accompanying me, RAAF attendants and pilots, and media. I look forward to hearing from Prime Minister Suga and Prime Minister Marape about their experiences in responding to Covid-19 and discussing ways to work together towards a stable, peaceful and resilient Indo-Pacific.” Australian prime minister Scott Morrison’s first trip overseas during the pandemic has been changed slightly, after political strife in Papua New Guinea led to him cancelling that leg of the trip. The PM was contacted by his PNG counterpart, James Marape, earlier today and asked to delay the trip, according to multiple reports. Marape had come under fire from the opposition, who felt the Morrison visit had been designed as a distraction from domestic issues. Morrison was still expected to travel to Japan next week. The governor of North Dakota, which now has one of the worst rates of coronavirus cases of any US state, has issued a mandate regarding mask wearing and dining restrictions. The decision is a significant reversal from Doug Burgum, who had resisted pressure for such a mandate for several weeks, according to reporters from the New York Times. “Our doctors and nurses heroically working on the front lines need our help and they need it now,” Burgum said in a statement. That’s all from me. Handing over now to my colleague Nino Bucci who’ll guide you through the next few hours of our live coronavirus coverage. Stay safe. Wash your hands and don’t touch your face. More than 300 people drove across the border into Western Australia on the first morning after the state’s hard border closure was lifted. About 1,300 people were also expected to arrive at Perth airport on Saturday on 11 flights after the seven-month border lockout was lifted at midnight on Friday. AAP reports that by mid-morning, 205 people had crossed into WA from South Australia at Eucla and 97 had travelled through Kununurra from the Northern Territory. People from NSW and Victoria will have to self-quarantine for 14 days and have a coronavirus test on day 11. But AAP reported all travellers will be asked to complete an online declaration and will be screened, including a temperature check, when they arrive. So far about 3,000 people have applied online to return to WA since the system went live late on Friday night. The police assistant commissioner, Paul Steel, said the processes were needed to keep Covid-19 at bay. Don’t expect that you can just get off an aircraft and walk through. This is the new Covid normal. This is what we are doing to keep our community safe. We make no apologies for that because the state expects that their authorities will be doing what they can to keep Covid out. We’ll be as efficient and effective as we can. WA has been closed to the rest of the nation for seven months, including to West Australians who were denied entry for compassionate reasons. The quarantine rules for NSW and Victoria will only be removed once they go at least 28 days with no community spread, as all other jurisdictions have achieved. Germany’s Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases has reported 22,461 new cases on Saturday morning, with 178 more deaths. Reuters reports the tally puts Germany’s number of confirmed cases at 775,556 with 12,378 deaths. Saturday’s daily increase is slightly lower than the record 23,542 cases reported on Friday – the highest number of cases reported in the European country since the start of the pandemic. The country is in a partial lockdown that could be extended, with Christmas markets, traditional parades and carnival season all cancelled, while more than 300,000 school pupils are in quarantine along with about 30,000 teachers. The prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison, has been taking part in a virtual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) from the cabinet room in Canberra. Morrison said on Friday he would be discussing Australia’s role in the regional recovery from Covid-19 at the summit, and at a virtual East Asia Summit also taking place today. Queensland has reported two new cases of coronavirus – both detected in people currently in hotel quarantine. The premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said both infections were acquired overseas. The New York attorney general, Letitia James, has said she will sue if US president Donald Trump carries through with a veiled threat to withhold distribution of any coronavirus vaccines from the state. You can read more on this at the Guardian’s just closed US politics live blog: In Sydney, two police officers were hurt and three people were arrested after officers broke up a party in a unit earlier this morning that broke the state’s coronavirus rules. Daily infections of Covid-19 in South Korea are starting to creep higher and have gone above 200 for the first time since September, Reuters is reporting. The country also introduced fines for people not wearing masks in public places on Friday as it reported 205 new cases, with 166 of those being caught domestically. People caught without masks in public venues, including nightclubs, malls, theme parks and hair salons, face fines of up to 100,000 won (US$90, A$124), while the operators of those places could pay up to 3 million won in fines. Mexico and China have both just reported their latest case numbers of the coronavirus. Reuters reports that Mexico’s health ministry confirmed that Friday saw 568 coronavirus deaths, bringing the country’s total to 97,624. There were 5,558 new cases, pushing the official total to 997,393 cases. Health officials there have said previously the actual numbers are likely much higher. AP has reported that Mexico City will order bars closed for two weeks after the number of people hospitalised for coronavirus rose to levels not seen since August. Mainland China reported 18 new cases for 13 November, up from eight cases a day earlier, the country’s national health authority reported on Saturday. All new cases had originated overseas. The total of confirmed cases in mainland China stands at 86,325, and the death toll is unchanged at 4,634. Victoria has reported its 15th consecutive day with no new cases of coronavirus and no deaths. But it is always worth remembering just how bad things were in Victoria not too long ago. On 4 August the state recorded 687 new cases and three days later there were 6,767 active infections. A month ago, on 14 October, there were 123 active cases in the state. Now there are three active cases. AAP reports comments made earlier today by the state’s health minister, Martin Foley, who said said the health department had removed 515 cases from its tally of mystery cases after establishing links to known infections. He said: As case numbers have come down over the past few weeks, the DHHS ... has created and tested an algorithm that has identified some additional 515 historical cases that are connected to close contacts, or established outbreak. The deputy chief health officer, Allen Cheng, said the reclassified cases are mainly from July and August. He said: It’s important to correct the record so that we can analyse the data correctly, and make sure we have learnings for next time. Cheng said the state’s run of zero cases was “about as good as it can get”. Victoria’s death toll from the virus stands at 819, with the national figure at 907. A little more on the update from NSW, where no new cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours but four new cases have been recorded in people in hotel quarantine. Health authorities in the state test sewage outflows for virus traces, and tests from Wednesday turned out positive for the Rouse Hill area that is a catchment for 120,000 people. So anyone living in the areas listed here and showing any symptoms at all are being asked by NSW Health to get tested. Quakers Hill, Castle Hill, Annangrove, Kellyville, Box Hill, Kenthurst, Glenhaven, The Ponds, Rouse Hill, North Kellyville, Kellyville Ridge, Beaumont Hills, Stanhope Gardens, Baulkham Hills, Glenwood, Bella Vista, Parklea, Acacia Gardens and Norwest. Australia’s ABC has reporters talking to people who are crossing the Western Australia border that opened at midnight on Friday after being shut for seven months. There are two main road checkpoints where people are moving through to work, see friends and be reunited with family. The Victoria Highway takes people from the Northern Territory to WA in the north, and the Eyre Highway crosses the South Australia border in the south. In the north, a police officer a few minutes ago told the ABC that 46 people had crossed since midnight. In the south, about 35 people were waiting at the border for the restrictions to lift at midnight, the ABC reported. One driver at the South Australia checkpoint said he was heading to meet his new grandson, who he had never met because of the border closure. Any arrivals into WA from people who have been in NSW or Victoria will have to self-quarantine for 14 days. Good morning, afternoon or evening. Graham Readfearn here in Australia taking you through the next several hours of live coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic. It has been a grim 24 hours globally, with more than 666,000 cases recorded in one day. That stands in sharp relief when writing here from Australia where restrictions are being lifted and community transmission appears under control. All seven new cases reported on Friday were overseas arrivals. Here’s a summary of where things are at: According to Johns Hopkins University, the world had its worst day of the pandemic with 11,617 more people dead and more than 666,000 new cases recorded in 24 hours. Western Australia opened its border at midnight, with cars streaming in. Arrivals from New South Wales and Victoria will need to self-quarantine for 14 days, but people from other states can enter freely. Some 455 people who arrived on flights from New Zealand since 5 November are being contacted by health authorities in NSW after concerns of a mystery case in Auckland. Victoria on Saturday recorded its 15th consecutive day with no new cases or deaths. NSW also recorded no local cases on Saturday. Donald Trump gave his first press conference since losing the US election, saying his administration would not order a lockdown despite rising infection rates and more than 100,000 new cases being recorded daily for the past seven days. The pandemic has killed more than 240,000 people in the US. Trump said a vaccine would ship in a few weeks to vulnerable people. Governors in Oregon and New Mexico ordered partial lockdowns. Liverpool FC’s talisman striker Mohamed Salah has tested positive for coronavirus. Stay with us and stay safe."

          "headline": "Streaming platforms aren't helping musicians – and things are only getting worse",
          "bodyText": "When I worked as an artist manager, there was one nerve-wracking question I was asked repeatedly: “Should I tweet this?” It wasn’t just from unhappy musicians. It came from disillusioned label managers, miffed agents and even the odd publicist, and the subject matter of the Tweet was always the same: a firm critique of streaming platforms and the damage they are doing to the career of musicians and the industry. It’s a risky public statement to make, given all of the above need streaming platforms to support their music. And after much deliberation, the answer was often, “Don’t tweet.” Don’t bite the hand that feeds you. Now isn’t the time to rock the boat. But as the pandemic ravages the music industry, and services like Spotify are on an aggressive campaign away from music and towards a broader “audio first” policy (think podcast and other audio streaming services), it seems like now is the time to speak up. Concerns around streaming economies have been simmering for some time, but it took the pandemic to bring them to the forefront. Previously profitable musicians have been hit hard with an abrupt halt to touring and the associated income. And with little hope of live music as we knew it returning until a vaccine, attention has turned to streaming, with many asking how it got so bad. Is it true that to earn USD$15 per hour a month, you would need to have around 700,000 streams monthly? Do major labels really sign catalogue deals with streaming platforms in secrecy? Are the bulk of user paid subscriptions fees on streaming platforms really going to popular musicians who a user might never listen to? The answer is to all of this is yes. Just last week Spotify announced it was cutting royalty rates for songs in exchange for an algorithm boost on the platform – a move that quickly provoked the ire of musicians already struggling to see how their streaming income will cover bills. This follows Spotify’s 2020 pivot away from music to radio and podcasts over the last few years, with the USD$100m purchase of podcast studio Gimlet Media, the acquisition of controversial and popular Joe Rogan Show, the USD$235m purchase of podcast ad platform Megaphone and, just last week, the trial of a new breakfast radio show format. In the meantime, musicians who are still able to gig are pushing themselves to the limits in order to barely break even, and being forced to seek other revenue streams at the same time. It’s easy for an artist like Beyonce to sign lucrative partnerships, but mid-level musicians need direct investment from their fans. This week in Australia, a new platform called Serenade launched, aiming to connect artists with fans who are willing to pay $100-500 for a personal performance. Artists urgently need to find new ways to reconnect with their fans – and the streaming giants are offering little hope. If you know anyone who runs their own business, they’re likely wondering if they can keep it going through the pandemic. Your favourite musician is probably wondering the same. Without a massive shift from the current model of streaming to a more favourable “user-centric” streaming pay rate, in which a user’s subscription money only goes to the artists streamed by that user, there is little hope that many musicians will be able to carry on without live income. There has been increased use of platforms like Bandcamp, which offer more favourable terms for artists, but without a bigger shift away from Spotify and Apple Music the prognosis is still the same. The last few months have seen a boom in advocacy groups aiming to empower the music industry or disassemble the current streaming economies, such as the #BrokenRecord and Keep Music Alive campaigns in the UK, the Australian Live Music Business Council and Justice at Spotify in the US. None of this should be a surprise. The alarm has been sounding about the lopsided economics of streaming for so long that it has become white noise. Streaming rates are opaque to say the least, but as some research has pointed out, platforms like Spotify have seen rates dropping year on year – and with more and more artists joining the platform this is only expected to get worse. If we’re to turn the economics of streaming back in favour of musicians, it will take a lot of noise – a lot of tweets. And it’s a lot to ask of musicians to lead the charge themselves. Recent UK government-led investigations into streaming economies are a promising start – but what can fans do? Perhaps they can find more meaningful ways to support their favourite bands: buying a t-shirt, joining a Patreon, donating while watching a livestream. And maybe they can join a campaign to change the industry – or send out that tweet themselves. • Evet Jean is an Australian-based music industry consultant, whose management clients have included multiple ARIA-award winning musicians, songwriters and producers."

          "headline": "What has Dominic Cummings actually achieved in No 10?",
          "bodyText": "Dominic Cummings arrived in Downing Street with big plans, and the stated intention to only stay long enough to get them rolling. So what has Boris Johnson’s chief adviser and policy touchstone actually achieved? Reforming the civil service Perhaps Cummings’ most resonant quote from No 10 – albeit delivered at second hand – was the idea of a “hard rain” landing on complacent civil servants. Revolutionising a hugely complex organisation of more than 400,000 people was never going to be simple, especially within a year of a pandemic. The main changes have been at the top, with a series of permanent secretaries – the lead official in a department – being ousted, along with Mark Sedwill, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. Verdict: not achieved. Centralising authority in Downing Street Many of the Conservative MPs who cheered the news of Cummings’ departure in the hope it will result in a more open No 10 would certainly agree this has happened. Much of the tighter grip has been based on centralising advisers, all of whom had to report to Cummings, an innovation that led to Sajid Javid resignation as chancellor. Given this revamped operation has presided over a series of mishaps and U-turns, whether it can be deemed a success, or will last, is another matter. Verdict: yes, but at a cost – and could be reversed by a successor. A data-led government Another obsession of Cummings, who – while a history graduate – is known for lamenting the grip of dilettante generalists on government. In an unusual recruitment drive, Cummings used his personal blog in January to appeal for data scientists and other “assorted weirdos” to sign up. Government data is yet another area brought into No 10 under Cummings, and in July it advertised for a data expert to set up a largely autonomous data “skunkworks”. Verdict: some change achieved. Finalise Brexit As one of several Vote Leave veterans inside No 10, Cummings had arguably less direct impact here than in other areas, instead being more part of a consensus. It is fair to say that his presence helped keep Johnson’s feet to the fire in terms of threatening Brussels over a UK walkout without concessions on a trade deal from the EU, even if the PM’s allies argue this would have happened anyway. Could Cummings’ departure see Johnson again achieve a deal by suddenly giving ground but nonetheless claiming a great victory? Perhaps – but then again, this might have happened anyway. Verdict: he has played a role in the UK’s tough Brexit stance Operation Moonshot Allies of Cummings say that the main reason he is staying at No 10 until Christmas is to oversee the rollout of mass coronavirus testing, based around innovative and near-instant tests. The most ambitious iteration of this would see millions of daily tests, meaning that even before the mass rollout of a vaccine, people could be certified Covid-free before going to work, or mass events such as at sports stadiums. A first try-out, in Salford, was some way from being a success, but ministers are more bullish about the new version, kicking off in Liverpool. Verdict: needs work – and could be overtaken by a vaccine. Planning reforms While successive government have talked up the need to liberate planning processes so more homes can be built, they have generally done little. Cummings’ experience illustrates why. A planned change to the system, based on an algorithm to allocate new homes to certain areas, has prompted open revolt among many Tory MPs, who argue the scheme is overly blunt and will dump large numbers of badly-built homes in the wrong places. Nimbyism is ubiquitous in planning matters, but the Cummings proposal has prompted genuine anger, and would very possibly struggle to get through parliament. Verdict: unlikely to happen, as it stands."

          "headline": "Felipe Neto: how a YouTuber became one of Jair Bolsonaro's loudest critics",
          "bodyText": "Felipe Neto is an irreverent YouTuber with 40 million followers on his channel where he plays computer games, pokes fun at celebrities and riffs on social media trends. With another 25 million followers on Instagram and Twitter, he is one of the biggest names on Brazil’s boisterous internet. And – when he is not goofing around – he is one of the loudest critics of the country’s far-right president. Jair Bolsonaro has presided over a disastrous Covid-19 response that has left more than 162,000 Brazilians dead; he has celebrated Brazil’s brutal dictatorship and weakened environmental protections while the Amazon burned. And while many Brazilian celebrities have kept quiet, Neto has only become more outspoken. Neto called Bolsonaro “the worst Covid president in the world” in a New York Times video, and was recently featured in Time magazine’s 100 Most Influential People of 2020 list. (The only other Brazilian included was Bolsonaro.) “Brazil today is like a house on fire. Some residents support the fire and others simply refuse to grab the fire extinguisher because they think it’s very heavy, it’s too much work, it’s a waste of time, they’ll lose opportunities,” said Neto in a video interview. He kept up the criticisms in a two-hour conversation, barely pausing for breath as he described the “ignoble, repulsive figure of Jair Bolsonaro, with all his boorish and violent way of being”. Such outspokenness has come at a cost: earlier this year Neto was targeted in a vicious fake news campaign that falsely associated him with paedophilia. For weeks, thousands of slanderous videos were uploaded daily to Facebook and Instagram, even as the social media companies rushed to take them down. After he and his family received death threats, Neto strengthened his security team and sent his mother abroad. Eventually, the deluge of defamation stopped. “They realised it hadn’t worked … that the population hadn’t turned against me,” Neto said. But that wasn’t the end of his problems. On 5 November, after an intervention by the justice ministry, police in Rio de Janeiro recommended charges against Neto for “corruption of minors”. Police said this was for “releasing material improper for children and teenagers on his YouTube channel and not limiting the age range of videos with language and content inappropriate for minors”. Neto said the videos involved were made before YouTube introduced age restrictions, and that he has long flagged those unsuitable for younger viewers. The Brazilian Press Association described the case as an example of “intimidation and political persecution” and prosecutors in Rio have yet to decide if they will take the case to court. “It’s just one of the many attempts at persecution and silencing practiced by the extreme right,” said Neto, who believes that he attacks are part of an organized campaign against critics of Bolsonaro. Brazil’s supreme court has launched two investigations directly linked to a so-called “Hate Cabinet” at presidential HQ that allegedly coordinates attacks on opponents. (Bolsonaro denies that any such group exists.) “This is articulated, it’s coordinated, and this is tragic,” said Neto. There is little in Neto’s past to suggest he would become such a high-profile thorn in the side for Brazil’s president. He grew up in a blue-collar neighbourhood of Rio, the son of a psychologist and a secretary. After school, he studied theatre and worked as a graphic designer, before trying his luck online. Inspired by US YouTubers, he put on sunglasses, grabbed a camera and started recording awkward, amateurish videos about his life, commenting on the Twilight series, trips to a shopping mall and even a Las Vegas nightclub. People tuned in. And over 10 years, Felipe, and his half-brother Lucas Neto, who makes videos for children, became some of Brazil’s most famous entertainers. The experience has made Neto an expert on the internet’s role in politics and daily life. “The algorithm is fed by us human beings,” he said. “The algorithm gives us back what we want.” Facts, reality, science – all the dry subjects that human beings have based their understanding of the world on – are too dull for many people, he said. Conspiracy theories, such as Flat Earth or QAnon, bring a deluded sense of belonging to those who follow them and are more entertaining, he said. “It’s our hunger for conspiracy, our desire to hear and share lies. Because life is very boring when it’s only based on truth,” he said. “Humanity is heading for destruction if the algorithms are not regulated somehow.” And Bolsonaro’s supporters “get stronger with lies, with radicalisation, and the use of algorithms to brainwash the population. If it wasn’t for this, Bolsonarism wouldn’t exist,” he said. Neto said he has no plans to enter politics. But he has advice for Brazilian progressives hoping to defeat Bolsonaro in 2022’s elections: understand how Bolsonaro’s folksy style connects with voters, stop Lula’s Workers’ party believing it has to dominate the left and learn how to communicate. “It’s easy to become a reactionary, to live in this fairytale in which you think you are in a war of good against evil,” he said. “Where are the communications specialists guiding opposition leaders in Brazil?”"

          "headline": "Missionaries by Phil Klay review – wrenching and wise",
          "bodyText": "Suffering trauma, boredom and shame from covering over-optimistic US military involvements in Afghanistan and Iraq, American reporter Lisette Marigny whimsically asks a search engine: “Are there any wars right now that we’re not losing?” The algorithm claims the answer to be “Colombia”, where, in 2015, US troops are supporting a national rebuilding and peace process after half a century of intersecting civil wars between government forces, terrorists, revolutionaries and drug barons. Lisette contrives an assignment there, intersecting with Major Mason Baumer, a Marine medic who, haunted by catastrophic casualties he saw in the same wars that unnerved the journalist, has taken what he hopes will be a more constructive posting as a special forces liaison officer at the Bogotá embassy. Klay, a Marine veteran, wrote about men at war in his award-winning 2014 short story collection Redeployment, the awful authenticity of which is also evident in Missionaries, his debut novel. Many details feel memoir-real, either experienced or observed: a ruined school still bears a sign boasting that it was donated by the United Nations; a humanitarian group called Clowns Without Borders seeks to cheer up war-zone children. Phone calls from tours of duty are agonisingly stilted because military advice to service personnel is to say nothing of the conflict, while loved ones have been warned not to burden them with domestic dismay. If the book were a movie, it would have an 18 certificate for the battlefield scenes alone. Enemy explosives and bullets, Mason tells us, often target the intestines because of the double indignity of a dying body losing blood and shit. Some guerrilla weapons contain chemicals mixed with faeces, so that burns or wounds become rapidly infected. This excretory imagery embodies the book’s depiction of humanity turned inside out in conflict. While Mason’s experiences are close to what Klay has known and described in Redeployment, the novel also advances into more distant gender and geographical territory than his briefer fictions, presenting (mainly in the first person) the perspectives not only of Lisette, but Abel, a poor Venezuelan; Juan Pablo, a rich Colombian; and Diego, a Chilean mercenary. In the current debate over the scope and ownership of fiction, Missionaries makes a strong case for expansive imagination of other lives. In this effort, Klay may have taken courage from his main fictional model. Identifying as a Catholic novelist, in writing fiction set in foreign war zones he makes a second genuflection to Graham Greene. Both Lisette and Mason fear, like Greene’s Querry in A Burnt-Out Case (1960), that they have lost the ability to feel, and must seek it in new experience, although Klay makes this torpor of the senses grimly broader. Lisette becomes convinced that her war reports have little impact in her homeland because “no matter how jaded I’ve become, I’ll never be as jaded as the average American”. Missionaries also includes a character, rare outside Greene, who believes that humans bear the curse of “original sin”, while the writer of The Heart of the Matter might be tempted to the sin of envy by the doleful local atmospherics – “a city after a bombing is like coming upon the decayed body of an animal in the woods” – and would surely have loved a scene in which a character confesses to a priest all the people he has killed but is told that he is absolved by God because the brutality was done for his country. Klay’s novel has the feel of a knowing coda to American fiction of the Vietnam war, such as Robert Stone’s Dog Soldiers (1974), Tim O’Brien’s The Things They Carried (1990), and Karl Marlantes’s Matterhorn (2010). In the book’s biggest US-set scene, Lisette visits her Uncle Carey, a Vietnam veteran who has never recovered from his missions there; we guess that his niece, in searching for a “good war”, is attempting to redeem both him and her nation. But while the Americans in Missionaries want to be involved in a success story overseas, readers will bet that this dream will be hard to achieve. In a pivotal passage, Lisette reflects that all the US’s post-Vietnam military adventures – Iraq, Afghanistan, the Philippines, Colombia – are, in fact, “the same war … related to the demands of America’s not-quite empire”. That is one of the places where the novel contains more insight into the theory and practice of war and politics than many hefty histories. Mason’s American creed that “you must accept that the true will of the people aligns with whatever the central government believes” is challenged by a South American reality in which ideological loyalties can be bewilderingly fractured. The novel’s structure subtly reflects this: the perspective of the first section is divided between two characters; the second alternates a different pair; and the third, after a shocking thriller plot twist, shuffles the voices with desperate momentum. As the available storytellers are cruelly reduced, the choice of the last speaker feels true to the meaning of the story. In an Afterword, Klay alludes to the difficulty in stretching from stories to novels. But this sweeping, searing, wrenching and wise addition to the great literature of America’s postwar imperialism ends absolutely as mission accomplished. • Missionaries is published by Canongate (£16.99).

          "bodyText": "As with many others in Britain, lockdown hit Rachel and her husband, Philip, hard. Almost overnight, the couple, both in their early 50s, found themselves cut off from friends, family and colleagues. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, they had both been working every day; now Philip found himself furloughed, while Rachel was put on rotation with other essential staff, working fewer shifts at odd hours. They were unable to meet up with their four adult sons and daughters. They had to attend a family funeral while remaining socially distanced. Initially, Rachel coped in the way many others did. She played more video games than normal, and felt stressed at work, but as far as possible she managed. Her husband didn’t. For him, it seemed there must be more to it than the authorities struggling to cope with a novel virus and evolving expert advice. “The regularly changing and conflicting information that was coming from the government added to the feeling in him that they were making things up or covering something up,” Rachel says now. Initially, Philip and Rachel (their names have been changed for this article) discussed his fears, but as lockdown went on, their conversations stopped. Philip was frustrated that Rachel wasn’t taking his concerns seriously: someone had to be benefiting from the situation, he insisted, and events such as Dominic Cummings’ Barnard Castle “eye test” only increased his belief that “they” knew the pandemic was fake, and the nation was being kept indoors for a more sinister purpose. Philip began to research what this sinister purpose might be. That, Rachel says, is what led him to QAnon. It’s hard to describe the movement that Philip fell into. QAnon has its roots in the “pizzagate” conspiracy, which emerged four years ago after users poring over hacked Democratic party emails on the message board 4chan said that, if you replaced the word “pizza” with “little girl”, it looked as if they were discussing eating children. That claim – whether it was made in jest or sincerity is impossible to tell – spiralled into allegations of a vast paedophilic conspiracy centred on Comet Pizza, a restaurant in Washington DC. A year later, a 4chan user with the handle “Q Clearance Patriot” appeared, claiming to be a government insider tasked with sharing “crumbs” of intel about Donald Trump’s planned counter-coup against the deep state forces frustrating his presidency. As Q’s following grew, the movement became known as the Storm – as in, “the calm before …” – and then QAnon, after its founder and prophet. At that point, QAnon was a relatively understandable conspiracy theory: it had a clear set of beliefs rooted in support for Trump and in the increasingly cryptic posts attributed to Q (by then widely believed to be a group of people posting under one name). Now, though, it’s less clearcut. There’s no one set of beliefs that define a QAnon adherent. Most will claim some form of mass paedophilic conspiracy; some, particularly in the US, continue to focus on Trump’s supposed fightback. But the web of beliefs has become all-encompassing. One fan-produced map of all the “revelations” linked to the group includes references to Julius Caesar, Atlantis and the pharaohs of Egypt in one corner, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and 5G in another, the knights of Malta in a third, and the Fukushima meltdown in a fourth – all tied together with a generous helping of antisemitism, from the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to hatred of George Soros. QAnon isn’t one conspiracy theory any more: it’s all of them at once. In September, BuzzFeed News made the stylistic decision to refer to the movement as a “collective delusion”. “There’s more to the convoluted entity than the average reader might realise,” wrote BuzzFeed’s Drusilla Moorhouse and Emerson Malone. “But delusion does illustrate the reality better than conspiracy theory does. We are discussing a mass of people who subscribe to a shared set of values and debunked ideas, which inform their beliefs and actions.” At first, QAnon was a largely US phenomenon, with limited penetration in the UK. The pandemic, however, has changed that. According to recent polling by Hope Not Hate, one in four people in Britain now agree with some of the basic conspiracies it has promulgated: that “secret satanic cults exist and include influential elites”, and that “elites in Hollywood, politics, the media” are secretly engaging in large-scale child trafficking and abuse. Nearly a third believe there is “a single group of people who secretly control events and rule the world together”, and almost a fifth say that Covid-19 was intentionally released as part of a “depopulation plan”. For Philip, trapped at home and searching for an explanation for a global pandemic, when all he could find was a void of information, QAnon was fertile territory. He already spent most of his time while furloughed on his phone looking for answers. What was the real reason for everyone being forced inside? How did the virus start? Who started it? “In his mind, there had to be a reason for it,” Rachel says. Inevitably, his search took in Facebook, where the site’s recommendation algorithms were quick to connect him to individuals on similar quests. “Ultimately, it led to him becoming brainwashed,” she says. For many, the existence of Facebook – and its sister products, including WhatsApp, Instagram and Messenger – has been a lifeline in this period. The social network has always prided itself on connecting people, and when the ability to socialise in person, or even leave the house, was curtailed, Facebook was there to pick up the slack. But those same services have also enabled the creation of what one professional factchecker calls a “perfect storm for misinformation”. And with real-life interaction suppressed to counter the spread of the virus, it’s easier than ever for people to fall deep down a rabbit hole of deception, where the endpoint may not simply be a decline in vaccination rates or the election of an unpleasant president, but the end of consensus reality as we know it. What happens when your basic understanding of the world is no longer the same as your neighbour’s? And can Facebook stop that fate coming to us all? * * * Since its foundation, in Mark Zuckerberg’s Harvard dorm room, Facebook has tackled its share of challenges. Some have stayed fairly constant: no social network gets many users without needing to tackle spam, for instance, though the Facebook of 2004 would struggle to remove the 3.3bn junk posts that the company took down in the first half of this year. Others are unique to a company with 2.7 billion users that operates in almost every country in the world. Facebook has become a centre point of civil society. It’s more than just a place to share photos and plan parties: it’s where people read news, arrange protests, engage in debate, play games and watch bands. And that means that all the problems of civil society are now problems for Facebook: bullying, sexual abuse, political polarisation and conspiracy theorists all existed before the social network, but all took on new contours as they moved online. And this year they really moved online. As the initial lockdown was imposed across much of the world, people’s relationship to the internet, and to Facebook in particular, evolved rapidly. Stuck socially distancing, people turned to social networking to fill an emotional void. Suddenly, the company found itself staring at unprecedented demands. “Our busiest time of the year is New Year’s Eve,” says Nicola Mendelsohn, Facebook’s vice-president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, over a Zoom call from her London home. “And we were seeing the equivalent of New Year’s Eve every single day.” It was, she says, the inevitable result of having “almost the entire planet at home at the same time”. Rachel agrees. “I believe the lockdown played a huge part in altering people’s perception of reality,” she says. When Covid restrictions came in, the rules of social interaction were rewritten. We suddenly stopped meeting friends in pubs, at the coffee point or by the school gates, and our lives moved online. And for many of us, “online” meant “on Facebook”. I first heard Rachel’s story from QAnonCasualties, a forum on the social news site Reddit where she, and thousands like her, have congregated to seek advice and support after their loved ones fell into the cult. Her first post, in July this year, was titled: “I’ve finally reached the end of my tether.” She described a marriage of 25 years, and a family with four grownup children, being shattered by a husband who had sunk “further and further into this conspiracy”. “It’s got the stage where I no longer understand him or even recognise him,” she wrote. Others echoed her story. Posts with titles such as “Grieving my dad while he’s still alive” and “Today I filed for divorce from my QAnon-obsessed husband” rub shoulders with pleas for help from those who still hope they can win loved ones back. Beyond the heartbreak and anguish on QAnonCasualties, there is a common thread: a feeling that their friends and relatives are inhabiting a different reality. “On all levels, from the old-school conspiracist who just wants to uncover corruption to the alien interdimensional vampire demon QAnon believer, they ignore reality and latch on to narratives that support their version of reality,” says Robert Johnson, one of the moderators of the board, adding that most of the recent posts are from people radicalised in lockdown. Early on in the pandemic, Facebook moved to make the most of the situation. As almost all of its 50,000 or so employees, as well as its army of contractors, were sent home, and Zuckerberg talked up the benefits of remote working, the company handed out grants to small businesses to help them switch to digital operation – $100m (£79m) globally, and another $100m in the US – and retooled its product offerings to take advantage of the new normal. But for all the work it put into smoothing the transition to lockdown life, Facebook also knew it had a problem brewing. The company’s never-ending battle with misinformation on its platforms was about to step into overdrive. For a long time, the company had resisted acting on the problem. Moderation is hard enough already: simply finding and removing every example of unambiguously banned content on Facebook is a huge task, with comparatively easy-to-automate searches for things such as adult content still throwing up dizzying numbers of edge cases and errors. When it came to tackling misinformation, Facebook had a stated philosophical objection. “As a principle, in a democracy, I believe people should decide what is credible, not tech companies,” Zuckerberg told an audience at Georgetown University last year. But the company was also motivated by the fact that misinformation isn’t as straightforward to identify as nudity, graphic violence or even hate speech. For one thing, there isn’t even a commonly accepted definition. It is a sibling of disinformation, which is the deliberate spreading of falsehoods. But the line between “misinformation” and simple “inaccuracies” is blurry. Generally, the focus is on the potential for harm. A rumour that, say, the Canadian emo pop star Avril Lavigne was secretly replaced by a body double in the late 2000s is probably untrue, but unlikely to qualify as misinformation. Conversely, a rumour that Trump died of Covid-19 in early October and has been secretly replaced by a body double almost certainly does. But wherever the line is drawn, the problem is the same: to find out if something is misinformation, you need to know the truth. Were Facebook to ban it directly, the company would effectively need to run an entire journalistic enterprise within its own moderation team. As a compromise, Facebook partnered with journalists in 2017. Around the world, independent factchecking organisations were given funding and tools to mark viral posts on Facebook as true or false (there are a number of other categories, including “satirical”, “altered” or “missing context”). If the posts were false, their reach – the extent to which the Facebook algorithm showed them to others – would be diminished, and users would have to click through a warning sign to read them. So far, the programme has been a mixed success. Reducing the reach of false content certainly helps: just a few months after it was launched, Facebook said a factcheck would lead to 80% fewer viewers of a piece of false content. But factcheckers have complained about the limits placed on them by the social network, ranging from restrictions on their ability to factcheck political adverts to a lack of feedback from Facebook about how much, or little, their work is actually helping. And that was before Covid hit. “We went early as a company in closing down globally,” says Mendelsohn. “You would class us as conservative in that respect, and we will be conservative coming out as well.” Now, six months on, Facebook has a skeleton team in some of its offices and datacentres, and employees coming in to work on the company’s augmented and virtual reality products, such as its Oculus headsets. But the bulk of its staff are still working from home, something that Zuckerberg has said is likely to continue well past the end of the crisis. Facebook’s moderation staff have been pulled off some of the most sensitive work, owing to data security concerns and fears for the employees’ own mental health. The soul-grinding task of scouring the platform for livestreamed suicides and videos of graphic violence has already led to a $52m settlement paid to more than 11,000 moderators in the US, and a lawsuit in Ireland over allegations of post-traumatic stress disorder, and that was when contractors were based in offices, with the support that brings. By early April, the company was having to bring its diminished resources to bear against some of the most viral misinformation it had ever seen. (The unfortunate double meaning of the world “viral” was noted by nearly everyone I interviewed for this piece, as was the cliched-yet-useful approach of modelling misinformation as something spreading like a disease.) “It became clear, very quickly, that there would be different approaches to how people would talk about, debate and discuss the issues of the virus,” Mendelsohn says. “And so we work through our harmful misinformation policy that we’ve had in place for about two and a half years now, where we have a very specific policy about taking down anything that could contribute to physical harm.” Of course, the company has a lot of leeway in how it defines “physical harm”. It had applied that to infectious diseases before. A measles outbreak in Samoa, for instance, saw a parallel outbreak in harmful untruths, which Facebook acted to limit. But for years, Facebook has argued that the harm caused by the broader anti-vaccination movement didn’t cross that threshold, and allowed the groups to flourish on the platform. In March 2019, it relented slightly, and banned anti-vax ads that include misinformation about vaccines; in October this year, it went further, and banned all anti-vax advertising, except for that with a political message. “Organic content” – posts and groups advocating against vaccines – is still allowed. With Covid-19, the company went even further, attempting to limit the misinformation while also filling in the “information voids” that led people such as Philip down their dark path. Links pinned at the top of feeds have taken more than 2 billion people, Mendelsohn says, to resources from health authorities around the world, detailing what is known about the virus. But those efforts can’t stop the tide. “There was just an explosion of interest in one singular topic, for very obvious reasons,” says Tom Phillips, the editor-in-chief of Full Fact, one of Facebook’s two UK factchecking partners. “In the UK, we generally see massive spikes of traffic around elections, and we had one at the end of 2019. The pandemic dwarfed that.” And matching that explosion in interest was an explosion in the supply of misinformation, much of it delivered by questionable sources. “The industries that many celebrities work in – film, music, sport – were among the hardest hit by shutdowns. So even more than most of us, they suddenly found themselves with nothing to do but sit on Twitter,” Phillips says. “Not all of them did a Taylor Swift, spending the time recording an album. Some of them started sharing wild rumours to millions of followers instead.” This, then, is how we end up with Ian Brown, the former frontman of the Stone Roses, declaring that conspiracy theorist is “a term invented by the lame stream media to discredit those who can smell and see through the government/media lies and propaganda”. Brown’s obsession with revealing the “truth” about coronavirus has spread from his social-media posts to his recorded music: the anti-mask, anti-vaccine Little Seed Big Tree, with lyrics including “Masonic lockdown, in your home town / Get behind your doors for the new world order” joins Van Morrison’s No More Lockdown (“No more taking of our freedom / And our God-given rights / Pretending it’s for our safety”) in the canon of hits championed by QAnon supporters. Where celebrities at least have a coterie of minders, publicists and agents begging them not to follow Brown and Morrison down this route, the rest of us had to rely on our friends and family, says QAnonCasualties’ Johnson. And then, suddenly, we couldn’t. “Some of these folk probably weren’t too into QAnon before the lockdown,” Johnson says. “They would have been shot down by co-workers when bringing it up.” Without that kind of reality check, they were able to fall further. Full Fact’s Phillips agrees. “Personal contact takes you out of the rabbit hole. You know, it can be a very direct, ‘No, mate, that’s nonsense,’ but it could also just be taking people away from the singular focus that conspiracy rabbit holes require. Just by introducing other topics of conversation.” Lockdown removed those opportunities for intervention at a stroke. And so, furloughed and stuck indoors, Rachel’s husband, Philip, sank deeper and deeper into the alternative reality that QAnon presented. Although Facebook had been the open end of the rabbit hole, it proved too restrictive for him: even the algorithmically mediated interactions with his friends and family were becoming hostile and argumentative, as they tried in vain to push back against the cult. He started new social media accounts, dedicated only to the conspiracy. When Rachel found one of those, and saw what it was sharing, she felt “physically sick”; she realised her husband hadn’t simply picked up a few odd beliefs, but joined a full-blown cult. “How do you talk to someone who has been brainwashed but who believes that it is you that is the brainwashed one,” she asked Reddit. In August, things hit rock bottom. Philip’s focus had grown from coronavirus-specific conspiracies to the wider web of evil posited by QAnon. His YouTube recommendations were no longer about mobile phones and cars; they were for clips putting forward conspiracy theories and fabrications. YouTube has historically been one of the most permissive of the major social media platforms, with few policies against misinformation: instead, the site puts links to Wikipedia pages underneath contentious videos (and deletes only the most egregiously false ones). But even YouTube’s filters started getting in the way, and so he switched again, to the video host BitChute, where “Fall of the Cabal”, a notorious QAnon video primer, shares space with content creators recounting lurid stories of having seen an infamous – yet entirely fictional – video of Hillary Clinton eating a young child alive, chasing a supposed high that can be gained from drinking the blood of a terrified child. In Philip’s eyes, Rachel was now an idiot, who believed mainstream media. “I became a ‘normie’ who needed to wake up and understand what was really going on,” she says. “He was unable to stick to one topic. If I said something about how we were struggling with social distancing at work, he would respond with a furious diatribe about Soros, Clinton, Bill Gates, 5G and vaccines that control and kill people.” For Rachel, the final straw was when her husband claimed to have seen a video incriminating a member of the Hollywood elite: a clip, he said, of Tom Hanks “with a three-year-old girl”. For Rachel, who works with safeguarded children, the implication was obscene. If her husband really had seen such a clip, then no matter how it was produced – Photoshopped, edited together – it must have started as real child abuse imagery. That a cult ostensibly focused on saving children could somehow persuade her husband to engage in sharing such material disgusted her. She started packing her bags the next morning. * * * By the time QAnon adherents are that far in the rabbit hole, the consensus on the QAnonCasualties board is that it’s hard to rescue them. It’s not easy to overturn someone’s sense of reality, but even harder to restore it once it has been lost. And so the focus is on preventing people from falling down the rabbit hole in the first place: tackling QAnon at the more acceptable end. In the UK, that largely means the “Save the Children” movement, not to be confused with the charity of the same name. One of its largest groups, Freedom for the Children UK (FFTCUK), was created in July by Laura Ward, 36, who told the BBC she had a “spiritual awakening” that motivated her to organise during the lockdown. By late August, the FFTCUK Facebook page had become large enough to organise a 500-strong rally in central London, campaigning to “raise the awareness of child exploitation and human trafficking”. Ward denied any links to QAnon, but the London rally – one of 200 nationwide that day – was full of QAnon-related slogans, from warnings that “pizzagate is real” to the catchphrase “Where we go one, we go all” (shortened to “WWG1WGA”). In October, Facebook announced a blanket ban on QAnon-related groups, after earlier trying to ban only those arms of the movement linked to violence. But that ban did not extend to groups such as FFTCUK, which remained on the site with more than 10,000 members. Joe Ondrak, of the factchecking site Logically, says the group’s denials don’t hold water. He cites the fact that members of the group openly talk about “adrenochrome harvesting” – the supposed high from drinking children’s blood. “While they don’t talk about Trump saving the world, the bedrock of their particular movement is based on one of QAnon’s many plotlines, rather than having any basis in reality,” Ondrak says. Shortly before this piece was published, Facebook finally took action to remove FFTCUK “for violating our dangerous individuals and organisations policy”. A spokesperson said: “In August, we expanded our dangerous individuals and organisations policy to address militarised social movements and violence-inducing conspiracy networks, such as QAnon. Since then, we’ve identified over 600 militarised social movements, removing about 2,400 pages, 14,200 groups and about 1,300 Instagram accounts they maintained, and in addition, we’ve removed about 1,700 pages, 5,600 groups and about 18,700 Instagram accounts representing QAnon.” The problem for Facebook is that the QAnon rabbit hole doesn’t work like other conspiracy theories. Rather than laying out the conspiracy, with a call to arms for believers, it instead offers a far more compelling instruction: “Do your research.” Adrian Hon, a game designer and founder of the developer Six to Start, describes the appeal as similar to that of an “alternate reality game”, or ARG. A relatively niche pursuit even in the geek circles where they flourish, ARGs can be thought of as large-scale communal puzzles, with clues and riddles often seeded across fake websites and real locations. They often involve the players working together to assemble evidence of a shadowy conspiracy, at a scale that no one person could hope to solve alone. The parallels, he feels, are obvious. “QAnon makes the act of ‘researching’ fun, and into a game. It is not a solitary effort where you are in your basement putting red string everywhere, and no one cares what you’re doing: you’re doing this in forums, on Facebook and WhatsApp. It is quite a social phenomenon.” QAnon is a group with coherent goals – ending child trafficking, or opposing Covid lockdowns – that prompt further questions. The adherents work together to uncover the truth beneath the surface, moving from mainstream sites to ever more esoteric communities, slowly getting sucked into the narrative they are both consuming and, ultimately, creating. “I know how people feel when they get into this,” Hon says. “It’s intoxicating and exciting to have all this information at your fingertips, and to be Googling things and checking websites.” That impulse doesn’t just pull in adherents. Those on the outside can find themselves equally intrigued by the complexity of QAnon-related beliefs. Abbie Richards, a graduate student of climate studies at Wageningen University &amp; Research in the Netherlands, found herself the target of QAnon-related attacks after she went viral on TikTok for, of all things, a video criticising golf courses. “You see all the comments in your videos, and I had one that was like: ‘Watch Fall of the Cabal, all 24 sections, and it’ll make sense,’” she says. “I was like, ‘You know what, I will!’” As she researched, what stood out was the ease with which the movement slid from things that were absolutely real to things that weren’t. In the eyes of the QAnon follower: “If Jeffrey Epstein’s death looks suspicious, then how can you deny that there’s a sex trafficking ring of people who drink blood?” Richards drew up a diagram, The Conspiracy Chart, exploring that slide in detail. At the bottom are things that actually happened – historical conspiracies such as the FBI’s Cointelpro operation, which aimed to destroy the civil rights movement in the 1960s. At the top, past “the antisemitic point of no return”, is the mesh of beliefs that characterise QAnon and its adherents. Initially posted on TikTok, the framework is a remarkably useful way of distinguishing between conspiracy theories, and the alternative realities that sit on top of them. (“God bless Abbie Richards,” says Full Fact’s Phillips, unprompted, when discussing the difficulty of defining QAnon.) But the chart also highlights, inadvertently, the difficulty of fighting the delusions head-on. As the conspiracies drift further away from the baseline of reality, the theorists are increasingly living in an altogether different world. In the sci-fi author Neal Stephenson’s 2019 novel Fall; or, Dodge in Hell, a tech guru launches a misinformation attack on the world, releasing a fake video showing the destruction by a nuclear weapon of the small Utah town of Moab. The attack is quickly revealed as a hoax, but it doesn’t matter: 20 years later, “remember Moab” bumper stickers plaster cars as a cold civil war simmers. The consensus reality has broken down. Stephenson’s book feels prescient in an age when QAnon is mobilising marches of thousands of people against mass child abductions that aid workers say have simply not taken place. And, surprisingly, some experts, such as Ruth Ahnert, a professor at Queen Mary University of London and fellow of the Alan Turing Institute, which conducts research into artificial intelligence and data science, think we have been here before. Ahnert acknowledges that Facebook and other social media platforms have changed the way we get information, but disputes that consensus reality is only now breaking down. “I think that idea is true only if you think of the movement from the 20th century to the 21st century, from broadcast media to social media. If you look in the longer history – back to the 16th century – you see something that looks like now.” She says that then, as now, the elites had access to fairly accurate information about the state of the world. “If you look at the really influential people, those people had huge reach. They were communicating across Europe, into north Africa, into South America, Ottoman empire, sub-Saharan Africa.” Think of Samuel Pepys, as administrator of the navy, able to request and receive a report on the local conditions from almost anywhere English ships sailed. “But normal people were probably not communicating much beyond their village,” Ahnert points out. And, in an era when people primarily get their news from social networks – as more than one in 10 British adults do, according to Ofcom – then all that has happened is the village has moved online. In that long view, the artificial world isn’t the one the internet and lockdown have created, but the temporary “blip” in time when broadcast media was able to forge one shared reality for a nation. “I wonder if it’s kind of come full circle in a way,” Ahnert says. “The more information we have access to, the less ability we have to tell what is authentic or not.” When I put Ahnert’s words to Facebook’s chief product officer, Chris Cox, he is, unsurprisingly, less pessimistic. “I don’t think we’re going back to the stone age here, but I do think, like with each medium, we go through a reckoning when it’s born; [a process] of understanding it and integrating it into our lives. Facebook was built in 2004, so I guess technically we’re still a teenager.” He points out that for Facebook, the work is continuing. “When we study groups, for example, we are able to study which of those are harmful and take a stand on them. And which of those are creating, at least at the individual level, a sense of deep belonging, fulfilling a deep need.” We aren’t fully living in an online village yet. The number of people who get their news from a large, trusted provider still vastly outweighs those who focus primarily on social media; three times as many British people say BBC One is their single most important news source as those who cite Facebook. But Facebook is in third place, just behind ITV, and its share is growing. “We take our responsibility very, very seriously,” says Facebook’s Mendelsohn. “It’s interesting to think about the history of misinformation, because it has been around for ever. It is in the nature of human beings.” Rachel has a more concrete suggestion for how to reverse the tide. “QAnon seems to turn people into angry, bitter, volatile people. Offering kindness, and reminding yourself of who they really are, helps. It is a mental health issue.” When she confronted her husband about the Hanks video, and started making preparations to leave, it shocked him back to reality. Philip came to her, saying he had deleted everything QAnon-related from his phone, as well as his social media accounts. “I do love you,” he said. It has been a long road to recovery. Philip admitted that he hadn’t seen the Hanks video, but a still image that was “definitely him”. Two days later, he and Rachel went shopping, and he wore a face covering for the first time, something he had previously insisted was just another example of how “they” were controlling the “sheep”. Since then, Rachel says, “we’ve racked up more than 1,000 miles in the car, driving all over England to visit beautiful, quiet places to walk and talked like there is no tomorrow. “I reminded him of how we laughed like drains when Trump was elected in 2016 and wondered if the US had lost its collective mind. He laughed and agreed. He still believes there might be a deep state or something sinister like that, but is now thinking more about questioning the motives of the people who are doing the pointing – not who they are pointing at. “I am glad I stuck my hand down the rabbit hole and hauled him out,” she says. “Although I suspect that I am going to be dusting the rabbit droppings off him for a long time.” • This article was amended on 11 November 2020. An earlier version said that Facebook had yet to extend its ban “to groups such as FFTCUK”. In fact, that group was banned on 10 November 2020, shortly before the article’s publication; the piece was updated to reflect this and a statement from Facebook added."

          "headline": "Trump's vote fraud claims go viral on social media despite curbs",
          "bodyText": "False or misleading claims of electoral fraud are going viral on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, even as the platforms continue to implement special measures aimed at reducing the spread of misinformation around the US presidential election. Major social media platforms are nominally cracking down on misinformation, prominently displaying election results or appending warning labels to posts by Donald Trump that seek to undermine the validity of the vote. According to social analytics platforms such as NewsWhip and CrowdTangle, however, claims about voting irregularities have become among the most-shared content on Facebook. The top three posts are all from Donald Trump, according to CrowdTangle: one alleges “Fake Votes” in Nevada, where Trump trails Joe Biden by 36,000 votes; another claims Georgia, where Trump trails by 13,000 votes pending a recount, will be a “big presidential win”; and a third says “a very large number of ballots” will be affected by “threshold identification”, the meaning of which is unclear. The top news stories on Facebook are also dominated by rightwing claims of “irregularities” and “fraud”, CrowdTangle data showed. Three of the top 10 posts are links from Trump to the far-right news site Breitbart, covering attorney general Bill Barr’s inquiry into “voting irregularities” and inquiries in Michigan and Georgia; a fourth is to rightwing site Newsmax, calling Pennsylvania’s situation a “constitutional travesty”. Joining Trump in the top 10 are two posts from Republican media personality Dan Bongino backing the idea that election fraud is to blame for Trump’s loss, and a report from Fox News quoting Trump’s campaign team saying they are “not backing down”. Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser for the Obama White House, attacked Facebook directly for its failings. “At this moment, Facebook is spreading disinformation that is destroying confidence in American democracy so its multi-billionaire CEO can make some more money off of clicks and ads,” he wrote on Twitter. “Increasingly hard to understand how people of good conscience work there.” The rightwing domination of Facebook’s platform is nothing new, but suggests that the company’s efforts to tamp down on misinformation following the election are starting to run out of steam. Once the election was called for Biden, the top performing posts briefly changed: where Bongino, for instance, had been in the top 10 for the previous 37 days, the top performing posts on 7 November were led by the New York Times, CNN and NPR; the day after, CNN and NPR between them occupied seven of the top 10 slots. That marked shift caused some, such as Mother Jones editor-in-chief Clara Jeffery, to wonder if Facebook had deliberately altered its algorithm to curry favour with the Biden administration. Others argued that it was more likely just a rare burst of activity from happy leftwing users on the site. Ryan Broderick, author of the Internet culture newsletter Garbage Day, said the answer is probably in between the two. “I absolutely do not think a website as large as Facebook, one led by people who seem completely out of touch with the daily goings on of their own user base, can immediately overnight throttle the majority of their content without basically turning the website off,” Broderick says. “I think it’s much more likely that a bunch of American liberals got good news for the first time in four years and the platform’s thoughtless recommendation engine reacted accordingly.” Major social media platforms continue to crack down on such misinformation, at least officially. Facebook has pinned the election results to the top of users’ newsfeeds, and is appending labels to Trump’s posts explaining the truth behind the election. Twitter is no longer fully restricting Trump’s tweets, but continues to add labels warning users that: “This claim about election fraud is disputed”. Even YouTube is taking action, demonetising videos from outlets such as the Trump-affiliated One America News Network that claim that “Trump won,” although the platform said it is not against its policies to seek to damage the electoral process unless it is done before the election occurs."

          "bodyText": "Amazon has been charged by the European commission with using the sales data of independent retailers selling through its site to illegally gain an advantage in the European marketplace. The US tech firm and online retailer was accused by Brussels of using the information it collects on retailers to focus its own efforts on the bestselling products with the biggest profit margins. Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s vice-president, said the commission’s preliminary conclusion was that Amazon used “big data” to illegally distort competition in France and Germany, the biggest online retail markets in Europe. Brussels has also decided to open a second investigation into Amazon’s e-commerce business practices over concerns that the Seattle-based company set rules on its platform to benefit its own offers and those independent retailers using its logistics and delivery services. Last month, Amazon announced a third quarter income for 2020 of $6.3bn, triple that of the previous year, as an increasing number of shoppers turn to online sales amid the pandemic. Vestager told a press conference in Brussels that the commission did not have an issue with the size of the company but only with its business practices which appeared to illegally stymy the growth of its competitors. “We all know how important e-commerce is today and the current crisis has demonstrated even further that buying online is now commonplace for many, many people, people shop online more frequently and for an increasing variety of products,” Vestager said. “The value of online sales in Europe has been growing steadily. And it has almost doubled in the last five years, reaching almost €720bn this year, up from more than €370bn in 2015. “And Amazon is at the centre of this market development. More than 70% of consumers in France, and more than 80% of consumers in Germany, that made online purchases bought something from Amazon in the last 12 months. We do not take issue with the success of Amazon or its size. Our concern is very specific business contacts which appears to distort genuine competition.” Amazon has been under investigation since July during which officials analysed a data sample covering more than 18m transactions and more than 100m products. The commission found that real time business data relating to independent retailers on the site was being fed into an algorithm used by Amazon’s own retail business. “It is based on these algorithms that Amazon decides what new products to launch, the price of each individual offer, the management of inventories and the choice of the best supplier for a product,” Vestager said. “We therefore come to the preliminary conclusion that the use of this data allows Amazon to focus on the sale of the best selling products, and this marginalises third party sellers and caps their ability to grow.” The company has been sent a formal statement of objection to which it has the opportunity to respond. In a statement Amazon said it disagreed with the findings. “There are more than 150,000 European businesses selling through our stores that generate tens of billions of euros in revenues annually,” the company said."

          "bodyText": "‘It’s Christmas time! It’s hot tub time!” sings Frank Sinatra. At least, it sounds like him. With an easy swing, cheery bonhomie, and understated brass and string flourishes, this could just about pass as some long lost Sinatra demo. Even the voice – that rich tone once described as “all legato and regrets” – is eerily familiar, even if it does lurch between keys and, at times, sounds as if it was recorded at the bottom of a swimming pool. The song in question not a genuine track, but a convincing fake created by “research and deployment company” OpenAI, whose Jukebox project uses artificial intelligence to generate music, complete with lyrics, in a variety of genres and artist styles. Along with Sinatra, they’ve done what are known as “deepfakes” of Katy Perry, Elvis, Simon and Garfunkel, 2Pac, Céline Dion and more. Having trained the model using 1.2m songs scraped from the web, complete with the corresponding lyrics and metadata, it can output raw audio several minutes long based on whatever you feed it. Input, say, Queen or Dolly Parton or Mozart, and you’ll get an approximation out the other end. “As a piece of engineering, it’s really impressive,” says Dr Matthew Yee-King, an electronic musician, researcher and academic at Goldsmiths. (OpenAI declined to be interviewed.) “They break down an audio signal into a set of lexemes of music – a dictionary if you like – at three different layers of time, giving you a set of core fragments that is sufficient to reconstruct the music that was fed in. The algorithm can then rearrange these fragments, based on the stimulus you input. So, give it some Ella Fitzgerald for example, and it will find and piece together the relevant bits of the ‘dictionary’ to create something in her musical space.” Admirable as the technical achievement is, there’s something horrifying about some of the samples, particularly those of artists who have long since died – sad ghosts lost in the machine, mumbling banal cliches. “The screams of the damned” reads one comment below that Sinatra sample; “SOUNDS FUCKING DEMONIC” reads another. We’re down in the Uncanny Valley. Deepfake music is set to have wide-ranging ramifications for the music industry as more companies apply algorithms to music. Google’s Magenta Project – billed as “exploring machine learning as a tool in the creative process” – has developed several open source APIs that allow composition using entirely new, machine-generated sounds, or human-AI co-creations. Numerous startups, such as Amper Music, produce custom, AI-generated music for media content, complete with global copyright. Even Spotify is dabbling; its AI research group is led by François Pachet, former head of Sony Music’s computer science lab. It’s not hard to foresee, though, how such deepfakes could lead to ethical and intellectual property issues. If you didn’t want to pay the market rate for using an established artist’s music in a film, TV show or commercial, you could create your own imitation. Streaming services could, meanwhile, pad out genre playlists with similar sounding AI artists who don’t earn royalties, thereby increasing profits. Ultimately, will streaming services, radio stations and others increasingly avoid paying humans for music? Legal departments in the music industry are following developments closely. Earlier this year, Roc Nation filed DMCA takedown requests against an anonymous YouTube user for using AI to mimic Jay-Z’s voice and cadence to rap Shakespeare and Billy Joel. (Both are incredibly realistic.) “This content unlawfully uses an AI to impersonate our client’s voice,” said the filing. And while the videos were eventually reinstated “pending more information from the claimant”, the case – the first of its kind – rumbles on. Roc Nation declined to comment on the legal implications of AI impersonation, as did several other major labels contacted by the Guardian: “As a public company, we have to exercise caution when discussing future facing topics,” said one anonymously. Even UK industry body the BPI refused to go on the record with regard to how the industry will deal with this brave new world and what steps might be taken to protect artists and the integrity of their work. The IFPI, an international music trade body, did not respond to emails. Perhaps the reason is, in the UK at least, there’s a worry that there’s not actually a basis for legal protection. “With music there are two separate copyrights,” says Rupert Skellett, head of legal for Beggars Group, which encompasses indie labels 4AD, XL, Rough Trade and more. “One in the music notation and the lyrics – ie the song – and a separate one in the sound recording, which is what labels are concerned with. And if someone hasn’t used the actual recording” – if they’ve created a simulacrum using AI – “you’d have no legal action against them in terms of copyright with regards to the sound recording.” There’d be a potential cause of action with regards to “passing off” the recording, but, says Skellett, the burden of proof is onerous, and such action would be more likely to succeed in the US, where legal protections exist against impersonating famous people for commercial purposes, and where plagiarism cases like Marvin Gaye’s estate taking on Blurred Lines have succeeded. UK law has no such provisions or precedents, so even the commercial exploitation of deepfakes, if the creator was explicit about their nature, might not be actionable. “It would depend on the facts of each case,” Skellett says. Some, however, are excited by the creative possibilities. “If you’ve got a statistical model of millions of songs, you can ask the algorithm: what haven’t you seen?” says Yee-King. “You can find that blank space, and then create something new.” Mat Dryhurst, an artist and podcaster who has spent years researching and working with AI and associated technology, says: “The closest analogy we see is to sampling. These models allow a new dimension of that, and represent the difference between sampling a fixed recording of Bowie’s voice and having Bowie sing whatever you like – an extraordinary power and responsibility.” Deepfakes also pose deeper questions: what makes a particular artist special? Why do we respond to certain styles or types of music, and what happens when that can be created on demand? Yee-King imagines machines able to generate the perfect piece of music for you at any time, based on settings that you select – something already being pioneered by the startup Endel – as well as pop stars using an AI listening model to predict which songs will be popular or what different demographics respond to. “Just feeding people an optimised stream of sound,” he says, “with artists taken out of the loop completely.” But if we lose all sense of emotional investment in what artists do – and in the human side of creation – we will lose something fundamental to music. “These systems are trained on human expression and will augment it,” says Dryhurst. “But the missing piece of the puzzle is finding ways to compensate people, not replace them.”"

          "bodyText": "Five stores email you on the same day. There’s a big sale coming tomorrow. You make a note in your calendar, planning to get some Christmas shopping done. By the time you log off the next day, a little dazed, you have an extra set of bedsheets and a popcorn machine you had no intention of buying. It was that pop-up offer that did you in – a little red ticker ran across the screen saying “Hurry! Only three items left!” It was probably driven by a machine-learning algorithm. “There is something biological going on, that creates a frenzied momentum and scale around these things,” says Christina Aventi, chief strategy officer at advertising agency BMF, and frequent guest on ABC’s Gruen Transfer. For the next 20 days, Australia will be buffeted by online sales. At 7pm on 10 November, Click Frenzy kicks off. The next day, inboxes will ping with Singles Day deals. On 27 November, Black Friday will hit (along with its culturally loaded moniker), followed on 30 November by Cyber Monday. All promise time-limited offers, deep discounts and most of all, a sense of occasion. And with the exception of Click Frenzy, all are international. “The power of the event-sale is you get that en-masse Fomo,” Aventi explains. Singles Day is an “unofficial” Chinese shopping holiday, led by ecommerce giant Alibaba, while Black Friday and Cyber Monday are American imports – taking place around Thanksgiving. Although Australia does not have the public holidays that originally prompted the sales, local retailers now take part in increasing numbers. “We are quickly seeing the globalisation of promotional events,” says Australian Retailers Association CEO Paul Zahra, meaning international sales are “now part of the Australian shopping tradition”. But traditions are going out the window this year. Online shopping was already replacing traditional retail, before a pandemic stopped us all from leaving our houses. In September, Zahra says, online shopping increased by 82% year on year, based on figures from Australia Post. “Since April more than 1 million households have shopped online for the first time,” and everyone is buying online more. “1.7 times more on average when compared to 2019,” he says. Aventi says as retail becomes increasingly digital, Australian brands have had to recalibrate their shopping calendars. “In a borderless online environment you just can’t compete,” she explains. When “some of the biggest retailers in the world” all offer discounts at the same time, Australian brands have no choice but to step in line or get ignored. “It’s basically a sport,” she says. For consumers, “savvy shopping is the unofficial sport for the person who’s not athletic. Even when you look at the commentary around it – people will talk about having a ‘game plan’.” That’s true for retailers too: “They’re competing against each other and they’re all trying to win.” The name “Click Frenzy” says a lot about the mindset one-day sales are trying to inspire. While she won’t go as far as to liken big sales events to panic-buying, Aventi concedes “they share a bit of DNA in terms of Fomo”. She says sale days are “stimulus response, it is Pavlov’s dog. You build equity in that day, you build memory capital. People will think ‘I’ll wait for that sale’ and you’ll hold out.” A lot of planning goes into the timing – “when people might have a bit of cash flow, or they’re looking ahead to gifting.” November sales are particularly effective because there’s “a key trigger” – the lead-up to Christmas. “You’ve got to have a motivation,” says Aventi. “Some sort of permission, a sense of ‘I’ve earned it’ … it’s not top of mind, it operates in the subconscious.” Shopping for others hits that trigger – and so does buying at a discount. “There’s a tinge of guilt if you’re say, buying on credit … but what a good deal does is make you feel savvy and it neutralises that guilt.” While it might cause a feel good rush in the moment, this “can lead to an addiction cycle or a compulsion loop, which is a bit dangerous”, says Aventi. All those factors – a sense that other people are doing it, a sense that you have to act fast or you will miss out, and a sense that the spending is justifiable – are present in one-day sales. These impulses are all great for retailers, but not always for consumers. Aventi notes the act-fast mindset also means sales are a chance to clear less-popular items quickly. “They don’t want that stock in their inventory, because that’s cost if it’s just sitting in a warehouse.” “God I hate this ‘art of persuasion’ stuff,” she jokes. “Know that we’re decent people – it’s not like the Mad Men days.” When asked if one-day sales create any issues for retailers, Zahra says “there are greater drawbacks for retailers that are not participating”. One-day sales have proliferated because they work. A timed offer is more exhilarating than trudging around a picked-through discount aisle. But Aventi believes we’ll soon reach a tipping point. “There will have to be some kind of survival of the fittest,” Aventi says. “There will be some [sales days] that will be weak performers … bigger sales that’ll eat the smaller ones up … And the long tail will fall by the wayside.” End-of-financial-year sales are already a victim of this in Australia. And while Boxing Day still has some cache, Aventi and Zahra both note Australian retailers have started “front-loading” their stock. While Australia’s shopping calendar may have evolved to become more digital, and more global, our brains are still driven by those age-old instincts. Buyer beware."

          "headline": "Australia trials new technology to intercept mystery seeds sent in the mail",
          "bodyText": "The Australian agriculture department is undertaking a world-first trial of new technology aimed at detecting seeds sent in the mail after 228 reports of Australians receiving mysterious seed packets from overseas. People in Australia and a number of other countries, including the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada, began reporting packets of seeds they had not ordered in mid-July. The US Department of Agriculture has suggested that the seeds may have been sent as part of what is called a “brushing scam”. The scam is aimed at boosting third-party sellers’ ratings in online stores such as Amazon or eBay by setting up a fake customer account using someone’s name and address found in a data breach. They then buy a product using that account and ship small items to the person’s address, and then leave a five-star review for that seller. Ministerial briefing documents obtained by the Guardian show Australian authorities have reached the same verdict. “Seeds are often sent in the mail as a result of an e-commerce practice called ‘brushing’ to bolster their store’s orders and ratings and to increase their visibility online,” the question time briefing document prepared by the Australian agriculture department states. US reports suggest people in all 50 states have this year received seeds in the mail they did not order. The Australian agriculture department’s head of biosecurity, Lee Cale, told the Guardian it was a similar story in Australia, with 228 reports of unsolicited seeds being sent in the mail since the beginning of July. “It’s actually in every state, we’ve received reports from every state now,” she said. Motherboard has reported – based on documents obtained from US state agriculture departments – that hundreds and maybe thousands of Americans had planted the seeds when they received them. Cale said that is not the case in Australia. “We very strongly communicate the fact that if people do get these things … we very strongly encourage people to not plant them. Also, don’t throw them out. But to contact us on that dedicated line, and we will go and pick those seeds up. “And then we’ll either, if we can re-export them to the centre, send them back, but more often than not will destroy them.” The seeds are being sent from China, Malaysia, Taiwan and Pakistan predominantly, Cale said. Australian scientists had not examined the seeds here to determine what they are, but in US reports, the seeds included rose, sweet potato, onion, cucumber, tomato, radish, peppergrass, alfalfa, corn, lettuce, hollyhock and spearmint. The agriculture department is trying a number of different ways to stop the seeds reaching people in Australia: alerting the jurisdictions where the seeds are coming from to stop them being sent in the first place; raising the issue with the Universal Postal Union; training detector dogs to sniff out the seeds; and now with a $1m trial of new X-ray machine equipment. The trial is of “a world first seed detection project using real-time video imagery, an auto-detection algorithm, and low-energy, high-resolution X-ray to detect the presence of seeds inside mail articles”, department briefing documents say. Cale said the current x-ray machine technology used at the border made it difficult for the seeds to be picked up, but the trial with x-ray technology company Rapiscan in Brisbane had been showing results in its early stages. “We’re preparing for those phase-two trials at the training facility in Brisbane, and then very quickly we want to actually integrate that technology into the Sydney gateway [and] into our operational processes,” she said. Cale didn’t put a timeline on when it would be rolled out nationally, but said the second phase of the trial would move “quite rapidly”. The size of the machines, being much smaller than the typical mail screening machines, would make them easier to deploy. “These are much more mobile. The idea would be to deploy those around the mail facilities around Australia.” In the meantime, the department has encouraged anyone who receives seeds in the mail to report them via www.awe.gov.au/report or to call 1800 798 636."

          "bodyText": "I recently received a text asking me to verify whether I had made a recent purchase. This is something that happens a lot, as my bank is triggered by anything that doesn’t appear to be me. It will allow limitless funds to go on overpriced trainers, but block barbecue meats or Tottenham Hotspur merch. I am making this up, of course, as it seems entirely random what it double-checks, although I am sure there is a sophisticated algorithm that says things like: “Romesh doesn’t usually buy vegetables in January – he gets depressed and eats only pastries.” It is worse when I’m on tour. The bank gets extra suspicious because I make purchases in so many different towns, particularly since almost every one is curry. I spent the whole of my last tour on the phone trying to convince my bank it was actually me having vegetable jalfrezi for the 16th consecutive night. If the system were truly sophisticated, it would trigger a call to a dietitian. I don’t begrudge any of this, because it’s nice to feel there is a system in place to stop you losing your money. But I have been known to lose my shit when my card is declined in front of a queue of people in B&amp;Q because nobody at the bank believes I would do DIY. I was working when I got the text asking me if I had spent £1,000 in a clothes shop. Obviously, I hadn’t, but my complete lack of trust in my own sense of recall meant I started racking my brains to see if there was any chance I had simply forgotten. I realised that probably wasn’t the case, and immediately began to panic. Somebody had been using my card! I know this is an anonymous crime, but in my head I envisioned some Thanos-type character browsing the dark web and saying, “I knew I’d get you one day, Romesh!”, before spending all of my money on guns. I immediately told everyone I was with that I had been the victim of cyberhacking, and phoned my bank. But getting across what had happened was more difficult than I had anticipated. First, I had to complete a series of puzzles in order to convince them it was me, ranging from telling them what I had spent £6.45 on the previous week, to remembering the number of times I had cancelled and renewed my gym membership. Once I had eventually reassured them, I was told not to worry as it was normal procedure to receive that text for security reasons. I said I understood that, but that it wasn’t me who had made the purchase; they told me not to worry, as it was normal procedure to receive that text for security reasons. This happened once more, before I said, in a slightly distressed manner, “I think I’m the victim of a crime!” Then they finally looked into it, and discovered not only that my card had been cloned, but that whoever did it likes to look incredibly stylish – a dead giveaway that it wasn’t me. They told me they would have to send me a new card and cancel the old one, and asked me to cut it up immediately. I made a huge show of doing this in front of the people I was working with, so they would feel sorry for me and perhaps even treat me as some sort of hero. Every day since then, I have discovered I have defaulted on yet another payment, because the service provider has my old details – including one for insurance on a phone I haven’t owned for almost a year. I updated the others, with the exception of the gym payment – on that one, I took the hacking to be a sign from above. Thanks, Thanos."

          "bodyText": "Spotify has been accused of trying to create digital “payola”, after announcing a feature that would give artists an algorithmic boost on the company’s playlists – if they agree to take a cut in the royalties they get paid for the relevant songs. The feature, which Spotify is describing as an “experiment”, will affect playlists including the company’s Artist Radio, which plays songs similar to a particular band, and Autoplay, which continues to play similar music after a playlist has run out of tracks. “Artists and labels can identify music that is a priority for them, and our system will add that signal to the algorithm that determines personalised listening sessions,” the company said. “This allows our algorithms to account for what’s important to the artist – perhaps a song they are particularly excited about, an album anniversary they are celebrating, a viral cultural moment they are experiencing, or other factors they care about.” But the algorithmic juice comes at a price. “To ensure the tool is accessible to artists at any stage of their careers, it will not require any upfront budget,” Spotify says. “Instead, labels or rights holders agree to be paid a promotional recording royalty rate for streams in personalised listening sessions where we provided this service.” The new terms sparked an immediate backlash among recording artists. “This a form of payola or sponsored social media post. It is not necessarily illegal but the tracks would need to be labelled,” said David C Lowery, the singer-songwriter of Camper Van Beethoven, and a regular campaigner for musicians’ rights, referring to the 1950s scandal of DJs being paid to play particular songs. Spotify’s push comes just a week after the company was presented with a campaign from the American Union of Musicians and Allied Workers calling for the company to guarantee a minimum payment of 1c per stream, and to “reveal existing payola, then end it altogether”. “Spotify encourages labels and management companies to pay for plays on the platform. In many cases, the artists do not even know this is happening,” the union wrote in an open letter to the company. “Spotify should not be in the business of selling artists access to their own fan base. Spotify must publicly reveal where existing payola is occurring, and then stop systems of paid access that make an already unequal platform even more imbalanced.” The letter has been signed by 16,000 artists so far, Umaw says. Spotify has been contacted for comment."

          "bodyText": "The new lockdown in England is the latest in a string of U-turns performed by Boris Johnson’s government since the pandemic began. The prime minister and his team had been insisting right up until Friday that their system of three tiers was the best approach to tackling the second wave while avoiding the economic damage of a full circuit-break. Here are some of the other major U-turns performed by ministers during the pandemic. Extending business support Just last month the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, completely revamped his job support scheme, which replaces the furlough system. Sunak had earlier resisted calls to give greater support to businesses as the second wave and tier restrictions hit the economy. But he came up with more money after firms – especially those in hospitality – warned of big drops in revenue as a result of socialising restrictions and the risk of forced closure. Decision to lift Covid restrictions in Bolton and Trafford reversed Coronavirus restrictions banning people from different households from meeting indoors or in private gardens were due to be lifted in the two Greater Manchester boroughs at the start of September. But the decision was reversed by the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who said there had been a “significant change” in infection rates in both areas. The statement was released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) shortly after midday on 2 September, the point at which it said the restrictions had been due to be lifted. The U-turn came after council leaders in both boroughs had called for the ban on two households mixing to be maintained. U-turn on face coverings being worn in schools The Department for Education (DfE) reversed its policy in August, announcing that face coverings should be worn in corridors and communal areas by staff and students in year 7 and above in schools in areas with coronavirus restrictions. The new advice came after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, had previously insisted measures being adopted by schools to limit the spread of the virus meant masks were not required and a day after a No 10 spokesman said there were no plans to review the guidance. A-level and GCSE results U-turn in England Following criticism from students and headteachers, and a backlash by Tory MPs, the government announced A-level and GCSE grades would be based on teachers’ assessments rather than a controversial algorithm devised by regulator Ofqual. The prime minister and Williamson had previously defended the “robust” system, which saw almost 40% of A-level grades reduced from teachers’ predictions. The announcement on 17 August, just days before GCSE results were due to come out, followed an earlier vow from Williamson that there would be “no U-turn, no change”. Government’s coronavirus contact-tracing app plans ditched A new NHSX app for contact tracing was announced by Hancock on 12 April when he said it would be “crucial” for preventing the transmission of coronavirus. The app was trialled on the Isle of Wight with a view to it being rolled out more widely across the country in May. However, on 18 June the government abandoned plans for its own app, instead switching to one using technology developed by Apple and Google. Trials of this one were launched in August on the Isle of Wight, in the London Borough of Newham and among NHS volunteer personnel and the app was finally rolled out nationwide in September. Primary school children to return In early May, Williamson set out the government’s ambition that all primary-age children in England would have at least four weeks in school before the summer. But on 9 June, he said there was “no choice” but to scrap those plans amid concerns that the two-metre social-distancing rule would make a full return impossible. In August, the government said its plans would be for all pupils, in all year groups, to return to school full-time from the beginning of the autumn term. Bereavement scheme for NHS staff extended After criticism that care workers, cleaners and porters were being excluded from a Home Office scheme granting families of foreign health workers indefinite leave to remain in the UK if their loved ones died of Covid-19, the government announced an extension of the scheme on 20 May. The scheme had been introduced in April but did not initially include all support staff in the NHS. The home secretary, Priti Patel, said the extension to a bereavement scheme for NHS support staff would be “effective immediately and retrospectively”. NHS surcharge for overseas health and care staff A day later, on 21 May, Johnson stood by the fee that overseas health workers were being charged to use the NHS. However, just hours later, following mounting pressure from senior Tories, it was announced that foreign health and care workers would be exempted from the scheme. Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, called the U-turn a “victory for common decency”. School meals voucher scheme England footballer Marcus Rashford was credited with playing a key part in forcing the government to U-turn on its decision not to extend the children’s food voucher scheme into the summer holidays. On 16 June, cabinet minister Grant Shapps said free school meals were not normally extended to cover the summer period. Yet a few hours later, No 10 backtracked on its stance, confirming that it would in fact extend the programme. Speaking the next day, Hancock mistakenly praised “Daniel Rashford” for his campaigning efforts."

          "headline": "Should Pinterest prohibit culturally inappropriate Halloween ideas?",
          "bodyText": "Do you suffer from Justin Trudeau-esque levels of judgment when it comes to fancy dress? Are you scrambling to find a last-minute Halloween costume? Pinterest is here to help save you from yourself! The visual social media platform, which many people use to search for Halloween inspiration, has said it is limiting recommendations for “costumes that appropriate cultures”. This builds on a policy from 2016 prohibiting advertisements with “culturally inappropriate costumes” and making it easy for users to report culturally insensitive content. But what exactly does Pinterest consider “culturally inappropriate” or “culturally insensitive”? The company doesn’t make that clear. Nor does it make clear what “limiting” means. (I reached out to Pinterest for comment but didn’t hear back.) My own research didn’t provide much clarification: when I searched for “Native American Halloween costume”, for example, plenty of examples came up. There were also plenty of results for “Geisha Halloween costume” and “Arab Sheikh Halloween costume”. And when I searched “terrorist Halloween costume” a picture of a little white boy dressed as an Arab suicide bomber came up. After playing around on Pinterest a little longer, I discovered what I’d been doing wrong. I’d been searching for Halloween costumes. If you search for “Native American costumes”, omitting the word Halloween, the cultural appropriation policy seems to kick in. You still get examples of costumes but you also get a big tab that says “Learn more: cultural appropriation on Halloween”. When you click on it you’re directed to articles about avoiding cultural appropriation. The same thing happens when you search for “geisha costumes” or “Mexican costumes” but it doesn’t happen when you search for “Arab sheikh costumes”. (Apparently stereotyping Arabs is fine.) In short, it seems like Pinterest hasn’t thought through its cultural appropriation policies terribly well. Nor has it seen fit to explain its rationale for what is considered appropriation and what isn’t. This isn’t exactly surprising; cultural appropriation is an incredibly complex subject that is rarely treated with the nuance it deserves. The topic inevitably provokes fake outrage and strawman arguments; on the one hand you have a small minority of very vocal liberals who claim eating sushi is cultural appropriation, on the other hand you have conservatives who claim nobody is allowed to say or do anything more because of political correctness. (You only have to look at who the US president is to realise that is patently false.) Should Pinterest be thinking about cultural appropriation at all? Well, yes. Social media platforms are never neutral. There is always some degree of censorship and editorializing going on. A recent study, for example, found that Facebook leads conservatives to read more polarized news sites; Reddit, on the other hand, leads conservatives to more politically moderate ones. The study, by professors at the University of Virginia McIntire School of Commerce, found that in a month when a conservative user visited Facebook more than usual, they read news that was about 30% more conservative than the online news they usually read. By contrast, when a typical conservative used Reddit more than usual, they read news that was about 50% more moderate than what they typically read. The researchers postulated that this is partly because Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes engagement (which is often a result of polarizing content) and Reddit prioritizes content based on what users have voted to be most informing or interesting. While Pinterest’s cultural appropriation policy may be somewhat confused and confusing, the platform deserves some credit for attempting to tackle the subject at all. Nudging people who are searching for Native American costume ideas into thinking about the issues associated with that costume seems like a responsible thing to do. It certainly seems more responsible than the algorithm marking the user as an enthusiastic racist, and serving more and more racist content to them. Like certain other social platforms might do."

          "headline": "Tory chatter suggests the party's north-south divide extends far beyond Covid",
          "bodyText": "The Conservative party’s north-south divide isn’t just about lockdown. It’s in the party itself. As the newly formed Northern Research Group (NRG) of Tory MPs representing Wales, the north of England and the Scottish borders pressures Boris Johnson to do more to help their regions, a divide is forming in the party between the two sides. As a general rule, northern Tory MPs tend to have been elected more recently, represent a higher number of blue-collar workers in their constituencies and be more unambiguously pro-Brexit. By contrast, southern Tory MPs tend to occupy seats that have been Tory for decades and represent more affluent voters – though obviously this doesn’t apply to all of them; left-behind coastal communities in the south have more in common with those in the “red wall”. The difference between the two Tory tribes stretches from coronavirus funding to planning reform and culture wars. The creation of the NRG this month – containing more than 50 MPs and led by the prime minister’s former ally Jake Berry – has been read in some quarters as a threat to Johnson’s authority. While the group’s letter this week, calling for more coronavirus support and a re-commitment to the “level-up” agenda, led to concern in government, the alarm was not confined to No 10. As soon as the group’s name was unveiled to include “research group” there was an acknowledgement by aides that it could cause problems – even though Berry and Johnson are old friends. The concern spread to MPs: some shire Tories are worried it could prove to be a powerful mechanism that leads to their own concerns being drowned out. They are already concerned that No 10 is more interested in keeping the red wall blue than in tightening the Tory hold on the south. Frustrations have been building for some time among blue-wall MPs that they are getting a raw deal on coronavirus. Their constituencies have been under tighter restrictions than the south and, they argue, were it the other way around more support would have been offered. A common refrain on some Tory WhatsApp threads is that when the coronavirus infections were worst in London the country was put under national lockdown – but that hasn’t happened when it’s the other way around. With the NRG, these MPs are now organised. “Jake Berry has skilfully corralled inexperienced colleagues into getting their voice heard,” says one colleague in a southern seat. But concern about what comes next extends past coronavirus. In one sense, disputes over lockdown levels are viewed as the least problematic. “At this rate, we’ll all be in tier 3 in a month’s time anyway,” says one MP representing a seat currently in tier 2. The areas ripe for argument include general funding, Brexit and culture wars. The government’s budget will be squeezed post-Covid, and a fight will follow over scarce resources. While there is no “Southern Research Group” by name, a taste of the demands of MPs in these seats can be found in the so-called “housing algorithm concern group”. Led by the former No 10 adviser Andrew Griffith and the Isle of Wight MP, Bob Seely, this group was formed to oppose the government’s planning reform algorithm. It is mainly formed of MPs in southern seats concerned about the government’s method for mass housebuilding – Theresa May is among the MPs to go public with their concerns. “This is a group who will also complain about the lack of funds going into their area,” says a colleague. On the whole, blue-wall MPs are more supportive over the planning reforms – anything that means more funding tends to be seen as a positive. They also see property ownership as the pathway to voting Conservative. Cheaper housing ought to mean more Tory voters. However, some MPs in more affluent seats – whom critics describe as Nimbys – take the view that cheaper housing not only spoils the countryside and upsets current residents, it also changes the makeup of their constituencies and brings in younger, more leftwing voters. The ongoing debate on post-Brexit food standards – over which the celebrity chef Prue Leith reportedly cancelled her party membership – is another sign of the difference of opinion. While Conservatives such as Zac Goldsmith and Danny Kruger push for a green Brexit, one red-wall MP tells me their priority for any deal is cheaper produce on the supermarket shelves for their constituents. If the money does run out for infrastructure projects, Johnson will face increasing pressure by blue-collar Tories to take a stronger stance on culture war issues. MPs such as Ben Bradley in Mansfield are among those happy to be bullish in a “war on woke”. Supporters of such a strategy argue that it is a cost-free way to unite their base and remind people this is the Tory party. But focusing energies on fighting culture wars meets resistance from MPs representing seats in the commuter belt. “Starting a culture war is a short-sighted plan that will isolate Liberal Democrat or Labour voters we ought to be trying to win over,” says one such MP. “As a general rule, the posher the MP, the softer they are [on fighting a culture war],” adds a fellow Conservative MP. While coronavirus is what dominates today’s news, these different issues could shape what type of Conservative party is in place by the time of the next general election. If Johnson is to prioritise shoring up his new blue-wall MPs, he risks isolating some of the Tory base the party has relied on so heavily in the past. • Katy Balls is the Spectator’s deputy political editor"

          "headline": "Nearly half of councils in Great Britain use algorithms to help make claims decisions",
          "bodyText": "Nearly half of councils in England, Wales and Scotland have used or are using computer algorithms to help make decisions about benefit claims, who gets social housing and other issues, despite concerns about their reliability. A Guardian freedom of information investigation has established that 100 out of 229 councils have used or are using automated decision-making programmes, many without consulting at all with the public on their use. This is despite one council admitting that results from one algorithm showed it was only 26% accurate in some instances. The company behind it said it was because people often entered information wrongly. Another council dropped an artificial intelligence tool to process new benefit claims, saying they were not satisfied with its reliability. A range of private companies are selling machine-learning packages to local authorities that are under pressure to save money. The systems are being deployed to provide automated guidance on benefit claims, help decide who gets social housing, and allocate school places among a range of other uses. Concerns have been raised about the arbitrary nature of these programmes, which inform important decisions about people’s lives, and their scope for making mistakes. Martha Dark, the director of the digital rights group Foxglove, said: “It is very worrying to see so many councils putting in place algorithmic systems without any public consultation. These systems are clearly being used to make huge decisions about people’s lives.” The use of artificial intelligence, or automated decision-making, has come into sharp focus after an algorithm used by the exam regulator, Ofqual, downgraded almost 40% of the A-level grades assessed by teachers. It culminated in a government U-turn and the system being scrapped. One of the most used algorithms among councils is that for risk-based verification, a process in which claims for housing and council tax are automatically processed to determine the likelihood of fraud. Those that are considered higher risk are slowed down and people are asked to provide more evidence. The programme is still being used by South Ayrshire council. When asked about the accuracy of this programme, the council said it had used the company Northgate Public Services, and the programme was found to be 26% accurate at finding low-risk claims, 36% accurate for medium-risk claims and had a 40% accuracy rate for high-risk ones. The service cost £41,500. A spokesperson for South Ayrshire council said: “All applications are manually processed by staff – we do not use robotics to verify any application or evidence submitted. The type of risk associated determines the type or level of evidence required to verify the claim and so improves efficiency in claims processing.” Northgate Public Services said the accuracy rates quoted were not related to the effectiveness but rather claimants often inputting incorrect data. Wigan council uses an algorithm to allocate social housing. It says answers are submitted and a points-based system then decides which category to place people into. The council uses Northgate housing software to sort candidates into groups. The company stressed it was not involved in banding and assessment criteria, which is instead put in place by councils. Wigan said applicants and council tenants are placed in either group A, B or C when they are able to demonstrate that they meet the appropriate criteria in either their permanent or temporary home. Group A includes young people leaving local authority care, those in severe hardship and those leaving the UK armed forces. Group B includes those living in poor housing conditions. Group C includes those living outside the borough with no local connection, among other criteria. Nicolas Kayser-Bril, from Algorithm Watch, a non-profit group looking at algorithmic decision-making processes, said that while the council should be commended for its transparency, “there seems to be ample room for arbitrariness”. “There will never be a way to objectively define who should be first in line for affordable housing. Transparent algorithms can help, but so can professional caseworkers who take the time to discuss with the applicants. Revealingly, none of the criteria in the list concerns the wishes of the applicants. Instead, they attempt to define the ‘good pauper’, much like in previous centuries.” Joanne Willmott, Wigan council’s assistant director for provider management and market development, said: “Applications are assessed and prioritised based on answers submitted by customers around their own individual circumstances on our online housing application portal and then assessed in line with the allocation policy. A final check of the application is manually carried out.” Flintshire council, which says it used the company Civica at a cost of £961.40 a year to process new claims for the period 2014 to 2018, said the service was terminated, as the council was not satisfied with its reliability. A spokesperson for Civica said: “While the authority did not continue with this approach which was based on a third-party algorithm, the company continues to provide the core revenues and benefits software for Flintshire county council which is a longstanding customer.” A Local Government Association spokesperson said: “Councils have been trying to improve how they use data in recent years, and predictive analytics is just one example of this. Good use of data can be hugely beneficial in helping councils make services more targeted and effective … But it is important to note that data is only ever used to inform decisions and not to make decisions for councils.”"

          "bodyText": "It started with an algorithm. No, wait, the baby came first and then the algorithm. When creative technologist Jonathan Plackett and comic writer and artist Karrie Fransman had a daughter, they wondered if it would be possible to create a program that “swapped all gendered language in any text”, he to she, daughter to son and so on. Having built it, they applied it to the ur-narrative text, the fairytale, choosing the Fairy Books, edited by Andrew Lang, published at the back end of the 19th century and into the 20th. The result is blunt and impartial, deliberately so: there’s no finer human judgment applied story by story (is a pantaloon male or female? What about a ruffle?), it’s a straight computer-says-she switcheroo. The illustrations are quite special, particularly when they veer into fantasy. I loved the forest full of parrots in “Little Red Riding Hood”, the lizards and mice in “Cinder”. Plainly, the core audience is the malleable young mind, a child at the age of such innocence that they haven’t yet internalised the gender prejudice all around them, and who will head into the world thinking of women as adventurers and men as very much in touch with their emotions. But more fascinating – particularly if your children are too old and cynical for such an enterprise – is to read it yourself for what jars, what surprises, what seems implausible, what repels. While in life I have no problem with a female chief executive, for some reason I can’t get my head around a lady miller. Dads who cook? Sure, I had one of those myself. Yet when “One day [Little Red Riding Hood’s] father, having made some custards, said to him …” I couldn’t even concentrate on the instruction (which is “take these to your grandfather”, obviously) for the din of my interior monologue, saying: “DADS DON’T COOK CUSTARD”. The obvious and persistent bias – and I wonder whether, also, the most life-defining – is the beauty standard, the fact that a woman is judged by her appearance in a way a man is not, that her ugliness or beauty both inform the world’s view of her and become the whole of her, excluding all other traits. It’s revealed in a fact as simple as “beauty” functioning as a noun where “handsome” does not. How could a handsome man contract into “a handsome”? How would we know how daring he also was? “The Sleeping Handsome in the Wood”, “Handsome and the Beast”, all ram home, with a light, rueful humour, the timeless message to a woman in fiction: be beautiful, or be evil, or go home. The requirement of thinness is separate to beauty – to be not thin enough, to break “above a dozen laces in trying to be laced up close, that they might have a fine slender shape”, is to make yourself ridiculous, a truism that I tended to swallow unexamined until the ugly sisters were ugly brothers. These tales are not voicing the modern obsession with an emaciated female body shape; rather, they iterate the Fay Weldon principle, that societies throughout history have wanted women to be smaller, not to be desirable but just so we take up less space. Beauty being the paramount quality, it stands to reason that female envy would be a powerful force – indeed, in many myths, the only force: why else are stepmothers always so damn mean? Yet only when six sisters become six brothers do the more casual allusions to it leap out: there isn’t really a beautiful heroine in folklore whose sisters don’t hate her and wish she’d go and live with some ogre – or failing that, almost anybody. Under every rock, I found dozens of my own unconscious biases, wriggling like earwigs under the exposure. When the merchant in “Handsome and the Beast” loses all her money, having been double-crossed by her trading agents, there was – so help me – a tiny interior voice going “why are women so gullible, they’re always getting ripped off by their agents”. When I chased this voice down to its source, it turned out I was thinking of Leonard Cohen, who is apparently an honorary woman in my subconscious purely by dint of having been ripped off by his manager. Absolutely stark and unignorable is the prejudice against an older, or uglier woman, trying to sexually exploit a beautiful young man: the female Beast, even the Queen in “Cinder” (mother to the Princess who throws the ball, who “old as she was, could not help watching” Cinder) seem predatory and unnatural as cougars, while as men they were sinned against or harmless. Likewise, the expectation of maternal altruism vexes what were previously totally sound scenarios: sure, a father might give his daughter to a beast to save his own skin, but how could a mother do that? Of course there are stories that make more sense with a gender-swap. It’s totally legit for a princess to choose a mate by the size of his feet. I found myself wanting an algorithm that swapped rich for poor, aristocrats for ordinary folk, to bring the same spirit of interrogation to class bias, the assumption that the nobler you are, the braver and more moral. One thing I’d forgotten about the genre is how loaded it is with stuff: chests full of gold, the finest silks – paragraph after paragraph just shopping lists of luxury items. I’d love to see that turned on its head, so that the stuff-afforders weren’t necessarily always the dragon-slayers. That’s the problem with liberals, give us an inch … • Gender Swapped Fairy Tales is published by Faber (£20). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com. Delivery charges may apply."

The office lifted the lid on the sports rorts affair, the overpayment by the Department of Infrastructure for land around Badgerys Creek airport and the overpayment by the Department of Agriculture for water for the Murray river; and in relation to the government’s Lobbying Code of Conduct, found that: The Attorney General’s Department “did not develop a strategy to raise awareness of the code.” “Limited activities were undertaken to inform lobbyists and government representatives of their compliance obligations under the code.” The Attorney General’s Department “did not systematically assess risks to compliance with the code and did not advise government about the sufficiency of the current compliance framework in meeting the code’s objectives.” If the purpose of high salaries, generous gifts and bonuses is to create incentives for staff to work smart and hard, then you would think that a prime minister concerned with the efficient use of taxpayer money would be personally pinning medals on the chests of the hard working folk at the ANAO. Indeed, you’d think he would be sending a note of thanks to the senators who uncovered the Cartier gifts at Senate estimates last week. But alas, the Coalition government is instead ensuring the ANAO conducts fewer inquiries next year, and treating Senate estimates as a trial to be endured rather than an opportunity to scrutinise spending. The hypocrisy of attacking Australia Post management while defending budget cuts to the ANAO is truly staggering. But the hypocrisy doesn’t end there. Apparently, it’s clear that taxpayer owned companies should not give gifts to senior staff, but it’s OK for privately owned companies to do precisely that. Why? It has been recently revealed that privately owned companies receiving taxpayer support to help “get them through the recession” have been paying multi-million-dollar bonuses to their CEOs. If the prime minister, Scott Morrison, was really worried about taxpayer money being squandered, then why wasn’t he as outraged that the head of Star casino took an $800,000 bonus this year — after receiving over $64m in commonwealth government support — as he was at the $20,000 in watches handed out by Australia Post? Even when privately owned companies aren’t spending taxpayers’ money on gifts for their executives, why isn’t the prime minister worried that multi-million dollar bonuses, corporate boxes at the footy and private jet travel are driving up the prices paid by ordinary Australians for their mortgages, electricity or groceries? In theory, governments shouldn’t have to worry about excessive private sector largesse, as the combined forces of competition and board scrutiny would nip any opulence in the bud. But in reality, Australia is the land of cosy oligopoly overseen by an even cosier club of corporate directors and, in turn, ordinary shareholders and ordinary taxpayers — those whom the prime minister says he is so concerned about end up footing the bill for very expensive food, wine and watches. Again, in theory we shouldn’t have to worry about corporate waste and opulence, but anyone who watched the royal commission into the big banks, or the recent inquiry into Crown casino, will know the boards of Australia’s biggest companies are very quick to place their faith in management — and very reluctant to dig into the “operational” decisions they are paid so handsomely to oversee. There is no evidence that receiving cash bonuses or Cartier watches will make executive staff work harder and no evidence that the Morrison government’s new-found concern about wasting taxpayers’ money will lead to improved processes or structures. If — and it’s a big if — Morrison was determined to ensure public money was being well spent, he would boost the budget of the ANAO rather than cut it, speed up the establishment of a federal anti-corruption watchdog rather than delay it, and claw back every cent paid out in CEO bonuses from companies receiving taxpayer support. But he is not, so he will not. Back in 2018, the then assistant treasurer, Stuart Robert, repaid $38,000 of taxpayers’ money he had somehow spent on his home internet bill. Mistakes, it seems, can happen. But when he was minister for human services, he oversaw the disastrous robodebt scheme that harassed and penalised people who — a deeply flawed algorithm concluded — may have been overpaid. There should always be scrutiny over the way taxpayers’ money is spent but, while attacking the head of Australia Post for $20,000 worth of luxury watches might generate some good press for the prime minister, it won’t generate anything near the savings a well-funded ANAO and a commonwealth integrity commission would deliver. • Richard Denniss is the chief economist at independent thinktank The Australia Institute"

          "bodyText": "I was making toast in my tiny apartment kitchen four weeks ahead of election day. Not that I really had track of the days. They had melded into one ever-extending runway as Auckland went through its second Covid-19 lockdown and New Zealand’s election date was pushed back a month. We were a few months into an insurgent campaign for an electorate seat at the centre of the country’s largest city. We’d built a team of hundreds of people – particularly young people, some so young they couldn’t even vote yet – who, despite their claims to the contrary, were all doing a lot more than the least they could do. They were about to make history. In Aotearoa New Zealand, a “minor” party hasn’t won a general electorate seat in well over 20 years without the tacit or explicit endorsement of one of the two “major” parties. So, it confounded more than a few commentators when at around 11.50pm on Saturday 17 October, with 100% of the preliminary votes counted, it was confirmed that a Green party candidate had won Auckland Central. Especially because we ran a campaign on an unapologetically progressive platform of urgent climate action, guaranteed minimum income, and wealth tax to pay for it. We flew in the face of two major opinion polls, the “red tide” of the Labour party’s majority win, and conventional wisdom. There are still half a million or so special votes (that is, overseas and on-the-day enrolments) to be counted, so the results cannot be taken for granted. But what can be granted is that so-called convention in our politics is disappearing. Convention is the echo of repetition to the point of predictability. Mainstream approaches to electoral politics have lost the right of convention. Mechanisms of conventional, incremental political change – literally the least we can, and know how to, do – have failed to rise to the challenges that the deeply entrenched and inextricable crises of climate change and social and economic inequality present. Citizens are smart enough to recognise the need for an alternative. It’s in this alternative where we can continually redraw the boundaries of the possible, because possibility in politics is only ever defined by the willingness of those in power. In these “unprecedented” times, the centre-left Labour party won a historic single-party majority, growing its nationwide vote to previously unimaginable heights under New Zealand’s proportional representation voting system. But so too has our Green party grown our own vote, shaking off the convention of give-and-take amongst the parties of the left bloc. In Auckland, we flipped a seat Green, which had been held by centre-right National party politicians for 12 years. We did it by bursting our own bubble. In our bubble, we can’t fathom that working-class people would vote against their own self-interest for a strong-man built on strawman logic. It’s wild to reckon with how policies to fairly tax millionaires are warped through talkback radio to scare tradies and hospo workers into thinking their jobs are on the chopping block. In our bubble, it’s slanderous to question the orthodoxy of our university educations and how the vernacular they normalise may alienate the very people we say we want to help. But we’ve graduated from the once-derided online “slacktivism” to regularly showing up at protests in solidarity, to shutting up when it’s obvious our lived experience isn’t the one requiring a platform, and to organising our way into mass-scale conversations with people we’d never share a Facebook feed algorithm with. We’ve still got a way to go in self-reflection, but more urgently, we’ve got to create a place in our movement where people – so many of whom already have the inkling that the status quo is not working – can belong. Right until the end of the Auckland Central campaign, we kept expanding our community. That mess of human reality and social evolution, changing and challenging ideas cannot be delivered through a Twitter feed, but meets you at the doorstep. At the polls, we heard they were running out of on-the-day enrolment forms for people who had not planned to vote but decided to turn up. You don’t grow a movement with perfection. You don’t spread an idea when only one person can articulate it. You don’t empower communities when they don’t have a place to belong. Our local campaign was one small proof-of-concept microcosm of work that Indigenous organisers, climate activists, and justice advocates have been doing for decades. It’s based on a radical notion in increasingly individualised societies: grassroots organising, human connection and conversation changes our world. What if we all did the least we could do? And what if we did it together?"

          "headline": "'What we do isn't rocket science': how Midtjylland started football's data revolution",
          "bodyText": "Think of it as the Moneyball derby. Not so long ago, the idea a club could gain a vital edge using mathematical models – let alone employ a theoretical physicist or track key performance indicators (KPI) – would have left real football men choking on their meat pies and Bovril. But when Liverpool host Midtjylland in the Champions League on Tuesday, it will not only be a meeting between the champions of England and Denmark, but one between the twin vanguards of the sport’s analytics revolution. Midtjylland became the movement’s poster child in 2014 when they started using deeper metrics – such as expected goals and pre-assists to an assist – to better evaluate player performances, find undervalued bargains and to shatter myths and easy narratives. Many sneered when the unfashionable club from the centre of the Danish mainland – literally the middle of Jutland – also hired dedicated ball-striking and throw-in coaches and when their chairman, Rasmus Ankersen, promised to exploit inefficiencies in football. Winning three Danish Superliga titles in six years and qualifying for the Champions League for the first time this autumn have proved an effective riposte. More recently, Liverpool have become Midtjylland’s big-budget half-brother. Their highly regarded research department, which includes an analyst with a doctorate in high-energy physics from Harvard, has earned significant credit for its recruitment of a string of top-quality players. The bonds between the teams go further still, however. Two years ago, Jürgen Klopp headhunted Midtjylland’s throwing coach, Thomas Grønnemark. Since then, Liverpool’s statistics for retaining possession from throw-ins under pressure has shot up from 45.4% to 68.4% – taking them from one of the worst in the Premier League to the second-best in Europe. The team ahead of them? Midtjylland. “We also scored a lot of goals on long throws, then he went to Liverpool,” says Ankersen. Midtjylland were thrashed 4-0 at home to Atalanta in their opening Champions League game and the bookies make them huge underdogs against Liverpool. But if they have a chance of making their hosts uncomfortable, it will probably come at set pieces, where they consistently ranked among the most successful teams in Europe. It is the result – the club’s amiable captain, Erik Sviatchenko, explains – of analysts scrutinising thousands of free-kicks and corners and distilling them into an American football-style set-piece playbook of 20-25 routines. “Other clubs do this,” he says. “But when you see the data, 49% of all our goals last season were scored on set pieces. They are something our club and our owner, Matthew Benham, sees as a clear point for winning or changing games.” Benham is the key figure in the Midtjylland story. Since taking a controlling stake in 2014 – two years after he did so in England at Brentford – he has used similar methods and models to those that helped him win millions as a professional gambler. His company, Smartodds, which analyses matches and players in dozens of leagues around the world, is also used by the club. It all amounts, says Ankersen, to a different way of thinking. “A professional gambler seeks an edge over the market. He is not getting it right all the time. He’s looking for value. However, in football there are a lot of emotional mechanics that lead to people not making rational decisions – that sets them back.” Ankersen says data is key because it helps Midtjylland get closer to the truth. “In football the stories we tell ourselves are often wrong,” he says. “Look what happens when a team goes through a bad set of results. The fans and the media search for a narrative to explain it. It’s the same when a team does well. “Last season, for instance, we won the league by 14 points. People were saying we were doing fantastically well. But when you looked at the underlying data, we didn’t actually improve. Our closest competitors got worse. And once you’ve seen regression to the mean, again and again, you build up a big belief that this is the right way of doing things.” The club even have a league table that shows where each team would be in the standings based on its underlying numbers, calculated by Benham’s team at Smartodds. “Even if I were allowed, I couldn’t tell you the precise algorithm involved,” says the head performance analyst, Søren Bjerg. “But expected goals is in there, as well as how opponents have been doing and whether a team has changed its coach and so on. There are a lot of variables.” These days almost every club has an analytics department. So how does a club stay ahead in a world where expected goals is now on Match of the Day and the easiest analytical advantages have already been exploited? Ankersen, understandably, does not want to give every secret away. But he says there are still inefficiencies – if a club knows where to find them. “The Brazilian transfer market is really chaotic, for instance,” he says. “The value of a player can change by a few hundred percent over a couple of months. It’s a highly irrational and emotional market. If you can pick up players when they are on a low, there’s a lot of value.” The signings of Paulinho, “an outstanding left back”, as well as Evander, who “on his day is the best player in the Danish league” after he lost his way at Vasco De Gama, shows Midtjylland practice what they preach. Ankersen also believes that some clubs are still doing “simple things” wrong, like taking too many shots from locations where the probability of scoring is too low - and points to the growth of three-point shooting in basketball as an example of a sport that’s become more efficient. Meanwhile Sviatchenko says another edge comes through using sports psychologist BS Christiansen, a former elite soldier from the Danish Huntsmen Corps, who is “especially good when we need to get together and talk through things”. “I don’t think a lot of what we do is rocket science,” says Ankersen. “But where we may be ahead still is that this is driven from the top. It’s not two interns in the basement working with data. The belief system comes from Matthew, from me and it filters down.” Ankersen says one KPI coaches have been given this season is to increase the team’s Smartodds rating up by 0.5 goals. “So between us we are asking: ‘Where’s that improvement going to come from? Is it going to come from set pieces? Where are the low-hanging fruits defensively and offensively? In which phases of the game?’” A knock-on effect is that Midtjylland keep chasing a second and third goal when they are 1-0 up, says Bjerg. Is that because your experts have worked out it is better not to sit on a lead? “Exactly,” he says. “But it also suits our style of play. Our mindset isn’t to sit back. The whole club DNA is about achieving things rather than protecting the stuff you have already got.” Those watching on Tuesday will see Midtjylland play a 4-2-3-1 formation and like to press – much like Liverpool. “We also have a little bit of X-Factor on our day, especially with Pione Sisto and Evander,” says Ankersen. Four years ago, Sisto was also a scorer when Midtjylland stunned Manchester United in the first leg of a Europa League last-32 tie. Toppling Liverpool, Ankersen says, would be another level again, but he is not entirely ruling it out. “It’s going to be very difficult,” he says. “We will need to play to our best, and have a bit of luck. But bigger miracles have happened in football.”"

          "headline": "Home food delivery: what is the most ethical way to order in?",
          "bodyText": "The food delivery industry has boomed during the coronavirus pandemic, but not without some allegations of questionable practices that have drawn the ire of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The major players in the market, Uber Eats, Deliveroo, Menulog and DoorDash, all offer similar services, with concerns that they share little about how they operate. With pay for contracted drivers determined by algorithms, and often below minimum wage, industry representatives allege food delivery apps are creating unsafe and unfair conditions for drivers. Joe Corrigan, co-founder of Ride On, a driver-owned delivery platform connecting restaurants with drivers rather than consumers, says “pretty much everyone is getting screwed on the back of the convenience for the consumer”. It all raises questions on the ethics of paying to have food delivered to you, with the pandemic itself exacerbating problems for couriers and restaurants. Are couriers treated fairly? Couriers are generally employed as “independent contractors”, which means they are not entitled to paid leave, sick pay, superannuation and other benefits. There is very little training, and there is no protection for delivery drivers during bad weather. They are not paid extra for petrol or to maintain their vehicles. A survey conducted by the Transport Workers’ Union also found that one in three drivers had been injured on the job, with the vast majority (80%) receiving no support from their company. “Essential frontline transport workers are also getting sacked with little or no warning and no chance to argue their case during the pandemic,” TWU national secretary Michael Kaine says. “This is nothing short of heartless given the rising unemployment situation in Australia.” Many couriers are recent immigrants and students as well, exacerbating the precariousness of their finances. In April, the Fair Work Commission ruled that drivers were not employees, but a parliamentary inquiry in New South Wales will be looking at the business model, while the Victorian government is considering how to regulate the sector. How much are couriers paid? Across all the major platforms, an algorithm decides how much independently contracted couriers are paid per delivery, instead of an hourly rate. This means that factors such as delivery distance, speed, how busy it is and whether there are multiple drop-offs are all factored into how much a courier is paid. It is an opaque system that makes it difficult to pin down an exact amount couriers can be expected to be paid an hour. It also means they are routinely paid below minimum wages, which is $19.84 an hour. The TWU put it more bluntly, saying none of the delivery companies offer minimum rates for couriers. “Riders and drivers continue to experience appalling abuses at the hands of food delivery companies – and the pandemic has made matters worse,” Kaine says. Corrigan says the manner in which delivery drivers are paid creates more inequity than opportunity. “You’re getting less than minimum wage, oftentimes far worse, you have to work without protections, and it’s exploiting the needy in many cases,” he says. “But there are still people who take benefit from it, it has that flexibility. But, by and large, it does exploit the needy and the desperate.” A survey conducted by the the TWU in September found that couriers were earning, on average, just over $10 an hour. But with an increase in drivers signing up, it has made it difficult for couriers to make enough to live. Are drivers at high risk of contracting Covid? Delivery services have almost universally adopted contactless procedures. That means couriers can place the order at doorsteps without interacting with the customer. But it doesn’t mean that drivers are completely safe. Unions have urged delivery services to provide protective equipment such as masks and gloves for couriers. Deliveroo, Uber and DoorDash say they will provide assistance to drivers and riders diagnosed with Covid-19 for up to 14 days. However, with no food delivery app providing sick leave or workers’ compensation to contractors, there is no support for drivers who need to self-isolate as a precaution, or falls ill with something unrelated to Covid-19. How much do restaurants make? Restaurants and cafes usually pay a significant cut of their orders to these platforms. Uber Eats takes a 30% commission on each order, having dropped it from 35% earlier this year. Deliveroo also takes 30% commission on each order, with variations on the rate based on each individual restaurant’s relationship with the service. DoorDash also recently slashed its commission by 50%, but would not outline how much exactly is taken from each order. The company told Guardian Australia: “DoorDash’s restaurant service fees vary based on an assortment of factors which are customised based on the partnership with each restaurant.” Menulog is just as vague with its commission rate, instead focusing on the maximum commission of 14% it offers to its “self-delivery” service, which is where restaurants provide their own drivers. The issue of delivery commissions has been a contentious one, with a variety of petitions calling for apps to cut commissions as the pandemic took hold in Australia. The petitions, in addition to pressure from the industry, eventually persuaded Uber to cut their commissions. So why do restaurants and cafes turn to these platforms? Plainly, because they are bringing customers when dining in is not an option. Corrigan explains that the sheer volume of customers these platforms can hold makes it a difficult deal to turn down, especially in cities affected by lockdown. “The way they get away with it is because they bring customers, and most places can’t say no to an order that comes in.” How have the platforms supported restaurants? Uber Eats and Menulog announced in March that they would provide “stimulus packages” to restaurants as lockdowns came into effect across the country. The Uber Eats package was said to fund promotions on the app, while restaurants could now receive daily payments as opposed to weekly. New restaurants and caterers signing on also had their sign-on fees waived. Menulog’s package included $3m in marketing support, and said it would halve commission on pick-up orders, where there isn’t a courier. But resentment from small business restaurant owners, angry at being wholly dependent on tech companies, is growing. “There’s a lot of hatred or anger towards them, because they really feel dependent,” Corrigan says. “Particularly now, where a majority of their business comes via delivery, and 30% of their revenue goes to their platforms. And if you stop, you’re out of business.” Is it better to pick it up yourself? Most restaurants would prefer that customers come in and pick up their orders themselves. “Take-away is usually preferred, they don’t have to pay commission, they don’t have to worry about all the operational headaches of delivery,” Corrigan says, adding that customers should also try to order online or by calling up. Corrigan encourages consumers to get in contact with the restaurant, saying some still have their own internal delivery drivers. Finally, be compassionate to couriers and restaurants, in treatment and in your review. Many are under enormous pressure and bad reviews could shut down a small business trying to make ends meet."

          "headline": "Boris Johnson is learning that in politics you cannot simply 'follow the science'",
          "bodyText": "What happened to following the science? In the spring, when Boris Johnson and his scientific advisers were proceeding in lockstep, there was no disagreement about the necessity of shutting the country down. Now the government is coming to its own conclusions about what is needed, and the scientists on the Sage advisory group have started distancing themselves from No 10’s decisions. Critics complain that the politicians are chancing it rather than being led by the evidence. But as the German sociologist Max Weber argued a century ago, politics can never really follow the science. Pretending that it can is where the trouble starts. Weber believed that politics and science do not mix. In the end, political decision-making has to rest on personal judgment – there is no scientific manual to tell leaders what to do. More to the point, scientists are not well suited to making those decisions. They want the facts to speak for themselves. That is wishful thinking: facts alone cannot tell us what to do. In politics, expecting the evidence to point the way does not reduce the arbitrariness of the outcome. All political choices are arbitrary to a degree. Using statistics to justify difficult decisions just makes them appear more arbitrary for anyone who happens to disagree. The widespread consensus in March that a national lockdown was needed – shared not just by national politicians and their expert advisers, but by the public too – was not primarily driven by the science. It came from a joint conviction that things were getting out of control. Something had to be done. Most people began social distancing well before the government mandated it, and many stopped before the government told them it was safe. In the spring, Johnson could plausibly claim to speak for the country as a whole when he took drastic action. Now he speaks for almost no one. He is making his own decisions, which is what we pay him to do. His problem is that he can’t admit it. He has to pretend that nakedly political judgments – about who gets what, and who pays the price – are being calibrated to a more nuanced understanding of the evidence. He is weighing up a virus whose health impacts are concentrated locally against economic consequences where the effects are national. Manchester v London is not a problem that can be solved by an algorithm or better stats. But Johnson’s justification for his political choices is still being couched as data-driven. He wants us to think that he hasn’t abandoned the science, he has just got better at reading it. It’s a threadbare position to be in, and almost no one buys it. Moving to three tiers, with constant reviews of who belongs where as more data come in, gives at best a spurious impression of greater accuracy. Really it’s just much more arbitrariness. As a result, Johnson is now vulnerable on two flanks. From one side he can be attacked by Keir Starmer, who is able not only to out-science him but to do it with political conviction. The demand for a national “circuit-breaker” lockdown has teeth coming from the Labour leader because it is backed up by an implicit appeal to fairness. If decisions are going to be arbitrary, they may as well be easily understood and apply equally to all. Current public support for wider measures is driven by a wish to see the same rules for everyone. Of course, Starmer can also claim the backing of Sage. But if that was all he had, it wouldn’t be enough. The facts never speak for themselves. He’s also got personal political conviction to sustain him. On the other side, Johnson is under attack from those who have had enough of the science altogether. Whenever politics claims to be a scientific enterprise, it leaves a vacuum for real politics to fill. There are plenty willing to fill it. Rebellious Tory backbenchers are demanding that a higher value be put on personal freedom, which is not a scientific concept and cannot be quantified. At the same time, regional politicians are demanding that the government recognise the damage its decisions are doing to the people they represent. If they are going to be locked down by central diktat, they want some compensation for the seemingly random inconvenience. Why us, they ask, and why not those people over there? Science can’t give an answer to that question. Suggesting that it can, by continually fine-tuning the rules to take account of more and more data points, ends up in farce. Either it means that everything becomes arbitrary – because decisions about who goes into which tier will be reduced to negotiating over whose evidence we believe today. Or it waits on the arrival of an algorithm so sophisticated it can know what needs to happen in every part of the country at any given time. At that point it won’t only be Tory backbenchers who start worrying about the threat to personal freedom. Starmer, who wants the government to go further, and Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, who wants the government to back off, are both part of the Labour opposition. How can these positions be reconciled? Easily. There is no inconsistency in a national politician speaking for the country as a whole, and a local politician speaking for local constituents. That’s how our democracy is meant to work. The oldest question in democratic politics is: who gets to speak on behalf of whom? That is why it is so misleading to think that it is the job of politicians to speak on behalf of the evidence. Political legitimacy comes from having a claim to represent the interests of people who cannot otherwise speak for themselves. Starmer can plausibly make that claim, on behalf of the country as a whole that is increasingly bemused by the way it is being governed. Burnham can make that claim, on behalf of the people of Manchester, who believe that the government is ignoring the conditions on the ground. And who knows the conditions on the ground best? Not the scientists. It’s the people who live there. What is Johnson’s answer to the who-whom question? He can say he speaks for the people who voted him into office in order to take difficult decisions, but the fact that many MPs for former “red wall” constituencies in northern England, which gave him his victory, initially joined the rebellion makes that a lot harder. If Johnson speaks only for himself, or for Dominic Cummings, he is in deep trouble. Meanwhile, he seems to be waiting for science to come to his rescue. Whether it is a “moonshot” mass testing programme or a vaccine developed by British scientists, Johnson is looking for an unarguable scientific result to get him off the hook. But, as Weber insisted, there is nothing unarguable about science in politics. Even a successful vaccine won’t relieve Johnson of the need to make difficult decisions. How will we determine who gets it first? What will he do about the people who refuse to take it? In the end, science won’t save him. Only politics can do that. • David Runciman is professor of politics at Cambridge University, and host of the Talking Politics podcast"

          "headline": "David Pocock: 'I've got a lot more comfortable just being a bit weird and different'",
          "bodyText": "David Pocock is planning a dinner party. The guest list is already proving a toilsome task when he realises he is allowed to invite the dead along with the living. “How many people are we talking?” he ventures. “This could be epic.” After careful contemplation, he lands on Mahatma Gandhi. “Gandhi would be pretty weird to have there,” he tells Guardian Australia. “Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X.” Also present at the hypothetical soiree is American comedian and podcaster Joe Rogan, several musicians, David Attenborough and the late African conservation visionary Garth Owen-Smith. “Then you need a few real mad people.” Donald Trump? Boris Johnson? “Oh hell no, not that kind of mad. More like a good human with a bit of a glint in their eye.” This party has KeepCups and general wholesomeness written all over it. And for one hosted by a former Wallabies captain and perhaps the world’s most exceptional defensive openside flanker, it is strikingly scant on fellow sportspeople. Pocock, after all, quaffs more existential stuff. It is no shock the 32-year-old has called time on his 15-year professional career. At the conclusion of the 2019 Super Rugby season, the two-time John Eales medallist and three-time world player of the year nominee left the Brumbies, his home for the seven years following his seven at Western Force. Last year’s humbling World Cup quarter-final exit to England marked his 83rd and final Test after 11 years in the gold jumper. He saw out the 2019-20 season in Ōta with the Panasonic Wild Knights, but has opted not to return to the Japanese Top League. What comes next is less surprising still. The long-time climate crusader’s full-time foray into conservation was solidified during his 2017 sabbatical, but can be traced back to his childhood on a farm in birth country the country of his birth, Zimbabwe. Obsessed with birds and animals, a 10-year-old Pocock wrote to National Geographic Magazine to take issue with an article on cheetahs. “My argument was they couldn’t be a true cat because they couldn’t retract their claws,” he says. “Months and months later this letter arrived in the middle of Zimbabwe with this little package full of information on cheetahs and a note from someone at National Geographic. I was so pumped. That’s where it started. Having said that, we were super conventional farmers. We used so many chemicals and inputs and all the rest.” Those practices were a product of their time. Since his family fled Gweru at the height of Robert Mugabe’s farm invasions, Pocock has been pressing for a paradigm shift from policy-makers, farmers and everyday people. The pitch sounds fantastical, but he is not one for reductive tokenism. He and wife Emma are overseeing the Rangelands Restoration Trust, an endeavour aimed at regenerating degraded rangelands and increasing biodiversity. Its first project is a 70,000-hectare wildlife area in southern Zimbabwe surrounded by communal land. Discussions are being had about expanding to work with communities on livestock management. Coronavirus is making logistics and funding difficult but Pocock, who has almost completed his Master of Sustainable Agriculture, hopes to travel to Zimbabwe early next year. It is almost six years ago that a 26-year-old Pocock was arrested for chaining himself to a tractor in protest over the opening of the Maules Creek coal mine in northern New South Wales. Today the fire burns just as bright. “But, like all these really wicked problems, we need policy from the government that’s actually encouraging it. When you look at where we currently are with climate and biodiversity, we’ve got agriculture, which employs way more than coal mining, yet the coal miners are getting $12bn a year in subsidies.” Kevin Rudd’s name pops up, and there is an alignment with the former Australian prime minister’s environmental vision and grave concerns about a concentrated media landscape. “You look at climate reporting and just how urgent it is. In terms of news on the climate and on the environment, if you picked up most newspapers you wouldn’t know we’re a world leader in extinction and not looking after a whole bunch of endangered species.” After all, “humans evolved in nature, but the Facebook algorithm has us”. Even with 136,000 Twitter followers, there is a love-hate relationship with social media, an inability to tell whether he is driving real engagement or “fuelling recreational outrage”. “Are they echo chambers or just horrendous vitriol?” he asks. “People follow me on social media because of rugby. It’s finding ways to connect on other things that will be the challenge.” Shouldering the dual role of high-profile athlete and activist requires careful navigation. For some, public moral conviction is a conversation-starter – a critical vessel to change. For others, the scrutiny that generates is too much. It is a friction stemming from the inseparability of sport and politics, an arena in which an athlete’s obligations are ill-defined, and often personal. A player’s very presence on a field – or absence from it – can be a protest. The message, as Pocock well knows, is vulnerable to getting lost in unsavoury tit for tat. In 2015, having pledged not to wed Emma until gay marriage was made legal (they did so in December 2018), the Brumbies vice-captain called out Waratahs forward Jacques Potgieter for twice calling two teammates “faggot” during a Super Rugby match. He complained to the referee, then received heavy criticism for causing a drama. After a Sanzar investigation, Potgieter apologised. Pocock commended him for it. Last year, in the midst of the Israel Folau “hell awaits” gay people saga, he openly pointed the finger at his Wallabies colleague for using his platform in an “incredibly disappointing” way. Every word, though, is tactful. Pocock has never forced his views onto fellow players, nor aimed to disrupt their focus. This remained the case throughout this week, when a conversation about taking a knee before the third Bledisloe Cup Test in support of Black Lives Matter generated controversy. Pocock kept his counsel, wary of disrupting the Wallabies’ preparations and cognisant of giving a playing group he left only recently space to speak for themselves. Indeed, the end of the Pocock era has heralded an inevitable rebuild. A loyal Michael Cheika supporter quick to defend his outgoing coach from post-World Cup “pot-shots”, he is optimistic about Dave Rennie’s brave new world. “From what I hear, guys in camp are very happy and enjoying it, and I think that’s shown in the last couple of performances,” he says. “Early days, but I’m really looking forward to watching a whole new bunch of Wallabies get an opportunity and hopefully build something over the next four years … he really seems to be picking guys on form and has given a bunch of young guys a crack who played really well through Super Rugby AU. That’s really exciting. I remember in 2008 getting my opportunity as a 20-year-old. Robbie Deans was kind of the same – he was willing to give guys a crack.” Not that Pocock is all that inclined to revisit the past – his Wallabies debut, that coming-of-age 2011 World Cup quarter-final display against South Africa, for whom he had once dreamed of playing, and the knee reconstructions that headlined a litany of injuries. Or of having wanted to play at a World Cup since watching the 1995 tournament as a kid on his grandfather’s farm and then playing in three, and of the ultimate disappointment that accompanied each exit. “How many people have helped me get to where I’ve got? It just rams home how much of a myth personal achievement is,” he says. Such sentiments characterise a deep thinker from way back. Pocock is remarkably mild-mannered for a specimen of such physicality his teammates affectionately called him “Bam Bam”. Nuggety as a wombat, the 115kg, 184cm package is protein powder personified. In recent months the training has been toned down from “fit” to “active”, though that still involves meeting mates to lift and carry big rocks up grassy hills by the Murrumbidgee River. Beneath the brawn is a self-confessed “introvert”. Emma, he says, prefers the word “cagey”. “I’ve got a lot more comfortable just being a bit weird and different.” There are examples. At a pre-2019 World Cup camp in New Caledonia, Wallabies team manager Patrick Molihan found Pocock halfway up a tree buried in a book. “An enormous one that has the roots going into the ground and is super easy to climb. This is super cliched, but I think it might have even been The Overstory that I took on that trip. He [Molihan] took a photo and sent it to management, so they were all giving me shit about it. “Emma gives me crap because I’ve never read or watched Harry Potter, I’ve never seen Game of Thrones. When it comes to pop culture I’m useless. I’m the worst pub quiz person you could possibly want on your team, unless the question is like, ‘what’s the world’s highest waterfall?’” Pocock does know music, having discovered Triple J on arrival in Australia as a 14-year-old. For a country where “taxpayers fund a lot of dumb stuff”, the socially aware youth station offered everything a Christian upbringing did not. He would no longer call himself religious, and the marriage equality issue has “caused some strife with relatives”. “People have been reading the Bible a certain way for a long time, and to talk about love and inclusivity is challenging to some people. But that’s really changing. People are starting to see just how valid and human different relationships are. It’s very hard to hate people when you actually get to know them.” For this reason people have been at the heart of Pocock’s philanthropy. In the past he has worked more directly on community development, focusing solely on livelihoods and education, health and infrastructure. In the future, he has not ruled out politics. “Right now I’ve decided to try and spend my time addressing some of the underlying issues keeping communities in that sort of state where you are really struggling just to feed your family, let alone make a living off the land,” he says. “Their lives are totally dependent on it.”"

          "headline": "Quick bye: I watched all of Quibi’s ‘quick bites’ so you never have to",
          "bodyText": "Ah, Quibi, we hardly knew ye. The new streaming platform’s demise this week has left most of us with many questions, such as, “What’s a Quibi?”, “Is it as disgusting as it sounds?” and “Isn’t it Lidl’s own brand version of Angel Delight?” Launched in April this year, Quibi, a portmanteau of “quick” and “bite” (as in, “Quick, bite off my ears, so I never have to hear the word Quibi again”) came promising original short content for our smartphones – although even it must have been surprised by just how short it ended up being. Quibi’s gimmick was that no episode was longer than 10 minutes, because they assumed that’s how millennials like to consume content – watching a tiny bit of a show on a tiny screen in between eating their avocado toast, spinning their Marie Kondo fidget spinner and killing various industries by not being born in the 1960s. Why did Quibi collapse? Maybe the pandemic means fewer people are commuting, so fewer people need short-form content. Maybe a dramatically changing world is a bad time to release something new, when people crave the familiar amid the chaos. Or maybe a TV show where people try to recreate a meal that’s been shot at their faces through a cannon isn’t the basis for a successful business. Who can say? Well, me, potentially – in one of my routine attempts to numb my brain from the horrors of reality, I spent last week watching nothing but Quibi. What was meant as an exercise in getting cheap laughs has been turned by circumstance into an elegy for a poor, misunderstood app, a chance to chronicle the final days of Quibi. I hope I can do it justice. Monday, 10am God, I hate this app. I’m having trouble working out what to start with, mostly because every show looks like a straight-to-DVD movie that you would see advertised on the tube, starring Ray Winstone and an extra from 1917, with names like FORGIVE US OUR SINS or I’M GONNA NUT YOU, STEVE. After a fair amount of bored scrolling, I decide to plump for Wireless, mostly because the poster is of a tired, cold man looking grumpily at his phone, and it’s nice to see myself represented in the media. Wireless is a 10-part thriller about a twentysomething man (Tye Sheridan) driving to a New Year’s Eve party in the middle of a snowstorm. He’s late, and also drunk, and also, like I say, there’s a snowstorm, so you can kind of guess where this is going. There are a lot of long periods where you’re just watching a man text and scroll through his messages, though. Do they know they’ve only got eight minutes? Monday, 10.20am It turns out if you flip the phone to the side and watch it portrait mode, you see what’s on Tye’s phone – so all those bits earlier when I was watching him just stare blankly at his phone, I was supposed to turn my phone to the side to watch the much more interesting stuff (Instagram videos of his ex-girlfriend, etc) happening on his phone. This is a really inventive innovation, and I despise it with every fibre of my being because I have to flip the phone every five seconds to make sure I’m not missing some crucial plot point. Holding the phone like a steering wheel, I feel like I’m playing the most boring game of Mario Kart imaginable, where the reward isn’t the Mushroom Cup, it’s seeing the text messages of an alcoholic as he freezes to death in a truck. In summary, 7/10. Tuesday After Wireless, I have been recommended #FreeRayShawn, a drama in 15 parts, about a black man who finds himself wrongly accused of assaulting a police officer, and is then besieged in his apartment with his family as trigger-happy New Orleans police fire at him. It’s powerful, it’s upsetting, it has three remarkable performances from Stephan James, Laurence Fishburne and an Emmy-winning turn by Jasmine Cephas Jones. It feels almost offensive to everyone involved that I can only watch it on a tiny phone-screen. It’s as if Ta-Nehisi Coates released a new searing nonfiction book on the brutal realities of being black in America that could only be consumed as a 3,000-part text message on a Nokia 3310. Really, this should have been a two-hour film, not 15 “quick bites”. It feels like the format is actively fighting against the content – maybe the thorny problem of racial inequality and police brutality is something that needs to be tackled in something more substantial than a series of quick bites. That’s really more of a “sit-down meal” matter. Wednesday, 4am Note to self: start a new rival streaming service to Quibi called Sitdown Meals, where every piece of content is eight hours long and can only be watched on your electric toothbrush. I’ll be rich, rich, I tells ya. Wednesday, 9am Today I’m moving on to comedy, because after watching two depressing thrillers in a row I’m worried the Quibi algorithm is starting to judge me. I kick off with Hello America, Nish Kumar’s bite-size topical show where he lampoons American politics with a British bent, and it’s a welcome change of pace from #FreeRayShawn, in that at no point did I fear a sniper was going to blow the main character’s head off. Most importantly, it actually works with the format of “quick bite” – in that it’s self-contained and satisfying on its own. It’s like a handful of dry-roasted peanuts, while a single episode of Wireless is a spoonful of mustard, in that it doesn’t work on its own and requires a bunch more ingredients for any kind of successful resolution. On the opposite end of the spectrum, I get about six minutes into the first episode of Dummy, a comedy series starring Anna Kendrick and her boyfriend’s sentient sex doll, before I suddenly start to question what I’m doing with my life. The moment that pushed me over the edge was when the sex doll asked Anna to clean out her vagina. I turn off my phone, place it calmly underneath a settee cushion, and go for a two-hour walk. Thursday After yesterday’s debacle, it’s back to the algorithm that thinks I’m an explosives-obsessed gun nut that feeds off the despair of others. Today it’s Most Dangerous Game, and it is gloriously, unashamedly shit. Liam Hemsworth plays a man called Dodge Tynes (Dodge! Tynes! A professional writer wrote down those two words and decided: “Yes, that is the name a human man might have, and not a character from the Cars universe”), an athlete turned bankrupt entrepreneur who has just been diagnosed with terminal cancer. So far, so depressing. Wanting to provide for his pregnant wife after he’s gone, he accepts the challenge of a delightfully camp Christoph Waltz – in return for a prize of $24.5m (£19m), all Dodge has to do is survive in the city of Detroit while a bunch of eccentric anonymous billionaires try to kill him with knives. Dodge has no idea who the billionaires are – all we know about them is that they’re violent sociopaths, and they’ve been given the codenames of former US presidents (yes, one of them is called LBJ, and I’m delighted). From episode five, the series becomes a formulaic hot mess of nonsense – Swerve Prongs sprints through the city, away from a hunter (usually a sneering British man who dresses like he’s a Moss Bros model), before taking refuge in a church or a ferry or something. Evade Spikes will breathe a sigh of relief before, suddenly, the owner of the church/ferry takes out a knife, and THEY’RE A HUNTER WITH A PRESIDENT CODENAME, TOO! This happens constantly, and I love it every time. Towards the end of the series, Sidestep Spur walks up to a dog licking at a puddle, and I was half-expecting the dog to suddenly take out a knife and lunge at our hero while yelling “I’M BARACK OBAMA” More hunting humans for sport, I say! Friday So far, the only thing I’ve learned while watching Quibi is how to blow up your car to get out of a snowdrift (thanks, Wireless), so I decide to make Friday “education day”. First up, it’s Last Looks, a series that looks at scandals in the fashion world – and this episode is about Anna Sorokin, who managed to defraud nearly $300,000 from hotels by pretending to be a fake German heiress. It feels like a trailer for a cheap Netflix show – lots of exciting flashing images of her partying over footage of talking heads saying things like: “No one could believe she wasn’t a German heiress,” “Everyone thought she was a German heiress but actually she wasn’t a German heiress,” and by the end I’m really not sure I could tell you any specific facts about her, except that she said she was a German heiress, but she wasn’t a German heiress. This is the weird paradox at the heart of most Quibi shows – there’s not enough time to do the deep dive that actually makes the content interesting, but there’s not enough superficial content to fill all the time. It’s like if Tiger King was just a seven-minute clip of someone saying: “The guy owns a tiger. He shouldn’t own a tiger, but he owns a tiger. He’s called the Tiger King because he owns a tiger.” Saturday Despite being someone who still has nightmares about the ventriloquist dolls from Toy Story 4, the algorithm really wants me to watch some horror. I watch an episode of Fifty States of Fright, an anthology series where each episode is set in a different American state – so basically that Sufjan Stevens albums project where all the experimental indie-pop has been replaced by mediocre gross-out horror. I start with The Golden Arm, which went viral earlier this year for being Absolutely Baffling – Rachel Brosnahan loses her arm in a needlessly graphic lumberjack accident, so gets her husband to make her a replacement arm out of gold. Why? Because Quibi doesn’t have time for subtlety, so its analogies are as heavy-handed as, well, an arm made of gold. The gold arm starts poisoning her, but she still won’t take it off, and she makes her husband promise that he’ll bury her with ol’ Goldyarm. He does, but then he needs the money, so he digs her up, so she comes back from the dead and kills him. The moral of the story is either “always take proper safety precautions while lumberjacking”, or “just because something is directed by Sam Raimi and starring the woman from The Marvelous Mrs Maisel doesn’t mean it won’t be terrible”. That was Michigan, by the way – God only knows what they’ll be doing by the time they get to Delaware. A park ranger with a bronze foot? A plumber with a silver nose? A Nascar racer with platinum nipples? The possibilities are endless. Sunday I watch three episodes of Die Hart, a lousy comedy where Kevin Hart (playing himself) tries to learn how to be an action hero at an Action Star School run by John Travolta (not playing himself, confusingly) before giving up. Everyone just seems to be going through the motions, meaning that it feels like a tedious chore and incredibly self-indulgent. Midway through a tedious scene in which Hart points out that “Action Star School spells out “ass”, I feel a deep and yawning despair. What is Quibi? No one is having a good time making it, I’m not having a good time watching it, presumably no one’s making money from it. Who is any of this for? Why are so many great actors in these tiny pointless shows that no one will watch? Has this all just been an elaborate prank, on Kevin Hart, on Andie MacDowell, on Laurence Fishburne, and on me, the viewer? As I watch Kevin Hart mirthlessly say his catchphrase (“Oh, hell, no”) and run about a burning house with his arm on fire, I realise that Quibi wasn’t for anyone. Quibi existed for itself. It doesn’t matter if no one watched Quibi, Quibi must still be fed. Quibi is the golden arm – pointlessly flashy, hideously expensive and utterly pointless – and I can feel it slowly poison me. Perhaps it is for the best that it dies before me, before I’m lying on my deathbed, looking into my spouse’s eyes and whispering, “Promise me you’ll bury me with my Quibi. Promise me.”"

          "headline": "Seven questions about applying for a graduate job – answered by experts",
          "bodyText": "The employment landscape has changed completely since the start of the Covid-19 crisis and the number of graduate jobs advertised dropped by 60% in 2020, according to recent analysis by the CV-Library, representing a drastic overall reduction in the number of graduate jobs available and corresponding applications for those jobs. Unsurprisingly, given the current circumstances, the average number of applications for those graduate jobs that are advertised has jumped by 47% in the past 12 months. The industries seeing the biggest increase in applications included catering (up 58%), customer service (45%) and social care (43%). It’s not all doom and gloom though. The CV-Library’s figures also show that the average graduate starting salary is still up 7% from last year at £24,626, which is encouraging. Where do I start? Starting your job search can seem pretty daunting and overwhelming at first. There’s so much to think about. What are you good at? Is your degree relevant? Does it need to be? Which sectors are still recruiting anyway? You also need to think about what sort of impact the pandemic might have had on the company you are applying to, says Gaelle Blake, director for permanent appointments at recruiter Hays UK and Ireland. “This insight will come through in your application and also give you vital context for discussion if you go through to an interview,” she says. It may also be worth trying to specialise your search and hone in on a specific area, says Ellen Donnelly, founder of The Ask, a career coaching startup. “Don’t be afraid to go for something niche. Pick something that you believe you can do for the next couple of years even if you’re still figuring it out,” she says. Are many companies using algorithms to filter out unsuitable candidates? Lots of employers and recruitment agencies now use application tracking software (ATS) to store job seeker information. It’s essentially a database that stores CVs and, with the high volume of applications and hiring to be done, helps make the recruitment process efficient. But, if you don’t use keywords and highlight your relevant skills and experience, there’s a danger the ATS might automatically filter out your CV. So what can you do to beat the algorithm? How can I make sure my application stands out? Firstly, make sure you’re applying for relevant jobs, highlighting the specific skills you’ll bring to that role, says Natasha Woodford, director of recruitment at clockworkTalent, a digital marketing recruitment firm. “Use bullet points to draw attention to your skills and experience,” says Woodford. “Tell us about what technology you can use, where your area of expertise is, what deals you’ve completed, what tools you’ve used and what projects you’ve worked on.” Are there any other ways I can show off my skills and experience? Lucy Clarke, co-founder at Get Blogged, which matches bloggers and influencers with brands for sponsored content partnerships, says setting up a blog can also be a great way to get noticed and show off your skills to prospective employers. Setting up a blog gives graduates a chance to showcase a range of talents, including content creation, photography, editing, social media marketing and graphic design. “A website can be a fantastic way to show your passion for a particular subject or field and a brilliant tool to help jobseekers stand out in a competitive market,” says Clarke. I live in Leeds but I’ve seen a job I love in London. Should I still apply? In a word, yes, says Valerie Todd, HR director at Siemens UK and Ireland. “Location is no longer such a huge barrier because many more roles can now be done through remote, mobile or virtual working. Employers like us want to be accessible to talented people whatever their location.” Are Zoom interviews now ‘the norm’ and how do these compare with meeting face-to-face? Interviews via Zoom, Microsoft Teams or Webex are now pretty standard and Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a video interviewing company, says they are really not that different to traditional in-person interviews: “For candidates, virtual interviewing can be more convenient and help relieve some of the nerves and pressure of meeting face-to-face.” How should I prepare for a video interview? After doing a basic screen and sound check, making sure you have a professional background and that there is no noise from pets or flatmates, you should prepare for a video interview in much the same way that you would for a real one. Do your research on the company you are applying to, and be prepared for the usual questions on teamwork, adaptability and, given the fact that many people are now working from home, how you can work independently. Don’t forget it might also be possible to take a virtual tour of a prospective employer’s office online to see what they are like inside."

          "bodyText": "In August, A-level students joined forces to voice their anger on social media at the algorithm that failed to give them fair grades, helping force a government U-turn in favour of teacher-estimated results. Now, some of those same students are stuck in lockdowns at halls of residences at universities across the country, studying online and restricted to socialising with their households – and they’re angry again. “Students were mobilised by the A-level U-turn. Now they’ve come on to campus, they’re thinking: ‘I’m sitting in my room watching a screen, which I could have done at home, why am I paying this money?’. There’s growing political awareness that enough is enough,” says Sabrina Shah, co-president of the School of Oriental and African Studies students’ union. Shah says the students she speaks to are angry about the way some campus lockdowns are being policed by private security, the paltry food parcels they’ve been receiving from ill-prepared institutions, and a widespread feeling that they were enticed on to campus to shore up university finances despite the risks posed to their physical and mental health. There’s also a growing suspicion among students that they’re being kept in halls to discourage them from dropping out before December, when universities secure their tuition fee payments from the government, she says. As a result, grassroots activist groups are springing up online at campuses across the UK to coordinate actions. Students at several universities, including Warwick, Bristol and Glasgow, are running rent strikes involving hundreds of students. Others at universities including Glasgow, Manchester and Liverpool have organised groups under the name Students Before Profit to campaign for better conditions for students locked down in halls. “People think the university’s abandoned them,” says Laura Verdasco, a third-year psychology and neuroscience student at the University of Glasgow who’s been speaking to students to inform Students Before Profit’s work. “It’s their first year and the situation doesn’t seem to be getting much better, and it’s proven hard to talk to the university.” This grassroots activism complements a nationwide campaign launched by the National Union of Students (NUS) last month, called Students Deserve Better. The campaign aims to uphold students’ legal rights, including challenging rules that treat them differently to the wider population, safeguarding their finances and ensuring universities prioritise their safety. The NUS is also partnering with rent strike groups to provide activism training. “The only exciting thing about this moment that otherwise feels really bleak is that we’ve seen an upsurge in the number of localised, grassroots student movements,” says NUS president Larissa Kennedy. “We’re finding ways to support that work.” Despite some students and staff testifying to tension on campuses, they are increasingly joining forces to share their worries about the health risks of face to face teaching and to hold university leaders and the government to account. Shah has been speaking alongside staff members in rallies run by trade unions and grassroots activist networks. “Academics are on the side of the students,” she says. “I think the cross-union work is scaring the government and institutions. It means we’re more powerful.” Demands from the groups vary, but typically they ask for more testing; for all teaching be moved online until it is safe to meet face to face; for proper investment in quality remote teaching, including pausing redundancy plans and supplying disadvantaged students with equipment; for students to be released from their accommodation contracts, so they can go home; and – crucially – for the government to bail out any universities which struggle financially as a result. There is tension in the movement over whether students should receive refunds: while various petitions and student groups such as Refund Us Now are asking for discounts on their education, some believe that this consumer behaviour plays into the marketised higher education system, and see it as a distraction from the broader call to abolish tuition fees. The challenge staff and students are facing is how to make their voices heard when they can’t meet in person or organise protests. Instead, they’re turning to online networks to galvanise their movement. One staff-led group, UCU Solidarity, sprang up in response to the wave of redundancy announcements at the beginning of the pandemic as a way to support official action by the University and College Union (UCU). “When we’re working from home we’re atomised from our usual communities, so you have to build solidarity and organise and be seen and heard,” says Bee Hughes, one of UCU Solidarity’s informal organisers and a lecturer and UCU branch officer. “We’re trying to raise awareness, create community and form a grassroots movement.” UCU Solidarity recently organised a day of action in which staff and students came together to express their concerns. Events included socially distanced protests from students in Manchester, Glasgow, Soas and Brighton; online rallies; talks from MPs including Liverpool Riverside’s Kim Johnson; Twitter storms voicing complaints from angry staff and students at Ulster; and workshops on issues such as intellectual property for online learning. This activism has dovetailed with union branches across the country confronting their leaders after learning that the government’s scientific advisers had called for teaching to move online at the start of the academic year. “It’s quite a drop in the stomach feeling how bad things actually are,” says Vicky Blake, UCU president. “It’s a real moment of reckoning across the sector. There needs to be some leadership that goes beyond offering a few Pot Noodles to some students to make things better.” Blake thinks the union’s work has been given added power by staff and students’ grassroots activism and the networks they’ve developed to share experiences and offer support. She sees this as a distinctive feature of social organising online. “We’re learning from each other, across trade union and activist movements, how to do something positive that helps bring people together,” she says. “It’s quite an organic thing, and I think it shows how bad the situation is that people have been moved to organise in this way. But it also shows that there’s some hope.”"

          "bodyText": "Scientists have developed a new tool to predict the chances of a person developing tuberculosis, which could help limit the spread of the disease and improve the life chances of millions of people . Researchers at University College London (UCL) said they believe they have produced an algorithm that could help eliminate the disease in some countries. Country surveys gathered data from tens of thousands of people, including information on age, exposure to TB, whether an individual’s immune system is compromised and whether they are a migrant. Scientists at the Institute of Global Health say this is the first time that patient histories have been used to predict risk of developing active TB, which should help doctors determine what treatment to offer. Although most patients with active TB seek treatment from doctors, the algorithm is aimed at those who are infected with the bacteria at its latent stage when it does not yet cause illness. The study authors found that, from looking at data from more than 80,000 people, 16% of children who had latent TB infection and recent contact with someone with TB were at risk of developing active TB within five years of being tested. In adults with latent infection, the risk was around 5% for people with contact with others with TB, migrants from high transmission areas and people with compromised immunities. The findings also show that the risk of developing TB declines significantly over time and most cases of active TB are likely to develop within the first two years of latent infection. “If we can identify people at highest risk of TB disease, we can treat their infection with preventive antibiotics, before they become unwell,” said Dr Rishi Gupta, author of the paper. “Current tests to predict who will develop active TB are not very accurate. The risk of becoming unwell with TB among people with a positive test also depends on many factors – our study highlights the fact that young children, people recently exposed to TB and individuals with ‘higher’ positive test results have a significantly higher risk of developing TB disease.” Around 10 million people are infected with TB every year, according to the World Health Organization, but many cases go undetected. This increases the chance of spreading the disease, which is transmitted through the air. People are infected when they inhale even a small number of germs, which the body’s immune system can keep in check for years until the infection becomes active. Around a quarter of the world’s population have latent TB, according to the WHO. The UCL institute’s director, Prof Ibrahim Abubakar, said the new tool is “important because it allows us to give preventive treatment to people who are most likely to benefit and to avoid unnecessary treatment for people who are at very low risk. This takes us a step forward to be more precise.” He said that previously doctors have only had “a blunt tool” of testing for exposure to the bacteria and prescribing antibiotics, which can cause other health problems if given to someone who is not at risk of developing active TB. “If a person presents in rural Norfolk … a GP seeing them with a cough and weight loss will not think of TB because in their whole career they’ve never seen a case,” he said. “This tool adds to our armoury.” Their study, published in the Nature Medicine journal this week, was based on data from Europe, the US and Australia – low-transmission countries where they hope to help eliminate the disease. Abubakar said fighting TB in countries with high case numbers is more difficult because people can be reinfected after treatment. But as numbers decline, a similar model could help to eliminate the illness, which is especially high among refugees and migrants. The tool, he said, assesses risk according to a range of factors, including age, exposure and whether an individual’s immune system is compromised."

          "bodyText": "Good morning, this is Tamara Howie bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 20 October. Top stories Donald Trump has attacked the top US public health expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, calling him a “disaster” and claimed that “people are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots” in a conference call to his campaign staff. The president later went on Twitter to criticise Fauci over his TV appearance on 60 Minutes. The comments come as infections rise above 40 million globally and many European countries are bringing in localised lockdowns. A two-week national lockdown will be imposed in Wales, which the government hopes will give the NHS breathing space before winter. Poland will open a temporary hospital at Warsaw’s national stadium and a surge in infections in the Czech Republic has made it one of Europe’s worst-hit countries. Elsewhere, Iran reported a big spike in the daily number of coronavirus deaths, with a rise from 252 to a new record of 337. Journalists and environmental and human rights groups could face compulsory questioning by Asio as part of a proposed expansion of the spy agency’s powers, according to external legal advice. GetUp’s general counsel, Zaahir Edries, who did not prepare the advice, said the law was “a chilling attack on our democracy”. The bill to extend the reach of questioning powers could deter people from speaking to journalists, the advice argues. Russian military intelligence services were planning a cyber-attack on the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo, the UK National Cyber Security Centre has said. The UK’s foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, condemned the actionsas “cynical and reckless.” The Russian cyber-reconnaissance work covered the Games organisers, logistics services and sponsors and was under way before the Olympics was postponed due to coronavirus. The new evidence is the first indication that Russia was prepared to go as far as to disrupt the Games, from which all Russian competitors had been excluded because of persistent state-sponsored doping offences. Australia Tony Abbott’s decision to grant Prince Philip a knighthood cost Australian taxpayers $135,000. That’s the value of write-downs the governor general has made to insignia associated with knights and dames because they are deemed worthless after the awards were scrapped by Abbott’s successor, Malcolm Turnbull. Kevin Rudd has called for solar panels to be made compulsory on all new buildings and increased incentives as part of a “genuinely green recovery” from recession. The former PM says Australia risks becoming “the complacent country” and could suffer another recession if it remains tied to fossil fuels. Legal experts have warned that Gladys Berejiklian is likely to have breached the state’s ministerial code of conduct by failing to disclose her secret relationship with the disgraced former MP Daryl Maguire. Despite the intense public and political criticism over the past weeks, a majority of voters approve of her performance, according to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The world The UK has refused to restart Brexit deal negotiations despite the EU accepting its demands. A No 10 spokesman said: “The UK has noted the EU’s proposal to genuinely intensify talks ... However, the UK continues to believe there is no basis to resume talks unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU.” French police have raided dozens of Islamist groups and suspected extremists three days after a teacher was beheaded outside his school.

Scientists found that the recommended high-temperature process for sterilising plastic bottles caused bottles to shed millions of microplastics. Vietnam is preparing for a cyclone to hit the coast in the coming days. The storm is expected to add to the already existing trail of destruction from two storms this month, which left 102 people dead or missing, and forced 90,000 people to evacuate due to floods and landslides. Recommended reads It’s time for social media giants to update their guidelines to make room for everyone, writes Lacey-Jade Christie, after the Australian comedian Celeste Barber’s latest parody post on Instagram highlighted the platform’s discriminatory algorithm against those who aren’t thin, white or cis-gendered. Barber posted a parody side-by-side photo of her imitating a post from the former Victoria’s Secret model Candice Swanepoel, clutching her bare breast and exposing side boob. But while both photos revealed the exact same parts of each body, Instagram wouldn’t let fans share Barber’s post, saying “goes against our community guidelines on nudity or sexual activity”. Swanepoel’s post, meanwhile, went unreported. Australia’s post-Covid jobs snapback is all about part-time work, writes Greg Jericho. “The September labour force figures highlight just how difficult Australia’s recovery from the pandemic will be – the initial ‘snapback’ was quick, but leaves many jobs still to return. The recovery is all about part-time work and full-time work lost has barely returned at all.” For women in lockdown with kids, it’s hard to feel like a whole person with interests, desires and needs when you’re stuck wearing a mask that says “mother” all the time, says Kate Mildenhall. “Yes, we love our kids and, yes, we even love being mothers (it seems we still have to preface any mum-whingeing with this proviso), but lockdown, as necessary and important as it has been, took away our opportunities of being seen as anything other than a parent.” Listen All over the English-speaking world, conservative commentators have latched on to Sweden’s approach to coronavirus as a shining example other countries should follow.

          "headline": "Matt Hancock warns deaths doubled in 12 days; no agreement in Manchester tier 3 talks - as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has indicated that more areas of England could be subject to the strictest tier 3 restrictions. In a statement to MPs he said further discussions are planned this week with south Yorkshire, west Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, the north-east and Teesside about moving them into tier 3, the very high alert level. But talks with Greater Manchester about moving it into tier 3 remain deadlocked. (See 5.35pm.) Hancock told MPs the situation was perilous. He said: Weekly deaths in Europe have increased by 33% and here in the UK deaths have tragically doubled in the last 12 days. The situation remains perilous. During a long statement many MPs complained to Hancock about the performance of NHS Test and Trace. Sir Bernard Jenkin, the Conservative chair of the liaison committee, told Hancock: One of the reasons why public confidence is in somewhat decline in the government’s strategy is because we have yet to see the transformation of the leadership of test and trace about which I have discussed with him many times. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, has told a committee of MPs and peers that it is “unlikely” that a coronavirus vaccine will stop the disease completely. Speaking to the joint national security strategy committee, Vallance said: I think it is unlikely that we will end up with a truly sterilising vaccine that completely stops infection. It is likely that this disease will circulate and be pandemic. My assessment - and I think that’s the view of many people - is that’s the likely outcome. Clearly as management becomes better, as you get vaccination that will decrease the chance of infection and the severity of the disease - or whatever the protocols of the vaccines are - this then starts to look more like annual flu than anything else and that may be the direction we end up going in. A temporary national lockdown will be imposed in Wales, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has announced. In a report Welsh government advisers say this measure could save almost 1,000 lives by Christmas. (See 5.31pm. Tourism businesses in Wales are spending Monday cancelling customers’ holidays after the first minister Mark Drakeford announced a two-week national lockdown designed to be a “short, sharp shock to the virus to slow down its spread”. The UK has recorded 851 deaths over the past week - up 68% on the previous week, the latest daily figures show. (See 4.36pm.) About a third more deaths in England are occurring at home than before the Covid-19 pandemic, data has revealed, with the majority down to causes other than the coronavirus. Downing Street has said a procedural concession by the EU does not go far enough to justify restarting the UK-EU trade talks. (See 5.43pm.) The archbishop of Canterbury has led criticism of the internal market bill in the House of Lords during its second reading debate. Referring to the way the legislation would allow the government to break international law, by ignoring pledges made in the Brexit withdrawal agreement, Justin Welby said: In the Church of England, we are all too clearly aware of the shame that comes with failing morally. Let’s not make the same mistake at national level. This House exists to amend and improve legislation, not to derail it, and that must be our urgent aim now. Michael Howard, the former Tory leader and Brexiter, also criticised the bill. He quoted Margaret Thatcher, who said: “Britain does not break treaties. It would be bad for Britain. Bad for relations with the rest of the world and bad for any future treaty on trade.” That said it all, Howard told peers. He went on: I want the United Kingdom to be an independent and sovereign state. But I want it to be an independent sovereign state that holds its head up high in the world, that keeps its word, that upholds the rule of law, that honours its treaty obligations. I want it to be an independent sovereign state that is a beacon unto the nations. I do not want it to be an independent sovereign state that chooses, as one of the first assertions of that sovereignty, to break its word, to break the law and to renege on a treaty it signed barely a year ago. That’s all from me for tonight. But our coverage continues on our coronavirus live blog. It’s here. Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, has ridiculed a claim from Michael Gove that Brexit will make security cooperation with the EU easier. (See 4.47pm.) Ricketts, a former head of the Foreign Office, was national security adviser between 2010 and 2012. Despite the procedural concession from Michel Barnier (see 4pm), Downing Street says it is not enough for the UK-EU trade talks to formally resume. Following a call between Barnier and his UK counterpart, David Frost, this afternoon, a No 10 spokesperson said: This was a constructive discussion. The UK has noted the EU’s proposal to genuinely intensify talks, which is what would be expected at this stage in a negotiation. However, the UK continues to believe there is no basis to resume talks unless there is a fundamental change of approach from the EU. This means an EU approach consistent with trying to find an agreement between sovereign equals and with acceptance that movement needs to come from the EU side as well as the UK. The two teams agreed to remain in close touch. Matt Hancock is still speaking in the Commons, but while he has been on his feet the government has released a statement to journalists saying that “disappointingly” there has still been no agreement with Greater Manchester leaders. A government spokesperson said: A meeting between government and local leaders in Greater Manchester has concluded this afternoon following discussions throughout last week, over the weekend and this morning on measures necessary to protect the public. Disappointingly, we have still not been able to reach an agreement. This is particularly concerning against the backdrop of rising cases and hospitalisations in Greater Manchester. We are carefully considering next steps. The Welsh government has now published a paper from its technical advisory cell (its version of Sage) showing the modelling that led ministers to introduce the short firebreak lockdown. (Earlier I posted a link to another TAC document - see 1.13pm - but that was not the relevant one.) The correct link is here (pdf). The report includes this chart suggesting that a two-week firebreak could save almost 1,000 lives by Christmas. But, over the longer terms, fewer lives would be saved, the model suggests, because the death rate would fall more gradually than under the “no change” option. This model assumes that, after the firebreak, the R number returns to its previous level. The report says, after the firebreak, further measures should be introduced to keep the R number down. It says: It is recommended that a two-phase approach is used. The first phase is a “fire-break” – a swift and short-term period of simple, extreme restrictions across the whole of Wales that would significantly reduce the prevalence of the virus in Wales. This would ease the pressure on the NHS and offer some time for a reset of behaviours and implementation of new healthcare pathways, health protection approaches or other interventions that require a runup. Doing it over half term would reduce financial and social harms. At least two weeks would be needed ... The firebreak will have to reduce the national R (latest between 1.1 – 1.4) to below 0.9. This implies that R will need to be reduced in all areas of Wales, which requires a national approach rather than the current locally driven approach through local health protection areas (LPHAs). The second phase is a new, simpler, national approach to behaviours and restrictions. Simpler messaging and regulations are expected to be easier to understand and comply with. Some existing restrictions may be removed if they are shown to be less effective or more harmful than originally expected, such as the local authority travel boundary restrictions. However, there would need to be sustainable changes in behaviour in many areas of life in order for Rt to remain as near to 1 as possible. In the Commons Jeremy Hunt, the chair of the health committee, suggests that local leaders should be given responsibility for bringing down the R number locally. But, if they don’t, central government should “take back control”, he says. Hancock says the government is working with local councils. But he stresses the need for action in Manchester. He says in Manchester, amongst the over-60s, cases have gone up in the last week from 171 per 100,000 to 283 per 100,000. Hancock ended his statement by confirming what Boris Johnson said at his press conference on Friday about how rapid-result Covid tests were being distributed and piloted around the country in coming weeks, particularly in tier 3 areas. Hancock says talks are continuing this afternoon with Greater Manchester. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, is in the lead, he says. And he says further discussions are planned this week with south Yorkshire, west Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire, the north-east and Teesside about moving into the strictest tier 3. Hancock defends the Covid alert system. He says it makes sense to have different restrictions in different areas, according to the number of cases. He confirms that Lancashire has moved into tier 3. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is making a Covid statement to the Commons now. He says the virus is on the offensive. Deaths have doubled in the last 12 days, he says. The situation is perilous. Here are the quotes from the rather testy exchanges between Theresa May, the former prime minister, and Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, on Brexit in the Commons earlier. May sacked Gove from cabinet when she became PM, although he got a reprieve after the 2017 general election. May said: The government appears resigned to the prospect of no deal, yet one area which they should not be resigned to the prospect of no deal is in security. She said neither Gove nor Boris Johnson had mentioned security in recent statements. She went on: Will [Gove] confirm that, if the UK walks away with no deal, then our police and law enforcement agencies will no longer have the necessary access to databases, such as PNR (passenger name record), in order to continue to identify and catch criminals and potential terrorists in order to keep us safe? In reply, Gove said “significant progress” has been made over security cooperation, adding: But it is the case that the EU are insisting that, before we have access to systems, like the Schengen Information System, we have to accept the jurisdiction of the European court of justice - we cannot accept that. The second thing I’d say is there are many, many areas in which we can cooperate more effectively to safeguard our borders outside the European Union than we ever could inside, through a variety of methods and arrangements open to us, open to Border Force and open to our security and intelligence services - we can intensify the security that we give to the British people. The third thing I’d say to [May] is that I agree with her: when it comes to everything, security and other matters, no deal is better than a bad deal. These are from my colleague Josh Halliday, with the latest on the talks that Greater Manchester council leaders were holding with the government this afternoon. The UK government has just updated its coronavirus dashboard. Here are the key figures. The UK has recorded 18,804 further positive cases. This is the highest figure since Thursday last week (18,980) and the third highest figure on record, excluding a day when the figure was inflated by the addition of past cases. A week ago today the figure was 13,972. It means the recent surge in positive cases has been sustained. The UK has recorded 80 further coronavirus deaths. That is well below the daily total on most days last week, when the daily total peaked at 150 on Saturday, but it is above the figure for this time last week (50). The UK has recorded 851 deaths over the past week - up 68% on the previous week. The number of Covid hospital patients on mechanical ventilation in England has passed 500 for the first time in this phase of the crisis. On Sunday, the last day for which a total is published, there were 503 - the highest number since early June. On Sunday there were also 4,974 coronavirus hospital patients in England, up from the previous day. On Friday there were 632 Covid hospital admissions in England. That was down from 792 the previous day and the lowest figure since the previous Sunday. In the Commons, responding to a question from the Tory Brexiter Iain Duncan Smith, Gove said he had just heard about the latest statement from the EU. (See 4pm.) He said it was constructive, and he said he welcomed that. In the Commons Theresa May, the former prime minister, challenged Michael Gove over security. She said that leaving without a deal would put UK security at risk because it would no longer have access to EU criminal justice databases. Gove said that in some cases having access to them would require the UK to be bound by the European court of justice. He claimed that the UK would be able to cooperate more effectively with the EU to protect its boundaries as a non-member. And, quoting May’s own slogan back at her, he said he agreed that no deal was better than a bad deal. Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has just posted this on Twitter. This sounds like a technicality, but agreeing to intensified talks, on the basis of legal text, may be enough of a concession to allow the talks to restart. On Friday last week No 10 said: There is only any point in Michel Barnier coming to London next week if he’s prepared to discuss all of the issues on the basis of legal text in an accelerated way without the UK being required to make all of the moves. The Barnier tweet does not concede the third point - “without the UK being required to make all of the moves” - and No 10 is still angry about the EU summit communique last week saying it was calling on “the UK to make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible”. But last week Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, said the EU would have to compromise. Rachel Reeves, Gove’s shadow, is responding for Labour. She says the deadline last week for a deal was the third set by the PM - and the third he has missed. Gove says the PM spoke on Friday about 2021 being a year of renewal. He says the government is doing that. On the negotiations, he says the door remains ajar. He hopes the EU will return to talks. But the UK will take back control in January. Gove is now speaking about the latest meeting of the joint committee, which has the job of overseeing the implementation of the withdrawal agreement. He says, in this forum, the EU has been very cooperative. At its meeting today the UK and the EU agreed to publish a joint statement on citizens’ rights. “Substantial progress” has been made on implementation, he says. Gove is now turning to the preparations for leaving without a deal. He says he is not blasé about this. But the UK is increasingly well prepared, he says. Gove says the proposals from the EU presented as compromises do not recognise the UK’s sovereignty. They want the UK to operate state aid rules essentially the same as the EU’s, with the EU free to retaliate if the UK does not comply. He says the UK is not asking for any special favours. With just 10 weeks left, this is not his preferred option, he says. Nor the prime minister’s. But, having come so far, it is important not to falter now, he says. Michael Gove is speaking to MPs now. He says the government had hoped to agree a trade deal with the EU before the end of the year. But he says, for that to happen, there will have to be a fundamental change from the EU, he says. He says the EU refused to accelerate negotiation. And they would not discuss legal text. At the EU summit EU leaders dropped a line from their communique saying the talks would have to be intensified. And they said all moves would have to come from the UK side - even though some EU leaders said the EU would have to compromise too. Gove says the UK will have to prepare to trade with the EU from January on WTO terms. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, is about to make a statement to MPs about the UK-EU trade talks. On Friday Downing Street claimed the talks were over. However, as Daniel Boffey and Peter Walker explain here, they are expected to resume very soon. In Northern Ireland another 820 people have tested positive, and a further six people have died, according to the daily update from the Department of Health. The number of positive cases is down slightly from this time last week (877), but the number of deaths is double what it was last Monday (three). Workers from the hospitality industry staged a demonstration this morning in Parliament Square in London, outside the House of Commons. They were protesting in particular about the lack of sector-specific support for their industry, and about the 10pm compulsory closing time. The number of confirmed cases of Covid at the University of Oxford has more than tripled in a week with almost one in four tests proving positive. The total number of positive cases in the week ending October 16 was 197, compared with 61 cases during freshers’ week, the week before. There have now been 288 confirmed Covid cases since the university testing service began on August 20, out of a total of 2433 tests, the university confirmed. The university says it is now in stage two of its emergency response framework which requires social distancing on site and allows a combination of face-to-face teaching and online learning. On Saturday students were criticised for failing to observe social distancing rules as they gathered to celebrate matriculation. The formal ceremony was moved online but students were pictured gathering at the Radcliffe Camera. At least 115 universities in the UK have now had Covid cases, according to UniCovidUk which is tracking infections in higher education. Public Health Wales has recorded 626 more positive cases and one further death. The details are here. The daily death toll is the lowest figure for 11 days. And the number of new cases is down considerably from yesterday’s total (950), but still a rise on this time last week (487). Police in Scotland will be able to get personal data of people with Covid-19 who are identified as part of the government’s test and trace programme, to issue fines and help other investigations. Despite public assurances of confidentiality, a privacy notice on a leaflet sent out to patients says that their names and mobile numbers could be shared with the police and other unspecified public bodies which “have a legitimate reason to ask for it”. The privacy notice, disclosed by the Times (paywall), goes on to say: “For example, it would not be shared with Police Scotland to implement fines unless Police Scotland had demonstrated their legal basis to have the data.” Similar police powers are in force now in England where police and prosecutors can fine Covid-positive people who breach self-isolation rules up to £10,000. The Scottish government has so far not introduced fines for self-isolation non-compliance. However, fines for breaching large gathering and physical distancing rules have been widely used by police in Scotland, and holiday makers can also be fined for breaching travel quarantine rules. Prof Stephen Reicher, a behavioural scientist at St Andrews university who advised the UK and Scottish governments, said these rules risked alienating the public and reducing compliance. He told the Times sharing such data was “deeply worrying in terms of civil liberties”. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said at her briefing earlier her government believed fines for non-isolation were “counterproductive” because they could make people feel testing had a criminal justice element to it. They were focusing on building voluntary compliance, she said. NHS England has recorded 76 further coronavirus hospital deaths. These are people who died after testing positive. There were 25 deaths in the north-east and Yorkshire, 24 in the north-west, 16 in the Midlands, five in the east of England, three in London, two in the south-west and one in the south-east. There were a further two deaths were the patients did not test positive, but Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. Seventy-six is more than double the equivalent figure for last Monday (36) and a sevenfold increase on the figure for two weeks ago (10). The details are here. Pupils in England sitting GCSE and A-level retakes this autumn will enjoy the same “generosity” in the awarding of grades as the summer cohort, the exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed. Following the cancellation of summer exams as a result of the pandemic, students who were unhappy with their results – and private candidates who were not issued with a grade – were given the opportunity to sit back-up exams. According to Ofqual, there are 20,000 A-level entries for this autumn’s resits (compared with 700,000 during the summer) which are currently under way, with GCSE resits to follow next month. This summer saw a significant hike in results after the government was forced to scrap its flawed algorithm and pupils were given school-assessed grades. In a new blog, Ofqual said it was “working with exam boards to carry forward the generosity from summer 2020 grades”. Ordinarily, exam boards adjust grade boundaries to ensure consistency in the distribution of results year on year. The autumn results will however be aligned with the summer results to ensure fairness, Ofqual said. The regulator said it would publish further details about next year’s exams later in the year. Downing Street has claimed that intensive care capacity in Greater Manchester is less than four weeks away from being completely overwhelmed. The prime minister’s spokesman released figures supporting the claim at the daily lobby briefing to back up government claims that tighter restrictions in the region are urgently needed. Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said this morning that he would not easily be “pressurised” into agreeing them. (See 9.43am.) The spokesman told journalists: Cases in Greater Manchester continue to rise. In the over-60 age group, cases have tripled in the most recent 15 days of full data - there were 89 cases per 100,000 on September 27 compared to 282 per 100,000 on October 12. Hospital admissions in Greater Manchester are doubling every nine days. Currently the number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care is around 40% of that seen at the peak of the first wave. But, assuming a 14-day doubling time - the “best case” according to the SPI-M modelling group - all free intensive care capacity would be used by 28 October (the middle of next week), according to No 10, and would pass the peak of the first wave by 2 November (a fortnight today). The projections suggest Covid patients would take up the entire current intensive care capacity by 8 November (within three weeks) and the entire surge capacity by 12 November. Asked if that meant hospitals being overwhelmed, the spokesman said: “Yes, that’s the entire surge ICU capacity.” The spokesman confirmed that talks with Burnham and other local leaders were continuing. “If at all possible, we do want to engage constructively with Greater Manchester and agree on a way forward,” the spokesman said. But if agreement cannot be reached, the government will need to intervene “in order to protect hospitals and save the lives of residents”, he added. From my colleague Josh Halliday Commenting on the ONS figures showing that there have been 25,000 excess deaths registered in private homes in England this year (see 12.14pm), Sir David Spiegelhalter, chairman of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, said that most of these deaths were ones that in normal circumstances would have occurred in hospital. He said: Non-Covid deaths in hospital have correspondingly declined, suggesting most of these deaths would normally have occurred in hospital, and people have either been reluctant to go, discouraged from attending, or the services have been disrupted. He added that it is “unclear how many of these lives could have been extended had they gone to hospital”. Adam Price, the Plaid Cymru leader, has said the Welsh government needs to use its two-week firebreak to make its test and trace system more effective. In a statement he said: A fire break is a last resort and should only be used in an emergency. We are now in an emergency. The time the firebreak buys us must be used to build up a resilient test, trace and isolate system in Wales which means we can prevent being in the position we’re currently in where the case numbers have risen to the point where they can overwhelm an already exhausted NHS. We also need to ensure the safeguarding of workplaces, and that sufficient financial support is available for businesses and their employees who will be directly impacted by this firebreak. From my colleague Maya Wolfe-Robinson Covid-19 case rates have started to fall in some of England’s biggest cities, with the sharpest increases now happening in towns and more suburban areas, latest figures suggest. As PA Media reports, Nottingham, Manchester, Sheffield and Newcastle are among the cities where the weekly rate of new Covid-19 cases rose rapidly at the end of September, coinciding with the start of the new university term, but where levels are now coming down. The rates have been decreasing for several days, suggesting they are on a downward trend rather than a temporary dip. In Nottingham the rolling weekly rate of cases peaked at 1,001.2 per 100,000 people for the seven days to 8 October - the highest for any local authority area in England - but since then the number has been falling, and it currently stands at 787.6. Manchester’s current rate is 432.5, after peaking at 583.5 (in the seven days to 3 October); Sheffield’s rate is 396.7, down from 500.3 (the seven days to 7 October) while Newcastle stands at 371.5, down from 553.8 (the seven days to 7 October). All current rates are for the seven days to 14 October. And here is the Welsh government’s news release with its summary of its firebreak lockdown plans, including the support being made available to business. The Welsh government has published a report (pdf) from its “technical advisory cell” (its version of Sage) that has helped to inform the decision announced by Mark Drakeford today. Here’s an excerpt. The main recommendation of this report is to try to protect our most deprived population from the direct effects of Covid-19 in a potential second wave, and from the indirect effects of Covid-19 on the economy which will increase health inequalities in the longer term. We will know we have succeeded in this if the gradient in Covid-19 mortality is less steep in future than in the first peak and if we see a reduction in the gradient in all-cause mortality in 2022, given that it is unlikely that inequalities will reduce in the next two years. Drakeford says professional sport will be allowed to continue during the firebreak lockdown. That counts as work, he says. Asked what regional restrictions will still be in place once the nationwide firebreak has ended, Drakeford says discussions on that are still continuing. Drakeford says the rules restricting cross-border travel will be even stricter during the two-week period of the firebreak. Drakeford says the aim of the firebreak is to get Wales through until Christmas without the need for further lockdowns. Beyond that, he cannot say what will or will not be needed, he says. Back in the press conference Drakeford says it is important for people to understand that the test for the firebreak is not whether numbers are falling by the end of it. They are not likely to start falling until afterwards, he says. He does not specify what “numbers” he is referring to - cases, hospitalisations or deaths? - although he does say that, because of the time lag between infection and death (at least three weeks, generally), deaths will probably still be rising at the end of the fortnight. Responding to the Welsh government’s announcement, the Tory leader in Wales, Paul Davies, said: Sadly, the first minster has failed to get public support for this second Wales-wide lockdown, failing to be open and transparent about the evidence to justify this lockdown and what his actions will entail for the future. The Welsh government also has to be honest that this road they are taking us down is committing Wales to rolling Wales-wide lockdowns. This is not a two-week break to solve the pandemic, it is likely that we will see regular lockdowns across the rest of the year. The Welsh government must be clear what actions they are taking during the lockdown to prevent further Wales-wide lockdowns which will have a significant impact on people’s lives and livelihoods. However, the main concern is that this national lockdown is not proportionate. The impact on businesses in areas such as Powys, Pembrokeshire and Ceredigion, who have the lowest rate of Covid-19 cases in Wales, will be severe at a time when they are desperately struggling to recover from the pandemic so far this year. Drakeford says the firebreak will never work if people keep asking why there isn’t an exception for this or that. The government has the minimum number of exceptions, he says. Here is the Q&amp;A from the Welsh government explaining in detail how its firebreak lockdown will work. Drakeford says he is disappointed that details of the plans were leaked. (See 10.50am.) He says the package was only finalised at 11.30 this morning. But he says he wanted to consult people who would be affected by this. He says he would rather take the risk of details leaking than not consult. Back in Cardiff Drakeford is still taking questions. He says it would not help business not getting the virus under control. The Scottish government has changed the way it measures Covid-19 cases by publishing daily test results for all tests carried out, including results from people who have had multiple tests in the proceeding day. Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister, said the new approach meant health officials and ministers would have a better and more realistic grasp of how quickly coronavirus was spreading, and where. Until today, Sturgeon has announced each day the percentage of positive results only from people tested for the first time, but from now would include results from people such as care home workers who are being repeatedly tested. That methodology was closer to the approach recommended by the World Health Organization, she said. She said 993 people tested positive yesterday. Under the old methodology, the latest daily result showed 17.1% of those tested for the first time were positive but counting every single test, only 6.4% of people were positive. Sturgeon disclosed the number of people in hospital had increased again over the last 24 hours, up by 40 to 754 patients, while the number in intensive care had fallen by one to 61. One person was recorded to have died, she added. Drakeford says people can leave home to exercise. But that exercise must start and end at home. He says people will not be limited to one act of exercise per day, as during the first lockdown. Drakeford says the Welsh lockdown will not succeed if it has to rely on the police. It will only work if people ask themselves if they are doing what they need to do to make this a success. He says people need to cut down their contacts with others to a bare minimum, to make the firebreak a success. Drakeford says Sir Keir Starmer is backing a two-week firebreak for the UK because that is what Sage, the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, is recommending. He says the Welsh government’s scientific advisers are also recommending this. Here is my colleague Steven Morris’s story about the Welsh government’s announcement. Drakeford this has to be a national effort. Everyone in every part of Wales has to make a contribution, he says. Q: What has to be put in place during those two weeks? Drakeford says the Welsh government will use the time “purposefully”. It will beef up the test, trace, protect system. It will roll out more field hospitals. And it will review penalties that have been imposed, to ensure they are being used proportionately. Drakeford says bonfire night celebrations will not be allowed. But remembrance day events will be allowed, he says. He says they are more important than ever. Drakeford is now taking questions. Q: Will the lockdown definitely end on 9 November? Drakeford says it will end then. It will be a fixed period. But he says the benefit will not be seen by then. It will take longer. The impact will only be seen later, he says. Drakeford says lockdown will end before its benefits become apparent - because it will take longer than two weeks for its full impact to take effect. Drakeford says this will not be easy. But if we act together, we can succeed, he says. He thanks people for their support. Drakeford turns to the support for business. He says there will be an economic resilience fund worth almost £300m. Every business covered by small business rate relief will get £1,000, he says. Retail, leisure and hospitality places that have to close will get a one-off payment of up to £5,000, he says. There will also be extra discretionary grants, he says. Drakeford says there must be no gatherings with people from other households outside or inside. The only exceptions are for adults living alone and single parents, who will be able to see someone for support. Drakeford says primary schools will re-open after half-term. But secondary schools will only re-open for pupils in years seven and eight, and for pupils doing exams. Otherwise pupils will have to spend the week learning from home. Students will have to stay at home too, he says. Drakeford says from Friday everyone will have to stay at home - unless their work is essential. Retail will have to close unless it is essential, he says. And he says places of worship will close, apart from for weddings and funeral. Mark Drakeford starts by saying he explained the serious situation faced in Wales on Friday. Ministers have held discussions over the weekend, he says. He says there are “no easy choices”. If the government does nothing, “there is a very real risk” of the NHS being overwhelmed. Unless we act, the NHS will not be able to look after the increasing number of people falling seriously ill, even with the extra 5,000 beds that we have. If the government does not act now, the alternative would be “an open-ended lockdown” later, he says. He says minister will introduced a two-week “firebreak” starting on Friday. Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister is about to start his briefing. There is a live feed at the top of the page. According to a report from the Office for National Statistics this morning, there have been 25,000 excess deaths registered in private homes in England this year. Excess deaths are deaths above the five-year average. Most of these did not involve Covid, it says. The report says: In England, the number of deaths in private homes registered between 28 December 2019 and 11 September 2020 was 108,842; this was 25,472 deaths more than the five-year average for the same period. In Wales, the number of deaths in private homes registered between 28 December 2019 and 11 September 2020 was 7,440; this was 1,624 deaths more than the five-year average for the same period. Sarah Caul, head of mortality analysis at the ONS, said: While deaths in hospitals and care homes have dropped below the five-year average since the initial peak of the coronavirus pandemic, we’ve consistently seen deaths in private homes remain well above the five-year average. We have seen an overall increase of deaths as well as a redistribution of various causes of death. For instance, while deaths of heart disease are below average in hospital, it has been above average at home. It’s a similar picture when looking at prostate cancer for males and dementia and Alzheimer’s disease for females. Unlike the high numbers of deaths involving Covid-19 in hospitals and care homes, the majority of deaths in private homes are unrelated to Covid-19. UPDATE: Commenting on the ONS figures showing that there have been 25,000 excess deaths registered in private homes in England this year (see 12.14pm), Sir David Spiegelhalter, chairman of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge, said that most of these deaths were deaths that in normal circumstances would have occurred in hospital. See 1.46pm. There will be two statements in the Commons this afternoon. At 3.30pm Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, will deliver a statement about Brexit. And at around 4.30pm Matt Hancock, the health secretary, will deliver a statement about coronavirus. Here is the response from Ed Miliband, the shadow business secretary, to Alok Sharma saying whether or not Brexit is called “no-deal” is a matter of semantics. (See 11.38am.) Miliband said: A ‘no-deal’ might just be semantics for Alok Sharma, but it’s not semantics for the manufacturers, farmers and many businesses across the country who have been clear that it could have serious economic consequences for them. The government is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes to pretend no-deal doesn’t mean no-deal. The business secretary should be listening to businesses and pulling out all the stops to deliver the deal ministers promised was oven ready, not dismissing their concerns. The UK government has broken the law by failing to tackle the disproportionate impact of coronavirus on ethnic minorities and disabled people, Labour has claimed in a letter to the equality watchdog. My colleague Haroon Siddique has the story here. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, has said the government is looking at a “test and release” regime that would cut the amount of time people arriving in the UK have to self-isolate for if they are subject to quarantine. Speaking at the Airlines 2050 summit, Shapps said: My ministerial colleagues and I have agreed a regime, based on a single test provided by the private sector and at the cost to the passenger, after a period of self-isolation and doing those things could achieve our objectives. The next step is to develop how this approach can be implemented.” It will mean a single test for international arrivals, a week after arrival. Currently people subject to quarantine have to self-isolate for 14 days. Earlier Sean Doyle, the new boss of British Airways, told the conference that Covid tests before departure should replace the current quarantine rules. He said: We believe the best way to reassure people is to introduce a reliable and affordable test before flying. For the UK, this approach reduces the stress on the NHS testing systems within the UK and on policing the quarantine system. If we look abroad to our near neighbours, we see that business travel and indeed tourism is being prioritised by some countries. We need to get the economy moving again and this just isn’t possible when you’re asking people to quarantine for 14 days. It’s our view that even if that quarantine period is reduced to seven days, people won’t travel here and the UK will get left behind. Among the many areas where Brexit is wreaking havoc is with the English language. Words are meant to have a clear meaning. With Brexit, it’s not always so. There was a good example this morning on LBC where Alok Sharma, the business secretary, argued that a no-deal Brexit - which is normally now taken as meaning a Brexit involving a trade deal with the EU - is in fact a Brexit with a deal, but just a different sort of deal. Sharma made the argument often made by ministers that the UK does, in fact, have a deal, because it signed the withdrawal agreement deal. But then he went further. When the presenter, Nick Ferrari, put it to him that the Australia-style deal that the PM now talks about is just another way of referring to no-deal, Sharma replied: The Australia deal is a deal that you have with countries where you are predominantly working on a sort of WTO basis. The exchange went on: NF: So it’s a no-deal? AS: Depends. You can use the phrase no deal but the point is it is a deal … Ferrari asked Sharma twice more to explain the difference between the Australia arrangement and no-deal, before Sharma eventually said: It’s a question of semantics at the end of the day, sure. Sharma was speaking only a day after Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, gave another example of Brexit linguistic elasticity in an interview with Andrew Marr yesterday (which I see has been getting a lot of comment BTL.) As the transcript (pdf) shows, Gove was asked if he was embarrassed to watch the clip of him giving a speech during the Brexit campaign saying: “The day after we vote to leave we hold all the cards.” No, said Gove. He said that “we hold cards and we do and it is the case that we take control of our destiny”. When Gove said in 2016 that the UK would hold all the cards after leaving the EU, that was widely interpreted as meaning the UK would hold all the good cards (the usual interpretation of the phrase). Now he is saying he just meant the UK would hold its own cards (which might be the worst in the pack). Yasmin Qureshi, the Labour MP for Bolton South East and a shadow international development minister, has released a statement saying she is in hospital being treated for pneumonia after testing positive for Covid. She is 57. According to a leaked letter from the Welsh director of the Confederation of Passenger Transport, the Welsh government is considering a 17-day national lockdown starting at 6pm on Friday. In terms of timing, that would be similar to the semi-lockdown announced by Nicola Sturgeon in Scotland. That also spanned three weekends, coinciding with half-term. The Northern Ireland version is longer, lasting four weeks. But, if the leaked document is correct, the Welsh lockdown would go further than the other two in other respects. In Scotland there is only a full closure of pubs and restaurants in the central belt. In Northern Ireland they are all closed, apart from for takeaways. Northern Ireland has also closed shops performing close-contact services, like hairdressing. But the leaked letter suggests that in Wales all but essential retail will be forced to close. In Scotland schools have not been affected. In Northern Ireland they have closed for an extra week over half-term. According to the leaked letter, in Wales primary schools will go back as normal after half term, but secondary schools could be given an extended break. The letter also says that in Wales people will be told to use public transport for essential travel only during the short lockdown. Asked about the leak at the weekend, the Welsh government said final decisions had not yet been taken. The leak was published by the Bubble.Wales blog. Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, has said the government should spend £14m a month on a shielding programme for people in Greater Manchester most at risk, as an alternative to putting the region into tier 3. He explains why in a blog published this morning. Here’s an extract. Most people who test positive for the virus are not getting particularly ill. They are not the problem. Too many are now getting ill and the number of hospital cases is going up, as is the number of people with Covid in intensive care. That’s the problem. I’ve spent a fair chunk of time over the last week talking to hospital staff about exactly what is going on. The good news is that they expect that now with improved treatment, they don’t expect to see anything like the death rate we had back in April and May. The bad news is that if cases continue to rise, they will have to again start cancelling other patients treatments. They do though know who in the population is, if they catch the virus, most at risk of hospitalisation - older people and people with existing underlying conditions, diabetes, obesity, high-blood pressure, other respiratory illnesses. If this is the evidence, wouldn’t it be much better to have an effective shielding programme for those most at risk, rather than have a blanket business closure policy of dubious efficacy. Greater Manchester have estimated the cost of a shielding programme at around £14m a month, less than a fifth of the estimated cost of business closures. Sadly, government, having forced through badly thought regulations, seem unwilling to think again. From Matt Hancock, the health secretary These are from Prof Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and an adviser to the Scottish and UK governments on coronavirus. This morning Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, was talking up the prospects of a deal with Greater Manchester about going into the the stricter tier 3 Covid restrictions regime (see 9.07am), but Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, has told Sky News morning that he won’t just “roll over” at the offer of money. He said: I spoke to [the government] yesterday and I’ve made it clear that we’re willing to talk and want to resolve this. But I do very much look to parliament to intervene as well. I’ve written to the main leaders in Westminster, all of them, including the prime minister. Tier 3 is a serious thing, it’s a serious development if we are to ask people to go into, just before winter, just before Christmas, closing a large number of places of work. People can’t just be pressurised into it. And I’m not going to be pressurised into it. I’m not just going to roll over at the sight of a cheque. This is about properly supporting those people whose lives will be damaged by tier 3. The Daily Telegraph this morning claims the government is willing to offer Greater Manchester “up to £100m” if it goes into tier 3. Other papers are saying tens of millions. On the Today programme this morning Nick Robinson, the presenter, said the BBC understood the figure was about £75m - assuming that Greater Manchester gets about the same, per head of population, as Liverpool city region and Lancashire. Jenrick refused to confirm the figure, but he did not deny that money was on offer, comprising support for local authorities, support for local businesses, funding for localised contact tracing and other forms of support, including the possible intervention of the armed forces if a suitable role for them could be found. This is from Plaid Cymru on the Welsh government’s plans for a short “fire break” national lockdown. It is worth pointing out that, welcome or otherwise, repeat lockdowns would not be unique to Wales. Scotland announced something very similar the week before last, and Northern Ireland announced one last week. And at the very start of the epidemic in March, UK government scientists predicted this might become the norm. This is from a paper drawn up by SPI-M-O, the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (an offshoot of Sage) on 16 March, the day Boris Johnson announced the soft lockdown. SPI-M-O said: It was agreed that a policy of alternating between periods of more and less strict social distancing measures could plausibly be effective at keeping the number of critical care cases within capacity. These would need to be in place for at least most of a year. Under such as policy, at least half of the year would be spent under the stricter social distancing measures. Good morning. In politics it’s never a good idea to be fighting too many battles at the same time and No 10 starts the week with its stand-offs with Brussels, over the UK-EU trade deal, and with Greater Manchester, over the proposal to subject it to the stricter tier 3 local coronavirus restrictions, still unresolved. But there might be an agreement on Greater Manchester soon. Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, told the BBC this morning: I do think it is very clear that having now discussed this for well over a week this does now need to be brought to a conclusion.I think everybody in Greater Manchester would agree with that. So, I am hopeful that either today, or tomorrow, we will reach a conclusion, one way or the other. There are almost 3 million people who live in Greater Manchester. But there are more than 3 million people who live in Wales, and today it is possible that they will be told they are going to face restrictions even tougher than the ones that apply to regions placed in tier 3 under the English system. The Welsh government has been mulling over the need for a “fire break” lockdown - a short, hard national lockdown, like the “circuit breaker” recommended for England by Sage and the Labour party - and this morning the Welsh cabinet will meet to take a final decision. Last night the Welsh government issued this statement. The measures we have put in place at both a local and a national level, with help from the people of Wales, have kept the spread of Covid-19 under check. However, there is a growing consensus we now need to introduce a different set of measures and actions to respond to the virus as it continues to spread across Wales more quickly during the autumn and winter months ahead. Ministers have held a number of meetings over the weekend with senior Welsh government officials, scientists and public health experts to consider their advice on a potential need for a ‘fire break’ set of measures to control the virus. The Welsh cabinet met this evening to consider that advice. The cabinet will meet again tomorrow morning to make a final decision. The first minister will update the people of Wales on any decisions taken tomorrow. Here is the agenda for the news. 9.30am: The ONS publishes figures on deaths in private homes in England and Wales. 12pm: Downing Street is due to hold its lobby briefing. 12.15pm: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, is due to hold a coronavirus briefing. 12.15pm: Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister, is due to hold a coronavirus briefing. After 1.30pm: Peers begin the first day of the second reading debate on the internal market bill. 4pm: Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, gives evidence to joint national security strategy committee. Also today Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Maroš Šefčovič, the European commission vice-president, will convene a meeting of the joint committee overseeing the implementation of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. And David Frost, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, is expected to hold a call with Michael Barnier, his EU counterpart, about the trade talks supposedly called off by No 10 on Friday. Politics Live has been doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog for some time and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, like Brexit, and when they seem more important or more interesting, they will take precedence. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow."

          "bodyText": "Last week brought an issue to the attention of millions of Instagram users – one that we in marginalised communities have been aware of for years: the Instagram algorithm favours thin, white, cisgendered people and effectively censors the rest of us. On Friday, Australian comedic juggernaut Celeste Barber posted the latest in her #CelesteChallengeAccepted series of parody images to her audience of 7.3 million: a side-by-side photo of her imitating a post from former Victoria’s Secret model Candice Swanepoel, clutching her bare breast and exposing side boob. But while both photos revealed the exact same parts of each body (Barber, in fact, added a string bikini), Instagram wouldn’t let fans share Barber’s post, notifying some users that it “goes against our community guidelines on nudity or sexual activity”. Swanepoel’s post, meanwhile, went unreported. “Hey Instagram, sort out your body-shaming standards, guys,” Barber wrote, sharing one fan’s screenshot showing Instagram’s repost rejection. “It’s 2020. Catch up.” The Instagram algorithm is a beast that we may never understand completely, but what we do know is that images in breach of Instagram’s community guidelines are flagged through a mix of manual reporting and AI tech. Instagram also has over 15,000 employees working all around the world to review posts, and look for banned material. With all of this technology and so many employees, it is hard to understand how prejudices still haunt the algorithm – and yet here we are. This is not an isolated incident. In June 2020, plus-size model Nyome Nicholas-Williams posted an artistic topless photo of herself, in which her breasts were covered by her arms – and Instagram promptly removed it. Censoring a black woman in the context of the renewed Black Lives Matter movement was a particularly bold move, and one that did not go unnoticed. Nicholas-Williams’s followers – now 60,000 - rallied behind her, using the hashtag #IWantToSeeNyome. There were reposts of her original photo, plus artistic tributes and posts from women of colour posing in their own versions of it; many had their own posts removed. The incident resulted in a Change.org petition, which has now amassed more than 20,000 signatures, protesting what it refers to as “Instagram’s prejudicial and clearly racially motivated censoring” with the aim to “showcase all people of all sizes and ethnicities”. Since then, Nicholas-Williams has spoken about the double standards that people of colour and fat people face that thin, white models are not subjected to. In a recent interview with Freeda, Nicholas-Williams explained that “censorship happens everywhere, but on social media it happens more, especially to black fat women like myself”. That month, the Instagram CEO, Adam Mosseri, publicly acknowledged the need for Instagram to look at “algorithmic bias”, as well as harassment, verification and content distribution. “Our focus will start with Black community, but we’re also going to look at how we can better serve other underrepresented groups,” he said. But by October, not much had changed. Which is why Kayla Logan, an American plus-size blogger and influencer, started #DontDeleteMyBody: an effort to not only prove to society how fatphobic and racist the Instagram algorithm is, but also to beat it. On 1 October, at 6pm American Pacific standard time, 50 fat influencers from around the world – of diverse racial backgrounds and with millions of followers collectively – posted an image to their grid. Some were artistic nudes, others fun fashion pics, but all contained a search bar with the words: “Why does IG sensor [sic] my body but not thin bodies?” Predictably, many of the influencers reported the removal of their posts for breaching Instagram’s community guidelines. And – as with Barber’s post last week - many of the images were banned from being reshared. One participant, Kalae Nouveau, suffered more than others: her original and subsequent posts were deleted, resharing her posts was banned, and her account was shadow-banned, meaning its visibility was restricted. The only #DontDeleteMyBody post that Nouveau was able to keep in her feed is a grey tile that reads: “I’m tired. I’ll continue to tell y’all not to delete my body tomorrow. #DontDeleteMyBody” Is it a coincidence that the only post to remain did not feature her body? There are three different issues at play here: the censorship of black people and people of colour; the censorship of fat people and people in marginalised bodies; and the censorship of women and women’s bodies. Yet all three bring us to the same conclusion: it’s time all social media giants update their guidelines to make room for everyone. Barber and Nicholas-Williams both say Instagram has apologised, saying their images were mistakenly censored. Both women are now working with the platform to help update their guidelines for the future. Until that happens, you can help make a difference: consciously follow people in marginalised communities and engage with their content; save posts, comment, like and share the content that resonates with you, and that you think people need to see. Show the social media giants and big corporations that diversity and inclusion matter in the world, and that you want to see it. /"

          "bodyText": "It’s time to address monopoly capitalism and, in particular, monopoly data capitalism, which has been turbo-charged by Covid-19, forcing the world to live and work online. A Joe Biden presidency – increasingly likely – and an EU unhampered by British reluctance to do anything bold to reform or even tax a monopolistic private sector are set to make common cause. They will act in sync to attack the now bewildering monopoly power of the hi-tech giants by tackling its foundation – the simultaneous owning of pivotal digital platforms and the unbridled provision of the services on them. Together, they will go on to reclaim the operation of the internet and enlarge individual control of personal data. Moreover, Biden, if he fulfils his campaign pledges to challenge shareholder-value-driven US business, act on climate crisis and enlarge union rights, will Europeanise the US economy to make it more friendly to this reform agenda. It will be a sea change – with Britain a marginalised bystander. In the past 10 days, both the powerful House judiciary committee and the EU commission, under pressure from the French and Dutch governments, have signalled a readiness to challenge Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon to the point of breaking them up. The EU has been circling round the possibility of separating the “gatekeeper” platforms from their owners’ capacity to favour the selling of their own goods and services on them, which is a crucial step on the way to breaking them up. But it is a first for the commission to be challenged so publicly by a joint paper from two member governments to do just that – and to go even further and faster if necessary. The initiative was quickly backed by Germany. The EU’s capacity to act unilaterally on US companies is of course limited and Donald Trump has been fierce in warning the EU against extending its ambitions to US companies. In June, he actually threatened a trade war over the EU’s readiness to sanction digital taxes on the Big Four from its member states. It is a threat that has so intimidated the enfeebled Brexit British that last week it was reported that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, would excuse Amazon from a proposed British digital tax. But a Biden administration would change the entire dynamic. It was the majority Democrats on the judiciary committee who made the running in this landmark congressional report and, even though the Republicans did not sign up for all the remedies, they shared the same analysis. This is one of the few areas in which there is a bipartisan consensus. Big tech, notwithstanding the great benefits it has brought to US society, has grown over-powerful, arrogant and monopolistic. It is predatory. It charges exorbitant fees. It extracts valuable data. It snuffs out rivals. “These firms,” wrote the committee members, “wield their dominance in ways that erode entrepreneurship, degrade Americans’ privacy online and undermine the vibrancy of the free and diverse press. The result is less innovation, fewer choices for consumers and a weakened democracy.” Amen to that. It also mirrors the thinking in Brussels. If the EU were to move to, say, prohibit a planned takeover by a hi-tech giant of a potential tech challenger, outlaw favouring in-house products and services, do more to protect data privacy or insist the platforms get opened up, it will find a US only too ready to do the same. The committee was especially incensed by the lordly attitude to giving evidence of Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai, respectively the CEOs of Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Google. As it tried to elicit from them answers on whether Apple abused its monopoly with its App store, about Facebook’s monopoly of online advertising, on whether Amazon used information garnered from third sellers on its platforms to help its in-house sales or on how Google exploits its global control of internet search, the committee got short shrift. The answers, it said, were “often evasive and non-responsive, raising fresh questions about whether they believe they are beyond the reach of democratic oversight”. But the CEOs had no choice but to be evasive: they could not answer honestly without acknowledging the truths behind the questioning. The proposed remedies are sweeping, reflected in the Franco-Dutch paper to the EU commission. Anti-trust and competition law, the backbone of ensuring fair play in a market economy, is too flat-footed, too slow and fails to get ahead of the curve. Too many challengers have been eliminated by takeovers that should have been stopped, anticipating the impact on future competition rather than judging it in the here and now. Platforms should be prohibited from operating in adjacent lines of business. All products and services from whatever source should have equal access to the platforms, “self-preferencing” should be outlawed and there should be complete “interoperability” – computer systems able to work with each other. The law should be framed to allow private companies to launch malpractice suits of their own. Newspaper groups should be able to come together and use the new legal framework jointly to insist on fairer, less predatory terms for the use of their journalistic and advertising content. The Johnson government seems either blind to all of this or judges it of secondary importance besides its ambitions for “global Britain” free from the EU yoke, even if it is attacking predatory monopoly power or agreeing, as it did at last week’s EU summit, to create Gaia-x to store and manage EU-wide data in the cloud. Our Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has little of the ambition of the EU or the US competition authorities and when its former chair Andrew Tyrie tried to make it a consumer champion, observing that the digital platforms were too powerful and could “destroy a small business with a change to an algorithm”, he was ignored. In June, he resigned in protest and the CMA has regressed to its comfort zone – technocratic caution – with no ministerial challenge to behave differently. As the EU and US recast digital capitalism, the truth is brutal: Brexit Britain has made itself irrelevant, a country to be plundered. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist"

          "bodyText": "Participants in a virtual paleontology session found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place last week, when a profanity filter prevented them from using certain words – such as bone, pubic, stream and, er, beaver – during an online conference. The US-based Society of Vertebrate Paleontology (SVP) held its annual meeting virtually this year due to the pandemic, but soon found its audience stifled when they tried to use particular words. Convey Services, which was was handling the conference, used a “naughty-word filter,” for the conference, outlawing a pre-selected list of words. “Words like ‘bone’, ‘pubic’, and ‘stream’ are frankly ridiculous to ban in a field where we regularly find pubic bones in streams,” said Brigid Christison, a master’s student in biology attending the event, in an interview with Vice. To root out wrongly identified “naughty words”, SVP members created a spreadsheet tracking all the words that seem to have been banned, and shared it on Twitter. It included: damn, hell, ball, stroke, pubis, wang, jerk, knob, stroke, stream, erection, dyke, crack and enlargement. Having set up a Reddit thread for the conference where members of the public could ask questions, organizers apologized for the confusion, explaining that the platform they used to host the event was clearly set up for business and industry meetings, rather than science events. “Apparently it came with a pre-packaged naughty-word filter. After getting a good belly laugh out of the way on the first day and some creative wording (my personal favorite was Heck Creek for Hell Creek), some of us reached out to the business office, and they’ve been un-banning words as we stumble across them,” an SVP member explained to Reddit users. Some discovered bias in the algorithm, too. Jack Tseng, a vertebrate paleontologist from the University of California, Berkley pointed out that the filter had banned the common surname Wang but not Johnson – even though both are frequently used as slang words to describe a man’s genitals."

          "bodyText": "Mere hours after the publication of a controversial New York Post article critical of Joe Biden, both Twitter and Facebook took unprecedented action to restrict distribution of the post. Facebook, a company spokesman revealed, had immediately begun to “reduce its distribution on our platform”, altering how the company’s recommendation algorithm would normally react to such a viral story in order to buy its third-party fact checkers time to come to a conclusion about its veracity. Twitter went further. Users were blocked from posting links to the article entirely, and tweets that had already been posted showed a warning for people who clicked through, saying that “this link may be unsafe”. That action was so dramatic, and delivered with such little explanation, that many initially assumed an automated system had gone haywire. It took until late in the day for the company to provide context: it was, an official account tweeted, applying long-standing rules against dissemination of both hacked content and personal information such as emails. Twitter’s co-founder and chief executive, Jack Dorsey, apologised for the “not great” communication. “Blocking URL sharing via tweet or DM with zero context as to why we’re blocking,” he added, was “unacceptable.” The panicked response from the social media giants underlines the extent to which both companies, as well as Google and its YouTube subsidiary, have scrambled to deal with the twists and turns of an American election that many fear is closer to tipping into violence than any in living memory. In the past few weeks, long-standing policies have crumbled and previously unthinkable restrictions have been imposed on users both public and private, with individual explanations offered for the changes but little explanation as to the wider scope of the changes. It’s a long way from May this year, when a controversial post from the president, Donald Trump, warning Black Lives Matter protesters that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”, was restricted by Twitter, leading to a wave of internal dissent at Facebook when the CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, declined to do the same thing. “I just believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online,” Zuckerberg said in an appearance on Fox News in the midst of the debate. “Private companies probably shouldn’t be, especially these platform companies, shouldn’t be in the position of doing that.” It was a similar explanation to that which the Facebook founder had given more than two years ago, over a very different topic: Holocaust denial. In an interview with the tech site Recode, he had brought the topic up unprompted as an example of something he didn’t feel should be removed from his site. Holocaust deniers were, he said, “deeply offensive”, but: “I don’t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong. I don’t think that they’re intentionally getting it wrong … It’s hard to impugn intent and to understand the intent. I just think, as abhorrent as some of those examples are, I think the reality is also that I get things wrong when I speak publicly.” This week, Zuckerberg reversed his position. The company would now take down content that denies or distorts the Nazi genocide, he announced, because “my own thinking has evolved as I’ve seen data showing an increase in antisemitic violence”. Just a day later, the company reversed another long-held policy, banning ads discouraging vaccination. “Our goal is to help messages about the safety and efficacy of vaccines reach a broad group of people, while prohibiting ads with misinformation that could harm public health efforts,” the company said. Both those moves came after yet another reversal: banning the conspiracist QAnon movement from all Facebook platforms, two months after attempting to ban only the violent strains of the community, and four years after the movement first began with users on Reddit and 4Chan commenting that hacked emails from the Democratic party sounded concerning if one replaced the word “pizza” with “child”. Adding to those reversals of longstanding policies have been a number of last-minute changes to the company’s rules, specifically regarding elections. First it banned new political adverts from being posted in the last week of the campaign, to prevent falsehoods from spreading without time to counter them; then it banned premature declarations of victory; then it banned martial language in political adverts; and finally it banned all political adverts full stop, effective the day of the election. A Facebook source disputed the idea that the policy changes around the Holocaust, vaccines and QAnon were related to the election, arguing instead that the company was responding as rapidly as it could in the middle of a global pandemic that was forcing all companies to take rapid action. At other sites, too, policy changes have ramped up in recent weeks. A suite of features on Twitter intended to add “friction” to the site, limiting the ability of posts to go viral, were announced this week. YouTube banned misinformation about coronavirus vaccines a day after Facebook banned ads on the topic. Even the crafting site Etsy acted, banning merchandise supporting the street-fighting Proud Boys group. The policy changes “represent a bit of desperation on both platforms and society at large about meaningful ways of getting to grip with the problems,” said Jonathan Bright, a researcher in digital politics at the University of Oxford. “This is a very particular situation: I don’t think they’re planning on having this as their normal election playbook. For me it reflects an evolving acceptance on the part of platforms that they are wielding enormous power.” Typically, he says, such platforms have bound their own hands, exercising “a reluctance to shut anyone off”. But the heightened tensions around the election have forced them to take far more concerted action than they would ever normally contemplate. A Facebook spokesperson said: “Meaningful events in the world have led us to change some of our policies, but not our principles. A historic election is raising concerns about voter suppression and post-election uncertainty. The global pandemic has created new concerns about harm caused by medical misinformation. And longstanding racial inequality has contributed to heightened unrest. We remain committed to free expression while also recognising the current environment requires clearer guardrails to minimise harm.” As expected, the new policies have caused a stir on the American right, with the blocking of the New York Post story crystallising a feeling that the platforms were acting specifically against Trump. On Wednesday evening, Twitter also reportedly locked the personal account of the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, for sharing the article. The article implicated the former vice-president in connection with his son Hunter’s Ukraine business. It was headlined: “Smoking-gun email reveals how Hunter Biden introduced Ukrainian businessman to VP dad.” The story focused on one email from April 2015, in which a Burisma board adviser thanked Hunter for inviting him to a Washington meeting with his father. But there was no indication of when the meeting was scheduled or whether it ever happened. “We have reviewed Joe Biden’s official schedules from the time and no meeting, as alleged by the New York Post, ever took place,” the Biden campaign said. The New York Post blasted the social media companies, saying they were trying to help Biden’s election campaign and falsely claiming no one had disputed the story’s veracity. “Facebook and Twitter are not media platforms. They’re propaganda machines,” it wrote in an editorial. Trump tweeted that it was “terrible” that the social media companies “took down” the article – in fact, it was restricted, not removed – and renewed his calls to “repeal section 230”, a measure that keeps website hosts from being held responsible for content posted. Ironically, repealing section 230 would require Twitter to take down more content, including many of Trump’s tweets. “The censorship Rubicon was crossed,” the hard-right online personality Mike Cernovich told his followers on Wednesday. “Mark Zuckerberg has declared himself your master and owner. Do you accept this?” But such pushback may carry less weight than it once did, with opinion polling now suggesting not just a probable Biden win, but a possible Democratic sweep. “Having engaged with Facebook, I wouldn’t say that the last few weeks have been radically different from [them] having watched the polls,” said Oxford’s Bright. “But there’s no doubt that they’re closely concerned with who is president.” Twitter has been contacted for comment.

          "bodyText": "Every few years my mother would buy a different version of the same book, only to abandon it after several weeks: How to Identify the Trees of Northeastern America. With the regularity of a trans-hemispheric weather cycle she’d come home, drop what appeared to be a travel brochure to the Republic of Trees on the table, and proclaim: “This time I’m going to learn the names of the goddamn trees.” She never did. Growing up amid this excess of tree-based literature I at least learned to distinguish maple from oak, beech from elm, spruce from pine. But even long after my mother died, my taxonomic view of trees remained arrested in something like a primary color filter of the world: I knew there were thousands of them, but I could only name six. Until the arrival of a pandemic. This new cycle of family obsession began with the eastern redbud outside my window, or as I’d often called it, the “pink flowery one”. In mid-March, along with much of the world, I found myself stuck at home, no longer making the 100-mile train trip south to New York City for work. As infection rates climbed, and we began to count deaths along with new cases, the eastern redbud burst into bloom, scandalously pink flowers in brash contradiction of its name. My nine-year-old, who has spent endless afternoons tucked into the boy-shaped crook of this tree, asked what it was called. With all the unearned confidence of my mother I blurted out the first word my glitchy dial-up of a mind could locate: “Lilac.” But I knew this wasn’t right, so I turned to the real internet and typed “looks like a lilac tree” into the search field. My strategy didn’t get much more organized than that beyond coming to rely on predictive search to help with common mistakes, typing things like “the difference between spruce and …” and letting the algorithm take care of the rest. And here is where I can claim no particular talent or virtue for moving beyond my mother’s facility for naming trees: she never had instant access to millions of images of leaves, nor to three-minute explanatory videos walking through the difference between a London plane tree and an American sycamore. In some non-western spiritual frameworks, to name something, to classify it, is to pin it to the page like a dead specimen, an act of desiccation – if not quite desecration – committed upon a live and vibrant thing. But the common names of trees, I quickly discovered, are like little stories, dense descriptive metaphors packed with history and life: the generosity of “pig-nut hickory” and its evocation of rough bounty; the excitable “hophornbeam” – AKA “ironwood” – and its metaphorical boasts of hardness (AKA the thoroughly disquieting “musclewood”, which grows in the uncanny valley of sylvan nicknames); the overcompensations of “showy mountain ash”, which can’t quite tell if it’s a shrub or a tree; the arrogance of the “staghorn sumac” and its disembodied red velvet antlers; the bewitching promise of the “golden raintree”, invasive in its beauty; the sprawling wayside calm of the “wayfaring tree”. I encounter simpler trees, now, as I pause on my daily pandemic walks, noting a decorous row of honey locusts on the way to the corner store, or the huddle of twisting red cedars that guards a vacant lot, or the giant lone silver maple at the end of the block, spreading wide and tall in its relative isolation. Moments spent with each newly named tree render the world a little less apocalyptic, counterbalancing the sense of confinement that has come to pervade our lives – brief as it may be, I feel the world expanding outward through limb and leaf. These accidents of grace also hold within them communion with my mother, and the fulfillment of a commitment she could never keep. My mum’s last words, as her family gathered in the hospice wing of a small-town Ontario hospital to sit and stand and sit again, to drink bad coffee and to wet her lips with small white swabs, were “blue, blue, blue”. They were spoken neither as instruction nor declaration, but rather as description – she was naming something. None of us will ever know what it was she named – whether feeling or vision or destination – but we will never forget the gentleness with which she named it. There is a giant blue spruce on my family’s land in southern Quebec. At 70ft, this blue spruce presides over a great outcropping of granite, a glacial erratic dropped there 20,000 years ago that now looms large in family mythology. My grandparents’ ashes are scattered there beneath the big blue spruce, as are my parents’, that they might watch over the ramshackle cottage that has held five generations, soon to be six, in endless moments of celebration and mourning, all of us, the living and the dead, guarded on either side by legions of hemlock, beech and sugar maple forever ascending the steep valley walls."

          "headline": "When handouts go straight to ministers' constituencies, it's time for local control",
          "bodyText": "Before last year’s election, Boris Johnson’s local government minister, Robert Jenrick, announced a massive £3.6bn of handouts to 101 “left-behind” towns across England. Forty of these were defined by Whitehall as most in need. The remainder were allegedly chosen by two ministers, Jenrick and his number two, Jake Berry. Most were marginal seats, all but one of which voted Tory at the subsequent election. They included Jenrick’s Newark and Berry’s Darwen, neither in the most needy category. (Newark was 270th.) Jenrick even boasted that he had secured an opportunity to future-proof Newark, after it was awarded the maximum £25m grant. He has subsequently insisted that there was a “robust and fair” methodology to the allocations and dismissed as “completely baseless” allegations that he was involved in Newark’s selection. The grants were strongly condemned by the National Audit Office last July and Labour is now demanding an explanation, which Jenrick is refusing to give. The accusation is that, to a degree, Johnson’s majority of 80 was bought. Never has Britain’s centralised government been more in the spotlight than now. After over six months of trying single-handedly to suppress coronavirus, Johnson has today accepted what was evident from across Europe, that local government is best at governing locally. His “world-beating” private contractors and beta-quality ministers have failed. He now needs the local knowledge, resources and staff that only elected town and city government can supply. Local councils are replying that they need power and money if they are to rebuild Whitehall’s chaotic coronavirus regime. They need power to micro-manage social distancing, hospitality and the protection of hospitals and care homes. They need power over local universities, clearly reckless hotspots of infection. Reports of Whitehall arguments into the night suggest that Johnson’s aides are denying them this power. They want to fix the three new tiers of lockdown, their content and their timing. Local government also desperately needs money, both to make enforcement consensual and to pinpoint the most desperate recoveries in local economies. That restoration cannot be centrally determined. Least of all can it be in the hands of Jenrick. Grants, loans and furloughs cannot be apparently built on an edifice of favouritism and political advantage. In just a year in office, Jenrick has shown blatant bias in his decisions. He attempted to help the Tory donor Richard Desmond avoid tax by rushing through approval for a housing development in Docklands, a decision that was subsequently overturned. His new planning algorithm will favour property developers in the south. His white paper even invents a class of builder to be excused from regulations governing conserving historic buildings with “earned autonomy”. It’s not clear how those rights can be earned. Whitehall ministers have for decades banned local councils from raising taxes or loans, forcing them to come cap in hand to the centre for grants and other favours. This has led Britain to the widest disparity between rich and poor regions in west Europe. It has also led to favouritism to contractors and projects more typical of a banana republic. Rumours are already swirling round the sums disbursed to certain companies during coronavirus. Public funds must be subject to public audit. Yet the towns fund affair showed the National Audit Office to be a paper tiger, and parliament likewise. Vast sums of taxpayers’ money are now splurging into the public and private economy without meaningful control. If Johnson’s post-Covid, post-Brexit Britain must rely on the sweepings of a political pork barrel, the outlook is dire. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "NHS 111 call centre was unsafe, says worker who nearly died from Covid",
          "bodyText": "Stephen Poore was a healthy, hearty, hardworking family man before he got a job at an NHS 111 call centre in early March, as the pandemic was extending its grip across the country. He became a Covid-19 service adviser, handling 111 calls from anxious members of the public. That is where he believes he contracted the virus, crammed together with other recruits in the call centre. Poore is now blind in one eye, has blurred vision in the other and has to use a walking frame, having come close to death as he spent 42 days on a ventilator in hospital. Since the start of the pandemic, the government and the NHS have directed people to use the 111 telephone or online service if they fear they have coronavirus, to help keep GPs and hospitals clear to cope with more serious cases. NHS England says 111 has helped millions of people receive the right care and advice. But in recent weeks the Guardian has uncovered alarming questions about the 111 service, the training it gave call handlers and the advice it gave to people who had coronavirus. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice Group estimates that a fifth of its 2,000 members’ relatives died after calling 111 and being told to stay at home. Approximately 6,000 people were rapidly recruited to work in the NHS’s new 111 coronavirus response service (CRS), mostly contracted to private operators. NHS England has said that they were carefully selected, screened and trained. But some recruits to the CRS have told the Guardian they had no experience and negligible training before beginning to handle calls. Two people who worked for the French corporation Teleperformance, at call centres in Gateshead and Ashby, also said there was no social distancing there. Teleperformance insists it has adhered to government guidelines at all its call centres and provided the requisite training. Poore, 63, had been helping his daughter, Alyshia Richardson, run a pub until their contract ended in January. They both found work as temps at a 111 call centre in Ashford, Kent run by the South East Coast ambulance service (Secamb), paid £9.17 an hour. Secamb is a regular NHS 111 provider. It says it did not become part of the CRS and it has taken on 149 new call handlers to deal with additional workload since the start of the pandemic. Unlike new CRS call handlers who could be giving advice to the public immediately, guided by a flowchart or algorithm, at Secamb the service advisers’ role was to take initial details from callers and, if they appeared to have Covid-19 symptoms, pass them on to an already trained 111 health adviser. It was a stressful job. “We had people calling up very distressed, some saying they wanted to end their life,” Richardson said. “It really affected me; I worried about them, whether they got the help they needed.” Yet for the 111 call centre staff themselves, she and her father said, there was no robust protection. “There was no social distancing,” said Poore, who has diabetes which he was then managing through his diet. “The biggest distance between people was half a metre to a metre. People were sitting close together at the workstations and directly facing opposite; they could be coughing and spluttering.” He believes he must have contracted Covid-19 in the call centre, first calling in sick on 30 March, because as lockdown had been announced on 23 March and some restrictions a week earlier, he had only been driving to work and then home again and not going anywhere else. By 7 April, struggling to breathe, he was taken by ambulance to the William Harvey hospital in Ashford. Within three days he was put into a coma and on to a ventilator. He came out of hospital in a wheelchair on 19 August. “The next day was our 43rd wedding anniversary,” he said. “I’d missed the wife’s birthday, so I wasn’t going to miss that.” The virus has taken a heavy toll. “I was fit and fine before; now it’s more or less clear I’ll never work again. It’s a long road ahead. My stamina and fitness are out the window. If it weren’t for my wife and kids, I wouldn’t be here. They fought for me tooth and nail.” Richardson also contracted the virus, but did not suffer as severely as her father. “They only put social distancing in place at the call centre after my dad was in hospital,” she said. “My mum phoned them up and said it was disgusting. “My dad went in there healthy; now he’s blind, in a wheelchair. His lungs failed, his kidneys failed, he needs insulin for his diabetes. We couldn’t go and see him in hospital, which affected his recovery and my mum’s mental health. It’s been horrendous.” A Secamb spokesperson insisted that social distancing was in place at the call centre when Poore and Richardson worked there, as well as temperature checks, a testing policy and alcohol hand gel and disinfectant wipes at work stations. However, four other people who worked at the call centre at the time told the Guardian there was no social distancing before Poore became ill. Sandra Dyson, who joined in early March, said staff were all sitting closely together at workstations. “One day after Steve had gone to hospital, they came and put yellow tape across every other desk, so we had that space between us then,” she said. Samantha Fisk, who worked in the same team as Poore and Richardson, also recalled no social distancing until the tape was put across the workstations in April. “We were crammed in together,” she said, “and we all used the same coffee and small seating areas too. I had Covid symptoms myself in early April and was off sick.” Secamb said in a statement that “significant numbers” of its workforce had not become “seriously unwell” during the pandemic, and it had supported those who contracted Covid-19. “Our thoughts are with Mr Poore and his family as he continues his recovery. We take staff welfare extremely seriously and have acted quickly in line with national guidance and government advice throughout the Covid-19 pandemic to protect both our staff and patients,” it said. “From early March we introduced infection control measures at our NHS 111 contact centre in Ashford and other worksites. We have continued to adapt our workplaces throughout the pandemic to mitigate against the spread of the virus.” Poore is doing his best to maintain his sense of humour. “We got a job in NHS 111 to give advice to people about the coronavirus, and I’m pretty sure that’s where I caught it,” he said. “This will be my party story for the rest of my days.”"

          "headline": "YouTube more representative of Britain than television, says UK boss",
          "bodyText": "YouTube’s UK boss has said his platform is more representative of modern Britain than broadcasters such as the BBC, saying that television channels are falling behind because they do not provide material that speaks directly to all parts of the country. The Google-owned video service is on the cusp of overtaking the BBC as the dominant media source for 16- to 34-year-olds in the UK, with the average adult internet user watching 46 minutes of YouTube per day. Its growing dominance of the UK media market has focused government attention on the site’s impact on traditional broadcast outlets and whether it should have similar public service obligations to traditional television channels. Ben McOwen Wilson said a key part of his platform’s success was that it offered audiences material from “different races, genders and regional diversity that just isn’t available in traditional media”. He highlighted the beauty presenter Patricia Bright, along with Folkestone PE teacher Matt Morsia, who quit his job to become a full-time YouTuber and “now earns way more than you or I will ever earn. I don’t know that traditional media was ever looking to cast someone from Folkestone in fitness videos.” McOwen Wilson argued that while traditional British TV channels were still essentially elitist and London-centric in their outlook, his site was creating global stars. These include Colin Furze, a science presenter from Lincolnshire, who gets a cut of the site’s advertising revenue. Instead, YouTube is working with the BBC to help the broadcaster increase its on-screen and off-screen diversity in terms of race, geographic and economic background. “It is just not accurate to depict us as something that is only taking from the British creative industries,” says McOwen Wilson. “Consumers get to view content that they can’t find anywhere else. “What we create, which the public service broadcasters do not, is an export opportunity.” He added that 84% of the views on UK-uploaded content came from outside the UK. “Their success is global. It’s not limited to these shores.” Unlike the UK’s public service broadcasters – the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 – YouTube is not legally required to invest in original news content. YouTube has also spent years grappling with the radicalising effects of its algorithm and reputation as a home for conspiracies and extremist material. Last week, the new BBC director general, Tim Davie, told an Ofcom panel on the future of TV that he admired YouTube. But he said its approach of serving specific niches with user-created created content would not work for the BBC: “That is different to a public service brief curated in a way that’s meant to be universal, with all its trauma and angst.” One regular criticism of YouTube from the UK’s broadcasters is its appropriateness for young children. The BBC regularly emphasises the thought and effort that goes into its children’s programming. This includes ensuring it is psychologically appropriate for age groups. YouTube’s children’s programming is created by third parties. McOwen Wilson instead said the site was filling a gap for parents after many UK channels reduced their investment in original British children’s programming. “I care about British television,” he said. “The reality is that at a time when volume of hours was going down, platforms such as YouTube and Netflix and others were bringing content forward. He acceptied the programmes may not be created to the same standards as that found on CBeebies. “We are not the commissioners of that content. We are not sat there ensuring the quality of that content compared with the BBC or others. It’s not us who’s making the commissioning decision. Our role is about making sure the platform is safe for parents and children.” He said that while the site removed tens of millions of videos a year for breaching its rules, its approach to unpalatable content that did not break rules was to reduce its audience by tweaking the site’s recommendation algorithm, rather than banning them altogether. “We recognise that in the UK we have a long tradition of liberal speech. There is that sense that we should not be overreaching in terms of closing people down because of how we would like to shape their views on the platform. “We will absolutely remove content that is in breach of any of our policies on hate speech. But also we have a view that while we may respect free speech in terms of allowing content to be uploaded on to the platform, we will reduce that flow of viewership. Access to the YouTube algorithm is a privilege.”"

          "bodyText": "I am currently applying for French citizenship. It’s a slow, intricate process – a bit like quilting, I imagine, except I am stitching together proof of my good character, spousal affection, mastery of the subjunctive and, er, birth, instead of fabric. I am very lucky. I am entitled to French citizenship, but do not need it. I have no immediate plans to live in France; I don’t need citizenship to work, be with my family or have the sense of stability and permanence that motivates many applicants. It is more a lockdown hobby than an immediate aspiration. I used to be desperate to be French, but maturity has brought an acceptance that Yorkshire Gold runs through my veins and I really love apologising. I’m stupidly happy living in the UK, despite, well, pretty much everything. Unfortunately, I can’t expect my French husband to put up with the Etonian venality and incompetence forever, especially post-Brexit. France has its share of suboptimal leadership, of course: Macron’s mid-pandemic reshuffle went down like a pasteurised Camembert and Prime Minister Castex’s recent tone-deaf declaration that he hadn’t downloaded the state Covid app because it’s not really for people like him was worthy of a British cabinet minister. But at least in France, my spouse argues, he could drown his sorrows by seeing a GP the same day for something non-life threatening. My application process has been one step forward, two steps into paperwork chaos. It’s largely self-inflicted. I have mislaid apostilled translations (I still don’t know what an apostille is, maybe a bit like an armadillo), missed deadlines and even registered for the wrong language test (the Canadian one, tabarnak!) This latest idiocy has necessitated a series of panicky emails to the testing centre, couched in those flowery French politeness formulas, where I beg the revered reader to accept that I, a disgusting wretch, might have the insolence to sully their eyes with the expression of my humblest respect. I love that stuff, thankfully, since the testing centre only replies to one email in three. It is not purely my incompetence. The French citizenship process is densely bureaucratic, requiring a black belt in form filling. It’s also inexplicably ravenous for recent birth certificates – what do they do with them, why must they be so fresh? An official somewhere must be sitting on a Mont Blanc of crisp, new certificates. This is, of course, nothing compared to the painful, labyrinthine process of trying to acquire British citizenship. Nesrine Malik has written beautifully about the dehumanising cruelty of the “UK’s brutal and incompetent” immigration regime – the endless changes of policy, the bad faith and injustice, the soul-sapping sense of insecurity it engenders. To take just one aspect of the grotesque process, have you tried taking a Life in the UK test, the notorious “Britishness” exam that demands you know the number of raisins in a Welsh cake, the birthdays of Queen Anne’s prime ministers and every time limit under Code C of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (I paraphrase, but only very slightly)? I have, and can confirm it is simultaneously stupidly hard and plain stupid. I got multiple legal and history questions wrong despite being a qualified solicitor and history graduate. One test question asks whether “new ideas about politics, philosophy and science” were developed during the 16th, 17th, 18th or 19th centuries (yes, there’s a single “correct” answer). A child could devise a better citizenship test; anything short of the A-Level algorithm could. This idea that citizenship is a rare prize is horribly persistent. In the UK it demands a mythological hero’s quest through the hostile environment in which you prove your worth by completing a set of baffling tasks at great personal cost. Stray from the path, mislay a payslip, fail to get 70 points and you’ll be eaten by a Minotaur (or Priti Patel might banish you to live on a volcano). In other places, on rare occasions, citizenship is bestowed on the heroically virtuous (remember the undocumented Malian hero who was “given” citizenship for saving a child from a burning Parisian building?) Even this dubious approach is too much to hope from the UK government, which refused to exempt NHS workers saving lives and risking their own this year from the healthcare immigration surcharge. This system continues its alienating work as the Migration Advisory Committee has just added senior care workers and nursing assistants to its “shortage occupation list”, declaring itself “particularly concerned about the social care sector”, and noting the declining number of migrants coming to the UK. Duh, frankly. Our immigration system is based on a notion of Britishness as a privilege and source of pride that feels absurd in 2020, as economic indicators tumble, poverty deepens and spreads and public life looks more corrupt and tawdrier than ever. It does not have to be that way. Imagine living in a country that is transparent, humane and welcoming towards those who want to live here: that really would be something to be proud of.

          "bodyText": "One day after school in January this year, Isabelle walked to the high street in East Grinstead, West Sussex, where her mother works in a shop selling gifts and clothes. She was with her boyfriend, Alex, who would be meeting her mum for the first time. “It kind of took her by surprise a bit,” Isabelle says, remembering the awkwardness of the moment. When that was over, Isabelle sprang another surprise: a few hours earlier she had received an offer to read Earth sciences at Oxford University. “Mum gave me a big hug,” says Isabelle, who is now 18. “She was absolutely over the moon for me.” That evening, Isabelle made herself pasta for dinner and sat down to think about it. Over the past month she had convinced herself that she wouldn’t get into Oxford, and that she didn’t belong there anyway. She remembered the terrible night after her first interview, sitting in a college room in tears, feeling like an impostor. But now, with an offer letter sitting on the table, she started to have a change of heart. She was going to be the first person in her extended family to go to university, and this was an offer from one of the best universities in the world. “I thought, I’ve got to do it,” she says. Late that night she sent me an email about how she was feeling. “It hasn’t really sunk in yet, to be honest,” she wrote. “But I’m pleased.” Isabelle and I first met in March last year at Sackville school, the West Sussex comprehensive she attended from the age of 11. The school is close to where I grew up, and for the past year and a half I have been mentoring students there, trying to help them get into Oxford, Cambridge, University College London and other leading universities. It started as a casual offer of help to my local school and went on to become an all-consuming project – the thing my friends would ask about first when I saw them, and a challenge that has given me more satisfaction than any story I’ve written as a journalist. High-achieving students at state schools like Sackville often lose out in the battle for places at the most selective universities. The application process is supposed to uncover talent and potential, but often seems designed to reward traits such as confidence and polish, handing a significant advantage to applicants whose parents went to university, and whose school knows the subtleties of a good application, often due to decades or even centuries of experience. In the case of many private schools, knowing how to convert great A-levels into places at elite universities is the reason they can charge such high fees. When I first met Isabelle and her schoolmates, I had just moved home to live with my mother, after my father died suddenly in late 2018. Dad had lived in this area all his life, and when I was growing up he volunteered to help dig various local institutions out of financial difficulty, including a school and a community farm. Helping out at Sackville provided a distraction from my grief, and felt like the kind of civic-minded thing he would do. Added to that, three generations of my relatives have gone to Sackville, since my grandparents settled in this corner of West Sussex as Jewish Czech refugees in the 1940s. These included two aunts, a bunch of cousins and, currently, my cousin’s 12-year-old daughter. If you are passing through East Grinstead on your way to Lewes or Brighton, you might spot Sackville, crouching behind some high hedges just before the town gives way to fields and villages. It is probably what many people picture when they think of a comprehensive: cheerless 1960s buildings, well over a thousand students, and some very average A-level results, literally: the school’s average A-level grade is a C, which is the national average. It performs above average at GCSE and is rated “Good” by Ofsted; but its sixth form isn’t selective, and around four out of every five students have parents who didn’t go to university. In recent years, Sackville’s deputy headteacher, Adrian De Souza, had become frustrated that too few of his best sixth-formers were getting places at leading universities. “We talked about it a lot,” he says. “We had the feeling there was something we weren’t doing.” No Sackville student had gone to Oxford or Cambridge since 2013, despite plenty of them having good enough grades – including some who got interviews but didn’t get places. The proportion of school leavers going to the most sought-after Russell Group universities was also disappointing. De Souza is a preternaturally warm and engaging teacher, who seems to have a running in-joke with every second student we pass in Sackville’s corridors. He felt that, as the resources at his disposal have been squeezed (spending per pupil in England has fallen 8% in real terms since 2009-10), it was becoming harder to compete with the private sector. The six-year Oxbridge dry spell was only a part of the problem, but it was symbolic. De Souza went to Bristol University, and knows that this country’s obsession with Oxbridge borders on the perverse. But he also thinks that what’s possible for students at the local private schools should be possible for his students, too. (Disclaimer: I went to one of these private schools, and to Cambridge University.) At one point in my first meeting at the school, Isabelle was waved in – a confident girl wearing black jeans and white Converse trainers, with wavy blond hair that she dyes a reasonably convincing ginger. After being introduced, she asked me what she could do to prepare for an application to Oxford and other prestigious universities like Imperial, Manchester and UCL. I didn’t have a good answer ready, but later that night I emailed friends who had also studied at Cambridge. I asked them all: what would you tell her? “Interview training is imperative,” replied a friend who now works in the City of London. “If you have never been in a situation where someone is challenging your intellect/interest/whole identity, such a massive part of it is just retaining your cool.” Others offered tips about preparatory reading, or emphasised the importance of making sure the students have the confidence to apply in the first place. A few weeks later, Sackville’s head of sixth form, Helen Valentine, assembled 10 of her highest-achieving year 12s, including Isabelle. They sat in front of me around a U shape of desks in a computer room, wearing casual clothes and chatting among themselves. For those who wanted to apply for Oxford or Cambridge, or to study medicine, the deadline was about six months away. These students became known among teachers as the “Oxbridge group”, but everything we were doing was supposed to work for Bristol, Durham and all the other Russell Group universities they were applying to at the same time. I told them I would try to give them something approximating the support students from private schools get. We would meet every week or two to talk about their subjects. They seemed receptive, but didn’t ask any questions. I tried to project confidence about the whole thing, because I knew how important a commodity confidence was going to be. But naturally, I also had some doubts. *** If you want a place at one of Britain’s top universities, you need to beat a lot of very well-prepared, expensively educated young people to get it. A recent report showed that almost half the schools that teach the most privileged 20% of students in the country – mostly private schools and grammars – have at least one dedicated “university adviser”. St Paul’s in London has 12 teachers who are trained as “UK university advisers” and nine staff who act as “counsellors and support staff for US university applications”, according to the school’s website. And if wealthy parents aren’t content with what their school is giving them, they often top it up with private tutors. “Parents normally say, ‘I need someone who has graduated from that course in the past few years,’” the head of a leading tutoring agency in London tells me. “If you are applying for PPE at Oxford, we will find tutors who have done that course.” A new book, Social Mobility And Its Enemies, calls this “education’s dark side” and argues that parents are engaging in an “ever-escalating educational arms race”. Lee Elliot Major, the book’s co-author and a professor of social mobility at Exeter University, tells me that in an increasingly complex admissions process, there are big advantages for applicants who know “the rules of the game” – including the subtle art of tailoring your personal statement. It goes without saying that most state schools don’t have the time or resources to offer this kind of preparation. A school like Sackville gets £4,000 a year to educate each member of its sixth form, a small fraction of most private school fees. Teachers spend most of their time teaching or preparing for class. “Teachers could go and learn the rules of the game at various careers conferences,” says Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, “but do they have time? The conferences I speak at are full of private-school teachers, often ones who are dedicated to uni preparation.” The result is that entry to the most sought-after universities is utterly dominated by private schools, and a narrow group of state schools that are either highly selective, or have a long tradition of getting students into elite universities, or both. Admissions data obtained by the Guardian from Oxford and Cambridge under freedom of information laws illustrates this clearly. Both universities made about half of their undergraduate offers to state school students in the past few years, with the remainder split roughly evenly between private school and overseas applicants. But the vast majority of the state school offers – more than two-thirds – went to just 300 schools. These schools represent the highest-performing 10% of state schools in the country and are mostly grammar schools, highly selective sixth-form colleges or academies in wealthy areas. They average around five Cambridge offers a year, and four from Oxford, so have plenty of experience in getting the best students in. Students from the remaining 90% of state schools – roughly 2,700 – get significantly fewer Oxbridge offers. On average, students from these schools, which include most regular comprehensives like Sackville, get an offer from Cambridge once every four years, and an offer from Oxford every five years. And before anyone dismisses this disparity on the grounds that these schools aren’t applying: the figures show that at least one student at most of this country’s schools and colleges applies to Oxford or Cambridge every year. When top universities boast about their state school intakes, it’s easy to forget this silent majority of frozen-out schools, where the students who get in are statistical outliers. Or, as one of my friends put it when I worked out the figures: “That’s a pretty sad state of affairs for anything resembling a meritocracy.” And when it comes to university applications, failure begets failure, according to Sir Peter Lampl, founder of social mobility charity the Sutton Trust. “It’s hard for state schools to gear up, because they only get one student in every five years,” he says. That isn’t a bad description of what had been happening at Sackville. The daunting challenge was to help the school jump from the forgotten 90% into the tiny elite. *** When she was in year 8, Isabelle remembers telling three friends that she wanted to study science at Oxford. She was half joking, half dreaming, she says. “It didn’t seem real, to be honest. It was very much something that people like me didn’t do.” Five years later, Isabelle and those three friends were all in our little group, including Lucy, applying to study English at Cambridge. Also in the group was Eren, a tall, unflappable young man who spends his weekends either working at a garden centre or climbing sheer rock faces. He grew up in Croydon, south London, before his parents moved to Sussex (his father works in construction and his mother is a yoga teacher). He has a similar memory to Isabelle: aged 13, he told a girl sitting next to him in science class, “I want to do physics at Cambridge”, but remembers thinking, “That’s not really going to happen, is it?” There were definitely times in my months working with the students when it felt as if it wasn’t going to happen. My notes for the early meetings sometimes just say: “Didn’t email” or “Didn’t come”. I was spending a lot of my time just persuading a few of the students that they were good enough. Eren says the school’s track record played on his mind. “For however many years, no one got in [to Oxbridge], so you think there must be a pretty good reason for that.” After a month or two, though, I started to have a good feeling about the students. They had the kind of work ethic and grades that top universities expect, and they seemed to enjoy the challenge we had been set. I told them to treat getting into university like a mini extra A-level: something that requires a bit of work every week, reading interesting articles about their chosen subjects, and learning how to talk about what they had read when we met. Ayo, Sackville’s head boy and one of its best footballers, whose parents had come to England from Nigeria when he was small, prepared for his application to Stanford in California by reading longform articles about economics. Lucy read lesser-known short stories by F Scott Fitzgerald and made interesting connections between them. Eren had been reading fairly advanced books about physics since he was a teenager, and just needed reminding that mentioning them in his application was a good idea. Sometimes our sessions were about sharpening the students’ thoughts, or picking them up if someone or something had knocked their confidence. As last spring turned into summer, my Tuesday morning volunteering gig was occupying more of my thoughts. I would email ideas to De Souza and Valentine at 1am, while watching Netflix. I used my group chat of university friends to answer questions about courses, colleges and future careers. Two of them took a day off work to do practice interviews, meeting the students one by one. At the end of each interview, I could hear them give the same pep talk: we think you’re good enough for this, so believe in yourself. When I visited the school, De Souza, Valentine and I would sit in Valentine’s office next to the sixth-form study room at lunchtime, drinking coffee and making plans. It had become a team effort that energised a handful of staff, and it was exciting. We felt these kids were going to do well, and they deserved to. The teachers had worked with most of the students for half a decade, and they deserved it, too. On a beautiful, sunny day in June, my former tutor at Cambridge agreed to show the students around the university. He gave them tips for their applications, and subjected me to a rapid-fire mock interview in his office to show the students what their own interviews might be like. On the bus back, the pupils chatted about Love Island, debating who was more of a snake, Maura or Mollie-Mae. I wasn’t sure how they would respond to the visit, but looking back, Valentine says it was a turning point. “They felt they had a really good chance,” she says. “There were no more tears and drama after that. We felt that something was in our grasp, that something special could happen this year.” Eren says it was the visit that convinced him to apply: it had made an unrealistic prospect seem real. *** Around the time that the Sackville students were putting the final touches to their applications, Dr Marchella Ward, the outreach fellow at Worcester College, Oxford, was challenging her colleagues with a radical proposal. Ward, whose job it is to attract a wider cohort of students to the college, wanted to make this year’s intake – the ones starting their courses this month – “genuinely representative”. She resolved that the students who got offers from Worcester should look like the students nationwide who achieve AAA and above at A-level, in terms of their schools and economic backgrounds. That meant persuading the college’s admissions tutors to focus on how they were assessing potential in students; to figure out why they were admitting a lot of privileged candidates. One of the key areas they looked at was personal statements – the one-page sales pitch that every applicant has to submit via the Ucas system. As all 21 university advisers at St Paul’s know, there is a particular skill to writing a personal statement for an elite university. It involves a certain type of showing off: talking about a 1971 lecture you came across by a Nobel prize-winning chemist; or linking something you studied at A-level to a review you read in the Times Literary Supplement (which you most definitely did not come across at school). Making those kinds of references suggests to admissions tutors that you are a highly engaged, impressively self-directed learner who will thrive at universities where embracing the specific and the obscure is a way of life. It’s the oldest trick in the book, and Ward wanted her college to stop falling for it. She felt strongly that the college was missing out on outstanding students in favour of ones who were better coached. “It was about asking tutors to think really hard about what it was that was making them impressed,” she says. “We’ve got to be thinking carefully about why we think potential looks that way.” When it came to targets, Ward wanted Worcester to move away from thinking about simple binary metrics like state or private school, which she says can always be gamed. Instead she asked her colleagues to pay particular attention to a new dashboard of “contextual” data, provided by the university to its colleges about all Oxford applicants, which ranked every student by factors like what percentage of their school is on free school meals. “It’s about assessing potential in a way that takes all sorts of advantage into account,” she tells me. By mid-January this year, we knew our efforts at Sackville had paid off. Every student in our group had offers from universities such as Durham, Imperial, LSE, Edinburgh, Manchester and UCL. And then, while I was driving along the motorway on a grey and drizzly morning, I saw an email from Valentine: Isabelle had an offer to read Earth sciences at Oxford – with grades of A*AA. And Grace, another of our applicants, had been accepted by Oxford to study geography, having taken her A-levels last year. I pulled into the next service station, sat down in a Starbucks to read it again, and messaged my friends Shyam and Frankie, who since doing the practice interviews had become almost as invested as me. I punched the air several times, and worried that the man at the next table would see I had tears in my eyes. Valentine was on a school trip in Hamburg with Sackville’s headteacher, Julian Grant. “I can only describe it as like an election night, when you’re sitting up waiting for the seats to come in,” she remembers. “I realised it meant an awful lot to very many of us.” She kept refreshing her phone, watching Ucas Track, the website where university offers show up, until the news came through that both Lucy and Eren had offers from Cambridge. “We really felt very proud for the school,” Valentine says. “There was a feeling of elation, first and foremost, for the students, and for you, and for ourselves as well.” Eren got his offer to study natural sciences at Cambridge via email on his phone first thing in the morning, feeling “as psyched as you can be when you’ve just woken up”. He put a screenshot on his family WhatsApp group. “I think my mum replied first – she was quite chuffed. I think she just said, ‘Well done’, and probably made a joke about posh people.” His dad called him from his office. “He was crying a bit. He said he had told all his friends from work.” Ayo was offered a place at Stanford, majoring in economics. The final list of offers felt almost unreal; overall, twice as many Sackville students as the year before had offers from Russell Group universities. What does it prove? “I think the interesting thing about your story is that it puts a big question mark over the admission practices of these universities,” says Nick Hillman, who was an adviser to the former universities minister David Willetts. “The kids who got in, Oxbridge obviously thinks are good enough. And previously Oxbridge would never have found out about them.” Duncan Exley, former director of the Equality Trust, says he isn’t surprised, either. He points out that social mobility charities like the Brilliant Club, Into University and the Sutton Trust have shown “measurable results” from mentoring talented state school students. But that support is unevenly spread. One of the people interviewed in Exley’s new book, The End of Aspiration? Social Mobility And Our Children’s Fading Prospects, told him: “If you are a kid in Tower Hamlets, you are practically chased down the street by social mobility charities. But in rural Norfolk, there is nobody.” Marchella Ward’s efforts at Worcester also bore fruit. She says 83% of the college’s offers went to state school students and 20% went to students from areas with low progress rates into higher education, both comfortably above the percentages from those groups who get AAA or above. Several Oxford colleges have asked her to explain how she did it. After thousands of A-level students were downgraded in this year’s exam fiasco, Worcester was the first Oxbridge college to say it would honour its existing offers. Between Sackville and Worcester, you have two different approaches to solving the problem of access to our most selective universities. You either teach a lot more students the rules of the game – or you change those rules. Some people, like Elliot Major, support sending trained advisers into every school, paid for by the government. Ward says that’s fine as a stopgap until universities get better at assessing potential rather than coaching and polish. “Let’s do that as long as we have to. But as universities, let’s make that time as short as possible,” she says. The independent Office for Students, which regulates universities, has been running a consultation on changes to the application process; proposals include scrapping personal statements, and the system of applying for university before you get your results. But this has been paused during the pandemic. All of the Sackville group ended up with the grades they needed, despite the flawed A-level algorithm. Isabelle is in various WhatsApp groups with other students who held offers from Oxford, which lit up with emotional messages when people lost their places on results day. “Some people missed their grades by one, and others were getting Cs and Ds,” she says. Some got their places back, after the government U-turn, or on appeal. Those who didn’t left the group chats. Of course, none of us had any idea how strange and disrupted their university experience would turn out be. Ayo is beginning his Stanford degree remotely, and Eren says he has “accepted it’s going be different”. One of the students I spoke to recently isn’t too upset about the cancellation of freshers’ week (“I’m sure we will have plenty of fun on the sly”), but says it is “demoralising to have worked so hard and be paying so much for this ‘world-class education’ via Zoom”. She is resigned to a compromised first year, but hopes it will improve afterwards. The students applying for university next year have to submit their applications by 15 October if they are applying to study medicine, veterinary science, dentistry, or want to go to Oxford or Cambridge. Many have missed out on a huge chunk of lessons, particularly at state schools. There are well-founded fears that students at private schools and those with private tutors will have an even greater advantage this year. A study by UCL’s Institute of Education found that while 31% of private schools provided four or more live online lessons per day during lockdown, that was the case for only 6% of state schools. Eren says he now wonders about all the other state schools that don’t send many or any students to Oxbridge. A couple of times he told me about his old school in Croydon, an underperforming comprehensive. His old school mates have struggled to get the places they wanted. “If you go to a school that hasn’t given you all the opportunities that you can have, it’s going to be way harder for you,” he says. “I think there’s a loss of talent and intelligence. It’s just a waste of people.” • Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

          "bodyText": "The chronic uncertainty pervading England’s secondary schools may be just one among many problems that Boris Johnson’s government is failing to deal with. But the urgency of the situation regarding GCSE and A-level exams, due to be taken by more than 1 million teenagers next summer, makes the lack of clarity from ministers inexcusable. Wednesday’s announcement by the Scottish government that National 5s (roughly equivalent to GCSEs) would be replaced by teacher assessment threw the UK government’s inaction into stark relief. Details of an adjusted GCSE timetable from the Welsh and Northern Irish administrations are also awaited. Since schools closed in March, it has been obvious that pupils who were then in the first year of two-year exam courses (years 10 and 12) faced potentially damaging consequences. Yet the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has still not clarified how next summer’s exams will be changed to take account of learning missed, or what happens if the pandemic stops them from taking place – although an announcement about contingency plans is expected. Clearly, the postponement of exams by three weeks cannot make up for a term (or more) of missed classes. Nor does the funding allocated to “catch-up” tutoring in England provide an answer. What makes the government’s silence all the more deafening is that there is no shortage of suggestions. Given the extent to which the current system is geared towards testing, cancelling exams at this stage could create more problems than it solves. But increased “optionality”, meaning more choice of questions, makes sense. So does a proposal tabled by unions, headteachers and governors to introduce staged assessments, moderated to ensure fairness. Sir Michael Wilshaw has put forward similar arguments and, as a former chief inspector of schools appointed by Michael Gove, he is someone the government might be expected to listen to. Other questions require answers, too. These include the extra demands of the pandemic on school budgets and the government’s plan for Ofsted inspections to resume, given the pressures schools are under. Then there are the issues connected with remote learning, including training, equipment and the likelihood that a rise in the amount of time spent out of school will increase inequalities. Longstanding problems of teacher recruitment and retention are expected to ease in the current economic climate, but risks associated with shortages and burnout have not gone away. There is a strong case, too, for taking another look at the whole system and particularly GCSEs, as some school leaders and Conservative MPs are demanding. Existing arrangements have been exposed by the pandemic as lacking in resilience. Exam stress is widely regarded as contributing to teenagers’ unhappiness. The chaos and controversy surrounding the algorithm used to decide this summer’s grades points to wider concerns around statistical modelling and “norm referencing”, whereby the number of students receiving a grade is fixed without reference to objective standards (so that, for example, the bottom 5% of entries could be graded 1 regardless of their strength except in relation to other entries). Labour MPs should add their voices to those calling for reform. But any sudden upheaval must be resisted. The priority now is helping schools and pupils to recover lost ground and raise their level of preparedness, with a focus on vulnerable groups and individuals. Ministers must lead these efforts. Distractions such as the recent issuing of guidance to schools forbidding the teaching of unspecified “victim narratives” should not be repeated. Such announcements give the impression that, rather than being supporters of schools, ministers see themselves as their antagonists. And perhaps this is the case, at least in part? Mr Gove, who with his adviser, Dominic Cummings, cultivated a bunker mentality when he was education secretary, remains at the heart of government. Nick Gibb, who once described his favourite book (by the American academic ED Hirsch) as an “armoury against the education establishment”, has been a schools minister for 10 years. Such posturing was never constructive. But if, in the midst of a pandemic, with children’s education hanging in the balance, ministers still see themselves as fighting some kind of battle against ideologically suspect teachers, everyone who cares about schools should be worried."

          "bodyText": "The government faces a potentially serious rebellion over its plans to centralise and accelerate the housebuilding process in England after Theresa May led a string of senior Tory MPs in expressing opposition to the proposals in parliament. May, speaking in a Commons backbench debate organised by another Conservative MP, Bob Seely, said that while she and others fully supported the need for more homes to be built, ministers must “think again on this”. The former prime minister, who has in recent weeks also been a vocal critic of the government’s plans to break international law by unilaterally rewriting parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, said the plans would remove local decision-making, build over rural areas, and not deliver the affordable homes needed. “We do need to build more homes, but we won’t do that by forcing local authorities to grant more planning permissions to developers so that they can build more homes to bring the price down – because developers simply won’t do it,” she said. “The government does need to think again on this and it needs to understand the impact that the proposals it has put forward are going to have.” The planning changes, set out in a white paper in August, would remove councils from many routine decisions and instead use an algorithm to set new housing targets for local areas. Analysis of the algorithm has alarmed many Tory MPs and councillors after it suggested that many of the homes needed for an annual target of 333,000 would be built in Conservative heartlands such as Kent and Surrey. The backbench motion by Seely, which has no force on the government, requests that the new system is not introduced without a debate and a vote in the Commons. Seely, the Isle of Wight MP, said the algorithm risked ensuring that with new homes, “the biggest housing increases will be to rural shires and suburbs, and the biggest falls are in the urban north and Midlands”. Virtually every Tory MP who spoke criticised the plans, with former May-era cabinet minister Jeremy Hunt saying they risked “eroding local democracy, reducing affordable housing and encroaching on our beautiful countryside”. He added: “The government must think again.” Damian Green, the Ashford MP and former de facto deputy to May, said he and other Kent MPs were deeply worried. “Algorithms are a tool for mathematicians, not politicians,” he said. “We are in danger of turning the garden of England into a patio.” Other Tory former ministers who joined in the criticism included Chris Grayling, who said the plans would merely “suck growth” into the south-east of England, Damian Hinds and Caroline Nokes. Nokes, the former immigration minister, said local councils were better able to decide where new housing should be built. “Let local councillors who have a track record of delivery carry on delivering,” she urged. Boris Johnson’s spokesman said no action would mean people being less able to buy a home. He said: “That’s why we must reform the planning system to cut red tape and make the system faster, while ensuring that councils and local people can decide where developments should and shouldn’t go.” Asked about the Tory MPs’ worries that the algorithm would mean building money being pulled into the south of England rather than the north or Midlands, he said: “The changes that we have put forward are part of a consultation, so naturally we will listen to the feedback to ensure we do this in the best way.”"

          "bodyText": "Top story: ‘Greatest failure’ in presidential history Good morning, Warren Murray getting you off the starting blocks. Mike Pence and Kamala Harris have sparred over the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic in the only vice-presidential debate of the 2020 election. “The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris, Joe Biden’s running mate, said in her opening comments to Pence, Trump’s vice-president who leads the White House’s coronavirus task force. “This administration has forfeited their right to re-election.” Pence responded: “I want the American people to know, from the very first day, President Trump has put the health of America first,” he said. Promising a vaccine for the virus before the end of the year, he accused Harris of undermining faith in a potential treatment. The vice-president repeatedly tried to butt in on Harris and spoke longer than his allowed time repeatedly. But the largely orderly debate was in stark contrast to the chaotic encounter between Biden and Trump – discreet themes were actually discernible, although both candidates dodged questions. David Smith’s analysis from Washington: “Both candidates did a better job than their bosses in last week’s debate apocalypse. At times, it almost felt like a brief holiday in political normality.” A fly that alighted on Pence’s head provided some distraction for viewers. The candidates were seated 12 feet apart and separated by plexiglass dividers – any guest who was unmasked was supposed to be shown the door, but afterwards Pence’s wife, Karen, joined him on stage without wearing one. Donald Trump, no doubt conscious of the spotlight falling somewhere other than on him, did another turn in front of the cameras as he remains under coronavirus watch – more of that further down. * * * Coronavirus latest – More than 80% of people who tested positive in a UK national coronavirus survey had none of the core symptoms the day they were tested, scientists say. Their findings carry a warning that controlling future Covid-19 outbreaks may hinge on more widespread testing in the community, universities and high-risk workplaces. While he is supposed to be quarantining, a deeply overtanned-looking Donald Trump has made another free-wheeling video address, this time saying his infection with coronavirus was a “blessing from God” and declaring he wants to give the Regeneron treatment to all Americans for free as he sweepingly and inaccurately hailed the unapproved therapy it as a “cure”. Developments are continuing to come in at our global live blog. * * * Brexit bill’s ‘slippery slope’ – Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has urged the British government to come good on a Brexit deal but admitted it was “difficult to feel optimistic” as Boris Johnson pursues an internal market bill that violates the withdrawal agreement, endorses breaching international law and limits legal challenge. The bill is part of a “very slippery slope” towards “dictatorship” or “tyranny” under the government’s Brexit strategy, says the former supreme court president Lord Neuberger. The data watchdog has concluded Cambridge Analytica did not directly misuse data in the Brexit referendum or help Russia meddle in UK politics. But Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, warned its activities raised concerns about the influence of technology in politics. The Cambridge Analytica founder Alexander Nix has been disqualified from being a company director for seven years for “offering potentially unethical services” including bribery or honey traps and spreading information anonymously in political campaigns. * * * Climate crisis – The world this year experienced its hottest September on record, scientists have reported. Surface air temperatures were 0.05C warmer than in the previous year, say experts from the EU’s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) said. It was also the hottest September Europe has seen, beating the 2018 record by around 0.2C. The World Bank has estimated an additional 150 million people could be pushed into extreme poverty by the end of next year as conflict, climate change and Covid-19 end two decades of progress in raising living standards of those on the lowest incomes. Meanwhile a study has found the spread of intensive farming is threatening to jeopardise the world’s chances of meeting the aims of the Paris agreement on the climate crisis, as the increasing use of artificial fertiliser and growing livestock herds raise greenhouse gases to levels far beyond those in nature. * * * ‘Spoon fed manipulation’ – Facebook, used by Russia to affect the 2016 election, has announced it will stop running political ads in the US after polls close on 3 November for an undetermined period of time, “to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse”. But the internet freedom group Fight for the Future said: “At the same time they’re tweaking their algorithm to go into overdrive recruiting people into groups where they’ll be spoon fed manipulation and misinformation.” It comes alongside revelations by the InfluenceMap group that Facebook is exposing millions of people to climate denial ads funded by US conservative groups. Senator Elizabeth Warren said: “InfluenceMap’s devastating report reveals how Facebook lets climate deniers spread dangerous junk to millions of people.” * * * ‘Glad it reconsidered’ – Drone footage has captured an Australian surfer’s narrow escape from a 2.5m great white shark off the coast of Ballina in northern New South Wales. Matt Wilkinson was paddling on his board near Sharpes Beach on Wednesday when a shark swam quickly up behind him. “I heard a splash and a noise and looked around and couldn’t see anything,” Wilkinson said. “The drone came down and told me that there was a dangerous shark in the area, return to the beach. It looks like it’s going for my leg and it’s changed its mind … I’m just glad today the shark reconsidered at the last second.” Following the incident, the beach was evacuated and closed for the day.

For the final we squeezed in Donald Trump after his latest odd to say the least video appearance. The lead story in our print edition is that pubs and restaurants in swathes of the north of England face new restrictions within days, while Nicola Sturgeon has announced a nationwide crackdown on indoor drinking in Scotland. And the pub restrictions dominate elsewhere too. “PM may shut pubs despite mounting Labour opposition” says the Telegraph while the Times has “Restaurants and pubs in the north forced to shut again”. “It’s grim sup north” says the Sun in a regrettable effort. You can imagine how the page might look if Labour was in charge, but the Express shrugs on behalf of Matt Hancock about tight public health measures: “It’s very tough but we have to stick with it”. The Mail takes a different view: “So when will they listen?” it asks, as it says tough measures have not helped in 19 out of 20 northern towns, and continues to promote herd immunity theories that are, in the words of one expert, “outside the scientific mainstream”. The Mirror does join the Mail in asking: “Why aren’t local lockdowns working?” and the Metro says “Lockdowns ‘are failing’” citing analysis by Labour. “Local furlough in return for tougher rules” says an i headline that the Briefing had to read a few times.

          "headline": "Facebook announces plan to stop political ads after 3 November",
          "bodyText": "Facebook has announced significant changes to its advertising and misinformation policies, saying it will stop running political ads in the United States after polls close on 3 November for an undetermined period of time. The changes, announced on Wednesday, come in an effort to “protect the integrity” of the upcoming election “by fighting foreign interference, misinformation and voter suppression”, the company said in a blogpost. Facebook’s chief executive officer, Mark Zuckerberg, had previously defended the controversial decision not to factcheck political advertising on the platform, but in recent weeks Facebook has begun to remove political ads that feature dangerous and misleading claims. In early September, the company pledged to stop running new political ads one week before 3 November, the day of the United States elections, to prevent last-minute misinformation. Now it will also disallow political advertising entirely following election day “to reduce opportunities for confusion or abuse”. In other words, Facebook will not allow new advertisements starting one week before 3 November, and immediately after polls close it will stop running all political advertisements indefinitely. The company did not give a timeline for if or when political advertising would return. The new policies mark important progress toward protecting elections, said Vanita Gupta, the president and chief executive officer of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of dozens of nonprofits and human rights groups advocating for democracy. “We are seeing unprecedented attacks on legitimate, reliable and secure voting methods designed to delegitimize the election,” Gupta said. “These are important steps for Facebook to take to combat disinformation and the premature calling of election results before every vote is counted.” Others said the change is too little, too late. Senator Elizabeth Warren called the changes “performative”. The internet freedom group Fight for the Future said in a tweet the change “isn’t going to fix the problem at all”. The group noted that Facebook’s recent decision to allow content from private groups to appear in newsfeeds will increase misinformation and negate any positive changes that come from an advertising ban. “Facebook is banning political ads but at the same time they’re tweaking their algorithm to go into overdrive recruiting people into groups where they’ll be spoon-fed manipulation and misinformation,” Fight For the Future said. Facebook is seeking to avoid another political disaster after it was found that Facebook was used by Russian operatives in 2016 to manipulate the United States elections. Since then, Facebook has hired thousands of people working on safety and security surrounding elections and has worked on more than 200 elections around the globe, “learning from each” and making “substantial progress”, the company said. Executives at Facebook, including Zuckerberg, reportedly became increasingly alarmed at language from Donald Trump suggesting the president would not participate in a peaceful transfer of power. Trump has also been accused of encouraging violence when he told white supremacists to “stand back and stand by” and encouraged supporters to “go to the polls” and “watch very carefully” at the first presidential debate. The company also said it will be removing calls for people to engage in poll watching that use “militarized language” or suggest the goal is to intimidate voters or election officials. Zuckerberg has previously expressed concern about challenges posed by the surge in mail-in ballots this year due to the pandemic. “I’m also worried that with our nation so divided and election results potentially taking days or even weeks to be finalized, there could be an increased risk of civil unrest across the country,” he said. Facebook said it would respond to candidates or parties making premature claims of victory, before races were called by major media outlets, by adding labels and notifications about the state of the race."

          "bodyText": "Nicola Sturgeon has announced a nationwide ban on drinking indoors in licensed premises in Scotland for more than two weeks, with a full shutdown of all premises across the central belt where infection rates are accelerating most rapidly. Here is a guide to the new rules. Boris Johnson must set out the scientific evidence behind the introduction of further lockdown measures in England, Keir Starmer has said, hinting his party could vote against implementing the 10pm hospitality curfew if the government fails to provide further evidence. England’s poorest communities are nearly four times as likely to face lockdown restrictions as the wealthiest areas, a Guardian analysis has found, as local leaders warned of a “winter of dangerous discontent” in the north of England without urgent financial support. More than £10m is being spent on a network of NHS clinics across England for people with “long Covid”. David Frost, the government’s chief Brexit negotiator, has hinted that the UK is now willing to agree to robust joint rules with the EU covering state aid. This has been seen as the key obstacle to a trade deal, because the UK government has been resistant to an agreement that would significantly constrain its state aid policy in the future. But today, in evidence to a Lords committee, Frost said he could imagine a situation where the UK would welcome a robust dispute resolution mechanism - because it would want to use it against the EU. (See 5.55pm.) Giving evidence to a committee of MPs later he said: The point I was trying to make on state aid is that whatever the final agreement, whatever the form of dispute settlement on subsidies, I could imagine we would be at least as assiduous users of it as the EU would be. He also said that he thought the two sides might be able to reach agreement on this within the next two weeks. He said: The EU in its text in March this year did not want to make certain aspects sensitive to it subject to [state aid] arbitration. We are likely to do the same. And I think what we’re trying to do in the next couple of weeks is find a balance between those two things. During the same hearing Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, put the chances of a deal at 60/40. And Frost said fisheries was now the most difficult issue between the two sides to resolve. These are from my colleague Lisa O’Carroll. Boris Johnson is prepared to make a major compromise to secure security ties with the EU by pledging in a deal on the future relationship not to rip up the Human Rights Act, my colleague Daniel Boffey reports. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. This is what Charles Michel, president of the European council, tweeted after his call with Boris Johnson earlier. (See 5.55pm.) Earlier Boris Johnson had a call with Charles Michel, the president of the European council. Afterwards Downing Street released this read-out. The prime minister outlined our clear commitment to trying to reach an agreement, underlining that a deal was better for both sides. He also underlined that, nevertheless, the UK was prepared to end the transition period on Australia-style terms if an agreement could not be found. Although some progress had been made in recent discussions, they acknowledged that significant areas of difference remain, particularly on fisheries. Chief negotiators should continue to work intensively in the coming days to try to bridge the gaps. The prime minister reiterated that any deal must reflect what the British people voted for and that businesses and citizens needed certainty very soon on the terms of our future relationship. These are from the BBC’s Europe editor Katya Adler with her take on what’s going on. Adler was referring to these comments from Frost in evidence to a Lords committee earlier (which got overlooked here, I’m afraid, because there was so much else going on). More than 2,000 students have now tested positive for Covid at Manchester’s two universities since term began: 1,264 at the University of Manchester and at least 900 at Manchester Metropolitan University (MMU). The latter figure is almost certainly an underestimate, as it doesn’t include any positive tests from a one-day mass testing pilot conducted at two MMU halls of residence — Birley and Cambridge — on 30 September. Around 1,700 students in those halls were told to quarantine on 25 September for a fortnight after an outbreak in the flats. Manchester City Council, which worked on the pilot with Public Health England, said around 800 students took part, but wouldn’t say how many tested positive. “We will not be releasing this information until all of the tests have been returned and students have been informed of their results,” said a spokesman. From the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg In Northern Ireland the chief medical officer, Dr Michael McBride, has said said the region is only two weeks away from seeing hospital admissions reach the level they were in March. (See 5.28pm.) At a briefing he said: We are only two short weeks away from seeing hospital admissions as high as they were back in March. It is our actions and decisions in the coming days that will determine how bad that situation becomes. It is too easy to forget how quickly the figures rise and how rapidly the rising cases can impact on our already stretched health service. Northern Ireland’s chief scientific adviser, Prof Ian Young, said the upturn in cases started from the middle of August. He said: At the moment the seven-day rolling average of new cases per day is above 500 and has more than doubled within the last week. Young said the level of testing had increased by around 15% while the number of positive cases had doubled. The increase in cases is not due to increased testing as confirmed by the percentage of tests which are positive. The seven-day average for that is now running at over 8% and on some days has been over 12% of all tests positive. Young said the R number for the virus is estimated to now be at 1.5 in Northern Ireland. And in Northern Ireland there have been 828 new coronavirus cases, and one further death. According to the dashboard from the Department of Health in Northern Ireland, there were 106 patients in hospital with Covid yesterday. A week ago the number was 89. Public Health Wales has recorded 752 further coronavirus cases and three further deaths. The details are here. The latest detailed hospital admission figures, available from NHS England here, show that the problems seems to be particularly severe in the north, as the head of NHS Providers said earlier. (See 2.23pm.) Of the 472 coronavirus admissions on Monday, 141 were in the north-west, and 123 were in the north-east and Yorkshire. The hospitality industry has reacted with anger and despair to news of the two-week shutdown, attacking the Scottish government for failing to consult on the measures before the announcement in Holyrood this afternoon. Describing the measures as “a hammer blow to Scotland’s hospitality sector and the businesses that rely on it”, James Withers, chief executive of Scotland Food and Drink, said: This may seem a short-term, two-week hit, but it is targeted at businesses that are barely clinging on to survival. Liz Cameron, chief executive of the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, condemned the “complete and utter lack of consultation with business” which she said “only serves to compound the blows of these restrictions”. Cameron said: These measures will sound the death knell for businesses across the hospitality sector, especially pubs and bars. Restaurants and hotels, whilst remaining open, will also be constrained on what they can provide and this will place a large dent in their already reduced income. Meanwhile, the Scottish Beer &amp; Pub Association has said that the £40m of economic support offered by Sturgeon is unlikely to save many businesses. CEO Emma McClarkin said: For the majority of premises, the available funds will not even come close to covering the required furlough contributions for the period, never mind ongoing fixed costs and stock. We need to review the financial support on offer and work with government to protect as many pubs, jobs and livelihoods as possible. Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and David Frost, the UK’s chief Brexit negotiator, have just started giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee (or the committee on the future relationship with the EU, to give it its formal name). You can watch it here. I won’t be covering it in full, but I will be monitoring it, and will pick up any highlights. Similar measures to those currently in place in north-east England – where household mixing is banned in any indoor setting – could be announced for Nottingham, where the coronavirus rate dramatically increased over the weekend. In the week ending 3 October, there were 440.1 cases per 100,000 people in the city, compared with 71.2 in the week ending 23 September, meaning it now has the fifth highest rate in England. Nottingham city council’s director of public health, Alison Challenger, described the surge as “extremely worrying” and said strict new government measures were expected to be announced by tomorrow. “I would expect that the measures put in [place] in the north-east are very likely to be those measures that are introduced here,” she said. Although coronavirus rates in Nottinghamshire remain much lower than the city, despite rises in cases, Challenger said that “it would not be a surprise” if the county was also subject to new restrictions. She added that although the backlog of infections that went unreported by Public Health England for a week may have contributed to the rise, “it is nonetheless a very significant and sudden change” and additional measures were needed imminently. It is thought that the surge correlates with the return of students to the two universities, with most positive results being received by younger people who are at a lower risk from the virus, although Challenger said the number of people in hospital was starting to rise in Nottingham. The University of Nottingham has so far reported 425 cases among its student population, while Nottingham Trent University is yet to make public its caseload. One set of exams for Scottish pupils has been cancelled for next year, John Swinney, the Scottish education secretary, told MSPs. He said that National 5 exams would be cancelled and replaced by grades reached through alternative assessment and teacher judgment. Higher and Advanced Higher exams, which are taken by older pupils, will go ahead. But they will will be pushed back by two weeks in 2021 until 13 May, Swinney said: In a statement to the Scottish parliament, Swinney said: In a normal exam year, National 5s constitute more than half of all exams taken. From a public health point of view, not running these exams significantly reduces risk. National 5 pupils will receive awards based on their coursework and the judgement of their teachers, with robust quality assurance. We have learned lessons from this year’s initial SQA gradings - there will be no algorithm for moderating grades in 2021. By replacing National 5 exams, we can hold an exam diet for Highers and Advanced Highers if public health guidance allows – these are the qualifications most pupils leave schools with that determine paths into work, college, or university. The UK government has just updated its coronavirus dashboard. Here are the key figures. The UK has record 14,162 cases. That is down slightly from yesterday’s total (14,542), but the trend is clear; cases are now running at double what they were this time last week and almost five times what they were a month ago. The UK has recorded 70 more deaths. That is slightly down on yesterday’s figure, 76. It takes the headline total to 42,515. But this only counts people who died within 28 days of testing positive. The dashboard says the total number of deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, registered up to last Friday, is 57,347. Almost 3,000 patients are now in hospital in England with coronavirus. Today’s figure is 2,944, up from 2,783 yesterday. There are now 376 hospital patients on mechanical ventilation in England, up from 349 yesterday. These are the people who are most seriously ill. Hospital admissions in England are still on a sharp upward trend. On Monday, the most recent date for which figures are available on the dashboard, 472 people were admitted to hospital in England with coronavirus. That was down slightly on the total for Sunday (478), but both figures are well above the figure for Saturday (386) and higher than any figure since early June. NHS England has recorded 54 more coronavirus hospital deaths. The details are here. A week ago the equivalent figure was 43. Beverley Hughes, the deputy mayor of Greater Manchester with responsibility for policing, said police were increasingly issuing fines at weddings which had more than 15 guests. She told reporters at a press conference: I don’t know if it’s that people have put off weddings that were going to be in the spring and now think they’ve got to get on with it, but it almost feels as if the fines that people will get – the fixed penalty notices – are being factored in as a cost that people will bear in order to go ahead with their weddings. As well as issuing fines to venues allowing too many guests, the police have the powers to enforce the wearing of face coverings at weddings, including to issue fines (fixed penalty notices) of £200, doubling for further breaches up to a maximum of £6,400. Greater Manchester police had also attended a number of funerals so large they “needed their own policing operation”, Hughes said. Northumbria and Newcastle universities have announced they will move the bulk of their teaching online, following protests by staff and threats of industrial action after more than 1,000 students in the city tested positive for Covid-19. They join the universities of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan, Sheffield and Sheffield Hallam as restricting face-to-face teaching to a small number of courses such as clinical medicine in the last two days. Staff at Northumbria had earlier voted to hold a ballot on industrial action over health and safety fears. Iain Owen, a University and College Union regional official, said: “It was the right decision for Newcastle’s universities to move learning online. But it should not have taken the threat of industrial action for Northumbria University to put the health and safety of its staff and students first.” UCU members at the University of Warwick have also voted in favour of a strike ballot, warning that industrial action is likely if the university’s management fails to shift to online teaching. “If the university refuses to immediately make online teaching the default option for all teaching, except in limited circumstances of practice-based modules, and to apply this to all staff including casualised staff, then the committee now has a mandate to ballot members of our branch for industrial action,” Warwick’s UCU branch said on Twitter. Universities around the UK continue to report increased numbers of infections among staff and students, with the University of Birmingham revealing 315 cases as of yesterday, and Leeds more than 550. There are no plans in Wales for “circuit break” restrictions at the moment but the option was being kept under “very close review” according to the country’s chief medical officer, Dr Frank Atherton. But Atherton said it was possible that a “rolling programme” of local lockdowns be put in place throughout the autumn and winter to help control the virus. “Having a flexible policy of being able to move areas into and out of some form of local restrictions, depending on the level of transmission in the area, will help us to manage spikes in cases, while hopefully avoiding the pain of a national lockdown,” he said. Atherton said the R rate in Wales was believed to be 1.4. He said the number of older people contracting the virus was increasing. In Cardiff in the first week of August 11% of those with the virus were aged over 60. Now the figure is 16%. Asked if he was worried about Donald Trump’s call for people to be unafraid of the virus, Atherton said he hoped people didn’t take Trump as their guide on the disease. Asked what would happen after 25 October, when the new restrictions announced today are due to come to an end, Nicola Sturgeon told the Scottish parliament that the intention was to then return to the rules applying now. Here are two more charts from the Scottish government’s evidence paper (pdf) about Covid trends released this afternoon. (See 2.47pm.) This one shows how hospital admissions have risen in recent weeks. And this one shows Scotland’s case rate per 100,000 people compared with rates in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and some EU countries. It shows Scotland having a lower rate than England, Wales and Northern Ireland (the worst performer on the chart, by far) – even though Scotland is now imposing restrictions that go beyond what applies in the other three countries of the UK. In response to a question from the Lib Dem leader in the Scottish parliament, Sturgeon said she was still committed to a strategy of eliminating the virus. She said all four nations of the UK wanted to suppress it. This is what Nicola Sturgeon said at the end of her statement. These new restrictions will last for 16 days. They are intended to be short, sharp action to arrest a worrying increase in infection. However, although they are temporary, they are needed. Without them, there is a risk the virus will be out of control by the end of this month. But with them, we hope to slow its spread. That will help to keep schools and businesses open over the winter. And it will save lives. Here is my colleague Libby Brooks’ story about the new measures in Scotland. Although Nicola Sturgeon did not use the term, the restrictions will certainly feel like the “circuit-breaker” that people have been speculating about. Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives in the Scottish parliament, asked Sturgeon to give details of how businesses would be able to get some of the £40m being made available to help. Sturgeon said there would be a short consultation with the sector before that gets decided. She said this would only take a day or too. But she wanted to speak to them first. This is what Sturgeon said about why she was not closing pubs completely. And this is what she said about exceptions. Sturgeon also says the government will make £40m available to support businesses affected by these measures. Sturgeon also announces extra measures for the central belt in Scotland. In the central belt snooker and pool halls, bowling alleys, casinos and bingo halls will have to shut for a fortnight from Saturday. People in these areas will also be told to avoid public transport unless journeys are absolutely necessary. Sturgeon is announcing the new rules. Pubs and restaurants will not be allowed to serve alcohol indoors for 16 days, starting this Friday. They will be allowed to serve food and non-alcoholic drinks inside from 6am to 6pm. Hotel restaurants will be able to serve people after these hours, but without alcohol. Pubs and restaurants will still be able to serve people outside, subject to the current rules. In five areas pubs will have to close completely during this period. Sturgeon says Scots have recently been following the rule saying they must not meet in other people’s homes. That should make a difference, she says. She says, if she was acting on health grounds alone, she would go further. But she has to take into account the economic impact too. Sturgeon says Covid cases are growing at around 7% per day. She quotes the finding from today’s evidence paper saying, without action, cases will rise to the level they were in March by the end of this month. (See 2.47pm.) Sturgeon says a great deal of progress has been made. She says the country is not going back into lockdown, and schools are not being closed. But she says the new measures “will feel like a backward step”, and in some ways they are, she says. She says new cases are now running at an average 788 per day. Hospital admissions have risen by 80%, she says. And she says the same number of people died last week as in the previous month. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, is addressing the Scottish parliament now. She starts with the latest Covid figures. She says there have been 1,054 further cases. Some 13% of people tested were positive. There are 319 people in hospital - an increase of 57 on the previous day, she says. She says 28 people are in intensive care - three more than the previous day. And there has been one further death. The full details are here. From the Daily Mail’s Jason Groves From Bloomberg The Scottish government has just published an evidence paper (pdf) covering Covid trends in Scotland. It says the reproduction number is between 1.3 and 1.7 and that the doubling time for cases is nine days. It says, if the virus continues to spread at the rate it is doing now, then infections will reach the level they were in March by the end of the month. We know the total number of confirmed cases is lower than the total number of new Covid-19 infections, as some people don’t have symptoms and some people with symptoms don’t come forward for testing. Currently we estimate the total number of infections is around 2,900 per day, which represents around 13% of the peak in March/April. 2 However, at the current rate of growth (7% increase per day), the number of infections would be at the level of the March peak by the end of October. Ministers are considering a rethink of the compulsory 10pm closing time, Joe Murphy reports in the Evening Standard. “Among ideas now under discussion in Whitehall are a later closing time, a drinking-up period, and measures designed to disperse customers more slowly from premises to avoid crowding on pavements and public transport,” he writes. MPs are expected to vote on the measure next week and, with Labour demanding a rethink, there is now a real chance of the government losing if it tries to maintain the current 10pm rule. This became apparent in the Commons last Thursday, when Tory MPs were queuing up one after another to condemn it and virtually no one spoke out in favour. Yesterday the government published figures showing hospital coronavirus admissions in England rising by a quarter between Saturday and Sunday. But, as the detailed figures show, and as Boris Johnson pointed out at PMQs (see 12.06pm), the problem is particularly acute in the north. The overall figure for admissions on Sunday was 478 - up from 386 the previous day. But of those 478, 208 were in the north-west, and 126 were in the north-east and Yorkshire. On the World at One Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and other NHS trusts, said hospitals in the north if England were now seeing admission levels equivalent to those in the spring, when the epidemic was at its peak. He also said health chiefs in the region wanted to see restrictions tightened soon to stop the problem getting worse. He told the programme: I’ve spoken to three chief executives in the north of England today all three of whom are saying, ‘Please, please everybody, don’t be misled by the national statistics’, which show that, yes, hospital admissions are much lower on a national basis than they were in the first phase. What they’re saying is they are seeing admission levels which are now at the same as they were in the north of England in the peak. And what they’re saying to us is they’re concerned. In their view, it’s pretty clear evidence that the local lockdown measures that are in place aren’t working sufficiently well ... So what they’re saying is, we need to think really carefully, really quite quickly, about whether we do need to go for tougher local lockdowns. Hopson also said any new restrictions needed to be introduced quickly. He said: And the other point they’re making is there’s no point waiting for tougher local lockdowns until people are swamped. You’ve got to start turning the tap off probably four to six weeks before you think you’re going to hit the peak that you can’t cope with. So this is now becoming, as far as northern hospitals is concerned, a really important issue, and one that needs to be dealt with quickly. The Guardian’s latest Politics Weekly podcast is out. Heather Stewart and Peter Walker discuss the latest from Westminster. Plus Anita Boateng and Paul Harrison review the prime minister’s performance at the Conservative party conference. Boris Johnson has always been weak at PMQs, but mostly that has primarily come over as a performance problem. Today he was a bit stronger than usual performance-wise, but it was obvious that, even if he possessed the parliamentary oratorical brilliance of someone like William Hague, he would have failed to have come out on top because he’s handicapped by a fundamental policy problem; he is trying to defend a Covid strategy that just isn’t working. Sir Keir Starmer highlighted this best in his fourth question. He asked: In Bury, when restriction were introduced, the infection rate was around 20 per 100,000. Today it’s 266. In Burnley it was 21 per 100,000 when restriction were introduced. Now it’s 434. In Bolton it was 18 per 100,000. Now it’s 255. The prime minister really needs to understand that local communities are angry and frustrated. So will he level with the people of Bury, Burnley and Bolton and tell them, what does he actually think the problem is here? Faced with the charge that his local lockdown strategy isn’t working, the best reply that Johnson could come up with was: “The problem is, alas, that the disease continues to spread in the way that I described earlier.” Someone needs to tell Johnson to stop using the word “alas” - something he is saying increasingly frequently - because it makes him sound as if he is trivialising the calamitous. But that wasn’t what was wrong; the central flaw was that Johnson could not provide an answer as to why local lockdowns aren’t containing their virus. (“Things would be even worse without them” might not have been an inspiring answer, but it would at least have been true.) Johnson was also flummoxed by the next Starmer question. In the prime minister’s own local authority Hillingdon, today there are 62 cases per 100,000 yet no local restrictions. But in 20 local areas across England, restrictions were imposed when infection rates were much lower. In Kirklees it was just 29 per 100,000. Local communities, prime minister, genuinely don’t understand these differences. Can he please explain for them? Johnson did not have a decent response to this one either, even though he should have done, because it featured in his car crash interview with Granada’s Hannah Miller last week. What redeemed the encounter for Johnson, a bit, is that he was able to put Starmer under some pressure using the charge of opportunism. Labour is now opposing restrictions it once supported, he claimed. On the rule of six, Starmer shot him down with ease (see 12.12pm - Labour did not need to vote for the regulations last night for them to pass, and so the fact the party abstained is a procedural detail of little interest to anyone outside Westminster.) And this line was effective: For the prime minister’s benefit, let me take this slowly for him. We support measures to protect health. We want track and trace to work. But the government is messing it up and it’s our duty to point it out. But on the 10pm compulsory closing time, Starmer did sound on weaker ground as he sought to explain why Labour may no longer be willing to vote in favour. Starmer said that he needed to see the scientific evidence for the measure, but that begs the question, why did Labour back the idea in the first place, when that scientific evidence was not available? A more plausible line would have been to say that the 10pm rule has been tried, it doesn’t seem to be working as intended, and now it’s time for a rethink. This is the argument that Starmer was making last week, when he first indicated that Labour would no longer vote to uphold it. Taiwo Owatemi (Lab) says Coventry is running out of brownfield sites. So where will the new homes it needs be built? Johnson says there is abundant brownfield space all over the country. He says as the former planning authority for London, he knows. He says rules are making building difficult. He will turn generation rent into generation buy. And that’s it. PMQs is over. Stephen Timms (Lab) says it would be unthinkable to cut the £20 universal credit uplift before the crisis is over. Johnson says this is being kept under review. Paul Bristow (Con) asks if the PM agrees that adult learners need support. Johnson says he does. He speaks about investment in Bristow’s constituency, Peterborough. Liz Twist (Lab) says restrictions in the north-east are making it uneconomical for businesses to stay open. What will the government do to help, and to protect the 80,000 jobs in the hospitality industry? And will he meet local leaders? Johnson says the government will continue to offer support. But Labour must decide if it is in favour of the plan or against? Maria Eagle (Lab) asks if the PM agrees that tighter local lockdown restrictions should trigger automatic local support schemes. And will he agree one for Merseyside as a matter of urgency? Johnson says he shares the concern about the loss of jobs. It is wretched, he says. He says the government has already given money to councils and it will continue to put its arms around communities. Johnson says the government is leading the way globally in protecting biodiversity. Chris Elmore (Lab) says the chancellor said yesterday that musicians should find another job. What better advice can the government give them? Johnson says that is not what the chancellor said. Andrew Jones (Con) asks about the events industry. It is really important in Harrogate. Will a package of support be offered? Johnson says this is a very important industry, worth £90bn. There is already support available. But the best solution would be to have a testing system that can allow conferences to take place and theatres to open (ie, the moonshot). Matt Western (Lab) says Deloitte will not set up its testing facility in Leamington until the end of the month, later than expected. But students are there now. Johnson says there have been particular problems in some parts of the country. Christian Wakeford (Con) asks about support for local shops. Johnson says more money is being spent supporting local businesses. Sir Jeffery Donaldson, the DUP leader at Westminster, says it would be devastating to Northern Ireland to have barriers to trade in the Irish Sea. Will the PM protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK internal market? Will there be unfettered access for businesses trading both ways? Johnson says Donaldson is “entirely right” and he hopes Donaldson’s words are heard in Brussels. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says the government has refused to commit to making the £20 uplift to universal credit permanent. Will it do that? Johnson says he is glad Blackford now supports universal credit. The government will continue to support people in poverty. Blackford says a thinktank says that, if the £20 uplift is lost, hundreds of thousands of families will be plunged into poverty. Will the PM do the right thing and make the uplift permanent? Johnson says it is vital that the government tackles poverty. He says more money is being put into universal credit. He says that should give Blackford the answer he wants. Johnson hints government will maintain the £20 increase in the value of universal credit introduced as a temporary measure during the Covid crisis. UPDATE: Here is the direct quote from Johnson. It is vital that we tackle poverty in this country, that’s why this government is so proud of what we did with the national living wage and what I can tell him on universal credit is that we’re putting another £1.7bn into universal credit by 2023/2024 and if that doesn’t give him the answer that he wants then he can ask again next week. We will continue to support people, families, across this country and we continue to spend £95bn a year in this country on working-age welfare, but the best thing we can do for families, for people on universal credit, is to get this virus down, get our economy moving again and get them back into well-paid, high-skilled jobs, and that’s what we’re going to do. John Stevenson (Con) asks the PM to move parts of government out of London to Carlisle. Johnson says he has spent at least one happy night out in Carlisle. He will consider this. He has an ambitious programme to level up, he says. Starmer says next week MPs will vote on the 10pm closing time rule. Is there a scientific basis for it? If there is, will the government publish it? Johnson says the basis for it is the same as it was when Labour backed it two weeks ago. What kind of signal does this send to the country? “That’s not new leadership, that’s no leadership.” The government is imposing restrictions to fight the virus and allow the economy to carry on. Starmer says he is going to go slowly, to help the PM. Labour supports local restrictions. It supports track and trace. But it wants them to work, and it will go on pointing that out. He quotes figures for how cases are rising in Bury, Burnley and Bolton. What is the problem? Johnson says the problem is that the virus continues to spread. The government is using a combination of national and local measures. Labour should support them. Does Labour support the rule of six. Yes or no? Yes, says Starmer. But he says Johnson needs to hear local communities where infection has gone up tenfold. He tells Johnson that if he listens to the question, they will get on better. He says there are no local restrictions in Johnson’s constituency, Hillingdon, even though cases are higher there than in some areas under restrictions. Johnson says he has explained the reason for local lockdowns. There needs to be a concerted national guidance, he says. He says it is extraordinary that Starmer supports the rule of six while his party abstains. Starmer says thousands of people have been walking around who should have been self-isolating. He says it would be one thing if this were a one-off. But it isn’t. He quotes other mistakes, and says this is government by hindsight. It is 100 days since the first local restrictions were introduced. They are not working. What will the government do? Johnson says the government will support areas that need lockdowns. He says two weeks ago Starmer said he supported the rule of six. But last night in the vote on it Labour abstained. Starmer says the PM’s assurance does not wash. In Manchester some of the cases date back to the middle of September. It is too late to contact people, and if they could be reached, it would be too late to tell them to self-isolate anyway. Why did it happen? Johnson says Starmer cannot call it a computer error and a human error. He repeats the point about how the mistake has not changed the assessment of the disease. He quotes the latest figures for Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle. He says two-thirds of those admitted into hospital on Sunday were in the north-east, the north-west and Yorkshire. Sir Keir Starmer asks the PM if he accepts that lives have been put at risk from the computer error last week. Johnson says all the 16,000 people got their results. And their contacts are being chased up. He says the missing data has not changed the government’s assessment of the spread of the disease. Sir David Amess (Con) says he is publishing a book next month. Does the PM agree that the last election was about whether the result of the Brexit referendum was implemented? Will the PM do that? Boris Johnson says this country has left the EU, and on 1 January it will “take back full control of our money, our borders and our laws”. From Sky’s political editor, Beth Rigby From ITV’s political editor, Robert Peston PMQs is starting soon. You can read the list of MPs down to ask a question here. The new coronavirus restrictions being announced in Scotland this afternoon will be closely watched in England because they may provide a clue as to what Boris Johnson’s will be doing shortly. According to a story by Harry Cole in the Sun today, Johnson is considering whether to close pubs and restaurants in cities in the north of England. Cole says: Pubs and restaurants face closure in Liverpool, Manchester and Newcastle, with Chancellor Rishi Sunak scrambling to put together a local bailout package for businesses facing ruin. Some shops could also be forced to shut, but workplaces and schools would remain open. Mr Johnson’s message came after Downing Street was hit with a “white-faced briefing” from senior medics about soaring virus numbers in the north-west and north-east. And, according to the Daily Telegraph (paywall), a cabinet row is holding up the announcement of a new, three-tier lockdown matrix to simplify the rules. It reports: A “traffic light” system of different levels of restrictions was due to be announced on Wednesday – but an intervention by Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is threatening to delay the plans ... Mr Sunak is understood to be insisting that decisions about which towns should be put in the “red” zone of the “traffic light” system should be made by a new committee of himself, Mr Johnson and Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. That would exclude the Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove from the decision-making process, meaning the chancellor – a “hawk” who wants to protect the economy – would not be outnumbered by Mr Gove and Mr Hancock, “doves” who want stricter lockdown measures. Ministers have also failed to agree on how harsh the strictest of the three “traffic light” lockdown tiers should be. The closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential retailers in those areas are still on the table, along with a ban on households mixing. In an interesting column for the Herald in Scotland, Iain Macwhirter says that Nicola Sturgeon is likely to announce what will amount to a “lockdown lite” today - and that policy in England is not that different. He has tweeted a link. And here’s an extract. The message of yesterday might be that for all the recent unpleasantness and four-nation rivalry, the UK may be coming together again in its approach to pandemic management. We are all Swedish now – sort of. Indeed, with today’s lockdown lite we may be seeing a tacit admission that the original lockdown was a mistake. It didn’t suppress the disease, just delayed it, increasing non-Covid deaths while serving to wreck the economy in the process. Truth be told, the policies, and mistakes, north and south of the Border have never been very different. Even at the height of lockdown, Scottish exceptionalism existed mainly on the fringes of pandemic policy. Though Ms Sturgeon will no doubt find new ways of accusing the PM, as she did before, of “putting peoples lives at risk” by not locking down hard enough. Or of neglecting Scotland’s unique circumstances. As first minister of Scotland she has the luxury of opposition even while being in government. She can and will blame Mr Johnson for not meeting the cost of extended furlough, which promises to be the next big argument. The Conservatives spent more than £16m on the 2019 general election campaign, it has emerged. As PA Media reports, the Electoral Commission has published figures showing the party spent £16,486,871 across the country in order to gain its 80-seat Commons majority in December 2019. The biggest chunk of the money, £5,818,998 went on “unsolicited material to electors”, the commission said. Marketing and canvassing cost £4,471,937, and advertising came in at £3,011,665. Rallies and other such events saw £529,650 spent on them. Figures for the Labour party have yet to be published as its financial submissions to the commission were late due to the coronavirus outbreak. The report shows that the cost of the SNP campaign was £1,004,952. Plaid Cymru spent £183,914 in the December election, and the Independent Group for Change paid out £29,556. It was a good morning for Sage participants on the Today programme. As well as Prof Stephen Reicher, the programme interviewed Prof Calum Semple, professor of child health at the University of Liverpool and another academic who advises the UK government by participating in meetings of Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. Semple said the government should consider giving up testing primary school children for coronavirus because the risk of them spreading the virus was relatively low. He said: We’re quite confident now that primary school children are probably a quarter to half as likely to become infected and are also much less likely to pass the infection on. So there’s growing evidence that primary school children are not amplifying this disease. Then, in secondary school children, again it’s less than adults, but it’s a gradient of effects such that sixth-formers are probably about the same risk as adults, but that data is slightly less stable ... If it’s shown that [the risk of children spreading the virus is] less than the adults, and if the children themselves are at a low risk of harm, the question has to be should we be making greater efforts to keep children in education, either through improved testing or potentially, with the primary school children, taking them out of testing altogether. Semple also suggested that children could be excluded from the rule of six that applies in England, as they are in Scotland and Wales. He said excluding children was “something that many scientists and public health doctors are considering”. Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool, told ITV’s Good Morning Britain today that the compulsory 10pm closing time for pubs was having “the wrong effect” and that it should be up to local leaders to decide what was best for their areas. He told the programme: We’re seeing 2,500 new cases in the last week in Liverpool and yet we’re seeing restrictions that were imposed on Manchester and Newcastle not working and the increasing infection rate going up. It’s about common sense, it’s about getting the balance right and about what we can do, what we should do and how local lockdowns work, working with local leaders to get it right. There’s a lack of consistency, a lack of clarity, but most of all a lack of communication and collaboration. Anderson is one of four Labour city leaders from the north of England who have signed a letter to Matt Hancock, the health secretary, saying the current restrictions are not working. They have proposed a five-point plan to make them work better, involving local authorities getting more control, test and trace being localised, more compensation for businesses, better support for people who need to self-isolate and more effective monitoring. The letter has also been signed by Sir Richard Leese, the leader of Manchester city council, Judith Blake, the leader of Leeds city council and Nick Forbes, the leader of Newcastle city council. Their five-point plan mostly overlaps with a similar one proposed by Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor for Greater Manchester, at the weekend. Supplies of some vital medical testing equipment, including material used for Covid tests, are at risk because of a supply chain problem affecting the pharmaceutical company Roche, it has emerged. There are more details here. Liz Truss, the international trade secretary, who has been giving interviews on behalf of the government this morning, said people should continue to request coronavirus tests when they need them. She told Sky News: There is an issue with the supply chain. Roche are working with the NHS, the health secretary is fully aware. I would encourage people to continue going through the testing process - that process is still working. Roche are pushing very hard to resolve that issue... as soon as possible. In his Today interview (see 9.27am) Prof Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and an adviser to the Scottish and UK governments, said there was no point imposing tighter restrictions now unless you used that time to change the way coronavirus is being handled. He said three changes were critical. Increase testing, that’s number one. Improve the regulation regime, that’s number two, And number three, support people, so they can do whatever you ask of them, like self-isolation. Good morning. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, will make a statement to the Scottish parliament later announcing a new set of coronavirus restrictions. Scotland’s laws are already tighter than England’s but case numbers in Scotland are rising alarmingly, as they are across the UK as a whole, and Sturgeon said yesterday: “The government is receiving very strong public health advice that action over and above the current restrictions is necessary.” We got a good insight into what that advice sounds like this morning from Prof Stephen Reicher, professor of social psychology at the University of St Andrews and an adviser to the Scottish government on Covid, as well as a contributor to Sage, the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. Reicher said that without action now, a March-style lockdown would be needed by the end of the month. He told the Today programme: I do think it’s important to do something because if you look at the figures at the moment, the level of infections is about 10% of what it was at the peak in March, but, at the rate of doubling, it would probably be at the same as the peak in March by the end of October. So the good news is we have a window of opportunity to do something. If we squander that window of opportunity, then we really are in trouble, then we really would be talking about going back to March in terms of lockdown measures. But we’re not talking about that now. We’ve got time. My colleague Libby Brooks has sent me this ahead of this afternoon’s announcement. The first minister’s rather unusual pre-announcement yesterday of “the things we will not do” has done nothing to dampen speculation or anxieties. Nicola Sturgeon assured the public at her daily briefing yesterday that the country will not be returning to full lockdown this month, but left the door open for localised restrictions - likely across the central belt where the virus is accelerating fastest - that could well include a travel ban and closure of pubs and restaurants. Remember that restrictions in Scotland are already tougher than elsewhere in the UK: last month Scots were banned from visiting other homes, with strict limits also in force for outdoor meetings and a 10pm curfew for pubs and restaurants. The Federation of Small Businesses warned that more than a week of uncertainty about details of the new restrictions - with ministers and public health officials floating the idea of a “circuit breaker” lockdown - had caused emotional strain for employers and staff, while the Scottish Licensed Trade Association predicted that Scotland could lose about a third of its pubs and about 25% of staff if another shut-down was ordered. Meanwhile, the virus is back in Scottish care homes, with two deaths and 80 staff and residents testing positive following a significant outbreak in two homes in Lothian. And these are from the BBC’s Glenn Campbell,. Here is the agenda for the day. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.15pm: The Welsh government holds its coronavirus briefing. 1.30pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. 2.30pm: Richard Hughes, the new chair of the Office for Budget Responsibility, and other economists give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about tax policy after coronavirus. After 2.50pm: Nicola Sturgeon gives a statement to the Scottish parliament about new coronavirus restrictions. Afternoon: MPs debate the regulations imposing the latest restrictions in the north of England. 5pm: Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and David Frost, the UK’s chief EU negotiator, give evidence to the Commons Brexit committee. Politics Live has been doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog for some time and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, and where they seem more important and interesting, they will take precedence. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow."

          "headline": "The Haunting of Bly Manor: schlocky yet genuinely chilling horror",
          "bodyText": "I always wonder how I’d fare as the au pair to two eerie, orphaned children. Watch enough horror and you assume you are doomed to become the au pair to two eerie, orphaned children, because everyone seems to take a turn at it at some point. Here are your orphans, locked in their ancient mansion, humming an odd, high-pitched tune, gazing over your shoulder, thumping their little orphan hands on their little orphan table. There is always a toy you swear you put back – but there it is again, right in the middle of the carpet. When it’s my turn to be the au pair to two eerie, orphaned children, will I have any patience for their spooky ways, or will I lose my temper constantly with their gothic bullshit? “Flora, why do you keep staring out into that lake, mate? Miles, can you stop sharply changing the features of your face, yeah? And if I find any more ominous twine-wrapped dolls that look a little bit like me, I’m throwing them in the lake. Play with the iPad like some normal children.” Anyway, it’s The Haunting of Bly Manor (Friday, Netflix) this week, and you know how this goes: the au pair is Dani (Victoria Pedretti from You), a US transplant to the English countryside with a secret to hide; the eerie children are named Miles and Flora; the whole thing is a reimagining of The Turn of the Screw, and a spiritual successor to the better-than-you-thought-it’d-be series The Haunting of Hill House. Actors return to play different roles. There are dodgy accents. The house creaks. A flash in the mirror. A stolen glance. Horror. My main issue with Netflix is that so many of its original series have such an inescapable feeling of schlockiness, you have to assume it is a directive right from the very top. You might have experienced it earlier this year with Ryan Murphy’s terrible Hollywood, but it is present in all of the platform’s big hitters: You is a tense thriller scripted like an Australian soap; the now-cancelled Daredevil was a bunch of movie-grade fight scenes glued together with some appalling best-friends-do-banter; the less said about House of Cards, obviously, the better. I cite these examples because, even though their dialogue seemed written by a robot that had just been taught how to telegraph an important theme, I still watched every single minute of them, so maybe I am wrong and whatever algorithm that tells them to dial up the cheesiness is right. That is not to say Bly Manor is cheesy, but it does have that undeniable “Netflix” feel to it; something you realise the first time an eerie orphan boy goes: “By jove, how simply capital!” In fairness, what unfolded from there made me slightly afraid to walk around my kitchen at night without the lights on: suspenseful, elegant, genuinely chilling horror that doesn’t need to lean on the crutch of a jump scare. And then there’s that toy again. “Flora, I swear I told you to …” – but she was just here a minute ago. Hold on, how can she be out on the lawn already? She’ll catch her death in those pyjamas. Oh no, it’s the exact night that, one year ago, the former au pair died here! You know what? Not my problem. If she wants to mess around in the garden humming songs again, she can do it on her own. I’m driving into town and getting a pint."

          "headline": "Jenrick calls for UK 'togetherness' as PM admits public fury over Covid",
          "bodyText": "Britain must return to a spirit of “national togetherness” and grassroots volunteering, the communities secretary has said, as Boris Johnson admitted the public was furious at the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Amid growing frustration and confusion over local lockdowns and a widening north-south divide, Robert Jenrick said energising community help for the most vulnerable during the second wave of coronavirus was a matter of “the greatest concern”. Jenrick said ministers would do more to help homeless and lonely people, a well as domestic abuse victims, but he put the onus back on communities to revive the support shown to isolated people six months ago. In an interview with the Guardian, the cabinet minister also said the economic crisis kept him awake at night and he feared the financial fallout would affect a generation. Tacitly acknowledging national division and fatigue, Jenrick said communities must have the same level of focus as on the brink of the toughest restrictions in March and April, when thousands of mutual-aid groups rendered the centralised volunteer programme virtually obsolete. He also: Told rebellious shire Conservatives furious at planning reforms that the party has a moral mission to build homes and signalled that he was prepared to face down his party critics. Signalled more Treasury aid for trapped leaseholders of buildings with unsafe cladding. Denied there was a communication breakdown with local leaders, even though some have complained of a five-minute warning of the detail of new Covid-19 curbs. Jenrick also used the interview to announce an extra £6m to help survivors of domestic abuse. The funding is intended for accommodation and support services to help councils fulfil new obligations under the domestic abuse bill, which is due to come into force next April. He spoke about visiting a shelter in his constituency in Newark, saying he would never forget meeting a woman who “had no front teeth whatsoever; she just escaped from an abusive relationship in another city, and had been directed to the refuge in Newark, knowing nobody at all in the local area”. He said it was clear that provision needed to be stepped up during the lockdown. Though there had been a rise in domestic abuse cases since the pandemic it had not been not as steep as predicted, prompting fears people were not coming forward for fear of exposing themselves to the virus or of breaking restrictions, he said. “Nobody should feel trapped in an abusive relationship for fear of breaching the rules or fear that there won’t be sufficient good quality, safe accommodation and support for them and their children available,” he said. “One of the areas that gives me greatest concern is how we can help the most vulnerable people now. If you go back to the beginning of the pandemic, there was a huge sense of national togetherness.” Government initiatives such as the NHS volunteer programme had proven unnecessary because “there was just so much organic desire to support people”, he said. Research points to growing resentment fuelled by rule-breakers such as the prime minister’s chief aide, Dominic Cummings. Jenrick himself drove 40 miles to visit his parents during the initial lockdown period, but defended his action saying he was giving them vital support. Speaking separately on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show, Johnson admitted the public were “furious at me and they’re furious with the government” over local coronavirus measures, but said: “This is the only way to do it.” He said people should “behave fearlessly but with common sense” and carry on with their lives as much as possible while obeying the rules. Jenrick acknowledged much would be different in a second wave. “I think this time around, this autumn and winter, we need to try to recapture that,” he said. “And to help people to come together, once again, and to have the same level of focus on the most vulnerable groups, lonely people and domestic abuse victims, those sleeping rough on the streets. “It’s hard to sustain anything for a long period of time, and we need to make sure that everybody understands the seriousness of the situation now, and that we in government redouble our efforts to support those groups in particular.” In a cabinet divided between those who want to further open the economy and those who fear it would unleash another devastating death toll, Jenrick refused to define himself as a “health hawk” or “fiscal dove”, but said his brief often pulled him in different directions. “By nature, I’m a Conservative who wants to allow people to live their own lives how they want to,” he said. Asked if the scale of the economic crisis facing the nation kept him awake at night, he said: “It does. I think the autumn and the winter are going to be very challenging periods. “I think the long-term scarring effects of unemployment upon society are huge and very long-lasting. Every small business that goes bust, or every individual who ends up unemployed, that can have a profound impact on them and their children.” Jenrick’s department is spearheading a radical new planning agenda which has drawn criticism from housing charities and Tory MPs alike. In Conservative-controlled rural and suburban areas, the requirement for new-builds increases substantially under an algorithm used to determine the number of new homes required. In Tory areas such as Chichester in West Sussex, the annual target would rise from 425 to 1,120 and in Reigate, Surrey, from 460 to 1,091. “If we’re going to address the very severe affordability issues being faced by young people in particular … that does mean significantly increasing the number of homes that we’re building as a country,” he said. “And that will mean all parts of the country. I do think this has to be viewed as part of the moral mission of the Conservative party, and our best chance of success in the long term.” Jenrick said he wanted to do more for leaseholders trapped in homes with unsafe cladding, facing huge costs and holding worthless, sometime un-mortgageable property. He suggested he would lobby the Treasury to help those in “an appalling situation”. Asked whether he thought contracting Covid-19 would change Donald Trump, Jenrick laughed and said: “I wouldn’t write him off.”"

          "headline": "Klarna: shopper's best friend or a fast track to debt?",
          "bodyText": "Even its harshest critics call Klarna a “genius” business model. The firm, which lets shoppers buy now and pay later, crucially without fees or interest, has grown fast in the UK – it has almost 10 million customers there and is opening 95,000 accounts a week. Interest among tech investors has reached fever pitch, with Klarna recently valued at $10.6bn (£7.8bn). It bills itself as offering a “healthier, simpler and smarter alternative to credit cards” and has 85 million customers globally, with an average age (in the UK) of 33. But is it luring its young customers into unsustainable debt, letting them buy more than they can afford? Or is it just an electronic version of the credit offered by old-style catalogue shopping? The retailer picks up the tab You can’t miss Klarna at the checkouts of scores of big online retailers. “Don’t wait until payday hon, Boohoo accepts Klarna,” says the fast-fashion retailer targeting young online shoppers. “Cop it now, pay in 30 days with Klarna,” JD Sports says. Asos, H&amp;M, Superdry, Pretty Little Thing, Schuh, New Look and hundreds of other retailers have also linked with the payments firm. In the UK, Klarna lets shoppers pay in either 30 days’ time, with a debit or credit card, or split the cost into three equal payments, the first taken immediately and the next two 30 and 60 days later. It boldly promises there is “always” no interest, no fees and no late payment charges. There is no complicated account sign-up, and no credit check appears on the shopper’s credit record. It has a separate service called “financing”, which it says is only a small part of its business that acts more like a traditional loan, charged at up to 18.9%, for which hard credit checks are made. The company makes its money by charging the retailer rather than the customer. Small retailers pay as much as 5.4% plus 20p for each sale, although big companies pay less. Buy now, pay later (if you can) If sellers are bearing the burden, should we really care about the way Klarna operates? For Martyn James of Resolver, a dispute resolution service that has received a number of complaints about Klarna, the main concern is that it encourages overspending. “Its business is to say ‘come on, spend, buy it now, go for it’. It’s not really that far removed from payday lending.” Klarna allows shoppers to order multiple items at once, safe in the knowledge that their card won’t be debited with the full amount immediately. It means they can order the same item in several different sizes, returning the ones that don’t fit, and pay any outstanding money later for those they keep. “They are now monetising the simple act of trying on something to see if it fits,” James says. He worries that retailers are enabling customers to order multiple items in expectation that some won’t return them in the 14- or 28-day window – and are then stuck with the bill. There is also a risk that delays in returning goods mean extra payments are taken. The debt charity StepChange says it has an increasing number of clients who have money owing on “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) among their debts when they turn to it for help. Klarna is easily the largest BNPL player in the UK market, although there are others, including Clearpay, used by Marks &amp; Spencer. “BNPL services paint themselves as simply the new convenient way to pay for goods you want. But along with convenience there’s a more worrying aspect: by encouraging you to defer the reality of paying precisely at the moment you are focused on the goods you wish to buy, there’s a risk that when the time to pay does come, it might not be affordable,” says Sue Anderson of StepChange. Will shoppers be able to repay? Klarna rejects suggestions it is encouraging reckless spending, pointing to its low rates of missed payments. “The ultimate test of our ability to ensure that consumers are only buying what they can afford is our default rates,” it says. “Fewer than 1% default on a payment with us and that number has stayed constant throughout the lockdown period. The fact that this number is so low, and without the threat of late fees or interest accumulating, suggest to us that the vast majority of consumers are using our service to better manage their shopping within their means.” But it is in the sights of financial regulators. The Financial Conduct Authority is examining Klarna and other BNPL operators as part of an inquiry into the unsecured credit market that began in September. One worry voiced by some bankers is Klarna’s boast that it does not perform credit checks, and even if the shopper fails to pay, it won’t show up on their credit record. In that case, they ask, how can other financial providers of loans and credit properly check a new applicant’s ability to repay? What if the algorithm says ‘no’? A report by the financial advice site Money.co.uk, “Shop now, stress later”, suggests that 18- to 24-year-olds on BNPL schemes such as Klarna, Clearpay, Zilch and Laybuy owe about £225 each. It analysed 10 fast-fashion brands based on how many times “buy now, pay later” is mentioned during the shopping process, with Nasty Gal, Boohoo and Pretty Little Thing “the worst offenders when it comes to promoting them”. Money.co.uk said: “BNPL is encouraging young consumers to spend more than they can afford. These stores are all fostering a smash-and-grab mentality among young shoppers today.” So what happens if you buy on Klarna but fail to pay? The company says: “As a last resort, Klarna will refer unpaid debts to a debt collection agency.” But some customers who contacted Resolver said they were chased by an agency relatively soon after failing to pay, even as they were disputing a returned item. What may surprise some shoppers is that even if they do fall behind on payments to the extent that they are referred, the unpaid debts won’t register on their credit record. Klarna says it works with “specially selected debt collection agencies that do not impact a consumer’s credit score … Ultimately, Klarna assumes 100% of the risk of non-payment.” According to the Financial Times, some analysts worry about Klarna’s rising credit losses – which almost doubled in the first half of 2020 compared with a year earlier, leading to a nine-fold increase in operating losses. Klarna says it assesses a shopper each time they make a purchase. “The affordability check conducted by your credit card provider to determine your credit limit may have been performed many years ago. At Klarna we are performing a check every time you make a purchase.” This can be frustrating for some customers who are accepted one month and may find they are rejected the next. They will never find out why, as the algorithm that determines acceptance is never revealed. We asked Klarna what goes into its algorithm. “We conduct a soft credit check. Alongside this, we review multiple data points which are combined to create an internal ‘score’ which we use to determine the creditworthiness.” It did not elaborate on the multiple data points used but it is understood they range from your home address to your IP address and the data that reveals about you. On Trustpilot, Klarna generally scores well – apart from a recent bust-up over pre-orders for the new Xbox All Access – and being rebuffed is about the most common complaint. This was one recent posting: “Klarna have blacklisted me. I pay on time, have a good credit score, nothing outstanding. I get the same reply each time. It’s worked out by an algorithm. They can’t tell me why.” Klarna responded: “We cannot provide specific reasons to why a consumer’s order has been denied. Each purchase decision is made by an automated algorithm.”"

          "headline": "Nurses barred from NHS 111 Covid clinical division after 60% of calls unsafe",
          "bodyText": "The NHS 111 service has permanently stopped nurses and other healthcare professionals in a clinical division handling calls with people suspected of having Covid-19 after an audit of recorded calls found more than 60% were not safe. The audit was triggered in July after many of the medical professionals recruited to work in that clinical division of the 111 service sounded the alarm, saying they did not feel “properly skilled and competent” to fulfil such a critical role. An investigation was launched into several individual cases after the initial review found that assurances could not be given “in regard to the safety of these calls”, according to an email, seen by the Guardian, from the clinical assurance director of the National Covid-19 Pandemic Response Service. In a further email on 14 August, she told staff that after listening to a “significant number” of calls “so far over 60% … have not passed the criteria demonstrating a safe call”. A number of “clinical incidents” were being investigated, she said, because some calls “may have resulted in harm”. One case had been “escalated as a serious untoward incident with potential harm to the patient”. NHS England declined to answer questions about any aspect of these apparent safety failings, saying it was the responsibility of the South Central ambulance service (SCAS), which set up a section of NHS 111 called the Covid-19 Clinical Assessment Service (CCAS). CCAS staff are responsible for calling people whose potential Covid-19 symptoms are identified by 111 as serious enough to need a discussion with a clinician. The SCAS declined to say how many calls had been audited and found not to be safe or provide information about the outcome of the investigations into possible harm to patients. It said that nurses and allied healthcare professionals (AHPs), who included paramedics and physiotherapists, had initially made up only 4% of the CCAS workforce, and that it was now staffed by more than 1,600 GPs and medical staff. One AHP who signed up to the CCAS told the Guardian the clinical calls involved making critical decisions about whether a person was in a life-threatening condition and needed immediate emergency care. Their training and experience had never involved emergency care, they said, adding they did not feel qualified for the role and were “horrified” by the outcome of the call audit. NHS England said nurses and AHPs continue to take Covid-related calls within “local 111/CAS [Clinical Assessment Service] providers. It is only nurses and AHPs working within the CCAS that have been suspended from taking calls.” NHS England added that the issue regarding the safety of calls was “identified through existing governance processes which include a call audit programme”. The apparent failures by the clinical division of NHS 111 are likely to reinforce calls from families whose relatives died from Covid 19 for an immediate public inquiry into the performance of the 111 service. At the height of the pandemic the government instructed the public to call 111, rather than contact their GPs or attend hospitals, as a strategy to prevent doctors and A&amp;E departments being overwhelmed. Nearly 6,000 people were rapidly recruited to be call handlers for a dedicated operation within 111, the Coronavirus Response Service (CRS). Mostly the CRS was staffed and operated by private corporations contracted by the SCAS on behalf of the NHS. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group says hundreds of its members’ relatives called 111, as instructed, when they were critically ill, but were given inadequate advice, with some being told to stay at home and take paracetamol and then dying shortly afterwards. NHS England and the SCAS both told the Guardian in statements that call handlers for the CRS were “carefully selected, screened and trained”. However, the Guardian has interviewed three people who worked for 111 at different sites across England and say they were given the job after a relatively brief conversation with a recruitment agent and negligible training. Two worked for the French corporation Teleperformance at call centres in Gateshead and Ashby, and the other for the French-US call centre giant Sitel at a site in Newcastle. The two employees who worked for Teleperformance said they had only an induction session on their first morning, which was mostly about the company they were working for and the building, and involved minimal training in Covid-19 symptoms or handling calls from the public. The handler in Ashby said when he began work he did not even know how to operate the phone system. In normal times NHS 111 call handlers have a minimum of six weeks’ full-time training, including classroom-based learning and call centre coaching, according to a job description seen by the Guardian. The NHS said the classroom training in fact lasts just two weeks before handlers “start to take live calls under supervision”. The job description sets out 33 main duties and responsibilities, including operating the NHS Pathways computer system that triages people according to clinical needs, and talking confidently to distressed, sometimes abusive patients in “safeguarding or life-threatening situations under pressure”. This level of training and clinical governance was not required for new recruits to the 111 service during the pandemic. The Teleperformance employee in Gateshead said that on the same floor that 111 calls were being handled the company was handling calls for the clothing company Asos. They said they were told to follow a flowchart in a Word document that explained how to handle 111 calls. It asked for people’s symptoms and led to an outcome, they said, adding it usually concluded that they should stay at home if they had symptoms unless they were acutely short of breath. Sitel did not respond to questions from the Guardian. A Teleperformance spokesman said its service involved call handlers giving “standard information based on NHS scripts”, and that all employees “were provided with a training programme designed according to NHS guidelines”. “It is a joke to say we had a training programme,” the Teleperformance employee in Gateshead said. “I didn’t even have time to read the flowchart before I started taking calls. The first call I had, the person was in distress. The flowchart led to advice that he should stay at home and rest. It was horrendous; there were a lot of young people taken on, some weren’t taking it seriously. It breaks my heart to read about these families whose loved ones died after calling 111.” The SCAS said CRS call handlers used an algorithm based on the NHS Pathways system. “The algorithm the call handlers used was updated with approved changes in line with Public Health England advice, as we learnt more about the virus and its symptoms.” The algorithms now were “more robust as a result of the learning in wave 1 of the pandemic”, the SCAS explained. In a statement, NHS England said: “Since the start of the pandemic, NHS 111 has provided urgent care to millions of people and all call handlers get appropriate training and can refer patients to a doctor or other medical staff if they need additional help.” Jo Goodman, the co-founder of the bereaved families group, said: “The revelations about the NHS 111 service are really shocking and upsetting for anyone who has lost a loved one to the pandemic. The more we hear, the clearer it becomes that those taking calls from individuals in life-or-death situations were terrifyingly ill-prepared for that crucial role. As cases are rising, we have to ask whether any lessons have been learned to ensure that this doesn’t happen again.” The Labour MP Kate Osamor, a campaigner for reform of the 111 service even before the pandemic, said there had been “a major failure of governance”, and called for a full, independent public inquiry. • This article was amended on 1 October 2020 to add further details provided by the NHS after publication, including about the audit, the call handlers who were affected, and their period of training."

          "headline": "Is it too late to halt football’s final descent into a dystopian digital circus?",
          "bodyText": "Gradually, then suddenly. This is how history tends to work, a process in which most of the time things don’t happen, or almost happen, or seem like they probably won’t happen – right up until the moment they suddenly do. Football has always seemed like an industry in search of its final form. The last 25 years have brought such fevered textural change it has been tempting to marvel at the clanking pistons, the gusts of steam, the unceasing revolutions. And yet it seems increasingly likely this was the gradual part. Welcome to football in 2020, an industry that might just have reached its tipping point, ready for the descent into sudden, radical, dystopian change. And it’s live! There is no doubt the current global crisis has also presented a wonderful opportunity for those in positions of power, whose plans might otherwise have met resistance. At Fifa’s most recent congress Gianni Infantino – who seems to have spent the last eight months trying very hard to maintain an expression of grave concern while secretly longing to boast at length about his brand new jetpack – spoke about reimagining the football calendar completely, moving every single competition to its own distinct time period, before getting a little bored of that and talking instead about some other vision of dictatorial inanity. Nobody really seemed to mind, or to have the mental bandwidth to raise any concerns. Yep, Gianni. You go ahead. Now if you’ll excuse me the world is on fire and my hang-glider appears to be crashing into a lake of boiling oil. This is the most urgent note of concern right now. If the last quarter-century has been notable for the pace of change, it has also been defined by resistance, by the squealing of brakes, by things that haven’t happened. Football has been defined by its own ritual obsessions, by lines that cannot be crossed, by the sense of itself as something noble and protected. Well, right now the shields are down. Ground is being conceded, structural change whisked through. How much of this will we get back? In the past resistance has tended to focus on two main areas. First, the primacy of supporters, the idea the game exists in its most authentic form as an immediate emotional experience, that football without fans is nothing. Well … you say that. In reality this notion has simply evaporated, flushed out into the light by economic necessity. The general public can go to Selfridges or the local Wetherspoon or Manchester airport but not to a football match – and there is no lack of logic in this. It turns out that real life fans, while important, just aren’t central enough to football’s business model. Not at the top end anyway, where the real money and power is located. The secret is out. We, the owners of football, appreciate your presence. But we do not require it. This is a transformative moment, not just tonally but practically. As the Premier League runs to catch up with itself, terrified of reneging on those broadcast contracts, its output has morphed into an interchangeable entertainment product. Last weekend it was possible to watch live Premier League football from midday to 10pm, all of it basically the same homogenised, unceasing, geographically nonspecific substance. Is this sustainable? After Bayern Munich’s Super Cup final victory, Robert Lewandowski let slip that the players didn’t celebrate because they were “all too exhausted”. Eric Dier appears to be playing football on your TV screen more or less constantly. Brave new world that has such indomitable one-paced utility defenders in it. But this is a product being stretched thin, the glorious shared obsession recast as moving shapes on a screen cheered on by an algorithm, a digital circus on endless repeat while outside the world burns. At the same time ground is being conceded. Late-night kick-off times, for example: will broadcasters give way on this when actual humans are allowed, grudgingly, to provide their own crowd noises? Never mind all those fan-run issues and campaigns, from twenty-is-plenty to the idea of community engagement, of access for everyone, of the vital importance of the bond between club and supporters. All of this has simply come to a stop. Will it still be there on the other side? Meanwhile, left alone in the ground, television has taken total control of the staging. Television stops and rewinds the play. Television countermands the referee. Television even decides now how players will stand and run and collide with one another. The transition to a remote spectacle feels complete, to the extent it is perhaps easier simply to abandon the real life experience and watch it all on TV, where a quarter of the action happens in any case, and where it is at least possible to understand the end result. So profound is the direction of travel it is tempting to wonder if this will become a more lasting change. Following a football team is an act of faith, loyalty and great expense. How many will come back? How strong is that bond? Nothing lasts for ever. Things fall apart. In the shadow of all this women’s football, a growth industry but not profitable enough right now, continues to fight for air. Even the international game looks as if it may start to run up against the cold, hard economic dictatorship of elite club football. This is the second element under threat. It is no secret that clubs in the lower leagues are skirting close to collapse. At the same time it has become a truism to state that elite football will not survive without the grand old Victorian pyramid, and that the cavalry must, of necessity, come to the rescue. In reality the top clubs have no interest in this process. Where does your best version of the immediate future lie? With Sunderland, Gillingham and those cobwebbed ancestral bonds? Or with SoftBank, Saudi, venture capitalism and the new leisure economy overclass? The European Club Association has predicted €4bn losses this season in the top-tier leagues. In a world where the bottom line is the only line, this is the real driver of change ahead. Arsène Wenger has long maintained a borderless “super league” is inevitable because it is what those in power want. Nobody really knows what form this might take. But should it happen change is likely to come at a greater pace, with attention diluted, and with a global economic catastrophe to blur the lines. It is of course tempting to zone out on all this, to become comfortingly enraged by the detail of the handball laws, by Manchester City’s transfer failings, by Manchester United’s travails under a manager who increasingly resembles a fond sad childhood toy found on a shelf in the attic. But this is happening right in front of us. If the world beyond sport has begun to feel like some horrendous category mistake, a collapse into powerlessness, 30 years of structural change compacted across six months of confusion, then football is as ever in the lead, running on ahead of the tideline. The real danger is that the new abnormal becomes the normal, that power will be grabbed, land occupied, flags planted. As ever, the only available path is resistance, in whatever form still remains."

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has declared that he would not hesitate to order further restrictions to tackle coronavirus if necessary. He made the comment at a sobering news conference where his two most senior scientific advisers stressed that the Covid figures were heading “in the wrong direction”. (See 6.17pm.) The UK government has caved in to demands that MPs be given a vote in parliament on any new UK-wide or England-wide coronavirus restrictions, after up to 100 Conservatives threatened a rebellion. The Merseyside economy may collapse and leave a legacy of poverty “for generations to come” without urgent financial support tied to new coronavirus restrictions, according to the region’s political leaders. Keir Starmer has accused the government of abandoning people with “viable” jobs by refusing proper support during continued lockdown restrictions, as the response to coronavirus again dominated prime minister’s questions. Deloitte, the consultancy giant hired by the government to help run the NHS test-and-trace programme, is involved in selling separate contact tracing services directly to local health officials in the UK. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. The government has this evening ruled out giving refunds to people holding railcards they have been unable to use – or granting a time extension – despite ongoing travel restrictions in place as a result of coronavirus. There are an estimated 5.1m railcards in circulation in the UK, typically triggering discounts of about a third on ticket prices, and valid for a year. But restrictions brought in to contain the coronavirus mean that train services have been cut and only essential journeys made by key workers, so it is unlikely many cards have been used. There are seven cards, including senior railcards for the 60-plus age group and a 16 – 25 card for younger travellers. A spokesperson for the Rail Delivery Group, which administers the scheme, said: After careful consideration, the government has confirmed to us that railcards will remain non-refundable and will not be extended. We understand that this decision may not be the news our customers had been hoping for. Refunding or extending railcards for over 5.1m customers would come at a significant cost to the taxpayer at a time when the focus must be on maintaining rail services to support the country’s recovery from the pandemic. The news will be a disappointment not only to railcard holders but also to the passenger group Transport Focus which had been calling for either an extension or a discount on renewal. Anthony Smith, chief executive of Transport Focus, said: Passengers bought railcards in good faith and will be disappointed by the decision not to extend them or offer a discount on renewal to make up for the period when we were encouraged not to travel. While the Government continues to provide high levels of support to make sure the day to day railway keeps operating, it seems a pity some slack could not be given on this issue to encourage people back to rail travel. The Rail Delivery Group has created an FAQ page here. Here are the main points from No 10 press conference. Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said the figures were “definitely heading in the wrong direction” in the fight against coronavirus. His phrase summed up the main message of a press conference intended to reinforce the need for the restrictions already in place and counter any public complacency. Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, presented eight slides showing the extent to which the virus is spreading. He said there was a “significant rise” in test positivity in the north-east and north-west of England, and Yorkshire and Humber. “This increase is accelerating quite rapidly in some of those areas,” he said. And he said hospitalisation was rising, particularly in hotspots, though the figures remain “in a much lower level than at the beginning of April”. Whitty summed up: We are pointing out that the direction of travel for both hospitals and intensive care is going in the wrong direction, particularly in these areas that have seen rapid increases in cases. And Vallance said: “Things are definitely heading in the wrong direction.” Whitty said the NHS could soon be under pressure if case numbers were not contained. Boris Johnson said he would not hesitate to order further measures if necessary. But he stressed that he hoped he would not have to. He said: I have to be clear, that if the evidence requires it, we will not hesitate to take further measures that would, I’m afraid, be more costly than the ones we have put into effect now. But if we put in the work together now, then we give ourselves the best possible chance of avoiding that outcome and avoiding further measures. Johnson and Whitty both said it was possible that the next wave of the epidemic might be more localised. Johnson said: We are seeing some very clear local peaks, just as there were local peaks in Italy and other countries. It’s too early to say, but it may be that this is a more localised phenomenon this time, in which case all the more reason for us to concentrate on these local solutions as well as these national solutions. And Whitty said: If you look around Europe during the first wave that happened here, the UK was actually an outlier in having an epidemic that was almost uniform in shape, although not absolutely in size, across the whole country. If you look at Italy and Spain, for example, [they had] significant epidemics, but highly concentrated. Now it is possible that in this next stage of the epidemic here we will have a pattern more like that, where it is more highly concentrated in certain areas, lower rates in the others. But it is far to early to say that. We have got a long winter ahead of us, and a lot could happen in that time. But later Johnson said he did not want people to get the wrong idea from this. Towards the end of the press conference he said: Listening to this, I realise there is a slight danger of people getting the wrong message from this, in the sense, yes of course it is more acute in these particular local areas, but it is vital to stress that this remains a national threat and a national challenge, and we all have to fight it together. Johnson said he would be providing regular press conferences to update people on the fight against coronavirus. While the press conference was taking place, MPs voted by 330 to 24 - a majority of 306 - to renew the powers in the Coronavirus Act. That’s it. The briefing is now over. I’ll post a summary soon. Johnson says he is worried people might be getting the wrong message. He says he wants to stress that coronavirus is a problem everywhere. Q: A recent survey showed that only 20% of people are self-isolating when asked to. Why is that? And are you saying the government’s plan is to come down hard on the north of England to spare London and the south? Johnson says the government just wants to bring the R number down by stamping on where cases are highest. If people are in any doubt, they should check the rules on the website. Vallance says it would be wrong to say this is just a problem in some areas. It is worse in some areas. But it is a problem everywhere. Self-isolation is vital, he says. If people circulate, they will give the virus to others. Vallance says more recent figures might suggest better compliance. The survey a few weeks ago referred to intent to self-isolate, he says. (But there are also studies, like this one, showing a very low proportion of people actually self-isolating when asked to.) Q: Do you accept many people are not wearing masks? Johnson says people should wear masks. Fines will be imposed on people who don’t. Vallance says case numbers are going up. Adherence to the rules is crucial, he says. Q: There were 71 deaths just before the full lockdown. There are 71 deaths now. What is the difference? Johnson says it is possible that there is a difference in the way the disease is expressing itself in the country. There are local peaks. It may be “more localised” this time. Whitty says Italy and Spain had significant epidemics that were highly concentrated. He says it is possible that this might be happening here. He says it may be “more localised” this time. As for the comparison with March, he says the doubling time at the moment is slower than in March, when it was three to four days. Initially they underestimated how quickly the virus was doubling then. But the small number of deaths now does not mean that we could get to larger numbers of death quite quickly. Vallance says things are heading in the wrong direction. There is no room for complacency. We need to reduce contacts in certain environments, in particular indoor spaces that are poorly ventilated. Q: What are the chances of more restrictions everywhere? Johnson says we know we can drive down the virus, because we did it before. He says a package of measures is in place, a combination of national rules and local ones. And there is tougher enforcement. He says he hopes that, if people follow the guidance as before, then we can get the spread down. He wants to do that while keeping the economy open and young people in education, he says. Success will be judged in the days and weeks ahead, he says. Q: Your presentation last week was controversial. Do you still think cases are doubling every week? Sir Patrick Vallance, the government’s chief scientific adviser, said he was trying to get across three messages in his presentation last week. He says he wanted to make the point that more cases could lead to more deaths, that case numbers were growing already, and that cases could double very quickly. He says cases are going up, and the number of deaths is rising. But he says it is much more likely that in April and March there were over 100,000 cases per day. So you cannot make a like for like comparison between the published figures then and the published figures now (which are higher). Q: How are enforcement agencies going to stop people travelling from lockdown areas to non-lockdown areas? Johnson says people should look at the rules on the website. But he does not want to go back to a national lockdown where people are told to stay at home, he says. Johnson is taking questions from members of the public. Q: What support is in place for young people? Johnson says there is a package of support. He thanks students for how they are behaving. He says the Kickstart programme will help young people into work. And he wants to help young people retrain, as he set out yesterday, he says. Whitty says his NHS colleagues wanted him to stress that the NHS is open for patients. Johnson underlines that point. Whitty is now showing an animation illustrating how coronavirus spread in the spring, how it went down over the summer, and how it is coming back. And Whitty says this slide shows hospital admission rates by region. The final slide shows admissions to intensive care. In some areas they are rising sharply, he says. But he says there is no danger of the NHS being overwhelmed. Whitty says this slide shows hospital admission rates. Whitty says this slide shows positivity rates for under-21s. Amongst the very young, rates are not rising. But amongst older people in this group, they are. Whitty says some people think there are just more cases because more people are testing positive. But this slide shows that is not the case, he says. It shows the positivity rate - the proportion of people testing positive. They are going up, he says. Whitty says his slide shows where new cases are. There is a particular increase amongst young people. And in some areas the increase is accelerating, he says. Whitty says the slide on the left shows the total rate of coronavirus. The dark the colour, the more there is. There is a particular concentration in the north and the Midlands. And he says the slide on the right shows the increase in the last seven days. The more orange there is, the greater the increase. It is increasing particularly in the north-west and north-east. Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, is speaking now. He is presenting slides. He starts with one showing what happened in the spring. This shows excess deaths. Johnson says 14m people have already downloaded the app. Johnson says some people think we should just give up the fight against coronavirus. But he does not think that is what the nation wants, he says. He says he will not allow the UK to be overwhelmed. Johnson says the only way to tackle the virus is for everyone to follow the rules. He thanks people for what they have done. And he promises to provide “regular updates” himself through these press conferences. Johnson says he would like to be able to say the new measures were already working. But yesterday we had the biggest daily rise in cases, and cases are over 7,000 today. He says in many ways the UK is better placed than it was in the spring. He says 32bn items of PPE have been ordered. A four-month stockpile will be in place. By December UK suppliers will provide 70% of it, compared to just 1% before the pandemic. Johnson says plans are being put in place to allow students home safely for Christmas. Boris Johnson is starting his press conference. He says new restrictions were introduced last week because the rise in case numbers implied more people were going to die. Sixty two students at Newcastle’s two universities have tested positive for Covid. Northumbria and Newcastle Universities said in a statement: As of Friday 25 September, we can confirm that we were aware of 62 Newcastle University and Northumbria University students who had tested positive for Covid-19. These students are now self-isolating. Their flatmates and any close contacts are also self-isolating for 14 days in line with government guidance and have been advised to contact NHS119 to book a test as soon as possible should symptoms appear. There were 705 new cases of Covid in Newcastle over the last seven days, up from 393 the week before. That gives the city an infection rate of 233 per 100,000 people, more than Bolton and far above the English average of 51. MPs are voting on the Coronavirus Act motion now. The debate was short - backbench speeches lasted just three minutes each - but it showed that the No 10 compromise has not satisfied all Conservatives. Sir Charles Walker said it was an “utter, utter disgrace” that MPs were getting just 90 minutes in total to debate such an important measure, and Sir Bernard Jenkin said the PM needed to take more notice of the views of his backbenchers. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, said: The emergency and the extensive powers in this legislation have naturally and rightly raised questions and concerns. The nature and the imposition of measures that significantly alter individual liberties deserve full and frank scrutiny, no matter the context. And it is in that regard that it is really quite unhelpful that we have only been given a 90 minute debate today. The government’s coronavirus dashboard has just been updated. Here are the key figures. The UK has recorded 7,108 new coronavirus cases. This is marginally lower than yesterday’s total (7,143), but it suggests the sharp increase in cases is being sustained. This is only the second time the daily case numbers been above 7,000, and this figure is higher than any recorded at the peak of the first wave in the spring. However, because there is far more testing taking place now than there was in March, April and May, these record case numbers do not mean that the prevalence of coronavirus in the community is comparable to what it was then. Other evidence suggests that overall case numbers are only smallish fraction of what they were in the spring. The UK has recorded 71 further deaths - almost double the daily figure for a week ago (37). It takes the headline total number of deaths to 42,143. But this figure is an underestimate because it only counts people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus. Overall more than 57,600 people have died from confirmed or suspected coronavirus in the UK. Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative 1922 Committee, is speaking in the Commons debate now. He welcomes what Matt Hancock said. He says the new approach will be in the interests of parliament and of government, and it should ensure people that important questions are addressed before new regulations are imposed. Mark Harper, a former Tory chief whip, intervenes. He says what Hancock described (see 3.45pm) is exactly what Brady asked for in his amendment (see 9.37am), with the one exception that the word “possible” has replaced Brady’s word “practicable”. Labour’s Chris Bryant asks Brady if he can explain what the new system actually involves. Brady says the government is talking about using commencement dates in regulations. Regulations would be introduced using the affirmative procedure (which is what happens now), but commencement dates for regulations would be set in the future, so the laws would only take effect after MPs have voted on them. Under the current system, MPs do approve regulations, but any vote can take place up to 40 days after they have already come into force. Scotland’s higher education minister, Richard Lochead, has told the Holyrood parliament that his government was “never advised to keep students at home” while insisting that young people “are in no way to blame” for the current spike in infections across Scotland’s campuses. Lochead insisted that bringing students back to campus – a move that has been sharply criticised by opposition parties, students bodies and some academics – was in line with scientific advice and that “there were no easy risk-free option”. He said that the Scottish government was advised that telling students to stay away from campuses would have “inflicted significant harm on them and the wider higher education sector in Scotland”. He also confirmed that 759 students had tested positive for Covid with “many more” self-isolating, adding that he expected to see more positive cases in the coming days. And he said that he wants students “to have the option to return home safely for Christmas”. He said: We are looking with the sector at the best approach, this includes public health measures, staggering term end dates, and transport considerations. We will work with the UK government to bring as much consistency across these island as possible. Here is another Labour MP describing Matt Hancock’s concession as worthless. The government’s centralised approach to decision-making on lockdown restrictions is “unsustainable” and must urgently change before “the most difficult winter we’ve ever known in this country”, Andy Burnham has said. The mayor of Greater Manchester said the government’s approach had been “too driven from rooms in Whitehall” with little regard to the impact of decisions on communities. Calling for local leaders to be more involved in the decision-making process, Burnham said at a press conference: Things feel unsustainable this week and it also feels like the last significant moment to change things before the winter. We’re now looking at probably the most difficult winter we’ve ever known in this country. It’s staring us in the face and we’re not where we need to be. I would say we’re nowhere near where we need to be in terms of our readiness to face that winter. Burnham said one of the key issues was a lack of extra financial support for areas where restrictions have been imposed and that there should be an urgent review of the 10pm curfew on nightlife, which is “causing major harm to a hospitality industry that is already teetering on a cliff edge”. He added: We can’t carry on in this way. We are ready to work with the government but we need to reset here. We can’t just have ad hoc conversations here and there with ministers. We need to be involved. Don’t do to us, work with us. I’m afraid that hasn’t happened so far. The whole approach has been too centralised, too driven from rooms within Whitehall without any recognition about what this means for people on the ground and how it affects our communities. Burnham said the government should never impose local restrictions without proper financial support for residents, businesses and councils in those areas. It was “utterly wrong” that Bolton’s hospitality industry had not been offered Treasury support, beyond a payment of up to £1,500 every three weeks, despite being forced to go takeaway-only three weeks ago. He added: “We’ve had the health crisis and that continues but now we’re going to see the economic crisis break as well as a health crisis simultaneously because the redundancies are going to start if things stay as they are.” In the Coronavirus Act debate the Labour MP Chris Bryant said he thought Matt Hancock’s concession was worth “nothing” because it had not been written down. Hancock replied by saying Bryant would be able to read it in Hansard. Hancock told MPs that one part of the Coronavirus Act was being dropped. The act allowed people to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act on the basis of the opinion of just one doctor, not two. It also allowed the time limits for these orders to be extended. Hancock said that, even when the act was passed, he was not convinced this part was necessary. Now it will be dropped, he said. He said the government would introduce secondary legislation to remove this provision in the bill. Here is the full quote from Matt Hancock on the new arrangements. He said: I ... propose that we change the approach to bringing in urgent measures. And I’m very grateful to all colleagues we’ve worked with to come forward with a proposal that will allow us to make decisions and implement them fast, but also ensure that they are scrutinised properly. Today I can confirm to the house that for significant national measures, with effect in the whole of England or UK-wide, we will consult parliament. Wherever possible we will hold votes before such regulations come into force. But, of course, responding to the virus means that the government must act with speed when required and we cannot hold up urgent regulations which are needed to control the virus and save lives. I am sure that no member of this house would want to limit the government’s ability to take emergency action in the national interest as we did in March and we will continue to involve the house in scrutinising our decisions in the way the prime minister set out last week with regular statements and debates and the ability for members to question the government’s scientific advisers more regularly, gain access to data about their constituencies and join daily calls with the paymaster general. Hancock said he hoped that these new arrangements would be seen as a new convention. Hancock is now addressing what the government will do ensure MPs get more say over emergency regulations. (This is the compromise deal brokered with Tory rebels.) He says he believes that legislation is improved by scrutiny from the Commons. He says that in future, for significant national measures affecting the whole of England or the whole of the UK, the government will consult MPs and give them a vote wherever possible before those measures come into force. But he says ministers must reserve the right to act quickly in emergencies. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is opening the debate. He says the government has needed the powers in the act and that it needs to be reviewed, even though not all the powers in the act are needed in future. MPs are now starting the Coronavirus Act debate. There is a provision in the act saying it has to be renewed by parliament after six months. MPs are now debating that provision. There is a simple motion asking MPs to agree “that the temporary provisions of the Coronavirus Act 2020 should not yet expire” and it is not amendable. That is why the Speaker has not allowed the amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady, or any of the other amendments. British football’s top 100 earners should consider donating a week’s wages to support community clubs across the country, MPs have heard. The sports minister Nigel Huddleston appeared to back the idea in the Commons earlier after it was floated by Labour’s Chris Evans. During an urgent question on government support for sport, Evans said: I wonder has the minister thought of more innovative ways of raising finance by creating some sort of community trust where we ask the top earning 100 footballers in this country - some are earning £350,000 a week, £500,000 a week - to just donate one week’s wages to a trust, which then can be distributed amongst struggling clubs to ensure communities can still enjoy their football. Huddleston replied: Both now and in the future, I encourage all stakeholders in sports to do the right thing and play their part, and he’s making some good points about voluntary donations as well as what we will be requiring and expecting from sport at various levels. Public Health Wales has recorded 388 more coronavirus cases and one further death. There have been 424 new cases of coronavirus confirmed in Northern Ireland in the last 24-hour reporting period, the Department of Health there has announced. A further coronavirus-linked death has been reported to the department, although it did not occur within the last day. Asked about the prospect of tighter coronavirus restrictions being imposed on Merseyside (see 2.18pm), Downing Street said that officials are “closely monitoring” the coronavirus rate in Merseyside and that the current rules are being kept “under constant review”. NHS England has recorded 43 further coronavirus hospital deaths. It says that the people who died were aged between 43 and 98 years old and that all except one had known underlying health conditions. The details are here. Failure to protect healthcare workers from Covid-19 has been described as “outrageous to the point of immorality” by a Nobel prize winner. Sir Paul Nurse, director of London’s Francis Crick Institute and a geneticist who won the Nobel prize for medicine, said the UK and other countries were “woefully unprepared” for the pandemic. As PA Media reports, in an interview in the latest Big Issue magazine Nurse said the government had not properly embraced how to deal with science and explain it to the public. There were simulations about what we do in a pandemic. We failed miserably in the tests and we failed miserably in reality. The fact that we couldn’t even protect our healthcare workers with equipment is outrageous to the point of immorality. We’re stumbling from one crisis to another in midst of chaos, frankly. In some respects, I have some sympathy to the government, because it’s a terrible thing for having to deal with, and I have sympathy with the scientists trying to advise them, but I don’t think we’ve handled it very well. My experience over 20 years when I have been involved [in government] is that the UK, generally, has done rather well in its interaction with science. I’m less impressed with the present government - because it’s populist it doesn’t like relying so much on evidence and experts because they have to justify an opinion against knowledgeable arguments. The National Education Union wants the government to back “Nightingale schools” with additional teachers and smaller class sizes, to help curb the spread of the Covid-19 virus in areas of high risk. The call comes as the NEU launched a new website to track Covid-19 outbreaks around each school, as part of a campaign to lobby the government for better access to tests for both staff and pupils. In a briefing before the union’s special conference on Saturday, Kevin Courtney, the NEU’s joint general secretary, said: We have got Nightingale courts to deal with the backlog in the courts. We think we need Nightingale classes too. Some people tell us this is over-ambitious but in Bolton and in Newcastle we are worried that they are going to move to a rota operation and we think that reducing class sizes in those areas is a better option. It will take real work but there are supply staff, there are [teachers] who qualified last summer who still don’t have jobs and this could be work they could sensibly do. Courtney said the Department for Education’s latest figures showed that more than 500 secondary schools in England were only partially open, and that there were reports of entire year classes and groups of pupils studying for GCSE and A-level or BTec qualifications being sent home to isolate. The union’s delegates will also consider a motion calling for changes to the exam and assessment system for 2021. It wants standardised tests in primary schools to be dropped, and for changes to GCSE and A-level exams to avoid a repeat of this year’s fiasco. One of Britain’s biggest cultural donors, Dame Vivien Duffield, has announced a £2.5m package to help safeguard the learning and community work of arts organisations during the pandemic. Her Clore Duffield Foundation has over two decades given £30m to fund Clore learning spaces at 66 cultural organisations, from Sage in Gateshead to Bristol Old Vic to the Royal Academy of Arts in London. They did remarkable work, she said, but lockdown closed them all and even though museums, galleries, theatres and concert halls were all gradually reopening, most of the learning centres remained closed. She went on: This donation is to help the institutions take the necessary precautions, and where possible start their learning programmes in person. It is of course also to help retain and support the learning teams which are in danger of being dispersed. The intention is to give a percentage of the original capital grant. Recipients of up to £1m will get 10% of the original grant and recipients of more than £1m will get 5%. So the British Museum which originally received £2.5m will get £125,000 and the Holburne Museum in Bath which originally got £145,000 will get £14,500. The Telegraph’s Christopher Hope has more on the deal struck between the government and Tory rebels over MPs getting votes on emergency legislation. The Commons order paper had the Coronavirus Act debate down to start after 7pm, but we’re told that it will now start soon after 3pm. MPs are debating the non-domestic rating bill first, but is has not attracted overwhelming interest and the speeches should all be over within the hour. New results from a clinical trial of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine have shown that the jab can induce a “robust” immune response against the virus, raising hopes it will provide at least some protection against Covid-19 infection. Scientists from the partnership gave the vaccine to 60 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 in April and May and found that two doses produced antibodies and T cells that should fight the virus. Antibodies take on the virus directly, while T cells destroy cells that the virus invades. The UK has pre-ordered 30m doses of the BioNTech vaccine which are due to be delivered this year and next, along with tens of millions of doses from other vaccine manufacturers, including Valneva in France, and AstraZeneca, which has partnered with Oxford University to trial its experimental vaccine. The BioNTech vaccine, known as BNT162b1, smuggles genetic material called mRNA into muscle tissue. There, the body uses the mRNA to make fragments of virus protein which the immune system then learns to hunt down the pathogen. The results need to be confirmed in a larger trial and in wider age groups to get a sense of how useful the vaccine might be. For now, it is unclear how older people with weaker immune systems will respond, and how long any protection may last. “As vaccine-induced immunity can wane over time, it is important to study persistence of potentially protective immune responses,” the scientists write in Nature. Coronavirus restrictions are expected to be imposed on Merseyside very soon. New cases are running at a rate of more than 200 per 100,000 people. Local mayors and council leaders have signed a joint statement saying they accept the need for further restrictions. But they also say that the region is “at breaking point” and that, if new rules are imposed, they need more money to help support local businesses and public services. They say: We are already at breaking point. With new restrictions – and who knows for how long they might be needed – our economy and public services may collapse. If we do not act now, we will see a legacy of unemployment and ill-health that will cost lives for generations to come. So, today, we are calling on the government to work with us. If government decide that new restrictions are required, they must also provide a comprehensive package of financial support for our economy and our public services. And to help us minimise the length of restrictions required, we must secure from the government an immediate uplift in testing capacity, that matches testing resources to the high level of cases in our region. We are fully committed to working in partnership with national government, but we need the right support and resource to help us at a regional level. And we need it now. The statement says Liverpool has already been hit particularly hard because its visitor economy is worth almost £5bn to the region and employs more than 50,000 people. Over the last six months local authorities on Merseyside, and the combined authority, has already lost more than £350m through extra costs and missing income, it says. The statement has been signed by Steve Rotheram, mayor of Liverpool city region; Joe Anderson, mayor of Liverpool; Rob Polhill, leader of Halton council; Graham Morgan, leader of Knowsley council; Ian Maher, leader of Sefton council; David Baines, leader of St Helens council; and Janette Williamson, leader of Wirral council. The government has signed its first independent fishing deal for 40 years after arriving at a post-Brexit agreement with Norway. It involves annual negotiations on share of catch, something the EU has rejected in Brexit trade talks. The Norwegian fisheries and seafood minister, Odd Emil Ingebrigtsen, described it as a “great day”. The environment secretary, George Eustice, said: “The agreement is testament to our commitment to acting as a cooperative independent coastal state, seeking to ensure a sustainable and a prosperous future for the whole of the UK fishing industry.” Rebel Conservative MPs hoping to force the government to give the House of Commons more power over sweeping coronavirus restrictions are set to agree a deal with party whips, after an amendment was thwarted by parliamentary procedure, my colleague Jessica Elgot reports. The Welsh education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said that allowing university students to return home for Christmas is a “priority” for her government. She said: We will leave no stone unturned, working with our universities and with our public health officials and with other governments in the United Kingdom, to give students the chance to get home for Christmas. That’s my priority. It’s my priority as the education minister and it’s my priority as a mum. Williams said that state school attendance across Wales was at 80%. She said the figure had been constant since the return to classrooms this month. Most schools have had no Covid cases. Only 22 have had three or more cases. There were seven deaths after a positive coronavirus test reported in Scotland since yesterday, the highest daily figure since June 17, and 640 new cases, Nicola Sturgeon said at her daily briefing, with 137 people being treated in hospital. The highest number of cases, 232, were in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, where hundreds of university students are self-isolating following significant clusters in halls of residence. She also confirmed that, as of 12 October, people on low incomes would be eligible to receive a new £500 grant if asked to self-isolate. She said that household restrictions remained the best way to contain the virus: the ban on household visiting, which initially came into force in west of Scotland before being extended nationwide, have blunted the rise but added that now university clusters are confusing the picture. From Bloomberg’s Kitty Donaldson At PMQs it is often assumed that the key task for the leader of the opposition is to “land a blow” or “deliver a knockout punch”. That can be important, and in an understated way Sir Keir Starmer does it well, but an equally vital skill is the ability to avoid, to dodge, and at that Starmer is even better. He must be driving them bonkers in No 10. Every attempt that Boris Johnson makes to lay down a dividing line, with Starmer on the wrong side of it, fails. In the past we’ve had ‘Starmer, the friend of IRA-loving Jeremy Corbyn’, which collapsed as soon as Starmer started talking about his record as DPP, and ‘Starmer, the Brussels-supporting remainer’. This fantasy got an outing last night on the CCHQ Twitter account, but Johnson did not try either of these lines of attack at PMQs, with the result that his overall performance was less erratic than some of his other ones in recent weeks. But only up to a point. Instead Johnson tried to depict Starmer today as someone opposed to the coronavirus restrictions - and, by implication, opposed to the whole national effort to fight the virus. One problem with this argument was that it was not clear whether Johnson was accusing the opposition of inconsistency (sometimes backing lockdown, sometimes not), or just accusing it of being hostile. But the main problem, of course, is that that charge just isn’t true, and Starmer established that quite clearly. (See 12.17pm.) That did not stop Johnson ploughing on at the end with a pre-scripted soundbite about Labour opportunism, but political messaging has to be at least half-true to be effective, and Johnson must have known he was peddling something inherently implausible. It was another underwhelming performance. But not quite as underwhelming as some of his others, and at one point he almost got the better of Starmer. It came when Starmer asked what was an obvious question in the light of yesterday: If the prime minister doesn’t understand the rules and his own council leaders are complaining about mixed messages, how does the prime minister expect the rest of the country to understand and follow the rules? Johnson replied: “Actually, I think that the people of this country do understand and overwhelmingly do follow the rules.” And this worked because, broadly, it is true. (One of the most extraordinary features of the coronavirus crisis has been how compliant people have been overall, despite the fact that there is little risk of people facing sanctions for not following the rules.) But then Johnson ruined it by saying people were doing what they were told “in spite of the efforts of [Starmer] continually to try to snipe from the sidelines”. This just amounts to criticising Starmer for doing his job, and Starmer’s healthy approval ratings suggest that, as a jibe, it doesn’t work. Starmer did deliver some clean hits too. Johnson did not have a decent answer to the question about lack of government support for businesses that just can’t operate now and his first two questions - why has just one area (Luton) come out of local lockdown, and what is the plan for the restrictions to be lifted everywhere else? - were excellent. Johnson was struggling to answer both. On Luton, he said that it was able to lift its local restrictions because “local people pulled together to suppress the virus”. That implied that millions of people in other parts of England facing similar rules were not doing likewise, quite a slur potentially, but Starmer chose not to pursue that. But he did not really need to. He won comfortably anyway. Here are some extracts from Sir Lindsay Hoyle’s statement at the start of PMQs. Hoyle accused the government of treating the Commons with “contempt” in relation to coronavirus restrictions. He said: The way in which the government has exercised its power to make secondary legislation during this crisis has been totally unsatisfactory. All too often important statutory instruments have been published a matter of hours before they come into force and some explanations as to why important measures have come into effect before they can be laid before this house has been unconvincing and shows a total disregard for the house ... As I hope my early comments show I have not taken this decision lightly. I am looking to the government to remedy a situation I regard as completely unsatisfactory. I am now looking to the government to rebuild the trust with this house and not treat it with the contempt that it has shown. He explained why he would not allow votes on amendments in the debate on the Coronavirus Act tonight. He said: When I became Speaker I made it clear that I would take decisions on matters relating to procedures guided by professional advice. I have concluded on the basis of advice that I received that any amendment to the motion before the house risks giving rise to uncertainty about the decision the house has taken. This then risks decisions that are rightly the responsibility of parliament ultimately being determined by the courts. From HuffPost’s Paul Waugh Jerome Mayhew (Con) asks about the A47 in Norfolk. But plans to upgrade it have just been postponed. Why? Johnson says the government is intensely ambitious for transport infrastructure. That project will be reconsidered, he says. The government is looking at projects from 2025 onwards. And that’s it. PMQs is over. Nav Mishra (Lab) asks if the ban one evictions will be reinstated to prevent a housing crisis this winter. Johnson says landlords have to give at least six months’ notice. So there won’t be evictions over Christmas, he says. And the government is embarking on a huge programme to build more homes. Neil Coyle (Lab) asks if councils will be funded for all the homeless people they helped. Johnson says the way homeless people were housed was one of the “consolations” of the crisis. The government will continue to do what it can, he says. Laurence Robertson (Con) asks if the A&amp;E unit will return to Cheltenham hospital. Johnson says he has been told this closure is only temporary. Mick Whitley (Lab) says the government has decided to write off 1m jobs as unviable. Why? Johnson says that is a misrepresentation of what the government is doing. It will continue to support jobs. But the most important thing is to get people into work. Darren Henry (Con) asks what the PM will do to support the Midlands engine. Johnson says he is happy to support this. Janet Daby (Lab) asks what the government will do to protect jobs in the hospitality sector. Why does the PM think these jobs are not worth saving? Johnson says the government is doing what it can to support every job in the country. But it cannot save every job. There is a lifetime skills guarantee to allow people to retrain, he says. David Simmonds (Con) asks what will be done to extend the Syrian refugee settlement scheme. Johnson says the UK can be proud of what has been done to resettle refugees. It will continue to meet its obligations to those fleeing persecution and war, he says. Debbie Abrahams (Lab) asks what the PM’s biggest Covid mistake has been. Johnson says he is grateful for the question. There will be plenty of time to go over the decisions made, for which he takes responsibility. He says the increase in cases in Bolton is worrying. He urges Abrahams to get Labour to support the government. Harriet Baldwin (Con) asks if the PM will change some of the elements of the algorithm used to allocate housing under the planning bill. Johnson says he wants to see more homes built, in a way that avoids desecrating the green belt. Tommy Sheppard (SNP) asks if the PM would regard a Conservative victory in the Scottish elections next year as a mandate for the union. Johnson says the Scots had a vote on this in 2014. That was a vote for a generation. We should stick with that, he says. Johnson says Tories are enthusiastic about the clean, green future. He is pleased this is being pioneered in the Tees Valley. Munira Wilson (Lib Dem) says the Coronavirus Act has weakened protections for the disabled. (This is why the Lib Dems are voting against. See 11.56am.) Johnson says the government will give the disabled the protection they need. Johnson says he totally supports the ambition of HS2. But he has been assured that communities affected are being consulted. Liz Saville Roberts, the Plaid Cymru leader at Westminster, asks if the PM will stop leisure travel from lockdown areas. Johnson says overall the UK is proceeding with the same approach. There are some differences, and some “seeming illogicalities”. That is inevitable. But he is grateful for the cooperation Saville Roberts is giving. (That did not address the question at all.) Ben Spencer (Con) says there has been less traffic noise during lockdown. What can be done to reduce noise and pollution from the M25? Johnson says the government wants to see more electric cars on the roads. Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, says just 15% of Scots trust the Westminster government to operate in Scotland’s interests. Why does the PM think that is? Johnson says the internal market bill will benefit Scotland. It devolves power back down to Scotland, he says. It enables Scotland to take back control of its fisheries. Today is a historic day, he says. The government has managed to lift the ban on British beef being sold to America. That covers Scottish beef too. Blackford says Johnson did not answer the question. The PM is “yapping, mumbling, bumbling”, but not answering the question. A Tory government that arrogantly breaks international law has shattered trust in the government. If the bill fails to get the consent of the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, will he withdraw it? Johnson says Blackford is just trying to “foment grievance where no grievance should exist”. David Mundell (Con) asks if the government will reach an agreement with the US on the Airbus dispute, so that tariffs on Scotch whisky can be lifted. Johnson says he has raised this with the Trump administration and will continue to do so. Starmer says the PM does not get it. There are viable jobs, but the businesses cannot operate now. They need help. He says black history month is about to start. Black women are five times more likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth. Will the government address this? Johnson says the government is reviewing race inequality. He says he is surprised by the fact that Starmer does not know that. He says the opposition supports the restrictions one moment, and opposes them another. He says the shadow education secretary made it clear when she said it was a crisis to exploit. The government is taking the tough decisions, he says. Starmer says he supports the restrictions. But he is asking about economic support. Some 10 million people could lose their jobs by Christmas. They wanted an answer to that question. The PM should have answered it. He quotes from someone who owns a wedding company. They cannot organise weddings, so there is no work. But those jobs are viable once the restrictions are lifted. What does the PM say to that business owner? The Speaker says it is prime minister’s questions, not opposition questions. Johnson says most people support the £190bn the government has spent. The furlough plan is far more generous than what is on offer in other countries. He knows the wedding sector is in difficulties. But the best way forward is to all pull together, and get the virus down. He says the support is only possible because a prudent, one nation Conservative government was in power. Starmer says the idea that asking a question at PMQs undermines confidence is wearing a bit thin. He says he spoke to the leader of Newcastle council yesterday. He called for better economic support. Why has the PM decided that some jobs are not worth saving? Johnson says Labour was calling for the measures the government introduced. He says they must drive down the virus and keep children in education. That is the strategy. Labour supported it last week. Starmer “simultaneously attacks and doesn’t attack” the restrictions. Which is it? Starmer says there is widespread confusion about the rules. He does not just mean the PM not knowing his own rules; having sat opposite him at PMQs, that was not a surprise. Starmer quotes the Conservative leader of Bolton saying people feel let down. How does the PM expect the people of the country to understand and follow the rules? Johnson says the people of the country do understand the rules and follow them, despite Starmer continuing to snipe. He says he cleared up the situation yesterday. He says people want to see the government defeat the virus, and they want to see us doing it together. He asks Starmer to be a little bit consistent, and to instil confidence in the measures he supports. Here is the clip if you missed it: Starmer says the PM described local measures as a “whack-a-mole strategy’. But that implies the mole goes down. In these areas, the virus has not gone away. What is the plan for getting them out of restrictions? Johnson says nobody wants to see these measures. But you have to take strong action. He says the illness seems to be more localised now than it was in the spring. Sir Keir Starmer says over 16 million people - one in four - are living under restrictions in England. But only one area, Luton, has come out of local restrictions. Why? Johnson says Starmer is right. There is “a serious and growing problem with the resurgence of the virus”. In Luton local people pulled together. That is the way forward for the entire country. Jason McCartney (Con) asks if the PM will support the events industry. Boris Johnson says he would like to have a situation where people can be tested before events. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts with a statement. He says the way in which the government has used its powers to make secondary legislation during the crisis has been “totally unsatisfactory”. He says regulations have come into force with very little notice. That is “totally unsatisfactory”, he says. He says he will give “very sympathetic” consideration to applications for urgent questions on these matters. MPs should get the chance to vote on amendable motions on regulations, he says. But, turning to tonight’s debate, he says only 90 minutes has been set aside for it. He cannot give it extra time, he says. He says when he became Speaker he said he would take decisions based on advice. He says tonight’s debate is meant to be a simple yes/no vote on renewing the Coronavirus Act. He says any amendments might create uncertainty. So he will not allow amendments, he said. But he says he hopes the government will resolve this issue and stop treating parliament with contempt. From my colleague Jessica Elgot PMQs is about to start. The list of MPs down to ask a question is here. The Lib Dems have said they will vote against renewing the Coronavirus Act tonight. In a statement the party leader, Sir Ed Davey, said: To save lives through this pandemic, the Liberal Democrats have supported and continue to support all necessary measures to keep people safe – including the lockdowns and face-covering requirements. However, I have deep reservations about the serious implications for people’s wellbeing, rights and freedoms. Most alarming to me is the watering down of care for elderly, disabled and vulnerable people. That is a red line issue. Just imagine what that has meant for those children and their families. On top of all the other hardships of lockdown, having the lifeline of caring support cut off completely. I have appealed to the prime minister to listen and heed the legal advice, but he has refused. Liberal Democrat MPs are therefore unable to vote for an act that fails to care for the most vulnerable, sees people wrongfully charged and gives ministers a blank cheque. Britain’s car industry risks losing out even if there is a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, according to a report by the BBC’s economics editor, Faisal Islam. This means car parts from Japan and Turkey used in the UK will not be treated as British, so some exports may see higher tariffs, the BBC reports. Lucy Powell, a shadow business minister, said: This is really worrying for our country’s automotive industry. The government must listen to businesses and trade unions, and crack on to deliver the trade deal with the EU they promised during the election. Both sides need to work harder and ensure a deal is reached that protects the businesses and jobs that our communities rely on, or risk adding to the growing unemployment crisis. Five staff members and one patient have tested positive with Covid-19 at the cardiac unit of Belfast’s Royal Victoria hospital. The Belfast trust, which runs hospitals in the city, confirmed the outbreak today. It comes as the number of positive tests for coronavirus in Northern Ireland is confirmed as 320 - the highest daily total since current test systems were put in place in the region. There are 550 people in NHS beds in Wales for Covid-related illnesses – up by 60% on seven days ago. The number of patients being treated in critical care beds has risen from 16 to 34 in the last week. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said there was more “scepticism” about Covid-19, partly being fuelled by conspiracy theories. Gething said the public was “thirsty for action” in March because of a “rising tide in deaths” in other parts of the world. There was more “complacency” now, he told the Senedd’s health, social care and sport committee. The Scottish government has announced a consultation on whether to make permanent the arrangements that have made it easier for women to have an early abortion at home during the pandemic. Since March, women have been able to take both pills required for an early medical abortion at home, where it is considered clinically appropriate. The current arrangements will remain in place as long as the virus remains a risk, but consultation has now started to gather views, including from women who have had the treatment, on making the current arrangements permanent. Scotland’s public health minister, Joe FitzPatrick, said: The current arrangements were put in place to minimise the risk of transmission of Covid-19 and ensure continued access to abortion services, without delays, during this pandemic. This consultation will allow us to gather as much evidence as possible to help inform future arrangements. On this morning’s BBC Victoria Derbyshire show the Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said that, if the government did not agree to give MPs prior votes on coronavirus regulations, he would vote against the entire Coronavirus Act tonight. The act, which gives ministers a very wide range of emergency powers, has to be renewed every six months and if the government were to lose the main vote tonight (which is most unlikely - Labour is not expected to vote against) the powers would lapse. Bone said he did not think it would matter if the act became redundant. He explained: Why do we need these emergency powers? Why couldn’t all the things that are being done by ministers be done by parliament? There is no need for these emergency measures. They were brought in because we were at the height of a pandemic when parliament was not sitting and operating ... I don’t see why government ministers making decisions is better than parliament making decisions. So the logic is, why do we need the act? Here is Sky’s Sam Coates on the standoff between No 10 and Tory backbenchers over the powers parliament has to scrutinise coronavirus regulations. (See 9.23am.) A Whitehall brainstorming session prompted by Priti Patel led to the idea being floated of sending asylum seekers to a volcanic island in the South Atlantic, my colleagues Peter Walker and Jessica Murray report. An initial review of the parliamentary art collection has found 232 items with links to the transatlantic slave trade, the House of Commons has said. Of those pieces, 189 depict 24 people who had ties to the slave trade and 40 pieces depict 14 people who were abolitionists. There are more than 9,500 works of art in the collection and a review is under way, prompted by concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter movement. Hywel Williams, the Plaid Cymru MP who chairs the Speaker’s advisory committee on works of art, said: The interpretation of our artworks is reviewed constantly, but this is the first time we are systematically reviewing the entire collection looking at issues around slavery and representation. We will look at ways to better explain and contextualise works in the collection through our website and in the material we give to visitors to parliament. And we will look for ways to better shine a light on the people in parliament who worked hard to abolish slavery. There are details of the 232 items here (pdf). The fishing industry has warned the government not to sell it out in Brexit talks after it emerged that the UK had offered a three-year transition deal for the sector to help get a trade deal over the line by December. “The fear right from the beginning has has been that we would again be sold out as we were in the 1970s,” said Barrie Deas, head of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organisations said at briefing this morning. But he warned the government not to sell them out. What we wouldn’t agree to is surrendering fishing rights in order to have a trade deal. The government would find it very difficult politically amongst its own supporters, never mind the kicking it would get in the press, from the fishing industry, if it came back with a poor deal on fishing. But he said “all the signals” were the government would deliver. He believed that a transition period was “one of the moving parts” of the negotiations and the industry could be content if it was a “step-wise movement towards the quota system” the industry is seeking. Alok Sharma is (quite rightly) being widely criticised by journalists for suggesting that it is unfair for broadcasters to ask ministers to explain details of coronavirus restrictions. (See 10.01am.) Here are some of the comments he’s attracting on Twitter. From Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC’s political editor From Jason Groves, the Daily Mail’s political editor From Nick Robinson, the Today presenter From the Daily Mirror’s Dan Bloom From Bloomberg’s Emily Ashton From LBC’s Theo Usherwood From openDemocracy’s Caroline Molloy The Evening Standard’s Sophia Sleigh says Alok Sharma used the “gotcha” line (see 10.01am) in three separate interviews this morning. Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio thinks it was scripted. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, has suggested that it is wrong for journalists to ask ministers if they know they detail of lockdown restrictions. Speaking on Radio 4’s Today programme this morning he said: There is an element of slightly ‘gotcha’ about this in terms of this line of questioning. You are a flagship programme when it comes to serious news and it is not a quiz show. Sharma was talking in the context of the PM’s failure to be able to explain the new lockdown restrictions imposed on the north-east of England in a Q&amp;A yesterday. A few hours before Boris Johnson fluffed the question, an education minister, Gillian Keegan, failed to answer the same question on the Today programme. As soon as Sharma made his “quiz show” jibe, the Today presenter Martha Kearney asked if he was seriously arguing that asking ministers to explain the coronavirus rules was as trivial as a quiz question. At that point Sharma backed down a bit, replying: No, absolutely not. But what I’m saying to you is that what is important is if people want to understand the precise restrictions that they have in areas which are more restricted, then they should go on to the [local authority] websites. Labour said Sharma was trying to excuse incompetence. Alex Norris, a shadow health minister, said: The prime minister should understand the rules he is asking huge numbers of people to follow. That’s not a gotcha, that’s just basic government competence. Temporary restrictions to services are to be put in place at the Royal Glamorgan hospital in Llantrisant, south Wales, after 82 cases of coronavirus were identified there, PA Media reports. The restrictions, which come into force at 2pm today, include suspending planned surgery with the exception of a small number of urgent cancer cases that have been clinically prioritised. There are currently 82 case of coronavirus identified at the hospital, which is in Rhondda Cynon Taf - one of the areas of Wales subjected to local lockdown restrictions. Last week, Cwm Taf Morgannwg University health board said 34 cases of Covid-19 had been recorded across two wards at the Royal Glamorgan hospital, linked mainly to transmission within the site. In a statement on Wednesday, the health board said that despite teams working to manage the outbreak, “additional cases linked to transmission within the hospital” had been confirmed in recent days. In his Today interview Steve Baker gave a clue as to the possible basis of a deal between ministers and backbenchers over the Commons getting more say over Covid rules (see 9.23am) when he stressed three principles. He said: I think there’s a common understanding between the government and ourselves on three things: that the government needs to retain the capacity for swift and effective action, that we shouldn’t be creating opportunities for vexatious opportunism from the opposition parties, and, thirdly, that we need prior approval of measures, major measures on a national scale, and indeed I think on a regional scale, which take away people’s liberties. That is the fundamental point of parliament - to legitimise, to authorise, restricting people’s freedom’s for the sake of the public interest. And at the moment MPs feel increasingly helpless as they find themselves unable to stand up for their constituents. Yesterday Sir Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the Commons liaison committee, offered his own proposal for a possible compromise. In a letter to the PM he said: Various proposals are being made that would require the approval by a vote of the House of Commons before or immediately after new restrictions come into force. The majority of us support this principle and expect that the government will also wish to accept it. It is worth pointing out that the rebel Tories are not demanding that every single new coronavirus regulation has to be voted on by MPs before it comes into law. Here is the amendment tabled by Sir Graham Brady, saying the Coronavirus Act power should be renewed: provided ministers ensure as far as is reasonably practicable that in the exercise of their powers to tackle the pandemic under the Coronavirus Act 2020 and other primary legislation, including for example Part 2A of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984, parliament has an opportunity to debate and to vote upon any secondary legislation with effect in the whole of England or the whole United Kingdom before it comes into effect. Good morning. Brexit was supposed to be about parliament “taking back control” but one of the extraordinary ironies of 2020 is that Britain’s departure from the European Union has coincided with the government implementing the most draconian restrictions on ordinary life seen in peacetime - mostly with MPs having no say over the process at all. The key lockdown measures have become law as regulations passed under emergency powers, Because of the way such secondary legislation is scrutinised, MPs have not had the chance to vote before the laws take effect, the few votes that have taken place have been retrospective (after the laws are already in place) and mostly the regulations have not been subject to votes or debates at all. Now many MPs have had enough. There will be a debate tonight on extending the powers in the Coronavirus Act and many amendments have been tabled saying MPs should have a greater say. The most important has been tabled by Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee, and it has got the support of dozens of Tories. It is likely that the amendments won’t be put to a vote for procedural reasons and ministers know that, if they don’t resolve this issue now, at some point soon the rebels will line up with the opposition to defeat them over this and so talks will take place this morning on a possible compromise. In an interview on the Today programme this morning Steve Baker, the Tory former minister and a leading rebel on this issue, said that What I’ve found by talking with colleagues on the backbenches, and indeed colleagues on the frontbenches, is people are extremely concerned about parliamentary democracy and the rule of law, the basis of our freedoms and our prosperity in the course of this crisis. And I do mean ministers - I’ve been amazed at the broad smiles that I’ve had from ministers in the course of this campaign ... There is widespread concern in parliament across parties and throughout the Conservative party that we are not standing up for parliamentary democracy and the rule of law and really that is what today is about. Baker said 247 pieces of delegated legislation had been introduced to implement coronavirus restrictions. He said it was not being properly scrutinised, and members of the public could not keep up with it. “The rule of law is based on ideas like certainty, predictability, clarity and stability and I think we’ve seen that they are going out of the window with this virus,” he said. He went on: When you get such a large and shifting body of law, you find even ministers and the prime minister cannot keep up with it. What possible hope can the public have? I had one minister say to me yesterday, with terror in his eyes about the disease, we might have to change the law every 24 hours. We can’t possibly expect 70 million people to keep up with law that changes every 24 hours - this would be chaos and ruin. We’ll hear a lot more on this as the day goes on. Here is the agenda. 9am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 10.15am: Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, gives evidence to the work and pensions committee about coronavirus and benefits. 12pm: Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs. 12.15pm: The Scottish government is due to hold its daily coronavirus briefing. 12.30pm: Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, answers an urgent question on government support for professional and amateur sport. 2.30pm: Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, gives evidence to the Commons women and equalities committee about the impact of coronavirus on children’s education. 5pm: Johnson holds a press conference with Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser. Later, after 7pm, there will be the 90-minute debate on renewing the powers in the Coronavirus Act. The rebel amendment is not expected to be called, and it is possible that ministers and rebels may agree a compromise deal before the debate starts, but the debate will still give MPs a chance to speak out on this issue. Politics Live has been doubling up as the UK coronavirus live blog for some time and, given the way the Covid crisis eclipses everything, this will continue for the foreseeable future. But we will be covering non-Covid political stories too, and where they seem more important and interesting, they will take precedence. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow."

          "headline": "Rise in pupils in England being home-schooled due to Covid fears, says Ofsted chief",
          "bodyText": "Anxious parents are taking their children out of school to home-educate them, as widespread misinformation on social media fuels fears over the risks of Covid, the head of Ofsted has said. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, the chief inspector of schools in England, Amanda Spielman, said that in a pilot study of 130 schools last month, one-third reported unusually high numbers of pupils being taken off roll to be home-schooled. While the trend might be explained in part by parents who enjoyed teaching their children over lockdown, Spielman said parents’ health fears were likely to be contributing, while others were disappointed by the support their children received from their school during lockdown. In her first interview since children returned to school in England, Spielman said primary and secondary schools who took part in the pilot study told Ofsted inspectors that misinformation on social media was presenting a real problem for headteachers. “A lot of parents have absorbed a lot of misinformation that’s making them more anxious than they need to be,” said Spielman. “Some of the headteachers told us they are having to explain and re-explain the real situation to parents.” On the increase in home education, she said: “We saw it in about a third of pilot schools. When we asked we were told there were unusual levels of children leaving for home education. These are children who have been on roll who have not come back because they’ve been withdrawn to be home-educated. “If it’s people who are able and enthusiastic about home-educating, that might be a great option for them. But my concern would be people who are driven by fear, who have perhaps lost confidence in schools’ ability to keep children safe or who have become genuinely so anxious for their children, who are taking it on when they are not actually well-equipped to do it.” Ofsted’s findings coincide with the Department for Education’s school attendance figures published this week, which show about 800,000 pupils still out of school three weeks into the new term. Spielman said the current climate was “febrile” and that myths were proliferating about schools – that football cannot be played, that children are not allowed to use sewing machines and that doors have to be open at all times, even if the pupils are getting hypothermia. “It’s an anxious time for many adults, I completely understand. Yet the great art of being responsible adults is making sure we don’t transfer our anxiety to children,” she said. Teachers also reported that children’s physical health had deteriorated during lockdown, when schools were closed to all but children of key workers and pupils described as “vulnerable” by the government. “Children are much less fit than they were,” said Spielman. Over the past months, there have been fears about the impact on children’s mental health, but Ofsted’s pilot schools have highlighted instead the impact on physical health and Spielman warned against schools being turned into “therapeutic institutions”. “For most children the most important thing for them is the restoration of normality. We don’t need therapy for all the children in the country.” Spielman also said next summer’s exams should go ahead, rejecting calls for them to be cancelled in favour of school assessments. After the exams crisis this year, when algorithm-moderated grades were pulled in favour of school-assessed grades, Spielman was appointed to chair a new board committee to oversee the work of the exams regulator, Ofqual. “I get a pretty strong sense from most corners: let’s not repeat what we did this year,” she said. Spielman also rejected criticism about Ofsted’s autumn visits, which began this week, with full inspections due to start again next year. Early feedback, she said, suggested schools found the visits “genuinely collaborative and helpful”. Commenting on the rise in home education, Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “Most children are better off at school. It is understandable that in this time of anxiety, some parents may be worried about the health implications of coronavirus, and this concern may be exacerbated by misinformation. “However, we would reassure parents that schools have done a very good job in putting in place control measures to minimise the risk of the virus being transmitted. If they have any concerns, we would encourage them to raise these with their school and would urge them against rushing into a decision to withdraw their child.” This week, the Commons education committee announced it was to hold an inquiry into home schooling to see if more needed to be done to ensure children educated at home were receiving a high-quality education. Their concerns predate lockdown. Figures dating back to March 2019 suggest that more than 60,000 children in England are home-educated, marking an increase in recent years, but the true figure is likely to be far higher as parents are not required to register home-educated children with their local authority. Robert Halfon, the chair of the education committee, said: “A parent will always know what is best for their child, but we want to make sure that the right support is in place for home learning to ensure every pupil in the country, whatever their background and wherever they are taught, can receive the education they deserve.” Meanwhile, MPs on the women and equalities committee, who are holding an inquiry into the impact of Covid on children’s education, were on Wednesday told that catch-up support needed to be targeted at children from black and ethnic minority groups who have suffered disproportionately as a result of the pandemic. Dr Angela Donkin, chief social scientist at the National Foundation for Educational Research, said that children were on average three months behind following lockdown, but research suggested a higher proportion of BAME pupils needed intensive catch-up support than their peers. Going forward, MPs were also warned about the shortcomings of online teaching for children who are unable to be in school for Covid-related reasons. The president of the National Association of Head Teachers, Ruth Davies, said online learning amounted to “little more than revision” and it was not possible to teach new concepts and skills entirely in an online setting."

          "headline": "More 'prompt' response could have prevented Victorian aged care deaths, says Brendan Murphy – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "With that we’ll be closing the blog for today. Thanks for reading along and we’ll be back tomorrow. Here’s what happened today: The former chief medical officer Prof Brendan Murphy said a more “prompt” response could have prevented Victoria’s aged care deaths. Murphy made the admission during a Senate inquiry, saying: “If the public health response had been more prompt, we might have avoided some of the scale of the outbreaks in Victoria”. More than 10,000 people died while on the aged care waiting list for home care, the Senate inquiry also heard. Those statistics were for the 2019-20 year and include a substantial period before Covid-19. The prime minister, Scott Morrison, said home quarantine could be used instead of hotel quarantine for returning Australians. He told reporters: “I think home quarantine can play a role in the future and it’s something that is being considered by the AHPPC.” He also said workers should “get back to the office” if safe, in states that were not Victoria. WA announced a slight easing of its border restrictions, meaning that NSW residents would be treated like that of other states, and Victorians could enter the state and also quarantine at home. Queensland and WA recorded no new cases of Covid-19. NSW recorded no new cases of community transmission, but two new cases in returned travellers. Victoria recorded 10 new cases of Covid-19, with seven more deaths. Thanks for reading and stay safe. The Australian managers of TikTok have denied that its content is changed to satisfy the Chinese government. TikTok Australia’s general manager, Lee Hunter, appeared before a Senate inquiry today, where he was asked about the app’s relationship to its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The Labor senator Jenny McAllister quoted ByteDance’s founder, Zhang Yiming, who in 2018 apologised to authorities over content shared in China through the company’s other apps, AAP reports. “Our product took the wrong path, and content appeared that was incommensurate with socialist core values,” he wrote at the time. Hunter said TikTok did not operate in China, arguing Zhang’s comments related to products that do. McAllister pointed to job advertisements for China-based positions that worked on ByteDance’s overseas products, including TikTok. “Are you seriously saying none of your content decisions are being made in the PRC [People’s Republic of China]?” she said. Hunter said TikTok moderators were based in 20 countries but none in China. “It’s important to note that we don’t moderate or remove content based on the political sensitivities of China,” he said. The Greens senator Nick McKim said ByteDance collaborated with the Chinese Communist party in Xinjiang province, where Uighur Muslims faced torture and imprisonment. Hunter encouraged McKim to search “Uighur” on TikTok to see a wide variety of content on the subject. “TikTok is not China,” he said. “We are an app. We are not based in China. We do not moderate or remove content at the request of the Chinese government.” TikTok Australia’s public policy director, Brett Thomas, said: “We would never give Australian user data to the Chinese. We never have and we never would.” He outlined the mutual legal assistance treaty, an international agreement to share evidence about criminal investigations with the US. Hunter also addressed the sharing of a graphic video showing a man taking his own life. He didn’t want to publicly go into too much detail on how it spread across the platform, but promised to tell senators more in private. The Western Australian government has also launched a new app that it says can be used to help police conduct self-quarantine checks on travellers. The premier, Mark McGowan, earlier today cited the app as a reason the state could slightly ease its border restrictions on New South Wales and Victorian residents. The app, called G2G Now, uses location data and facial recognition technology to conduct “virtual check-ups” on people, according to the state’s police commissioner, Chris Dawson. “This new app will deliver greater certainty and confidence in self-quarantining,” McGowan said. “As a result of this technology, we have confidence in taking the next steps to ease some of our restrictions.” The app is voluntary, but McGowan said all visitors to WA would be “strongly encouraged” to download it. “The incentive to download the app is you’ll not need to have police physically checking in on you as regularly,” he said. The Nationals senator Matt Canavan has just ruled out moving to the lower house by running for the Queensland seat of Groom. The former MP for Groom John McVeigh retired from politics earlier this month, triggering a byelection in the safe LNP seat. Canavan just told the ABC he was asked to run but declined. McVeigh, who as a Queensland MP was a member of the combined LNP but sat in the Liberal party room, had won the seat with a primary vote of 53% at the last election. Canavan sits in the Nationals party room. He told the ABC’s Jane Norman he had “ruled that out”. “I was asked. I used to live in Toowoomba, which the seat of Groom surrounds, so I was asked. Look, I’m very happy in central Queensland.” Norman: “What about if there was an intervention? If you were drafted?” Canavan: “Well, no, I made a decision to stay here because, look, a lot of it’s about family obviously. I’ve got five young children ... I didn’t really, I didn’t want to leave. So it was nice to be asked but I’m staying put and I’ve got a lot more to do here in this region.” The deputy Labor leader, Richard Marles, is now on the ABC, and has been asked whether he heard the comments of his colleague Joel Fitzgibbon – who threatened to quit the shadow ministry over the party’s renewables targets. Fitzgibbon made the comments in an interview with Guardian Australia’s Katharine Murphy on our Australian Politics Live podcast. Marles says Labor is still working on its policy. “If you listen to the podcast from the Guardian fully, [Fitzgibbon] said this is a matter to be sorted out in shadow cabinet and he expected to abide by the outcome of that,” Marles says. “There is a way to go in relation to all of these issues. We’ll work through them in a methodical way.” He is also asked about the party’s support for gas in response to the government’s proposed “gas-led recovery”. Marles says Labor supports both gas and renewables: We are absolutely supportive of the Australian gas industry. No ifs, no buts. Australia is the world’s largest gas exporter. We are, of course, supportive of that. Gas is a critical component of manufacturing in Australia. There’s no question about us being supportive of the role of gas and supportive of the gas industry. We are also very much supportive of trying to build a renewable energy sector in this country and seeing that as an important pathway forward in terms of getting to net-zero emissions by 2050, but also in terms of being a generator of jobs. Both of those things sit together and ultimately we are supportive of both. On the ABC, the national secretary of the Maritime Union of Australia, Paddy Crumlin, has refuted claims from Patrick Terminals that there are 90,000 containers that can’t come into port due to an ongoing industrial dispute. Crumlin said the company was being Trumpian in its statements, and all the union had done was one four-hour stoppage. “There’s one ship or two ships sitting off Botany, and there is always two ships sitting off Botany,” he said. “The only reason there are a few bottlenecks off Botany is the company, through their tremendous maintenance capability, cut through an electrical cable and shut the joint down for 48 hours. They have a software system out there that doesn’t work.” Asked by host Jane Norman about the 90,000 container claim, he said it was “nonsense”. “Absolutely fake news,” Crumlin said. “You know, a la Donald Trump. Bullshit.” In climate news, the Bureau of Meteorology has confirmed that La Niña has formed and will remain until the end of the year. La Niña increases the chance of floods and above average rainfall across Australia during spring. The bureau said that half of its models predict “a strong [La Niña] event”, while three of eight predict a moderate event. “Overall, models do not currently anticipate this event will be as strong as the La Niña of 2010–12, which was one of the four strongest La Niñas on record,” the bureau said. McGowan also announced that there have been no new cases of Covid-19 overnight, after eight cases were reported yesterday among the crew of the Patricia Oldendorff cargo ship off Port Hedland. He also said that the change to allow non-hotel quarantine would ease pressure on the state’s hotel quarantine system. The premier said that he would remain “cautious” and the hard border would remain in place for now. Like everything, we will continue to monitor the situation over east. But until we have confidence that community spread is under control, the border will stay in place. The WA premier, Mark McGowan, has just announced that the state will lift its hard border restrictions, allowing some residents of NSW and Victoria into the state – as long as they go through quarantine. From Monday 5 October, residents of NSW will be able to enter WA under the same restrictions as other states. Currently, people can only enter WA if they are exempt travellers – but people who have been in Victoria and NSW in the past 14 days cannot be exempted. McGowan said that this change was recommended by the chief health officer, after the low numbers in NSW and the declining numbers in Victoria. Victorians who enter WA from 5 October will “no longer need to quarantine in a hotel facility as long as they have an appropriate premise to quarantine in safely”, McGowan said. The premier said this was a “significant but reasonable change”. Hi all, it’s Naaman Zhou here. Thanks to Amy Remeikis for running the blog earlier today. A story from this morning: the prime minister, Scott Morrison, has rebuked his deputy PM, Michael McCormack, after the latter said yesterday that paying $30m for land worth $3m would in future be seen as a “bargain”. There is a national Covid update at 3.30pm, which Naaman Zhou is going to take you through. Thank you again for joining me today. I’ll be back tomorrow morning. Please, until then – take care of you. Ax It continues: In Victoria at the current time: 4,273 cases may indicate community transmission – a decrease of one since yesterday 326 cases are currently active in Victoria 46 cases of coronavirus are in hospital, including five in intensive care 18,978 people have recovered from the virus A total of 2,677,022 test results have been received, which is an increase of 8,226 since yesterday Of the 326 current active cases in Victoria: 320 are in metropolitan Melbourne under the second step of our roadmap Six are in regional local government areas under the third step of our roadmap 0 are interstate residents 0 are either unknown or subject to further investigation Colac Otway has one active case and greater Geelong, greater Bendigo and Ballarat have no active cases. Of the total cases: 18,766 cases are from metropolitan Melbourne, while 1,192 are from regional Victoria Total cases include 9,613 men and 10,530 women Total number of healthcare workers: 3,540, active cases: 53 There are 158 active cases relating to aged care facilities Active aged care outbreaks with the highest active case numbers are as follows: Estia Keilor: 34 (45 total) Opal Hobsons Bay Altona North: 23 (total cases: 44) Embracia Moonee Valley Aged Care: 22 (total cases: 80) Baptcare Wyndham Lodge Community Werribee: 14 (total cases: 260) Edenvale Manor Aged Care Facility Keilor East: 13 (total cases: 22) Doutta Galla Aged Services Woornack: 8 (total cases: 60 ) Mercy Place Parkville aged care: 7 (total cases: 104) Twin Parks Aged Care Reservoir: 4 (total cases: 127) Churches of Christ Care Arcadia Aged Care Essendon: 4 (total cases: 22) Epping Gardens Aged Care: 3 (total cases: 220) In Victoria there are currently two active cases in residential disability accommodation: Total resident cases: 0; total staff cases: 2 Active cases in NDIS homes: 2 (0 residents) Active cases in “transfer” homes (state regulated/funded): 0 Active cases in state government delivered and funded homes: 0 Non-aged care outbreaks with the highest number of active cases include: 9 active cases are currently linked to the Casey community outbreak (total cases: 44) 7 active cases are currently linked to Footscray hospital (total cases: 20) 6 active cases are currently linked to Alfred hospital (total cases: 11) 5 active cases are currently linked to the Springvale shared accommodation outbreak (total cases: 5) The official Victoria Health update is out: Victoria has recorded 10 new cases of coronavirus since yesterday, with the total number of cases now at 20,158. The overall total has increased by nine due to one case being reclassified. Three of today’s 10 new cases have been linked to known outbreaks or complex cases. One is linked to aged care (Embracia Moonee Valley) and two are linked to health services (Western Health and Monash Health). The other seven cases remain under investigation. Of today’s 10 new cases, there are two cases in Casey, Monash and Moreland, and single cases in Hobsons Bay, Knox, Moonee Valley and Wyndham. There have been seven new deaths from Covid-19 reported since yesterday. One man in his 60s, one man in his 70s, one woman in her 80s, two men in 80s, one woman in her 90s and one man in his 90s. Three deaths occurred prior to yesterday. Six of today’s seven deaths are linked to a known aged care facility outbreak. To date, 794 people have died from coronavirus in Victoria. The average number of cases diagnosed in the last 14 days for metropolitan Melbourne is 18.2 and regional Victoria is 0.6. The rolling daily average case number is calculated by averaging out the number of new cases over the past 14 days. The total number of cases from an unknown source in the last 14 days is 27 for metropolitan Melbourne and zero for regional Victoria. The 14-day period for the source of acquisition data ends 48 hours earlier than the 14-day period used to calculate the new case average due to the time required to fully investigate a case and assign its mode of acquisition. And the Victorian cabinet has been reshuffled following Jenny Mikakos’ resignation: Victoria Health has updated its “be on the lookout for symptoms if you were here” list: Leader of the free world. And it gets worse: Greens senator Larissa Waters has responded to the minister for families and social services, Anne Ruston’s, re-announcement of domestic violence funding: This funding is a fraction of the money needed to ensure women and children fleeing family violence have somewhere to go and get the support services they need. Announcing 700 new crisis places which the government contends will house 6,000 women and children nationally, when its own data shows more than almost 10,000 survivors were already turned away from crisis accommodation pre-Covid, means the government is condemning a third of women and children to a choice between violence or homelessness. Increased demand throughout Covid has meant Queensland Women’s Legal Service hasn’t been able to answer 50% of its incoming calls. Much of the ‘emergency’ funding announced by the government to address increased demand on family and domestic violence services in March is yet to reach the bank accounts of frontline services. Funding for crisis accommodation and support services for victim-survivors has never been more critical. Yet services have been waiting months for the support promised by this government, and made clear that much more is needed. The Greens support the sector’s calls for a significant increase in funding to fix the domestic and family violence crisis. Next week’s budget must fund all frontline services needed to keep all victim-survivors of violence safe, and effective primary prevention. Also in the Covid hearing, the committee has just heard that for the 2019-20 year, 10,563 people passed away while on the home care waiting list. A little earlier today, Scott Morrison also acknowledged the grim Covid milestone the world has passed – one million deaths: Today also we pass a milestone that no one would want to have ever seen passed and that is a million lives lost to Covid-19 around the world. And it is a reminder that we are living in the midst of a global pandemic. This is a pandemic that has been visited upon Australia from outside our shores and is one that has impacted on us greatly. In Australia, 882 lives have been lost to Covid-19, 670 of those in aged care. This is a heavy blow when it comes to the health impacts of the pandemic and it has been a daily challenge to ensure that we remain, as best as we can, ahead of the challenges of this pandemic, and in Australia we have fared better than almost any other country in the world. That is particularly the case when you combine the challenge we have with the Covid recession that has stemmed from the pandemic and our task has always been to manage both the health impacts of the pandemic and the economic impacts of the pandemic. And Australia sits amongst a handful of countries that have been able to limit the economic blow as well as limiting the health blow to our country and that is a great credit to all Australians in what they’ve been able to achieve and the way that they’ve demonstrated resilience and, in particular, the people of Victoria and especially the people of Melbourne, who have most significantly undergone the heavy burden of those restrictions in recent months and together they have flattened that curve for Australia once again. I said Australia will not win until Victoria wins and I believe Victoria is now beginning to win and that’s good news for all Australians and we thank Victorians for their great sacrifice over these many months to ensure that Australia can move forward together. Here is what Anthony Albanese had to say about today’s announcement by the federal government: I wanted, today, to respond to the latest re-announcement. The latest triumph of marketing and spin over substance from Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg. Today’s re-announcement is about the so-called ‘digital strategy’. But once again, when you look at the detail, it’s more about announcement than delivery. Scott Morrison is always there for the photo op, never there for the follow-up. The Digital Transformation Agency was set up by Malcolm Turnbull many years ago. The only thing we’ve heard of it in recent times is the extraordinary amount of money that they spent on stationery, which is ironic given that it is supposed to be about digital transformation. Indeed, more than half of the money that has been re-announced today was actually announced in 2017 and in a funding envelope that was revealed last year to create a digital identification number. Labor committed to a director identification number in May 2017. Today’s announcement follows the extraordinary humiliation of the backflip just a week ago by Paul Fletcher, when the government discovered that indeed, fibre, 21st century technology, was better than copper when it came to the National Broadband Network. This, in spite of the fact that they trashed the model that was established under the Rudd Labor government to roll out fibre-to-the-premises for 93% of Australian households and businesses. During the pandemic we have learned again how necessary 21st century communications technology is. Not just to downloading but to communicating, to uploading, which was always the key for business. How important it is to drive jobs in regional Australia. This government doesn’t get new technology. It doesn’t get helping to not just imagine the future but creating the future in a way that creates jobs and creates economic activity. And if today’s announcement or re-announcement is the best job they can do, then I think Australians are entitled to have confirmed in their mind that this indeed is a government that just does re-announcements, that concentrates on marketing and spin and doesn’t deliver when it comes to what is what is necessary. Over at the Senate Covid inquiry, Brendan Murphy has been asked if any of the aged care deaths were avoidable. His answer is below: Of course, you can always look at whether a more rapid public health response to these early outbreaks – if you recall, earlier on in the outbreaks in New South Wales and in Victoria there was a very rapid response and containment, but even then, with those rapid responses in NSW, two facilities had widespread infection. But I think if the public health response had been more prompt, we might have avoided some of the scale of the outbreaks in Victoria, and obviously we’re looking at, for example, if we had stood up the Victorian aged care response centre, early on, if we had been aware, if we’d had prior warning the public health response may have been compromised, that’s something that might have prevented some of the spread amongst facilities by responding more quickly. And obviously, you know, one of the lessons that we have learned, out of the Victorian outbreak is that infection prevention control training which was done widely across the sector needs to be regularly reinforced and that’s certainly something that the Victorian aged care response centre has been pursuing in facilities in Victoria. So, so it’s not possible to say what proportion could have been prevented as we’ve said on many occasions, once you have widespread community outbreaks, aged care outbreaks and unfortunately, deaths, particularly for people who are very frail and close to end of life are inevitable, but largely with the benefit of hindsight and in responding with a response centre, as I said a little bit earlier, we may have been able to prevent some of some of the spread. I think we would always look at every, every episode that happens and see what else we could learn. Gladys Berejiklian, the New South Wales premier, is not celebrating her state’s fourth day of having no locally acquired cases. As AAP reports, she is concerned people will get complacent: Last time we were complacent the Victorian situation erupted and caused this enormous amount of stress. It’s very early days. The fact that we’ve had a few days now of zero community transmission is positive, but we can’t get ahead of ourselves. A further relaxation of restrictions is on the table, as soon it is safe to do so, she said. We’re always looking to see what we can do in NSW, but we need to do it at the right pace. Labor’s social media campaign has decided on a new format in recent days: The Ernies – the awards given out for the most sexist and maladroit remarks – will be held virtually this year. The awards will be handed out on 1 October. From founder and organiser Dr Meredith Burgmann’s statement: Some of the frontrunners for 2020 are old favourites Mark Latham, Jeff Kennett and Craig Kelly, joined by newcomers Adem Somyurek and Israel Folau. It is remarkable that what began as a joke 28 years ago has become an institution. The winner of the Gold Ernie is often a surprise and in 28 years I have never managed to predict the winner. You can find the finalists here. Or just add your predictions to the comment thread. Good god. This number: If you want to follow along with the Covid committee’s hearings on the federal aged care response, you can find the link here. Q: The prime minister has ... [flagged] a possible return to home isolation rather than hotel quarantine. Do you believe that this can provide enough protection for returning travellers? Anthony Albanese: What we should be doing is taking the advice of the medical experts and the chief health officers, rather than making political decisions. Q: And in terms of public servants returning to the office to encourage more CBD spending, do you support public servants going back to work in the office? Albanese: Well, I’m a public servant, I’m in an office right now. Thank you very much. Q: Just very briefly – have you picked up the phone to [speak to Patrick’s]? Anthony Albanese: No, I have not. And it’s not my job, as the opposition leader. I’m not part of the government. And I suggest to the government that what they should be doing is trying to bring the parties together. Q: As the leader of the Australian Labor party, do you support the MUA and their right to engage in what is protected industrial action? Anthony Albanese: Of course, we have an industrial relations system that provides for action. This government has been in place now in its third term. This is the government’s industrial relations system, but there should be, also, as well as formal processes, the commonwealth should be playing a role in trying to bring the parties together. Now, we have a circumstance whereby, for example, earlier this year, we had an industrial relations minister say that he had never spoken to the secretary of the ACTU. I find that extraordinary. They’d never picked up the phone, had had no contact whatsoever. What we’ve seen from the government is a change in that rhetoric, and the government engaging with the trade union movement to try to achieve common outcome unless the interests of the national interest during the pandemic. I think that spirit should be taken to industrial relations. It’s the position that I put for a long period of time, that trade unions and employers have a common interest. They have an interest in successful businesses, but, of course, successful businesses are ones as well that have a cooperative workforce; that have a history of not necessarily engaging in cooperative dialogue with the trade union movement. The Labor leader’s first question is on the Patrick Terminals dispute: I think that the unions and the employers should have a cooperative relationship. There should be dialogue in the interests of both parties coming together, rather than conflict, and that the commonwealth should be playing a role in that rather than engaging in rhetoric for political purposes. ... If I was prime minister in this position, I would be trying to bring the parties together. ... I would be trying to bring the parties together in a cooperative way. ... I can’t answer the same question in anything other than the same answer. There are no new Covid cases in Queensland. The Senate Covid committee is also holding hearings today – they start at 1pm. It is about the aged care response today. Anthony Albanese will hold his press conference at 12.45 today. NSW Health has reported no new community transmissions for the fourth day in a row: Two new cases of Covid-19 in returned travellers were diagnosed in the 24 hours to 8pm last night, bringing the total number of cases in NSW to 4,031. There were 6,381 tests reported in the 24-hour reporting period, compared with 6,353 in the previous 24 hours. NSW Health thanks the community for all they have done towards reducing Covid-19 numbers and continues to ask people to remain vigilant and come forward for testing immediately if symptoms like a runny nose, scratchy throat, cough or fever appear. This is particularly important with school holidays having started and increased movement of people around the state. Locations linked to known cases, advice on testing and isolation, and areas identified for increased testing can be found here. NSW Health is treating 55 Covid-19 cases, including three in intensive care, none of whom are being ventilated. Eighty-four per cent of cases being treated by NSW Health are in non-acute, out-of-hospital care. Q: The public service has been told to go back to work, physically, in office buildings – should corporate Australia follow suit? Scott Morrison: On the issue of the public service, of course I support that measure, and it is important whether it’s here in the ACT, or in Sydney or, or in Brisbane or Perth or anywhere else, where the health advice enables it – obviously Victoria is still in a different position right now. For the public service to be back in their offices buying their lunch at the local cafe and doing all of those things will support, particularly those CBD economies, and it’s a matter that I’ll continue to pursue. I think very positively with the other state, with the state premiers and state ministers who I know will also I’m sure be wanting to see their own CBDs revitalised. And when I say CBD I’m not talking about the Sydney CBD in New South Wales, I’m talking about Parramatta. I’m talking about Liverpool, I’m talking about Sutherland, I’m talking about all of these places and Hurstville there, and the many other similar suburban CBDs that are around the country – Box Hill and the like. So it’s important that I think we get people back into their offices in a safe way. I think people have learned an enormous amount over the last six months, about how to do that in a Covid-safe way, and it’s time to get our CBDs humming again. And I think the commonwealth public service taking the lead in that regard is a good thing, and will seek the encouragement of other state public services. I know the NSW premier and treasurer have made similar comments in relation to business, I would encourage them to do the same thing. For example, if you had head offices in Melbourne, that doesn’t mean that your office in Perth should be operating on the same Covid site plan to the one in Melbourne. And I know that’s a point that the Western Australian premier has made on a number of occasions. We also have large multinational companies that are running their Covid-safe arrangements based on what’s happening in Paris or New York or, or in London, and those rules are probably very appropriate in all of those places, but they don’t make much sense in Adelaide. So I think it is important that we always have customised homegrown Covid-safe plans here in Australia targeted to the locality, because that is the best way to get our economy opening up again, because an economy opening up again safely means jobs, it means livelihoods, it means incomes and it means that we will recover and we will grow. Q: Can I just ask in your deliberations on the on the on the budget coming out – did you have a concern that some extra boost of aggregate demand might actually not work, that it might take a bit more effort to flow into the economy? Scott Morrison: You might want to unpack that last bit I mean of course we’re only going to consider things that we think is going to work. Q: Well, spending, it might actually not get your bang for buck because people might have to save it or indeed there might not be able to spend it because of businesses being restricted. Morrison: Obviously with every measure we’ve undertaken, particularly since the Covid crisis here, it has always been one of our assessments, temporary targeted proportionate targeted means it’s going to go somewhere where it works, and has the best effect that has been one of our principles the entire time. When we went into this crisis we thought it was really important to sit out what the principles would b,e and indeed I did that at the AFR summit. Back in March, where we were very clear about what the rules were for framing the economic measures that we would we would introduce and we’ve held fast to all of those, and we will continue to hold fast to all of those. And so I think that probably answer your question, of course, of course, we would consider the effectiveness. That is the point with every single measure and aggregate demand measures are important in this recovery phase, very important in this recovery phase as the tide is going out on so much other investment or activity, then it is an essential response in these unprecedented times that we would have a budget like the one you’re going to see next week. How do we respond and call back from that position in their budget by growing our economy. That’s how you do it. You don’t do it by putting up taxes. you don’t do it by risking essential services that Australians rely on you do it by growing your economy. And that’s why today’s announcement, along with the so many others we’ve made, whether it’s on insolvency reform or, or credit reform, or whether it has been on the job trying to fund or affordable, reliable energy with lower emissions all of this is designed to grow your economy. Now when you grow your economy, you can build your revenues, again, and that’s how Australia comes back from the budget that we will have to announce next week, and the measures that we’re putting in place a design to achieve those ends I mean today, we’ve announced reforms that are effectively upgrading the circuit board of our economy with this digital plan. That’s what it’s about today, mining, the, the arteries of your of our economy to burn on another analogy to be able to be cleared and able to ensure a much more healthy economy for Australians Q: The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission published data showing it had barely got to a quarter of aged care homes in April and Unifor non-site visits – so done remotely. How can Australians have confidence that the regulator is effectively being toothless throughout the pandemic? Will the government consider beefing up its powers, not just with resources, but empowering it to go into aged care homes more often and do more site examinations? And the aged care royal commission is due to hand its Covid report to you tomorrow, will you can commit to making that public as soon as possible? Scott Morrison: Well, we’ll wait for the royal commission to come down. It’s a royal commission. It will make its report. It will make its report. We’ve invested around $1.5bn in boosting our support for aged care. In aged care it’s been the area where people have been most vulnerable. That’s the case around the world. It’s not surprising that what you’ve seen is as the case numbers steadily increased in Victoria with the second wave that has flowed because of the community outbreak, which was obvious to all, those numbers also rose in aged care. Now, as the number of cases in the community have fallen in Victoria, so have the numbers of cases in Victorian aged care. There has always been a direct link between what has been happening in the community with what has been happening in aged care facilities and predominantly, the aged care facilities within Melbourne will are not publicly run facilities. They’re privately run, or not-for-profit-run facilities. So obviously, where the community outbreak has been greatest, that’s where it will affect those centres and that’s why we’ve seen predominantly what we have seen. There will be many lessons to be taken out of what has occurred during the Covid period. Many lessons have already been taken in how we would respond in other states and territories and they’ve been discussed candidly at national cabinet and the Aged Care Response Centre, which continues to operate successfully in Victoria as a crisis response. This has been formalised to a level that would enable it to be stood up very quickly in other states and territories. I knows there’s been a call that it should already be stood up in other states and territories. Those states and territories are adamant that they do not want such a centre stood up in other states and territories, that this needs to be done in partnership. They believe the arrangements that exist in other states and territories are satisfactory for the current threat and risk that presents but, should that change, then [it will be available]. Josh Frydenberg then takes that question: As the treasurer, I’m very focused on businesses reopening and people getting back to work. But as a Victorian parent, I’m also very focused on my children and other people’s children getting back to school. I note that that timetable has been accelerated for some of the year levels but I cannot see why all students can’t get back to school in Victoria now. Not just for their educational development – because so many of those students have lost nearly a year of study, not just for their educational development in the classroom, but for their wellbeing. I’ve read letters from well-regarded doctors and GPs, open letters to the premier of Victoria, and they speak of the mental health state of young people in Victoria as a result of the lockdown. And the number of cases they are seeing through their doors skyrocketing, providing antidepressants to kids as young as 12 and 13 as a result of this lockdown. So I say to the premier follow the medical advice but please get Victorian children back to school at all levels. Q: Prime minister, 11 days ago, you flagged that you wanted to see a national network of contact tracing systems right across the country. How long do you expect that to take to be set up? And can I ask both you of you, given what you said in your statement on Sunday and where Victoria’s cases are at now, with an average of eight a day over seven days, do you have faith in Victoria’s contact tracing system so that restrictions could be eased now or in the next couple of weeks? Scott Morrison: Well, a couple of points. Dr Finkel is leading that taskforce that I announced after the last meeting of national cabinet – that’s already under way. He’s in Canberra now and leading a team drawing from a range of different disciplines and it’s already started the work of pulling together that digital overlay to connect the contact tracing systems between the states and territories. One of the reasons that’s so important is because it enables your contact tracing resources in other states and territories to swarm on to particular problems. That was one of the challenges we had when Victoria hit their second wave. There were plenty willing and able to assist the systems, and the system in Victoria at the time when it first hit was different from what it is now. In large part, there were paper-based systems in Victoria at that time. That has radically transformed since that time and I would say - and I commend the Premier on this - that it is now going beyond that with the mod night ace they’re applying to bring the system up to what I would call the New South Wales gold standard and now they’re looking at further improvements beyond that system. They’ve come a long way in a very short period of time and the key to being able to open up your economy – as New South Wales has demonstrated, day after day, week after week, month after month, has been about the capacity of your contact tracing system and your testing regime. Those combined with outbreak management, maintaining Covid-safe behaviours, that’s how you keep your economy open. That’s how you live with the virus, not have the virus tell you how to live. It’s very important that that work continue and build. I made the point on the weekend with the treasurer and the minister for health that Victoria now is at a similar state when it comes to the number of cases that New South Wales has been at over recent months and New South Wales has a very different level of restrictions. They are matters at the end of the day that are for the decision of the Victorian government and the Victorian government and the premier does take responsibility for the decisions they make about restrictions and the thank path that they’re on. Obviously as a federal government we have sought to work with them to highlight areas where we think we could move more quickly but we do that behind the scenes working in good faith with the Victorian government. Do not take an absence of commentary from this platform as an absence of engagement between officials and otherwise. That’s a good thing. That’s how it should work. I don’t intend to have those discussions in a public setting. We want to support the Victorian government to move forward as safely and quickly as they possibly can. Ultimately, the calls that are made, I respect are made by the Victorian premier and the Victorian government and, of course, the implications of that also rest with that government. Q: You’ve made two observations today – jobs are coming back in the economy in some places but people are still doing it – a lot of those families doing it tough are on the edge and with jobkeeper and jobseeker now tapering off. A few hundred dollars could be the difference between meeting the mortgage or a rent repayment and literally living rough. There’s been speculation about maybe a supplement for pensioners in this budget coming up. Will you give something for those families who are on the edge of being thrown out of their homes, looking at a bleak Christmas, in this budget, in some form of payment or support? Scott Morrison: The budget will be next week so I won’t make further announcements about what we’re putting in the budget for next week and the treasurer will do that at that time. Let me give you a scenario here – someone who was receiving jobkeeper at a rate of $1,200 per fortnight may also be eligible for a part payment for jobseeker of $276 per fortnight, which includes the coronavirus supplement bringing their total taxpayer-funded income back to $1,476 per fortnight. My point is that jobkeeper and jobseeker work together to provide essential income supports and it was the same numbers we did when we looked at less than two hours and more than 20 hours. People working less than 70 hours, on $750 – which I remind people is paid to the business and the business then pays the employee, know now, that business is not restricted to paying that employee $1,200. What we are seeing when I talked about 760,000 jobs coming back in, that’s not just the more than 400,000 that have come back in terms of measured employment, that is about 300,000 or thereabouts of jobs that were reduced to zero hours. Now, those jobkeeper recipients are now getting more hours so their actual incomes will be supplemented by their employer, not just the taxpayer. That’s a good change. Jobkeeper and jobseeker are transitioning but equally there are more jobs coming pack into the economy and more hours coming back into the economy so people’s incomes, increasingly, will be supported by their jobs, not just by the taxpayer, particularly when it comes to jobkeeper as a payment and jobseeker is there to support and buttress what is otherwise happening with their income supports and so the two will work together and you will see people being able to get further income support where they’re in the sorts of situations that you’re talking about. Q: Back on the waterfront, if Patrick were to form a rival workforce, would you support such a move? Scott Morrison: I’m not getting into hypotheticals about how this will be resolved. I’ve made the point clearly and I’m imploring that there be a lawful resolution to this situation, because I can not have Australians who need what’s on those ships being held on those ships, 40 of them out there. You can go down to Port Botany or Kurnell and you can see them lining up and every single one of them lining up is being held back from Australians getting what they need in the middle of a recession. So whatever differences people have on the waterfront about this, I would ask them to put it aside, think of the national centre and get back to work. Q: You talked about the need to build and you talked previously about the importance of infrastructure into the future. Do you agree with the Western Sydney airport, with your deputy prime minister, that $30m was a bargain for that piece of land? Scott Morrison: Look, I agree with the auditor’s report. And these events are not things I’m happy about. There are clear lessons that needed to be learned within the department and they will be. And there is a review going on presently within the department and I understand why Australians would feel disappointed in that. I’m also disappointed in it and I don’t think it’s something that I would ever like to see repeated and I know the minister at the time feels equally disappointed about that. I agree with the deputy prime minister that the Western Sydney airport is going to be if not the biggest game changer we’ve seen in infrastructure in the Sydney basin in a very, very, very long time. I agree wholeheartedly with him on that. It’s an absolutes jobs machine, the western Sydney Lady Nancy Bird Walton international airport and the logistics hub and technology hub that will continue to be built around that. This is a megalithic project for western Sydney, Sydney more broadly and the country. The deputy prime minister and I are on the same page when it comes to that. When it comes to the processes that led to that decision, I’m not happy about it. The officials understand that. This happened some years ago, as you’d appreciate. Now that it’s come to light and has been brought to our attention, we’ll ensure it won’t happen again. Q: In 1949 the Labor prime minister Ben Chifley sent troops into the coalmines to break a strike. Given Australia is in a national emergency, would you consider session similar on the docks? Scott Morrison: I’m not going to pre-empt any of those sorts of things. We’re still at a stage where I think that sort of thing would hopefully be unnecessary and that it would never come to something like that. My simple message today is to get it sorted and stop the extortion and to think of your fellow Australians and get back to work. Q: On the waterfront, the MUA said they offered to get [medical supplies] off the ships but were rebuffed by Patrick’s. What more could they have done? And why should they give up the right to take industrial action when politicians are still getting pay rises? Morrison: Well, they’re not. Q: Politicians are getting pay rises. Morrison: Well, they’re not. Q: Why shouldn’t they be able to take lawful action, though? Morrison: We’re in the middle of a Covid recession and supplies on ships need to come ashore. It’s extortion and I won’t put up with it. Q: Freezes on childcare fees were lifted in every state but Victoria yesterday. Given what we know about how families are doing it tough, what’s your message to centres? And is it correct that the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet is looking at policy options for childcare? Scott Morrison: Well, a couple of points. For everywhere other than Victoria, the situation is different – and the treasurer may want to comment on this particularly – what we are seeing around the country is Australia’s economy recover. Now, there’s still a long way to go but when you look at the most recent job numbers that we’ve seen nationally and on the measured employment alone, more than 400,000 jobs have come back, more than 400,000. Now, it was even more than that around the country when you take out the impact in Victoria, which saw the number of jobs go down. So we are seeing all the other states and territories get themselves back into a much stronger position. We always said that our supports would be temporary, targeted and proportionate and we can’t stay stuck in the same gear when it comes to our response to the Covid-19 recession. We’ve got to keep moving forward. We’ve got to keep leaning into the next step to see our economy strengthen and not have it held back by keeping support measures in place for too long. What we want to see is the economies continue to restore and as the economies continue to restore, then households’ budgets will be further strengthened, the job prospects will be further strengthened. Businesses and incomes will be further strengthened and that will enable Australians all around the country to get back to as close to a Covid-normal position as is possible. Where there have been measures in the past there comes a time for them to move on. Where there are particularly difficult situations like the situation in Victoria, then we’ve shown the flexibility and I think the common sense to make exceptions and arrangements in those cases. But in other cases where we’re moving ahead and in Western Australia, for example, the premier will tell you, I’m sure proudly, that Western Australia, which is looking at even having a budget less this year, the idea of maintaining many of those sorts of support in that environment, I think would be counter-intuitive. It is important we keep moving on and not stay stuck in the same gear when it comes to economic recovery. Q: A theme through a number of your recent announcements has been deregulation and the need to free up things from controls. I’m wondering whether you are really confident that this, in the end, won’t be counter-productive in some cases. I’m thinking particularly of your announcement on credit the other day, which – it does seem – could lead to some people in the end being worse off, undertaking obligations that they really can’t afford. Josh Frydenberg: We had no less authority than the governor of the Reserve Bank talk about how the responsible lending laws had led to a risk aversion when it came to lending and ... Q: I’m talking about the banks, though, not the consumers. Frydenberg: This is all about the consumer. This is all about increasing access to credit for the consumer, be it for a credit card, be it for a loan and I knows that industries such as the motor vehicle industry, the housing industry and others have strongly welcomed this proposal from the government. We already have Apra as the prudential regulator with a lending standard as it applies to the banks. And it requires the banks to identify the income of the customer and their ability to pay. What has happened over the last decade is that these regulations, which started aspirin-based, have become overall prescriptive, costly and complex. It’s leading to delays in loans being made available. It’s leading to loans not being available as they otherwise should, as the risk aversion on the part of the banks cuts in. So what we’re seeing 20 do here is to boost Australia’s economic recovery by reducing unnecessary red tape, by encouraging and facilitating lending as appropriate but, of course, with the necessary consumer protections in place. Q: Do you have confidence in the Victorian bureaucracy’s response to the pandemic? Scott Morrison: That’s really a question to the premier. I’m responsible for many things but I’m not responsible for the state government of Victoria. That’s a matter for the premier and he’s initiated an inquiry into this, given the seriousness of the matter and that report has not yet been brought down. I note that there’s been counsel assisting who have made comments but the final report will come down and I’m sure the premier will address that in due course. Q: A question about what’s going on on the waterfront at the moment with the go-slow action in response to seeking a pay rise and some other conditions. The industrial relations minister yesterday floated the prospect of some sort of intervention. How serious is the federal government on that? And what would you be looking at? Scott Morrison: Well, I’m very serious. There are 40 ships – and I’m told there’s some 90,000 containers out there. That includes medical supplies. I mean we cannot have the militant end of the union movement effectively engaging in a campaign of extortion against the Australian people in the middle of a Covid-19 recession. This is just extraordinary, appalling behaviour. And they as much as admitted it on morning television this morning, with what they [made] are ambit claims. That is just straight-out extortion. That is reprehensible. Now, as I made some remarks on Saturday when I was in Adelaide, I thanked the union movement, I thank the ACTU. I thank Sally McManus for the way that she has brought the union movement to sit down as part of this, I think, good-faith process that the attorney is leading and I find what’s happening with the MUA in port bat any so at odds with the good-faith spirit. I would think that the union movement would want to distance itself from that behaviour as much as certainly the government does in condemning it. This is certainly whether it’s ever a time for extortionate demands, I would never say there’s never such a time but certainly not when Australians are doing it so tough. I mean it is just absolutely galling. Now, the specific measures the government may undertake, well, I’ll keep that to the counsel of the attorney at this point, but I want to assure Australians that we don’t take this lightly. It’s not on and we will take what steps are necessary to ensure that this can be brought, I think, to a more meaningful and swift conclusion. Q: Prime minister, in relation to the hotel inquiry going on in Melbourne, on March 27, you stood in this courtyard and announced that program. You gave the states a very short period of time to get it up and running. The consequences of that short period of time have been discussed during the hearings. That put a great deal of pressure on state public servants. Do you take any responsibility for the consequences of those time pressures? Should they have been allowed more time? Do you accept the suggestion of counsel assisting the inquiry that while the offer of the ADF was made that it doesn’t necessarily need to have taken up and no findings should be made against the Victorian government as a result of that. And given there are now concerns that some of those people may have been held unlawfully, shut national cabinet consider some sort of hybrid model where you basically have a triage system, check out whether people should be kept in hotel quarantine and let them go to their own homes? Scott Morrison: First of all, I remember the national cabinet meeting very well. It was actually the states and territories that were most urgent in moving forward and they made the recommendation to move so quickly to establish hotel quarantine and we supported that. That was a, quite a long yes discretion and the states were keen to move forward and get this in place so, that was a genuine decision then by national cabinet at the initiation of the states and territories to move as quickly as they did. I welcomed the fact that they were so keen to move so quickly and get those quarantine arrangements in place. In all other states and territories, I think the experience has been quite different to Victoria, and that is a great shame [for] Victoria. But, you know, that is what has occurred and that’s all plain for people to see. In relation to the second question, well, the offer was made for the ADF to be available. It was taken up by most states, not by some, and that was a decision for the states and territories, so how best that to be done was a matter for those states and territories to determine and so I will leave it to the inquiry to make their own recommendations. Thirdly, in relation to issues of home quarantine – which is largely I think what you’re referring to – if we recall back in February and March of this year, that’s how it was working and I’ve got to say particularly among the Chinese Australian community, where the risk of greatest, where people were returning from mainland China and even Wuhan at one point, that home quarantine was followed incredibly assiduously by our Chinese European community and that, as I’ve said on many occasions proved absolutely vital in Australia’s success in managing the impact of that first wave. Now, I think home quarantine can play a role in the future and it’s something that is being considered by the AHPPC and particularly as we move beyond the phase we’re in now and we do look to see ... To have our borders open up at some point to safe locations weather it be New Zealand or parts of the Pacific or places like South Korea or Japan or countries that have had, I think, a much higher rate of success, then there are opportunities to look at those alternative methods, a triaging if you like. And many countries do this. Denmark operates on a traffic light system which goes along those sorts of lines. In Greece, they have an algorithm which triages people based on where they’ve come from and where they’ve been and that quantifies the risk. At the end of the day, the answer to your question is really how you’re going to manage risk and how you’re going to identify it and then apply the right solution to the risk that presents and I think as time goes on, we will need a more flexible approach that gives us more options for managing this, so I think that is something that is under active consideration and when it comes in, that will obviously be determined principally by the health advice that can provide a green light to those sorts of options once again but I’m hopeful it’s something we can move to. OK. So not a lot of announcements there but the budget is just a week away. We move on to questions. Josh Frydenberg details some of the other changes – consumer data: The other initiative worth mentioning is around the consumer data right. Prime minister, when you were treasurer, you were promoting and pursuing the electronic exchange of consumer information in a secure and trusted way in order for consumers to get more choice and to get a cheaper product. And we have already implemented the consumer data right through open banking, as it applies to credit cards today, but we’re also extending it to mortgages and personal loans by the end of this year. What this means is if you have a $250,000 mortgage on your home and you’re a trusted customer of a bank, longstanding customer, you may be paying $1,000 too much for the variable interest on your loan compared to the best market offer that is otherwise available and we’re extending the consumer data right also to the energy sector and why this is important – because, again, if you are on an established paying system in one state, you may be paying $400 more for a medium set of energy supplies than you otherwise would get if you got the best median market offer, if you got the best market offer available. Finally, we should all see digital transformation as an opportunity, not as a threat. We want existing Australian businesses to transform by using the digital opportunities available to them. We want new businesses in Australia to be born digital and, in doing so, we will help Australian consumers and Australian businesses alike. Some of those changes? E-invoices. Josh Frydenberg: A distribution electronically of documents will now be much easier to undertake for businesses. We’re enabling the execution of documents to now be undertaken digitally and we are also enabling AGMs to be held virtually. For example, last year, Telstra printed and posted 650,000 notice of meetings at a cost of around $1m. No longer will that be required. We’re also moving to e-invoicing by commonwealth agencies. This is when the supplier and also the buyers’ systems are automatically connected and it reduces the cost of an invoice by around two-thirds. And this is really good for small business who is will be able to be paid a lot quicker. So if you are a fruit and veg supplier to an army barrack, if you are an IT consultant to a government department, by moving to e-invoicing, we will be able to ensure that you get paid a lot faster. Ninety per cent of small businesses today still used paper-based invoices and, if you take the commonwealth together with the states, governments are responsible for around 10% of all business invoices and this was an issue that I raised with the state treasurers as recently as last week and it is hoped that the commonwealth, by taking the lead to e-invoicing with lead to states – and I know New South Wales already has measures under way – other states following the commonwealth’s lead in this respect. We are on to Josh Frydenberg: As we all know, Covid-19 has changed the world. Covid-19 has changed Australia and Covid-19 has changed the way businesses do business. Nine out of every 10 Australian businesses have used technology to adapt. Indeed, it has been said that we have made five years’ worth of gains in advancing the use of technology in this country and around the world in just a matter of eight weeks. Zoom meetings have replaced air travel, Telehealth consultations have replaced GP visits and e-commerce – which was already gaining a pace – has moved to the next level. Now, the Morrison government made a number of temporary changes to our regulation through Covid to ensure that businesses could continue to do business and people could continue to stay in jobs despite the virus. Today we’re making an announcement that a number of those changes have become permanent, as well as going further in other areas. The theme for the budget? Scott Morrison: It’s all about three things – it’s about cushioning the blow, it’s about recovering what was lost, and it’s about building for the future. Here’s the main takeaway so far. Scott Morrison: We are recovering what has been lost although there is still much ground to take. Some 760,000 jobs that were either lost or reduced to zero hours have already come back into our economy and that is great tribute to the resilience of our economy and the Australians who make it work every day. And we are building for the future through the jobmaker plan that I began outlining many months ago – affordable and reliable energy, particularly for heavy industries and households. Lower emissions into the future. Skills development through the jobtrainer program and the supporting of apprentices in this country $1.5bn alone from the commonwealth, also backed up by the support of the states in the $1bn jobtrainer fund. Fixing problems in our industrial relations system so we can employ more people. That’s what it’s about. Us coming together with employers to find ways that they can work together better to employ more Australians and we grow into a recovery. Record investments in infrastructure through our three grids – a transport grid, a water grid and an energy grid – making it easier to do business, cutting red tape, streamlining approvals and the reforms to the EPBC Act that we flagged. We need to go further than that and in the budget we will, particularly in the area of making it easier for people and businesses to do business in this country and that means supporting businesses to thrive in the digital world. And making it easier and safer to deal with government when it comes to the digital economy. I’ll come back to anything we have missed with Daniel Andrews in a moment – first, Scott Morrison is holding a press conference with Josh Frydenberg to discuss the “most important budget in a generation”. Q: The six more deaths in aged care, when did they get infected? Daniel Andrews: I don’t have that data. Q: Do you know if they died from the virus or with the virus? Andrews: I’m not the coroner. I’ve not sought to make that judgment at any point. Q: Why are people in aged care still getting infected? Andrews: Because this is a wildly infectious virus, and people in aged care are ... Whilst it’s aged care is their home, aged care is not where the staff live. The staff live in the local community and we have community transmission and therefore the virus can spread. Q: So it’s still from the staff? Andrews: Well, it can be from many different sources but it stands to reason if somebody has not left a particular facility, but there are different people moving in and out of that facility and there’s no alternative, other than to provide no care or have a situation where staff live in – which is many tens of thousands of people. I’m not sure where we would put them. Q: So it’s staff that are still causing the transmission in aged care right now? Andrews: I wouldn’t make a statement like that right now. I’m saying logic tells you if you’ve got people in the community and you’ve got people, by necessity, moving from the community into these settings, that is a risk. The other issue too here is that not all of those who are connected – and that’s the reporting we do every day – those deaths are linked to an aged care outbreak. Whether that person has passed away as a resident in an aged care facility as opposed to a hospital, I haven’t got that detail. Q: What’s the health advice now behind letting cricket nets be used but not tennis courts, without club rooms being open? Daniel Andrews: I’ll have to get the public health team to come back to you. They’ve made a judgment. It’s ... I think it will be a feature of some nets in the park. There’s an issue about shared equipment. There’ll be things of that nature. Again, rather than me speculating on what that might be – with the greatest of respect to cricketers out there, I’ve not spent a lot of time interrogating the public health team on that particular issue but I’m more than happy for them to come to you with any more detail. Q: OK. Why is it appropriate that Ms Mikakos resigned but it’s not appropriate for you to resign? In your view, that would be you running away from challenges. Daniel Andrews: You would need to ask her. She resigned. Q: I’m asking you. Andrews: Well, again, you asked – you have asked me a question. What I’m indicating to you is she resigned. She made a judgment she could not sit in the cabinet. When a minister makes that judgment, then you have only got one ... Q: You said it was appropriate she resign ... Andrews: She issued a statement. That statement makes it very clear that she could no longer sit in the cabinet. Any minister that comes to that conclusion has no choice but to resign. That’s the appropriate thing to do. That’s exactly what I have said. Beyond that, if you want any more specificity about her reasons, then you would need to speak to her … I’m not in a position to elaborate on that. I appeared at the inquiry. I have not made a supplementary submission to the inquiry. If you want to speak to her about those matters, then I’d invite you to to that. Q: Are you implying that Ms Mikakos is someone who runs from challenges? Andrews: No. Not at all. I was asked a question. I have answered the question. I’ve answered it, I think to be fair in similar terms I have answered before, which I believe predates the decision of the minister. Q: Do you expect ministers to take responsibility for what goes on in their departments? Daniel Andrews: Yes. Q: What about yourself? Are you prepared to resign? Andrews: I indicated the other day I don’t run from challenges. I don’t run from problems. I’m not someone who quits to avoid doing the hard work that needs to be done ... you have asked me ... I would have thought a rather serious question. If I might be allowed to answer the question? I will then answer your next one. I don’t run from problems. I have a big job to do. I’m dedicated to getting it done. That’s not just getting the numbers down but also delivering the most significant package of economic reform, investment and recovery that this state has ever seen. I can barely describe to you how committed I am to that task. And that, I think, is an expansive way of saying to you – no. Q: When Judge Coate or the inquiry asked for an extra nearly $3m, you said yesterday the funding [had been granted] – did they say why? [And what it was for?] Daniel Andrews: I’m not certain. It’s not a matter ... It is not a matter of me sitting down and trying to assess and second guess them. They have sought extra funding. I have faith that they have a genuine need for that additional funding. And there is an appropriate formality to this. It isn’t like a normal budget process where an agency might ask for money and you had would like carefully. Indeed, we look line by line to make sure whether has is a fair thing. This is a slightly different process. I think it is appropriate when extra funding is sought to complete the task that’s been given to the board, that that additional funding has been quite – has been approved. If you want further information about where that money’s – the sorts of things that money will do and help support then I direct you to the board. Q: Why should Victorians have any confidence when the inquiry heard on multiple occasions these secretaries didn’t brief their ministers on key elements of hotel quarantine program that led to 768 deaths? Daniel Andrews: I’m not here to speculate. What I’m telling you I’m confident that they are doing the very best they can and they are acting appropriately. That is what everyone is doing. This strategy would hardly be working as it most certainly is, if that were not the case. They’re briefing their many ministers right now? Yes, I believe they are. What I can also indicate to you is that if that were not the case, the broader reflection you’re making on those public servants or others, I would not be standing here reporting 326 active cases. Nor would I be reporting 10 new cases when six weeks ago we had 725. The prime minister will be holding a press conference at 11.15am. Does Daniel Andrews still have confidence in the public service to continue to lead the response, given what the counsel assisting the inquiry had to say yesterday in its conclusions? Andrews: Yes, I am. Yes, I am. I will wait – as we all must – whether we like that or not. We must all wait and see what the findings of the report are. The recommendations that may or may not be made. The commentary, the contents of that report will be very important. That’s why we have set up this process. I would make to point to you as well that the submission process is not over. Counsel assisting have made their important submissions to Madam Chair, but others have an opportunity – not orally but in writing – to make further submissions. I think that expires next week. So, that whole submission process, very important, but it is far from complete. Nor is the burden of inquiry complete, given the report that former Judge Coate has been commissioned to write, she has not yet written. Q: Are you prepared to overhaul the public service? Daniel Andrews: I don’t want to cut across what may or may not be in the report. But we stand ready to implement whatever changes that – obviously we believe are necessary and, indeed, any changes that the board may well recommend to us. It’s somewhat challenging to speak to those recommendations, given they haven’t been made yet and the scope and the kind of terms of any of those recommendations. That really is a matter for Judge Coate. There will be no hesitation in taking the action that is required. I will take the action that is required to make sure that we do everything we possibly can to avoid anything like this ever happening again. That’s important. It is a contract call part of my job. Q: Will you look through roles within your government, such as that of Kym Peake? [Peake is the head of the Department of Health and Human Services.] Daniel Andrews: The most important thing is to wait until we get the report. I’m not sure what it will find. None of us can be certain what former Judge Coate will call for. We will look at that. We will take the action necessary very quick thereafter to make sure that these sorts of mistakes can never happen again. The exact nature of those mistakes, the nature of recommendations, what action is needed in the view of the board of inquiry, I can’t predict what that is now. We simply have to wait for the report. I know it is frustrating. It is some weeks away. When you have got nearly 300,000 pages of documents, many, many witnesses, many different issues, it’s appropriate and not only appropriate, but it is respectful of Judge Coate and respectful of the process to allow that to run its logical course. The press conference is thrown open to questions: Q: The hotel inquiry said the Victorian government failed. Your response? Daniel Andrews: I will await the report of the inquiry. Submissions were led by counsel assisting yesterday. It is an important part of the process. But it is equally important – arguably more important part – is to wait until early November when Judge Coate will deliver her report. That will have findings, recommendations. What’s in that report and what she calls for or believes to be appropriate is entirely a matter for her. And then, an update on contact tracing. Daniel Andrews: I can confirm for you that as at 28 September, no cases are awaiting that first contact. The proportion of outstanding cases needing notifications – there are none. Everyone has been contacted within that 24-hour period. The proportion of outstanding cases that require interview, no new case, no cases are awaiting interview: 100% have been interviewed. Indeed, I can further report that just under 80% of those interviews are conducted within four hours. So, not 24 hours. Within four hours. And, finally, the last of those three metrics – which is to have contacted close contacts within 48 hours, no close contacts are awaiting notification. So, that is a very significant performance and that speaks pretty much to the trend over quite a few weeks now. We’ve seen obviously when you’re not overwhelmed by literally thousands of cases then this contact tracing team, like any contact tracing team across the world, are in a position to respond even more quickly and that’s exactly what they’re doing. That should give every Victorian significant confidence that because of investment, because of improvements, because of just the position we find ourselves in, and the nature of the challenge, that continuous improvement will serve us well as we continue to open up. Daniel Andrews continues: The next one on my list is cricket nets. Cricket nets can be used in public spaces, so long as they do not require facilities beyond that. Other restrictions apply including the two-hour time limit and the 5km travel limit. Dog groomers – in relation to animal welfare issues, which have been raised with us consistently, in metro Melbourne that is only in retail stores. Not from home. It can occur from home in regional Victoria. Painters – emergency repair, emergency repairs can take place at occupied properties. That means no interior design, no renos if the property is occupied. Gardening and landscaping services by sole traders are allowed, as long as it’s contactless and can be done safely alone and it can also occur on an occupied property, given the nature of that work. It is, indeed, outside. We then get some clarifications on the easing of restrictions and what that means for some situations. Daniel Andrews: Firstly, learner drivers – you can practise driving if you are out for one of the for reasons – for example, driving to the supermarket – you cannot go out solely for the purposes of driving practice. Weddings – there is no 5km limit. You cannot travel to regional Victoria for a wedding unless you are the celebrant and you are working. Apartment complex swimming pools – all pools, indoor or outdoor at residential premises, including apartment complexes, are closed. Only outdoor pools at non-residential premises are open in the second step. Travel for childcare – yes, you can travel across the metro border for childcare. But the restrictions follow you so you are subject to step-two restrictions when in regional Victoria. You should not travel unless you really need to. It is about trying to make sure again we have got as little movement as possible from Melbourne into regional Victoria, because any movement of that nature potentially takes the virus from Melbourne into regional Victoria. I know regional communities have been a very highly motivated to make sure that we limit that movement. That’s why Victoria police really have stepped up their efforts at those checkpoints and, of course, it’s now a couple of weeks old now that we’ve had a much more significant fine, an almost $5,000 on-the-spot fine if you are found in regional Victoria and you do not have a lawful reason to be there. Daniel Andrews then moves on to today’s numbers: This strategy is working. The strategy is delivering us the lower numbers and I think an increased sense of confidence that we are going to be able to continue to take those safe and steady steps. There are 10 new cases. Three are linked to known outbreaks and complex cases. Seven are under investigation. One was reclassified. There have now been – I’m sad to report – 794 deaths due to this global pandemic. Seven since my last report. One male in their 60s, one male in their 70s, one female and two males if their 80s, one female and one male in their 90s. Six of those seven deaths are linked to aged care. We send our condolences and best wishes, our deepest sympathies, to each of those seven families. There are 46 Victorians in hospital, five of those are receiving intensive care. Four of those five are on a ventilator. The total of 2,677,022 test results have been received, which is an increase of 8,226 since yesterday. That is a solid number. But, of course, we again take this opportunity just to urge any Victorian, any symptoms – whatsoever – don’t wait till tomorrow. Don’t wait till this afternoon. Please go and get tested as soon as you can. It’s only then that we get the most complete picture so that we can take those steps with the certainty that needs to sit behind them. And, of course, we thank those 8,226 Victorians who got tested a bit over 24 hours ago. It is a really important part of our response. The Victorian premier has paid tribute to police who have lost their lives in the line of duty, including Lynette Taylor, Kevin King, Glen Humphris and Joshua Prestney, who were killed while impounding a Porsche in April: As the premier of the state, can I say to you that my thoughts and prayers will be with their families today and with every police member and every police family on what will be a very challenging Police Remembrance Day. To live your life in the service and protection of others is an amazing thing. To lose your life doing that work is a terrible tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers and best wishes are with every police member and every police family today. The head of Australia’s Covid-19 commission, Nev Power, is still being paid director’s fees by the gas company Strike Energy, the government has confirmed. The National Covid-19 Commission, which was set up to guide Australia’s economic recovery, has pushed for additional government support of the gas sector. In May it was reported that Power, a former Fortescue Metals chief, had stepped back from his role as deputy chairman at Strike Energy to avoid any perceived conflict in his role as NCC chair. In June Power was questioned by the Covid-19 Senate inquiry about whether he was still receiving director’s fees from Strike Energy. He said at the time that he wasn’t sure but probably was. A response to a question on notice published last week confirmed that Power is, in fact, still receiving the fees. The confirmation has prompted criticism from the environmental activist group 350.org. Its chief executive, Lucy Manne, said this further highlighted the problems surrounding the lack of accountability and transparency within the NCC. “Mr Power is still receiving remuneration from Strike Energy, a gas company with interests in the Perth and Cooper basins – two of the basins that Scott Morrison named as priority basins he hopes to unlock,” Manne said. “This doesn’t pass the pub test.” An NCC spokesman referred Guardian Australia to previous comments made by Power during the June inquiry hearings, when he said he had taken the role at the request of the prime minister to help through the crisis. “When I took the role on, it was not intended that I step back from any of my other interests,” Power said at the time. “This was to be purely an advisory role; we are not decision makers and therefore there was no requirement for me to curtail any of my business activities. I don’t believe there are any areas where I have breached any public interest or conflict-of-interest rules, but there have been perceptions of it raised, so, as a result of that, I elected to stand down from those two boards – I still retain my role on the two not-for-profit boards – and to step back from my private business affairs on anything that could be perceived as a conflict.” Power has also not attended a board meeting of Strike Energy since joining the NCC. Board meeting minutes from May also note that Power had advised Strike Energy it was not appropriate for him to “vote on any operational or strategic matters at Strike Energy which could give rise to perceptions of a conflict of interest”. Yesterday, the social services minister Anne Ruston refused to guarantee that the unemployment benefit, now known as jobseeker, wouldn’t return to the old rate of $40 a day, when the Covid supplement expired completely on 31 December. Ruston told the ABC: We are very focused on the here and now. We remain focused on the here and now because I don’t have a crystal ball. I don’t know when this pandemic and the impacts of this pandemic on the job market are going to stabilise. I don’t know what Australia’s economy is going to look like post the end of this year. That’s why remain focused on dealing with the here and now. It is a matter for another day when we have some idea what the post-Covid world in Australia will look like. Linda Burney said that wasn’t good enough: With 400,000 Australians expected to lose their jobs by the end of the year – and with 13 jobseekers for every job vacancy – it is going to be a very uncertain and anxious Christmas. Australians doing it tough don’t know what support will be available to them after Christmas, when they face yet another cut. The minister could end this uncertainty by delivering a permanent increase to jobseeker in the budget. It’s 10.30am for Daniel Andrews today. The ABS has put out the latest on Australia’s international trade. You can find that here. But the headline statistics are: The balance on goods and services surplus fell $3,542m to $4,607m. Goods and services credits fell $1,604m (4%) to $34,496m. Goods and services debits rose $1,939m (7%) to $29,890m. Greg Hunt was on the Nine Network this morning, where he was laying out the government’s case to stop the Patrick Terminal’s planned strike action. Q: First up, this port dispute threatening the nation’s medical supplies, the unions say it’s not a concern. Is it a worry for you? Hunt: Yes, it is. We’ve been working with the medical companies and they’ve reported that it is a clear risk to the supply of important medicines in Australia. I need to say, it’s not an immediate risk, but if this goes on for any period of time then we will see potential shortages and that’s been provided to us by a range of different medical companies. Q: It’s tough to see how this is resolved any time soon. Hunt: Well, I think the- those that are doing the go-slow need to realise that whether it’s our farmers and the export of their extraordinarily valuable crops after drought, after difficult times, it’s just so fundamental to the health of their communities and the health of their communities and the economic health of Australia and then on the incoming side, medicines which are vital for the health of Australians are being delayed. There’s no question about that. That’s not at issue. And that could pose very shortly a real risk to Australians. So at the moment, the supplies are already here, but the new supplies that we need are sitting in ships offshore. Q: The Maritime Union absolutely vehemently denies that, they say they haven’t prevented a single tablet from getting through to the ports. Are they wrong? Or are you? Hunt: They’re wrong. No, they’re wrong. We’ve had the medical companies state clearly publicly, absolutely, that that’s the case. We’ve had a meeting of what’s called the Medicines Shortage of Working Group with the Therapy Goods Administration and there are delays. There are risks and there are consequences and I would respectfully say to those in the union that are denying that there are risks to medicines, the advice they have is false, incorrect and untrue. Labor’s shadow minister for ageing and seniors Julie Collins has responded to the latest reports about the aged care regulator: Damning new figures have revealed more than 2,000 complaints in just three months led to no fines or warnings from the Morrison government’s aged care regulator. These shocking figures lay bare the complete failure of the Morrison government’s regulator to ensure Australia’s aged care homes were safe from Covid-19. It is difficult to believe so little was done to follow-up the concerns of residents, families and loved ones in the middle of a deadly global pandemic. Despite the terrible stories from overseas, which exposed how vulnerable aged care homes were to Covid-19 outbreaks, the Morrison government’s regulator failed to act. How did anyone think it was acceptable that more than 2,000 complaints in just three months led to no action against aged care homes? This must prompt real action from the Morrison government to fix the aged care regulator. Western Australian authorities are pondering what to do with the Patricia Oldendorff cases. The ship is just off WA’s north coast and so far 17 crew members have tested positive for Covid. A dozen of those people are in quarantine in Port Hedland. Essential crew have stayed on board, but at least seven of the nine people on board have tested positive. Roger Cook had a chat to ABC News Breakfast about it this morning: It’s a very tricky situation. ... My main anxieties are really around the crew that are still on board the ship.” Under maritime law, at least 13 people have to be aboard the ship when it leaves for international waters. There also needs to be a cook and clean crew aboard while people are still in quarantine, to help with the maintenance. WA authorities are looking at how they can deep clean the ship while people are still aboard, given the presence of Covid. The ship, carrying 20 Filipino nationals and the captain, has been anchored nine nautical miles off WA’s north-west coast since 16 September. WA’s Department of Health has said all crew members are in good spirits and have been able to contact their families. Security personnel have been flown in to help local police oversee the hotel quarantine and locals have been assured there is no risk to the community. It is National Police Remembrance Day. The NT News reports that Sydney could be removed from the territory’s hotspot list next week. Queensland will review its hotspot list at the end of the month, although so far as indicated Sydney residents will remain barred from entry (northern NSW residents will be allowed in from 1am on 1 October). The rolling 14-day average for metro Melbourne is now 18.2. For regional Victoria, it is 0.6. In total, there have been 264 cases of Covid diagnosed in Victoria in the last 14 days, for an average of 18.9 cases per day. Mystery cases are down to 27 in the last 14 days. Double yesterday’s number of five, but testing numbers should be up. Seven deaths is another tragedy. There will be more attention on the aged care regulator today – and the minister – with people once again looking at the number of compliance checks the regulator has made, during the pandemic. As Labor’s Julie Collins stated late last week, the regulator had visited just one in six aged care homes to check whether infection control practices were being implemented in the wake of Victoria’s outbreak. The latest publicly available figures reveal just 448 aged care homes nationally have been visited by the Morrison government’s aged care regulator to check compliance with PPE and infection control arrangements,” Collins said last week. In some states less than 5% of aged care homes have been visited to check infection practises and ensure safe use of personal protection equipment was being observed. Even in Victoria just 160 visits, representing only 20% of aged care homes in the state, have taken place. 627 people diagnosed with Covid, linked to aged care, have died in Victoria. Helen Sullivan has all your international Covid news. Monash University has surveyed Australians about their Covid testing habits – and well, it might help explain why testing numbers are down. As AAP reports: Only a quarter of Australians with cold or flu-like symptoms are getting tested for coronavirus, according to a Monash University survey. More than a third spent time in public while unwell. The latest results of the Survey of Covid-19 Responses to Understand Behaviour, released on Tuesday, found 27% of people with symptoms were tested for the virus. The result is up from 15% in a previous survey. A fifth of those with Covid-19 symptoms said they didn’t go for testing because they did not think they had the virus. More than a third spent time in public while symptomatic and one in five went to work. But 81% of those surveyed said they always follow Covid-19 rules and regulations. Compliance with handwashing, wearing face masks and keeping a physical distance from people outside of home, either stayed the same or increased on the previous survey. Thrive by Five, an initiative of the Minderoo Foundation which aims to improve early learning outcomes for children, has released its budget wish list: • Ensuring all families receive assistance of at least 30% of childcare costs, with the long-term goal of universal access to high quality early learning for all Australian children • Increase the childcare subsidy for families and carers whose incomes have been reduced due to Covid-19 • Expand the jobtrainer program to provide free or low-cost Tafe and VET courses in early childhood education and care, and • Calling on the prime minister to urgently convene a national roundtable on the early childhood education and care workforce, including a discussion of the immediate ways to support educator jobs and long-term workforce planning. The Heart Foundation is once again pleading with people to go have their regular heart health checks, as AAP reports: Around half a million Australians with heart disease have skipped critical check-ups during the Covid-19 pandemic, putting them at risk of a heart attack or stroke. While heart disease remains the nation’s single biggest killer, it’s fallen off the radar for many Australians, the Heart Foundation says. Its survey of more than 5,000 Australian adults, released on World Heart Day on Tuesday, found people with heart disease, or at high risk of heart disease, were more likely to have missed or delayed an appointment with their GP between April and August than other Australians (27% versus 17%). With 2.1 million Australians living with heart disease or at high risk of heart disease, the Heart Foundation has calculated more than 500,000 of them have skipped potentially life-saving check-ups during the pandemic. About one-in-five people at highest risk said they were unlikely to attend future appointments with their GP because of concerns about Covid-19. People with heart disease are more vulnerable to severe complications if infected with Covid-19. Heart Foundation general manager of heart health, Bill Stavreski, urged Australians not to let the Covid-19 “fear factor” stop them from getting check-ups. “Heart disease doesn’t stop during a pandemic,” Stavreski said. “It is vital that you continue to monitor your heart health and stay in contact with your GP, and there are options to do this safely via telehealth or in person.” Restrictions were lifted in most states and territories in August but about 30% of people surveyed with heart disease were still avoiding GP appointments. There had also been a drop-off in people speaking to doctors about risk factors compared with pre-Covid-19 levels. The biggest dip was in people discussing their blood pressure or cholesterol with their GP, despite 6.2 million Australians having high blood pressure and 7.1 having high cholesterol. Labor’s Tim Watts has seen the government’s latest budget announcement. This comes after Anne Ruston re-announced domestic violence funding yesterday. Victorian MP David Davis wants an inquiry into the government’s omnibus emergency measures bill. From his statement: These new authorised officers will have wide and largely unchecked powers of arrest and detention under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act. Respected lawyers and former judges have expressed concern about the bill’s untrammelled powers. The Bar Council has expressed concerns about the omnibus bill. I have written to the chair of the scrutiny of acts and regulations committee demanding the committee hold public hearings and a full inquiry in the two weeks that remain before the bill is dealt with in the upper house. Labor forced it through the lower house without the views of Sarc or indeed any proper examination of the bill’s serious infringements of rights and privileges. Apparently “ostensibly to empty his Vatican apartment” is an approved reason to leave the country during the border ban. Speaking of budget announcements, the government wants your face. As Daniel Hurst reports: The Morrison government will expand the use of digital identity checks when businesses and individuals access services online, as part of an $800m package in next week’s budget to increase the take-up of new technologies. As the government puts the finishing touches on its delayed budget, which is expected to foreshadow a deficit north of $200bn and ongoing high unemployment, the Coalition is rolling out a series of announcements that it says are designed to get the economy moving again. But the government is coming under pressure for reducing the rate of jobkeeper and jobseeker payments over the past few days, with Labor accusing Scott Morrison of “mishandling this worst recession in almost a century” by cutting economic support “without a proper jobs plan to replace it”. The biggest chunk of new funding in the “digital business plan” to be announced on Tuesday is $420m towards ensuring businesses can “quickly view, update and maintain their business registry data in one location”. I mean, what on earth could go wrong? It isn’t like the government has access to mass surveillance systems and has put a bunch of bills through the parliament to be able to bypass the courts to access your data already. I’m sure it’s fine. Western Australia recorded more new cases of Covid than Victoria yesterday, as it took in crew members from a bulk carrier ship anchored off its north coast, who have been stricken with the virus. There are now 17 members of the Patricia Oldendorff who have been diagnosed with Covid, with the crew now quarantined in Port Hedland. It’s the first time in yonks (official scientific time measurement) WA has dealt with Covid, which is why there are a lot of interested eyes on the west at the moment. Meanwhile, NSW has seen it’s case numbers drop, reporting no cases for two consecutive days. But testing rates have also dropped, which has authorities worried. The clock is still ticking on the incubation period for possible infections from a taxi driver who (unknowingly) worked while infectious himself with Covid. So if you are in NSW and you have a sniffle or any other symptom: get tested. In Victoria, Daniel Andrews will hold his 89th consecutive press conference, where the topic will no doubt be this: And in Queensland, the election campaign continues. The federal government meanwhile, is all about the federal budget. Yesterday had the re-announcement of domestic violence funding. Who knows what today could bring. We’ll bring you all of it though, as it happens. You have Amy Remeikis with you for most of the day. As always you can reach me here and here and can drop me a line with any questions, complaints, commiserations etc. Ready? Let’s get into it."

          "headline": "Dear Gavin Williamson, here's how to avoid more exam catastrophes",
          "bodyText": "I would guess that like the rest of us when we emerge from a nightmare experience, you’ve been hiding under your pillow. Sorry to remind you, I’m thinking of the algorithm catastrophe. But here we are again: the new school year is under way and, as predicted, many schools are unable to provide full education for all pupils all the time because of the pandemic. Schooling is being disrupted. You and the Department for Education must know that the next round of exams could easily descend into chaos again unless you put a plan in place now. Well, more than that, actually: a plan that involves researchers, teachers and parents as well as the crew of “advisers” you usually turn to behind closed doors. Apart from breaking with a decade of habit of not involving the people who actually work in education to come up with a plan, the simplest and easiest thing to do with GCSEs would be to suspend or abolish them. You could fix things not only for this year’s candidates, but for those in future years. As more and more people are saying, educationally it would be much better to replace GCSEs with a mixture of assessments. This moment could be a great opportunity to break the thrall that a national exam has over the first five years of secondary education. It still needs to be said that these one-off, end-of-course, do-or-die exams do not fully reflect what students can do and are much better at proving what students don’t know. The idea of late has been to create exams that are so difficult, they guarantee what is regarded as the necessary and expected failure rate. We know one reason for this: the worship of the bell curve into which all results and “levels” must fit – so-called norm-referencing, whereby only a certain number of students can be allowed to succeed. As a parent of children in the state sector, I’ve yearned for my offspring to have had the broader-based assessments that the private sector has managed to squeeze in. This was on show for all to see in a recent Observer story. It must have felt like an “et tu, Brute” moment for your government, since some of your beloved private schools, including Eton and St Paul’s girls’ school, in tandem with some academy chains, are taking matters into their own hands. They are saying, in effect: “We can do a better job of this assessment business than you.” Various proposals are surfacing: invigilating using Zoom; networks of schools moderating coursework; research projects supplementing exams; high-quality year-long record keeping; pupils’ presentations to their peers. Various thinktanks and organisations – Rethinking Assessments, the Big Education Trust, Inspiring Futures – have either worked on this before, or are moving ahead with proposals. The argument that exams are counter-productive in creating the kind of education we need is no longer a matter of chat between mavericks holed up in universities and sections of the teaching unions. The idea that 16-year-olds in a system that educates everyone to 18 should be put through a nationwide, high-stakes, competitive exam is under fire. Even your forerunner as education secretary, Kenneth Baker, whose inclination in post was to nationalise school students’ minds, has joined the resistance. Needless to say, your department’s response, presumably with your approval, has been to concede nothing: “We expect exams to take place next year and are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach.” Presumably that’s because it was such a great success last time. Yours, Michael Rosen"

          "bodyText": "When an airline no longer wants a plane, it is sent away to a boneyard, a storage facility where it sits outdoors on a paved lot, wingtip to wingtip with other unwanted planes. From the air, the planes look like the bleached remains of some long-forgotten skeleton. Europe’s biggest boneyard is built on the site of a late-30s airfield in Teruel, in eastern Spain, where the dry climate is kind to metallic airframes. Many planes are here for short-term storage, biding their time while they change owners or undergo maintenance. If their future is less clear, they enter long-term storage. Sometimes a plane’s limbo ends when it is taken apart, its body rendered efficiently down into spare parts and recycled metal. In February, Patrick Lecer, the CEO of Tarmac Aerosave, the company that owns the Teruel boneyard and three others in France, had one eye cocked towards China. Lecer has been in aviation long enough to remember flights being grounded during the Sars epidemic in 2003. This year, when the coronavirus spread beyond Asia, he knew what was coming. “We started making space in our sites, playing Tetris with the aircraft to free up two or three or four more spaces in each,” he told me. By late March, after the US shut its skies to Europe, planes began streaming into Tarmac Aerosave’s boneyards. No one knew if they were going into short-term residency or long-term storage. On one day alone, 3 April, the Teruel boneyard received five Boeing 747s and two Boeing 777s. Throughout the next few weeks, planes arrived from Lufthansa, Air France, Etihad and British Airways. Before the pandemic, there were 78 aircraft at Teruel. By June, there were 114, running near the full capacity of 120-130. Patrick Lecer’s other three boneyards were also “close to saturation”, he told me in July. He sounded grave. He had just spent two hours on the phone with an airline that wanted him to house another 30 planes. “I’ve been in this business almost 40 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this. The mood is bad. It feels like a tragedy.” * * * Among all the industries hit by Covid-19, aviation suffered in two distinct ways. Most obviously, there was the fear of contagion. No other business depends on putting you into knee-by-thigh proximity with strangers for hours, while whisking potentially diseased humans from one continent to another. Less directly, there was the tumbling economy. It is an axiom in aviation that air travel correlates to GDP. When people have more money, they fly more. But in the midst of this historic downturn, no one was buying plane tickets. In the past, airlines have only been stung by one or the other of these factors. During Sars, travel was unsafe, but the global economy didn’t flatline. During the 2008 financial crash, money was tight, but flying was not a health risk. In the 110 years since the dawn of commercial flight, these blows had never been dealt in tandem, until this year. To customers, investors and airlines, an earthbound existence was unimaginable before the coronavirus. For commercial aviation, the past two decades have been a period of superheated growth. In 1998, airlines sold 1.46bn tickets for one kind of flight or another. By 2019, that number had shot up to 4.54bn. This year has undone it all. Early in March, the International Air Transport Association (Iata) published two potential scenarios. The more extreme one forecast a global loss of revenue of $113bn. By mid-April, about 14,400 passenger planes around the world – 65% of the global fleet – had been placed into storage, according to the aviation research firm Cirium. Companies that have been brought to the brink, or in some cases collapsed entirely, include Virgin Australia and Virgin Atlantic, Flybe in the UK, South African Airways, LATAM and Avianca in South America, Compass and Trans States in the US. Airlines for America, a trade group, calculated that the last time the US averaged fewer than 100,000 daily passengers was in 1954. Emirates became so desperate for passengers that it promised to shell out $1,765 for a funeral if anyone died of Covid-19 after flying with them. By June, Iata had to issue a revision: Revenues will fall by $419bn this year, precisely half of what airlines earned in 2019. These numbers are scarcely credible, even to industry veterans. Boet Kreiken, the executive vice-president for customer experience at the Dutch carrier KLM, recalled a meeting early in the pandemic, in KLM’s offices near Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. His colleagues had brought in the latest figures for new bookings and the dismal projections for the summer ahead. “I’ve seen some crises in my time – the Iraq war, 9/11, Sars, the Icelandic volcano eruption,” Kreiken said. “I know in the gut what that feels like. But this was something else. I was staring at the chart and got so involved in thinking about the consequences that the others had to tell me twice: ‘Boet, start the meeting!’” Prior to the pandemic, airlines had been wrestling with a different motivation against flying. Aviation accounts for 12% of all carbon dioxide emissions from transport, and flying is so cheap and easy that we can add unthinkingly to that gush of carbon in the seconds it takes to book a ticket on an app. London to New York and back creates 986kg of carbon dioxide – more than the average person in Madagascar or Nicaragua generates in a year. Last year, KLM unveiled an initiative that sounded like a plea for less business. “Do you always need to meet face to face? Could you take the train instead?” a voiceover in an advert asked. “We all have to fly every now and then. But next time, think about flying responsibly.” (“There was a little bit of bravery in that,” a KLM executive told me. “It had to be pitched to the board three times before they approved it.”) The ad, bold as it was, also fit a broader pattern. As ever, individuals are being requested to tame their habits of consumption, even while governments and large corporations do far less than they might to curb their expenditure of carbon. At the same time, we’re assured by airline companies that our self-restraint has to be only temporary, and that some technological salvation – a plane running on batteries or hydrogen – will let us return to our habits very soon. This year, as the industry’s fortunes tumbled, and as executives attempted to run their airlines even while most of their planes stayed on the ground, a different kind of technological salvationalism emerged. The future of flight now appears to be pinned on the discovery of a successful Covid-19 vaccine. The important problem of how much we ought to be flying gave way to the even more basic uncertainty of when and in what fashion we will ever fly regularly again at all. * * * KLM calls itself the world’s oldest commercial airline, by which it means it’s the oldest airline still operating under its original name. Last October, KLM turned 100, and Pieter Elbers, its CEO, was feeling cheerful. Elbers joined the airline in 1992, when he was 22, and worked all over the world before reaching the top in 2014. He told me that KLM’s profit margin for that year was a slender 2%. “From that, we moved to 8% last year, so there was a really positive, upbeat atmosphere.” By December 2019, he’d flown to so many KLM offices around the world to celebrate the centenary that he decided to spend New Year’s Eve at home in Amsterdam. A couple of weeks later, when KLM’s partner airlines in China began suspending operations, Elbers heard the first murmurs about a strange new virus. Figuring that China would soon contain the disease, Elbers and his team cut down the frequency of KLM’s flights to China, reallocating those planes to US routes instead. By February, though, the pandemic had spread to Europe; by March, the Netherlands had locked down. At the KLM offices, only Elbers and half a dozen executives continued to come in to work, to wrestle with the crisis. Elbers left home at 6.30am every day and drove half an hour on vacant roads. “Everyone sat in my office, since it’s spacious enough to still be able to keep a good distance from each other.” Sometimes he would wander over to Schiphol and gaze at the slumbering planes and the desolate terminal. The airline industry’s metabolism is ordinarily slow – planes ordered years in advance, routes plotted and pilots trained with measured care. During the pandemic, though, decisions had to be made with uncommon speed. Late in March, for instance, a KLM flight somewhere above Novosibirsk, bearing towards Shanghai, was told that every incoming flight crew now had to quarantine for 14 days in a Chinese state hospital. This rule was so new that it hadn’t existed when the plane left Amsterdam; circumstances had changed mid flight. Executives scrambled to get an approved exemption from Dutch and Chinese authorities so that the crew could stay aboard the plane in Shanghai and bring it home 18 hours later. The same month, Elbers retired three Boeing 747s – huge, fuel-guzzling craft that were on the verge of being put out to pasture anyway. Mere weeks later, they had to be hastily pulled out of storage and pressed into service to ferry medical equipment and PPE from China to the Netherlands. There were complicated repatriation flights to be flown. Two thousand Dutch travellers had to be retrieved from Australia. The first repatriation flight to Sydney had to leave with 48 hours’ notice, but it had been 20 years since KLM had flown there – so long that the routes and permits had to be plotted afresh and reloaded into flight computers. Usually, airline representatives convene at “slot conferences” twice a year, to divvy up landing and takeoff slots in airports around the world for the season ahead, said Vincent van Hooff, who oversees KLM’s flight operations. “We are not in the ad-hoc business. But now it was a totally new game. Would we still be flying to London tomorrow? Would we need more slots for repatriation flights? It was almost as if we had suddenly become a charter company.” * * * Amid this mayhem, the pandemic’s effects upon aviation seemed sudden and tectonic. Richard Aboulafia has an alternate view: “Nothing new is happening. It’s just happening faster.” Aboulafia is the vice-president of analysis at Teal Group, an aviation market research firm, and every month he sends out a chatty newsletter that is widely read in the industry. “Dear Fellow Dark Cloud Dwellers,” he wrote in May, peering ahead at the contours of a post-Covid industry. Airlines will hoard cash, he predicted. They will choose smaller, more efficient planes. They will fly more point-to-point routes, leaving behind the old hub-and-spoke networks – the kind that require us to fly from one town to another in a minimum of two legs, via a “hub” airport in a major metropolis. But these changes were under way even last year, he argued. The coronavirus has only made them seem more practical still. One way to understand these trends, Aboulafia told me, is through the industry’s most beloved metric: the seat mile. If a plane with 300 available seats flies 1,000 miles, that flight clocks up 300,000 seat miles. Airlines are constantly comparing revenue per available seat mile, or Rasm, with cost per available seat mile, or Casm. Aboulafia, pronouncing these terms as “razzum” and “cazzum”, said: “As long as razzum is a nose above cazzum, you’re happy.” In the 70s and the 80s, barring a couple of price spikes, aviation fuel – Jet A-1, as the industry calls it – was cheap. As a result, the industry’s ideas for keeping razzum above cazzum didn’t need to dwell too heavily on the cost of fuel. Instead, airlines pursued their beloved hub-and-spoke model – their elaborate networks that offered journeys only in multiple legs. To cultivate an airport as a hub, an airline booked out most of its landing and takeoff slots, so that it could corner the market on flights serving the surrounding area. After Delta developed the Atlanta airport as a hub, for instance, a customer found it more expensive to fly into the region on any other carrier. In the hub-and-spoke model, passengers flowed thickly from one hub to another, before dispersing in thinner streams to their eventual destinations. To make these hub-to-hub flights, airlines ordered wide-body planes such as the 747, intending to stuff them with up to 500 passengers each. These planes consumed enormous quantities of fuel, and airlines then burned more still by shuttling their passengers from hubs to smaller airports. But the cost of Jet A-1 was so low that it almost didn’t matter. Besides, no matter which plane you flew, the takeoff phase always burned through Jet A-1 the quickest. The most fuel-efficient stage of flight came at cruising altitude, tens of thousands of feet in the air. It seemed to make sense, then, to put as many people as possible into a single takeoff and to then keep them up in the air for as long as possible. The hitch was, though, that airlines couldn’t always pack these massive aircraft to capacity, and they engaged in such ruinous price wars to fill their seats that Rasm suffered. A 2007 book by Adam Pilarski, once the chief economist for the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell-Douglas, carried the plaintive title Why Can’t We Make Money in Aviation? Beginning in the 90s, and continuing well into this century, the price of fuel rose steadily, forcing airlines to re-examine their extravagance with Jet A-1. In 1989, a barrel of oil had cost $10, but in 2008, the price hit $147. In the uncertain years after 9/11, many airlines watched their passenger volumes flag, even as they kept having to pay for the new planes they had ordered years earlier. Ordinarily, airlines might have responded by raising ticket prices – except that, as the industry was fast deregulating everywhere, low-cost carriers emerged as fierce competition. These carriers shrank the cost of flying by doing away with frills such as meals and legroom. “That revolution was brutal,” Aboulafia said. “You couldn’t conduct business as usual.” The hub-and-spoke model appeared to be fading as well. Every city was building itself a decent airport, and people didn’t want to waste their time with layovers and connecting flights. Keeping Casm lower than Rasm needed a fresh approach. Chief among these was to blow less money on Jet A-1. Airlines typically enhance their fuel efficiency by 1%-2% a year, and often these gains are won by tinkering around the edges: lighter seats, less water in the bathroom tanks. In 2017, when United Airlines reduced the weight of its paper in its inflight magazine, it saved nearly 770,000 litres of fuel a year – or $290,000 in costs. Aboulafia told me that, a decade or so ago, many airlines adopted power-washing, which reduces the drag on a plane by stripping it of greater quantities of oil, grime and bug corpses than an ordinary lather could ever do. Separately, several airlines started playing the futures market in fuel, to hedge against sharp price hikes. Delta bought a whole oil refinery near Philadelphia. But the true leaps in efficiency were achieved by new craft, which airlines began to request from manufacturers in the early 00s. The Boeing 787, for example, claims to burn 20% less fuel than its older sibling, the 767. Van Hooff recalled how, when KLM inducted its first 787 into its fleet in 2015, a pilot accustomed to the 747 was appointed to fly it to Dubai. “The 747 is beautiful, but it burns around 11,000 kilos of fuel per hour on a trip like this, so he was used to seeing around 100,000 kilos on his storage gauge when he got into the cockpit,” Van Hooff said. “This time, he saw 50,000. He put in a call to dispatch to ask: ‘Are you really sure this is enough?’ Of course, he knew it was. But he couldn’t get past his gut feeling that he needed more fuel.” Airlines put the 787 and other new planes on to point-to-point routes, slicing the hub out of the hub-and-spoke networks. More and more, Aboulafia said, carriers are buying smaller, single-aisle planes for these direct flights, and shedding their old, large craft. Even before the pandemic, Emirates had already decided not to buy any more Airbus A380s, a plane that costs $500m and can carry up to 868 people – a plane so big that airports have to redo their tarmac and their gates to accommodate it. In July, British Airways decided to retire the 31 Boeing 747s left in its fleet. Tickets stayed cheap, though, and not just because of the competition from low-cost airlines. Peter Morris, who was once Iata’s chief economist, told me that back in 1995, 25% of the cost of a ticket actually went into producing and selling it: courting travel agents, paying out commissions, printing tickets securely. The internet did away with that, replacing it with attritional algorithm battles. Automated web crawlers alert an airline many times a day if a rival drops its price on a route, so that analysts can decide if their airline can afford to do the same. Boet Kreiken, who once worked for the Dutch Air Force, called the price game “mutually assured destruction”. This is among the reasons, people in the industry kept claiming, that airlines hardly make any money. Morris has no time for these “weepy stories with violin accompaniment that airlines tell”. “The truth is, over the last few years, the airline industry has never been so profitable.” Carriers have pruned their expenses so much, and convinced so many people to fly so often that, despite low prices, Rasm has steadily surpassed Casm. As of last December, the global airline industry had been in the black for 11 straight years. Cheap ticket prices, in fact, are central to an illusion fostered by the airline industry over the past 20 years. The illusion is that the money we pay for a ticket covers the cost of flight in a deeper sense – the cost of transporting us through the air, but also the cost exacted from the environment – and that the booking of a £42 return flight for a stag weekend in Bratislava isn’t worth more than a casual thought. The irony about KLM’s advertisement last year to “Fly Responsibly” is that it came after years of the industry exhorting us to fly irresponsibly. “Do you always need to meet face to face?” the ad chided us gently, as if airlines hadn’t worked to plant in us the belief that face time – to pitch a client, or to lunch with colleagues – was both optimum and trivially inexpensive. Then the coronavirus arrived, the prospect of face-to-face meetings evaporated, and for the first time in decades, flying became a luxury once again. * * * In the depths of the flying freeze, in late April, 166 of KLM’s 204 planes were grounded. Instead of taking them to boneyards, KLM decided to keep them all at Schiphol – pulled up to the departure gates, or parked wing-to-wing in a zigzag pattern on one runway, after steel plates had been laid down so that the combined weight of the aircraft didn’t damage the tarmac. Airplane storage is a funny, delicate affair. The saying “time is money” is so emphatically true in aviation that even planes in long-term storage must be kept as close to airworthy as possible, so that they can bolt into the air to continue earning back their massive price tags. On a video call one August morning, Ton Dortmans, KLM’s head of engineering and maintenance, explained what his team had to do to bed their planes down through the spring and summer. Fuel tanks were emptied, although not entirely: “You still need some weight in the plane, for the bursting wind we get here in Amsterdam.” For the same reason, the blades of the engine fans were locked into place with straps, so that, on gusty days, they didn’t whirl around endlessly and wear their parts out. The water tanks were drained. Engineers 3D-printed covers to place over the small holes on the plane’s surface, which conceal sensors that measure air pressure and altitude. The covers protected them from moisture and insects. Every seven days, someone would climb into the plane and run the engines for 15 minutes to keep them functional. The air conditioning was switched on to keep the humidity at bay. “And the tyres – well, it’s the same as a car. If you keep a car parked for more than a month, you get flat tires,” Dortmans said. So a tug pulled the plane forward and back every month, to keep the wheels and axles in shape. Still, there were some surprises. In the absence of the roar of jets, birds began to appear around Schiphol again, and one day, a ground engineer told Dortmans that he’d found a bird starting to nest in a cavity in the auxiliary power unit. “I’m hearing all these birds and now I find this,” he told Dortmans. “It feels like I’m out in the woods.” Pilots couldn’t be put away in storage in quite the same way. KLM has 3,000 of them, all of whom must fly a minimum number of hours and perform three takeoffs and three landings every 90 days to stay “current” – to still be allowed to pilot a plane. During the lockdown, the pilots on the ground had to retain their currency by rotating through KLM’s nine simulators. From the outside, these simulators look like motorcycle helmets for giants, and a pilot, having climbed into one and closed the hatch, can be put through a pretty immersive rehearsal for flight. The summer slipped by. At some point, a number of pilots had spent six months without going up. Van Hooff resolved that whenever they flew next, they had to do so alongside a trained flight instructor. Flying was its own challenge, because all manner of routine vanished. Week to week, pilots saw their routes and aircraft change, and they touched down into an ever-shifting matrix of rules and norms. US regulations were so inconsistent – which states demanded masks, which states permitted crew members to leave the hotel, which states required them to keep to their rooms – that van Hooff put a team to work just to update these restrictions multiple times a day, and to feed the information up to the planes vaulting over the Atlantic. A source at another European airline, who asked to remain anonymous, told me that after one flight to New York at the peak of its cycle of infection, the plane’s crew felt uncomfortable heading to a city hotel for the night. Instead, they slept in the business-class cabin. A tide of cancellations rolled in. Passenger numbers dropped by 95%, from 9 million in the first quarter of the year to 500,000 in the second. To field complaints and to issue vouchers and consolations, KLM put 800 of its employees on temporary customer-care duties, which they performed from their bedrooms or living rooms. In Manila and in Santiago, call centres were vacated during lockdowns. The staff took their computers home and responded to calls from there. “It was double trouble, triple trouble,” Boet Kreiken, the customer-experience chief at KLM, said. Late in July, Elbers announced that KLM had lost a record €800m in the first half of the year. The airline received a bailout from the Dutch state: €1bn in direct loans, and another €2.4bn in bank loans guaranteed by the government, all with firm strings attached. Costs had to be cut; new environmental conditions had to be met; the airline had to be restructured. Elbers sent around a note to his employees, in which he admitted that these conditions were “difficult” and “raw”. By the end of the summer, the KLM group had announced 4,500-5,000 upcoming job cuts, out of its staff of 33,000 – a combination of layoffs, voluntary retirements, and terminations of temporary contracts. The scenario recurred across the industry. American Airlines plans to slash 40,000 jobs from its workforce. British Airways: 12,000 jobs. Qantas: 6,000. Ryanair: 3,250. The industry will incur losses of $84.3bn this year, Iata estimates – and that’s if there’s no fresh spurt of disease. “It’s going to be a marathon, not a sprint,” Elbers keeps warning his colleagues. In his July note to his staff, he offered just one word as KLM’s primary priority: “Survive.” * * * As yet, there has been no comprehensive reckoning of how many tonnes of aviation emissions the pandemic has averted – in part, of course, because the pandemic is still around, and many planes are still grounded. One rough analysis found that the cancellation of 1m flights in March wiped out the equivalent of a month of the UK’s carbon dioxide emissions. In March, I met Andreas Schäfer, a professor of energy and transport at University College London’s Energy Institute. Schäfer thinks about aviation and emissions all day long, and had been planning on giving me a lot of data, but his laptop was lethargic that afternoon. He would make an observation and then have to talk around it, marking time while a PowerPoint or a pdf loaded and supplied him with the necessary numbers. Between 1980 and 2015, Schäfer said, aviation emissions increased by 2.2% annually. This isn’t surprising, he noted, because the boosts in fuel efficiency in recent years notwithstanding, there are just more people flying. How many more? He summoned another document and, five minutes later, said: “Ah, here we go!” In those same 35 years, even as planes were using 2% or 3% less fuel every year, the demand for air transportation grew by 5.4% annually. In that difference lies aviation’s contribution to the climate crisis. “Not only airlines, but even plane manufacturers are nervous about the CO2 issue, and about people’s perception of them,” Schäfer said. In 2013, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the United Nations body that lays down standards for airlines, set new requirements for fuel efficiency and carbon emissions. Three years later, the ICAO adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation. Corsia, as it’s known, aims to reduce international aviation emissions to half their 2005 levels. Airlines also pledged to purchase carbon offsets to atone for any excess growth in emissions beyond 2020. The incremental rewards of a better engine or a leaner seat will not get airlines to these targets, and they know this. Esmée van Veen, a sustainability manager at KLM, said that the airline had begun a climate action plan in 2008 that relies upon fuel efficiency, biofuels and a voluntary carbon-offset programme, which funnels passengers’ offset payments into a reforestation project in Panama. “We’ve stabilised our carbon emissions, and now we’re ready to decrease it,” she said. In 2011, KLM flew its first commercial flight with biokerosene, made from used cooking oil, added into its fuel mix. “It isn’t much. Right now, it’s about 0.2% of all the fuel we use,” she admitted. Van Veen can outline stages of progress that might eventually turn flying into a zero-carbon enterprise, but she’s careful to note that this is an extrapolation – that it depends on new technologies bearing fruit. By 2030, KLM’s planes taking off from the Netherlands will use a fuel mix that’s 14% biofuel and “synthetic” kerosene, reducing both the need to drill for fresh oil and the emissions that the oil industry spews in the process. Synthetic kerosene – fuel concocted in a refinery – is expected to be made partly from carbon dioxide drawn out of the air, so its overall emissions will be up to 80% less than those from Jet A-1, Van Veen said. Over shorter distances, some planes might be hybrids, powered by batteries as well as fuel. And subsequently, by the middle of the next decade, she said, “we expect there will be a hydrogen-propelled aircraft launched in Europe”. The hydrogen plane is the industry’s recurrent dream, its equivalent of cold fusion or the driverless car. But I also spoke to several people who were sceptical, both of Corsia and of all this nascent green tech. Schäfer thinks Corsia’s targets are timid – that they’ve been set in a way that won’t pinch the industry much. Corsia’s spine is a carbon-offset programme, and offsets are cheap. Brandon Graver, a researcher at the International Council on Clean Transportation, has seen that most of the money from offsets goes into administrative costs, not into actual projects. It’s even doubtful if these projects result in a permanent reduction of carbon, he said. “You hear, ‘Tree planting, tree planting, tree planting’, but only a certain percentage of these trees end up living past a year.” He called offsets “modern-day indulgences”. We pay for our sins to be forgiven, but also for the licence to sin again. The trouble is that the technologies that might usher us into an age of cleaner flight aren’t at hand yet. The volume of biofuel and other alternatives being manufactured is vanishingly small. Graver’s team calculated in 2017 that all the world’s supply would keep the world’s planes in the air for a total of 10 minutes. (Environmental experts worry that biofuels, made out of products such as palm oil, will do more damage than they promise to repair.) If synthetic fuel becomes viable, it will cost more than $3 a gallon at first, Schäfer told me. “Oil is now around $1 a gallon. So why would airlines buy the synthetic stuff?” The battery that’s both small and powerful enough to take a plane across the Atlantic, or from Paris to Perth, is not even on the horizon. In the near term – a timescale that matters enormously to climate change – the only way to decarbonise aviation is to fly less. As an option, that seemed plumb absurd until this year, when we were forced to learn how to live without planes. * * * In the coming years, airlines will be wrenched in two different directions. Their revenues will stay low and wobbly; Iata predicts that passenger numbers will return to pre-pandemic levels only by 2023, but others in the industry grimly cite 2024 or 2025. Simultaneously, many carriers will have to invest in climate change plans, buying offsets or funding research. Already, they’ve had to convince the ICAO to relax some Corsia obligations. In Europe, governments have imposed environmental reforms among the terms for airline bailouts. In return for €7bn, for instance, Air France has committed to halving domestic flight emissions by 2024 and to restricting short-haul flights where trains run instead. In the US, too, the government organised a $25bn aviation bailout, even though the four biggest airlines blew through nearly $40bn in cash over the last five years simply to buy back shares and prop up their stock prices. Here, there were no climate change riders. “Sustainability in the US is marginally more important than keeping enough toner in the fax machine,” Aboulafia told me. But airlines need passengers if they are to repay bailout loans, or mop up their emissions. In both the US and Europe, where growth was already slowing, the prompt and full return of customers isn’t at all a sure thing. This is especially true of business flyers. “Covid gives companies a reason to rethink travel expenses,” said Jeff Pelletier, who runs Airline Data, an analysis firm based in Dallas. Business travellers make up 12%-15% of a plane’s passengers, but they sit up front, so they contribute as much as 75% of a flight’s profits on some routes. “Not every company will cut back,” Pelletier said. “But some will. They’ll figure they’d rather spend a couple of bucks on a Zoom meeting instead.” In Asian countries including China and India – markets that have been growing faster than most others, as flights became increasingly affordable – Dennis Lau expects a quicker rebound. Lau, a Hong Kong-based analyst at Cirium, told me that “climate change is not a part of the industry’s conversation here”. Corsia is, for many governments in the region, one more instance of western nations promoting environmental standards that they have violated for decades, and that will curb the economic development of Asian countries. China, India and Russia have agreed to participate in Corsia only from 2027 onwards. And there’s still considerable doubt about how thoroughly Corsia can be enforced, Lau said. “What will you do if countries just refuse to report their emissions?” During my reporting, I kept being told that eventually the pandemic’s effects would fade – that the world’s economy, having been opened wide by affordable flights, couldn’t be zipped shut again, and that people will get back on planes the second they believe it’s safe to fly again. But in the interim, a period of consolidation is in the offing. More airlines might go out of business, and others will be bought by bigger carriers. Airlines will have smaller fleets, Aboulafia wrote in a newsletter. More planes will be smaller, single-aisle jets flying point to point, because while the coronavirus still lurks, no one wants to spend a longer time than necessary in connecting flights or layover airports. Flying will feel both more austere, in these aseptic and functional flights, and more luxurious, since there will be less of it. In June, KLM’s engineers started to rouse some planes out of their hibernation. They replaced leaking toilet taps, fixed faulty rubber rings and tested the emergency lights. “The second-last thing we do is to check the fire extinguishing systems and the flight controls,” Ton Dortmans, KLM’s engineering chief, told me. “And then the last thing is: we run the engines and put all the systems on again to see if they work – air conditioning, navigation, all of it.” For a brief spell of time, uninhibited travel looked possible again, but then fresh bouts of disease appeared all over the continent. The week I was scheduled to visit KLM in Amsterdam, in mid-August, the UK government announced self-isolation rules for any traveller returning from the Netherlands, so my trip fell through. “You should have been here, to see what we were doing,” Dortmans lamented on our video call. He had been coming up with a fallback scenario for the winter. “It’s a question we have to answer now. If it’s a snowy, hard winter, maybe we have to rethink how our planes are parked here. You have to think about the water and the fuel in the planes, and how they react to freezing temperatures.” If his planes had to be parked for more than 180 days through the winter, Dortmans said, he would think about sending some away. Perhaps to Teruel, or perhaps to the boneyard in California’s Mojave desert, where they will be warmer and drier, and where they can wait to find out if they will be needed again. • This article was amended on 30 September 2020 and 6 October 2020. Airline Data is based in Dallas, not Houston, as previously stated. The size of Air France’s bailout was €7bn, not €15bn; the €15bn figure was the size of the combined bailout from the French government split between a number of companies. A return flight from London to New York generates 986kg of carbon dioxide per passenger, not 1,972kg; and 986kg is more than the per capita emissions in Madagascar (130kg) and Nicaragua (790kg), but not Colombia (1,790kg). • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here"

          "bodyText": "“If you’re reading this book, you probably already know your personal data is being collected, stored and analysed,” Carissa Véliz begins, in Privacy Is Power. Her challenge, as a writer and a privacy advocate, is to shake us out of our complacency; to persuade us to see this not as a necessary sacrifice in the digital age, but an intolerable invasion. From the mounting dread I felt while reading Privacy Is Power, I’d say she was successful. From the moment you wake up and first check your phone, to the marketers that infer your mood from your music choices, to the smart speaker that shares your private conversations, or the television that listens in on them (from the terms and conditions of a Samsung smart TV: “Please be aware that if your spoken words include personal or other sensitive information, that information will be among the data captured”), there is nowhere to hide – or even just be – in this hyper-connected hellscape. Corporations can track you both by your face and your digital footprint, your medical records may be handed over to Big Tech, and advertisers may learn of your break-up before you do. In her book, Véliz, a professor at the Institute for Ethics in AI at Oxford University, often veers into the second person, cleverly underscoring her point: it’s impossible not to picture yourself blindly navigating this horror, then you remember - you already are. Your data may already be being used against you, says Véliz, with far-reaching implications for trust, equality, justice and democracy. “It doesn’t matter if you think you don’t need privacy,” she says. “Your society needs you to have privacy.” Véliz’s introduction to the issue was deeply personal. In 2013, while researching her family history, she uncovered some surprising details about her late grandfather that she could only assume he had not wanted her to find out. “I started wondering whether I had a right to know all these things that my grandparents didn’t tell me.” That same summer, Edward Snowden made history by telling the world about mass surveillance at the NSA. “It was a very personal thing in the beginning,” says Véliz, “then I became very worried about our society, and it became a professional interest.” Privacy Is Power is a slim book on a vast, complex issue, made more powerful by Véliz accepting her limits. (“Facebook has violated our right to privacy so many times that a comprehensive account would merit a book in itself,” she writes.) It is highly readable, clearly laying out a problem that many of us have lost sight of. “When companies collect your data, it doesn’t hurt, you don’t feel the absence, you don’t see it physically,” Véliz says. “We’re having to learn as we have bad experiences.” She writes of a Spanish woman, a victim of identity theft, who has spent years being pulled in and out of police stations and courtrooms for crimes committed in her name. “My life has been ruined,” the woman says, just one among nearly 225,000 such cases recorded in the UK last year alone. Last month, a Detroit man was wrongly arrested on the basis of a facial recognition algorithm. (“I guess the computer got it wrong,” one detective reportedly said.) In Japan last year, a man sexually assaulted a pop star, claiming he had identified her location by analysing reflections in her eyes in photos she had posted online. And Véliz describes a data scientist-in-training being tasked with investigating a stranger, simply for the exercise of it: “He ended up studying in depth some guy in Virginia who, he learned, had diabetes and was having an affair.” The problem is hard to manage even within our civic institutions, who look to tech as the answer to everything, even when it is not fully understood (the exam results fiasco being a recent example). “When somebody says AI is ‘cutting edge’, many times what they are saying is, ‘We haven’t tested it enough to know if it works,’” says Véliz. “It shouldn’t be tested on an entire population without our knowledge, consent or compensation … We’re being treated as guinea pigs.” Privacy is Power is out just as the UK government has launched its new contact-tracing app. Véliz says there is little to suggest it will be effective – and certainly not without accompanying mass testing – because by the time people are alerted that they have come into contact with a confirmed case, they will have already infected others. “The first app was a complete fiasco, and everybody knew it was going to be,” says Véliz. Whether the second is an improvement remains to be seen, but privacy and security risks are a certainty. Imperial College researchers estimate that trackers installed on the phones of just 1% of London’s population could account for the real-time location of more than half the city. As history has shown, it is easier for governments to erode civil liberties at times of social upheaval, and many can’t be trusted with the information they collect; just this month, 18,000 people had personal information published online by mistake by Public Health Wales. “It’s very expensive to get tech right and most governments don’t have the money or expertise… we’re giving very sensitive data to institutions that are not capable of keeping it safe,” says Véliz. “We seem to be not ready for this kind of power.” But misuse of our data is not the only threat to our privacy. Cooperation between public bodies and corporations – such as the border control contract awarded to Palantir, the tech firm assisting the Trump administration to deport migrants from the US; or the UK police’s support of Uber receiving a licence in exchange for its data – should be ongoing cause for concern. “It’s a public institution giving support to tech that might, on the whole, be detrimental to society,” says Véliz. A tech specialist might have been tempted to focus on the whys and hows of our structural surveillance, in doing so (even inadvertently) affirming the need for it. Framed by a philosopher as an ethical question, it is obviously intolerable. “This isn’t publicity: this keeps me up at night,” she says. Still, Véliz is adamant that there is reason to be hopeful. “People didn’t think the GDPR was going to be possible, they thought privacy was dead, it was a thing of the past – and obviously it’s not. I am very optimistic that this level of intrusion is not sustainable.” What she wants is for more people to exercise their agency over how their data is used, both to protect themselves and to send a bigger statement. Even the biggest tech companies depend on people’s cooperation, she points out: “If we look for privacy-friendly alternatives, they will thrive.” She sets out practical steps for taking back control, such as swapping Google for privacy-friendly search engines such as DuckDuckGo, taping over your webcam when it is not in use, asking people for permission before posting about them online, using password managers and VPNs to obscure your IP address, and choosing “dumb” devices over “smart” ones. (Privacy Is Power has convinced me that Amazon Alexa offers no benefit sufficient to justify its sinister presence. Check the forecast yourself.) “It’s a hard thing to do if you do everything, and if you do it perfectly – but you don’t have to do either to make a big difference,” says Véliz. Though regulation remains needed, it is refreshing to see practical solutions for a situation it is hard to not feel powerless about - as well as a reminder that this will continue unless we make it clear it’s unacceptable. “We should be outraged. Companies are very worried about what people think. If people tweet about this, talk about it, choose better products, things can turn around in a matter of very few years,” Véliz says. Disingenuous it may be, but a recent Apple ad trumpeting the importance of privacy is proof that, at least, they know the public is concerned. The first step towards revolution may simply be becoming more aware of how freely you hand over your data, and to whom. Did you need to click “yes” to that cookies pop-up? Should you tell all of Twitter where you are? Does your fridge really need to be connected to the internet? When asked for her email address, Véliz will often give noneofyourbusiness@privacy.com, “to make a point”.

          "headline": "Tory councillors in revolt over plans to accelerate housebuilding",
          "bodyText": "A growing rebellion among Conservative councillors is threatening government plans to accelerate housebuilding in England with six out of 10 believing reforms will make planning less democratic. A survey across Tory heartlands has revealed party representatives are baulking at ministers’ plans to sharply increase housing targets in electoral strongholds like Hampshire and Surrey and are rejecting attempts to cut planning committees out of routine decision-making. Conservative leaders in councils are becoming increasingly vocal in their opposition to the plans which they fear could result in countryside being concreted over for housing and core voters deserting them in disgust. Martin Tett, the Conservative leader of Buckinghamshire council told the Guardian demands for an extra 1,000 homes to be built a year in his country were “undesirable and undeliverable” while John Halsall, leader of Wokingham council said the proposals were “a huge political danger”. An internal presentation from Winchester council seen by the Guardian warns the proposals are “clearly designed to reduce [the] number and type of decisions taken locally”. The concern is reflected in a poll this month by Savanta Comres of Conservative councillors, weighted towards those who sit on planning committees, which found 61% believe proposed reforms announced in August would make planning less democratic. It was carried out on behalf of BECG, a planning communications firm, and showed that 70% of Tory councillors want to increase the size of the greenbelt, which appears to run contrary to government proposals that otherwise unprotected farm and open land could be zoned for construction. Andrew Howard, the firm’s managing director, said: “If the government is going to deliver on its commitment to fundamentally reform the planning system, it is going to have to put in some serious spade work, to win round those Conservative councillors who provide the bedrock of their member of parliament’s constituency association and who clearly value their role in controlling development.” The survey also found that two thirds of all councillors, including Labour, Liberal Democrats, Greens and independents, believe the majority of consultation with the public should happen on a proposal-by-proposal basis rather than when broad local plans are devised, as the planning white paper published last month proposes. The planning reforms were unveiled in August by the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, and immediately drew sharp criticism. Under the proposals, planning applications based on pre-approved “design codes” would get an automatic green light – eliminating a whole stage of local oversight within designated zones. Land across England would be divided into three categories – for growth, renewal or protection – under what Jenrick, described as “once in a generation” changes to sweep away an outdated planning system and boost building. But the proposals were immediately condemned by The Town and Country Planning Association as disruptive and rushed, and described as creating the “the next generation of slum housing” by the president of RIBA, Alan Jones. The government’s parallel proposal to use an algorithm to set new housing targets for local areas in order to meet a national annual housebuilding target of 333,000 new homes has caused widespread concern. Analysis by Lichfields, a planning consultancy, of the proposed method has shown that sharp increases are expected in many Tory heartlands. In Chichester, West Sussex the annual target would rise from 425 to 1,120, in Reigate, Surrey it would rise from 460 to 1,091 while in Tonbridge in Kent it would rise from 425 to 1,440. “If they stick with the algorithm they are using at the moment there will be more building on greenfield and less on brownfield in northern cities and that’s a real concern,” said Cllr David Renard, Conservative leader of Swindon council and planning spokesman for the Local Government Association planning spokesman. “What local government would like to see is numbers based on local needs rather than some algorithm imposing numbers from above. We are hopeful the government will reshape their proposals. The planning system can be improved and we don’t think this is the right way to do it.” The algorithm has proposed cuts to housing targets in many northern areas such as Lancaster, Preston and Blackburn with Darwen. Halsall’s area in Wokingham, Berkshire, has been told its current target of 600 new homes per year will rise to 1,635 which he said was “very unpopular”. “We are a rural and semi-rural area and our population has doubled in the last 20 years so everyone is suffering from congestion, development noise, medical services being rationed which [voters] attribute to the volume of development,” he said. “It’s nuts in planning terms and it’s nuts in political terms.” A spokesperson for the ministry of housing, communities and local government described the opposition as “misguided”, saying community involvement and control is at the centre of its overhaul of an “outdated planning system”. “While local housing need proposals provide a guide for councils they will still need to consider local circumstances to decide how many homes should be delivered in their areas,” they said. “We’re consulting on the proposals and will reflect on the feedback we receive so we can deliver the homes we need, where we need them.” On Wednesday parliament is set to vote on a Labour motion against a planning rule change to allow owners of blocks of flats to extend without seeking full planning permission."

          "bodyText": "“Britain has led the world in gardening for centuries” is a line often used dozens of times in gardening media. Judging by how frequently it has come up in TV scripts I have been asked to present, it seems to be a concept baked into the DNA of how British gardeners see the world and our place in it. It is a line I am uncomfortable saying. It’s not that I doubt the enormous influence UK horticulture has had, or that I mind a good bit of flag-waving now and then. My greatest gardening passions – terrariums and aquariums – are arguably two of a tiny handful of uniquely British contributions to the horticultural world. But this “led the world” narrative can only be made if one is very selective about the evidence. If your view of “the world” of horticulture is projects in countries with a history of British colonialism, when the British Empire was at its height, then the narrative works brilliantly. But this quickly becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and the only types of gardens we regard as worth considering are the ones that follow our model of what gardens “should” be. Often, in order to be called a “garden” at all, designs must be made to fit our pre-existing cultural ideas. It’s rather like saying Britain has “led the world” in language when you only speak English. Sure, it’s enormously popular, and that’s greatly reinforced if you live in a world that self-selects for hearing it, but does that make it true? This Anglocentric world view means that when I have filmed in Malaysia on garden design, producers have made an enormous effort to find the few remaining outposts of colonial British horticulture: going to highland retreats, filming extended sequences in mock Tudor houses; but showing far less interest in the village herb and forest gardens in the lowland tropics – which are unlike anything else in the world. When I pitch magazine pieces on the incredible high-rise “sky parks” and multi-storey living walls in 21st-century Singapore, I am asked to include more US, European and Australian examples, often more “historic” ones that are more “relevant” to readers. Even when making documentaries on Japanese gardens, rather than exploring the industry of nurseries dedicated to growing moss (considered a weed in British horticulture) including dozens of named cultivars we instead have to film subjects such as camellias which, frankly, could have been shot in Cornwall. This subconscious filtering process works like a social media algorithm, to remove novel or unconventional ideas that challenge perceptions of what gardens are, presenting us with a vision of the world that matches our prejudices. For a creative form, this is a dangerous path. The UK is brilliant at food, fashion, music and art because of its successful magpieing of ideas from across the globe. And the golden age of British gardens between the 18th and 19th centuries came about because we voraciously absorbed what were often considered shocking international influences and made them our own. In seeking to celebrate these historical achievements while glossing over their origins we undermine the very process that led to that era of innovation. When we say, “Britain has led the world in horticulture for centuries”, often all we are really saying is that the only type of gardening that counts is British. To me, that’s the opposite of world-leading. Follow James on Twitter @Botanygeek"

          "bodyText": "We’re ending our live coverage for today, thanks for following along. Some links and developments: Trump refused to answer a question about the 200,000 coronavirus deaths in the US. The president spread misinformation about Covid at his Pennsylvania rally. Mitt Romney announced his support for considering the president’s supreme court nominee. Cindy McCain formally endorsed Joe Biden. Officials outside of the US Census Bureau made the decision to speed up efforts to complete the 2020 census, a report found. A state of emergency was declared in Louisville, Kentucky, in anticipation of protests following an imminent grand jury decision on the police killing of Breonna Taylor. California’s governor faced backlash for sending an incarcerated firefighter to Ice to be deported. Chinese Americans have had their daily communications unwittingly swept into the US-China trade war, as the Trump administration threatens to ban China-based messaging platform WeChat. A growing number of Americans will be reluctant to get a Covid-19 vaccine immediately after one is developed, a poll found. Biden leads Trump by 5 points among likely voters in Michigan, while the two are even in North Carolina, according to a new poll. At his Pittsburgh rally, which is ongoing, the president has continued to spread misleading and dangerous claims about the Covid crisis. A few examples so far: He claimed Democrats are “trying to make our numbers look bad” by implementing Covid restrictions, in this case encouraging the crowd to boo the governor of Pennsylvania for adopting public health measures. The president mocked Joe Biden for wearing a mask and for practicing social distancing on the campaign trail, again casting doubt about those tools that remain vital to slowing the spread of the virus. In a bizarre aside, Trump also claimed that he used the racist “China virus” label because the word “coronavirus” reminds him of Italy and makes him think of a “beautiful villa”. Trump said “we did a great job” handling the coronavirus and drew a misleading comparison to the Obama administration’s handling of H1N1. The vice president’s plane has hit a bird, according to reporters traveling with Mike Pence: Air Force Two, on the way to Washington, apparently turned around after taking off from New Hampshire “out of an abundance of caution”. Cindy McCain has made her endorsement of Joe Biden official: Biden said earlier today that Cindy McCain was motivated to support him in part by the recent reports that the president had privately called dead soldiers “losers” and suckers” and that he had canceled a visit to pay respects at a military cemetery. Vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris has criticized the president for his handling of the coronavirus, noting that he continues to discourage mask use even after 200,000 people have died. Speaking in Detroit tonight, she noted that he has continued to hold large rallies where people don’t wear masks, according to CNN: We are looking at now the marker, the sad, awful marker of 200,000 lives that have perished in just the last several months. Almost 7 million people who have contracted the virus and to this day. We have a commander in chief of the United States of America who is holding rallies, with no masks because you see he has convinced everyone that you’re on one side of his ledger if you wear a mask, and you’re on the other side of his ledger if you don’t, making value judgments about people who are concerned with not dying. We’re talking about the President of the United States. We deserve better.” The president’s Pittsburgh rally has begun with predictable falsehoods and misinformation about Joe Biden. Trump again said the Democratic nominee is “against God”, an attack that Biden has called “shameful”. The president also made misleading and false claims about Biden’s position on fracking, saying he would immediately end all fracking. Biden has repeatedly reiterated that is not his stance, recently saying, “I am not banning fracking. Let me say that again. I am not banning fracking. No matter how many times Donald Trump lies about me.” The president also criticized Biden for wearing masks, a line of attack that has continued to raise concerns from public health officials. The president has refused to comment on the Covid death toll in the US exceeding 200,000 deaths. “Why haven’t you said anything about the US hitting 200,000 deaths from Covid?” a reporter asked, twice. Trump looked away and ignored the journalist: “Go ahead, uh, anybody else?” The number of dead in the US is now equivalent to a 9/11 attack every day for 67 days, as some have noted. Vice-president Mike Pence has argued that the Senate needs to “quickly” confirm Trump’s supreme court nominee so that the president’s pick will be seated in time to “resolve” any issues that arise from a contested election: This line of argument has raised significant alarm and backlash given that the president has already spread falsehoods about mail-in voting in an effort to undermine trust in the election and to set the groundwork for possibly contesting the results. After Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death, the White House is now making the argument that she needs to be immediately replaced so the president’s own pick can be seated on the bench to potentially rule on an election case. Trump’s Pittsburgh rally is due to start any minute. Here’s a snapshot of the crowd: US federal law enforcement and cybersecurity agencies warned today that “foreign actors” and “cybercriminals” will likely try to discredit the November presidential election by taking advantage of the slow counting of mail-in ballots, Reuters reports. The expected delays in counting mail-in ballots “could leave officials with incomplete results on election night,” the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a joint public service announcement. It continued: Foreign actors and cybercriminals could exploit the time required to certify and announce elections’ results by disseminating disinformation that includes reports of voter suppression, cyber attacks targeting election infrastructure, voter or ballot fraud.” Trump himself has repeatedly made false claims about mail-in voting in his own effort to raise doubts about the legitimacy of the results. In August, the Trump campaign failed to produce any evidence of vote-by-mail fraud in Pennsylvania after a federal judge ordered it do so. Here’s a recent fact-check from the Guardian’s voting rights expert: House speaker Nancy Pelosi says she has reached an agreement with Republicans to add nearly $8 billion in nutrition assistance. The bill, known as the continuing resolution (CR), is meant to avert a government shutdown. Joe Biden has told supporters at a fundraiser that Cindy McCain will be endorsing him for the first time: McCain, the widow of the late GOP senator John McCain, appeared in a video during the Democratic National Convention talking about Biden and her husband’s relationship, but she did not formally endorse him then. Biden said Cindy McCain was motivated in part by the recent reports that the president had privately called dead soldiers “losers” and suckers” and that he had canceled a visit to pay respects at a military cemetery. Trump publicly criticized John McCain on numerous occasions and was enraged when the senator voted against an effort to overturn Obamacare. During his campaign, Trump infamously said of McCain: “He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured ... He lost and let us down. I’ve never liked him as much after that. I don’t like losers.” A scene from the campaign trail in Chandler, Arizona today where Trump supporters packed into a ballroom to see Donald Trump Jr and his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle: Supporters were indoors, not wearing masks and not social distancing, raising concerns once again about the potential spread of Covid-19, which remains a significant threat in Arizona. Vladimir Putin is likely continuing to try and influence the US election in favor of Donald Trump, a recent CIA analysis found, according to multiple news reports today. The Washington Post, New York Times and NBC News have all reported on the CIA assessment today, citing various unnamed officials. The Post, the first to report on the CIA’s finding (citing “two sources who reviewed” the analysis), said that Putin and his top aides are “probably directing” a Russian foreign influence operation to interfere in the election against Joe Biden. Trump’s press secretary defended the president’s record on Russia, saying no one has been tougher, but her comments came one day after Trump said, “I like Putin, he likes me.” Immigration authorities have stopped sending detained migrant women to a rural Georgia gynecologist accused of performing surgeries without consent, a government spokesman told the Associated Press today. Dr Mahendra Amin faces allegations that he administered hysterectomies and other procedures that women held at the Irwin county detention center didn’t seek or fully understand. Amin has seen at least 60 detained women, said Andrew Free, a lawyer investigating the medical care at the Ice jail alongside other civil rights attorneys, told the AP today. Bryan Cox, a spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), confirmed to the AP that Amin would no longer see patients, but declined to comment further, citing an ongoing inspector general investigation. Amin’s lawyer did not respond to an inquiry on Tuesday. The Amin scandal has renewed attention on the conditions inside Ice jails where migrants have long alleged that they face abuse, medical neglect, mistreatment and other human rights violations. Those concerns have escalated dramatically during the Covid crisis. Here’s a recent story on Irwin: Joe Biden led President Trump by 5% among likely voters in Michigan, while the two were even in North Carolina, according to Reuters/Ipsos opinion polls released today. In Michigan, 50% of voters said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic while 44% said Trump would be better, according to the poll on the critical battleground state. In North Carolina, 47% said Biden would be better at handling the coronavirus pandemic versus 45% who answered Trump. In both states, a higher percentage of voters said Trump would be better at handling the economy. You can see the full details here. And here’s the Guardian’s poll tracker, which we published yesterday and will be regularly updated: Hi all - Sam Levin here, writing from Los Angeles, and taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. One story we’re closely following: Authorities in Louisville, Kentucky have preemptively declared a “state of emergency” in anticipation of protests following an imminent grand jury decision on the police killing of Breonna Taylor. Taylor, 26, was killed on 13 March by police serving a no-knock warrant as part of an investigation into an ex-boyfriend. Her death has inspired national protests for months, with activists across the country calling for the officers to face criminal prosecution. Louisville’s mayor, Greg Fischer, said his emergency order was put in place “due to the potential for civil unrest, which allows him to exercise any of his emergency powers, including those to hire or contract for services, and implementing curfews and other restrictions”. Civil rights groups have raised concerns that the order will be used to clamp down on protests in violation of free speech rights, and that the order could lead to brutality against demonstrators. Here’s a recent analysis of the possible criminal case, published in the Guardian: That’s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Sam Levin, will take over the blog for the next few hours. Here’s where the day stands so far: The US coronavirus death toll surpassed 200,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has the highest death toll of any country in the world and accounts for about 21% of the global coronavirus death toll, even though it represents only 4% of the world’s population. Senator Mitt Romney said he would support moving forward with Trump’s supreme court nominee. The Republican senator’s announcement virtually guarantees Trump’s nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be confirmed, likely before election day on November 3. Trump said he would announce his supreme court nominee on Saturday. The announcement will follow ceremonies honoring Ginsburg, who will lie in repose at the supreme court and lie in state at the US Capitol this week. Mitch McConnell remained non-commital about the timing of a supreme court confirmation vote. Trump has said he wants the final vote to happen before election day, but McConnell said he would not know the timing of the vote until the nomination makes it out of the Senate judiciary committee. The FDA is reportedly expected to soon release strict guidelines on the emergency authorization of a coronavirus vaccine. According to the Washington Post, the guidelines would make it highly unlikely that a vaccine will be approved before election day. Trump has promised a vaccine will be released in the coming weeks, but the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the Senate last week that a vaccine will not be widely available to the American public until mid to late 2021. Sam will have more coming up, so stay tuned. The Food and Drug Administration is reportedly expected to soon release strict guidelines on the emergency authorization of a coronavirus vaccine, making it very unlikely a vaccine will be released before election day, on November 3. The Washington Post reports: The agency is issuing the guidance to boost transparency and public trust as it approaches the momentous decision of whether a prospective vaccine is safe and effective. Public health experts are increasingly worried that President Trump’s repeated predictions of a coronavirus vaccine by Nov. 3, coupled with the administration’s interference in federal science agencies, may prompt Americans to reject any vaccine as rushed and potentially tainted. ... The guidance, which is far more rigorous than what was used for emergency clearance of hydroxychloroquine or convalescent plasma, is an effort to shore up confidence in an agency that has made missteps during the pandemic. With the vaccines, the FDA is expected to ask manufacturers seeking an emergency authorization — a far quicker process than a formal approval — to follow participants in late-stage clinical trials for a median of at least two months, starting after they receive a second vaccine shot, according to two individuals familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss information before it is made public. As a sign the vaccine works, the agency also is looking for at least five severe cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, in the placebo group for each trial, as well as some cases of the disease in older people. These standards, plus the time it will take companies to prepare their applications and the agency to review the data, make it highly improbable for any vaccine to be authorized before the election. The agency has previously said any vaccine would have to be 50 percent more effective than a placebo. The news comes as polls have indicated declining confidence among Americans in both parties about the safety of a coronavirus vaccine, which Democrats have blamed on Trump politicizing the process. Trump has repeatedly suggested a vaccine would be released in the coming weeks, but the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told the Senate last week that a vaccine would not be widely available to the American public until mid to late 2021. The president claimed the CDC director was “confused” when he made that prediction, but other health experts have offered similar timelines for the distribution of a vaccine. Senator Susan Collins confirmed she would oppose Trump’s supreme court nominee if the final vote occurs before election day. The Republican senator, who is facing a difficult reelection in Maine, previously said she did not support holding a vote on a nominee before the November 3 elections. However, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell now appears to have enough support to move forward without Collins’ vote. But Collins confirmed that, if the nomination process does move forward, she would not support Trump’s pick. “My statement was a model of clarity. ... I made it very clear, yes, that I did not think there should be a vote prior to the election. And if there is one, I would oppose the nominee,” Collins told reporters, per the Hill. “Not because I might not support that nominee under normal circumstances, but we’re simply too close to the election, and in the interest of being fair to the American people,” Collins said. Collins noted she also disagreed with McConnell’s decision to block Barack Obama’s supreme court nominee in 2016, Merrick Garland. “The decision was made not to proceed, a decision that I disagreed with, but my position did not prevail. I now think we need to play by the same set of rules,” she added. The Guardian’s Sam Levine reports: More than 40,000 people registered to vote last weekend after the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Friday, according to new data from vote.org, a non-profit that helps register voters on its website. The organization saw 40,771 new voter registrations on Saturday and Sunday, a 68% increase from the previous weekend. The group also saw 139,046 people verify their registrations, a 118% increase from the previous weekend. The organization also reported a spike in mail-in ballots, noting more than 35,000 people requested them last week. In addition to Ginsburg’s death, there may be several other reasons that explain the jump in voter activity. There generally tends to be a spike in voter registration and verification as the country gets closer to election day. Ginsburg’s death placed the direction of the Supreme Court front and center of the presidential race. Democrats have said the winner of the presidential election should choose Ginsburg’s replacement, but Republicans have pledged to move ahead and fill the seat regardless. Ginsburg reportedly said just before she died that she did not want to have her seat filled “until a new president is installed.” The Senate cannot even pass a nonbinding resolution to honor the legacy of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg without debate devolving into partisan bickering. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer attempted to pass the resolution while adding a line noting Ginsburg’s dying wish was that the new president would choose her supreme court replacement. Senator Ted Cruz objected to that proposal and instead suggested adding a quote from Ginsburg criticizing the idea of court packing. Schumer told Cruz, “I think Justice Ginsburg would easily see through the legal sophistry.” That divisiveness likely foreshadows how the next month will go, as Republicans attempt to confirm Trump’s supreme court nominee before election day, on November 3. Wisconsin governor Tony Evers has declared a new public health emergency and extended a face-coverings mandate into November to fight a flare-up of coronavirus cases, as the US surpassed the grim milestone of 200,000 Covid-19 deaths this morning. In-person social gatherings led to cases skyrocketing among people aged 18 to 24, Evers said, as he pleaded with students who returned to colleges for the fall semester to stay out of bars and wear masks, Reuters writes. “We are seeing an alarming increase in cases across our state, especially on campus,” the governor said in a statement announcing his decision. Evers’ previous mask mandate, part of a second public health emergency he issued in late July, was due to expire on Monday and has been challenged in court by a conservative group arguing the governor, a Democrat, violated state law in using emergency powers more than once. Wisconsin has experienced one of the highest percentage increases of coronavirus cases nationwide over the past two weeks, and has the second-highest rate of positive coronavirus tests in the nation at 17%, according to a Reuters tally. The United States continues to have the world’s highest number of Covid-19 deaths. On a weekly average, it is losing about 800 lives each day to the virus, according to a Reuters tally. That is down from a peak of 2,806 daily deaths recorded on April 15 during the first peak of infections. Olivia Troye, the former member of the White House coronavirus task force who has been publicly criticizing Donald Trump’s response to the pandemic since leaving, has just come back against former boss Keith Kellogg. Kellogg, national security adviser to Vice President Mike Pence put Troye down at a briefing earlier today. Troye’s having none of it. Troye has accused the president of putting his own supporters at risk when they turn out for his campaign rallies. And here’s a throwback to what Troye said on a Republican Voters Against Trump ad: Meanwhile: A spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi said the House speaker will soon lead a moment of silence to commemorate the loss of 200,000 Americans to coronavirus. The US coronavirus death toll hit 200,000 earlier today, representing a far higher death toll than that of any other country in the world. Asked this afternoon if Trump would be doing anything to mark the tragic milestone, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany dodged the question. At his own press conference, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer denounced Republicans’ efforts to push through a supreme court nomination using “brute political force”. “If that becomes the standard in the Senate, how can we expect to trust the other side again?” Schumer asked. The Democratic leader argued Republicans were rushing to confirm a supreme court nominee who could “change the complexion of the court for a generation.” “Everything Americans value hangs in the balance,” Schumer said, accusing Republicans of having “pulled the federal judiciary to their far-right side.” Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell was asked how he could justify moving forward with a supreme court vote, when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s reported dying wish was for the new president to fill her seat. McConnell replied, “I prefer another thing she said recently, which was she thought the number of the supreme court ought to be nine.” It should be noted McConnell kept the supreme court stuck at eight justices for more than a year as he refused to consider Barack Obama’s nominee in 2016. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell remained noncommittal about the timing of a final vote on the confirmation of Trump’s supreme court nominee. McConnell said Lindsey Graham, the chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, would first lay out the panel’s timing for confirmation hearings after the nominee is announced. “When the nomination comes out of committee, then I’ll decide when and how to proceed,” McConnell said. Trump has said he wants the final vote to happen before election day, but McConnell has been more vague, saying yesterday that the vote will happen “this year.” McConnell also dismissed one reporter’s question about polling showing a majority of Americans believe the Senate should wait until after the election to hold a confirmation vote. The Republican leader insisted the Senate has a “constitutional obligation” to take up the nomination, even though McConnell refused to consider Barack Obama’s supreme court nominee in 2016. Senator Joni Ernst, who is facing a difficult reelection in Iowa, said she looked forward to vetting Trump’s supreme court nominee. Ernst, a member of the Senate judiciary committee, pledged, “I will do my duty as a member of that committee.” A poll taken days before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death showed Ernst trailing Democratic candidate Theresa Greenfield by 3 points among Iowa’s likely voters, representing a virtual tie given the survey’s 3.8-point margin of error. At the Republicans’ press conference, Senate majority whip John Thune said senators had been elected for “big moments like this ... to fill seats on the supreme court.” Senator John Barrasso also noted that Trump’s supreme court nominee would likely be someone who had already been vetted by the Senate, indicating the nominee will be a federal judge. Senate Republican leadership is holding a press conference on Capitol Hill, addressing the supreme court confirmation hearings and the government funding bill. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell started the press conference by noting they expected to receive Trump’s nomination later this week, and they anticipated the nominee would be an “extremely well qualified woman.” Before handing the mic over to Senate majority whip John Thune, McConnell took a moment to criticize House Democrats’ stopgap government funding bill. McConnell noted the bill, which would keep the government funded until December 11, did not include the $30 billion bailout for farmers that Republicans have requested. “It basically is a message to farm country to drop dead,” McConnell said. Judge Amy Coney Barrett has reportedly emerged as Trump’s favorite to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. CNN reports: Trump has not finalized his decision, and with days to go until he announces his pick on Saturday, his thinking could change. The White House is currently working to schedule a meeting between Trump and Judge Barbara Lagoa while he’s in the Miami area Friday, two sources tell CNN. Lagoa is one of five female candidates the President is considering as a replacement, but two sources said her chances have dimmed significantly since the weekend. But for now, Barrett -- currently sitting on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago -- is his clear front-runner and is viewed inside the White House as the likely nominee. ... Officials said Trump seemed very enthusiastic about Barrett after their [Monday] meeting, which lasted for several hours. He told people afterward he believes Barrett will be very well received by ‘his people,’ one official said. While no one close to the process would go so far as to say Barrett is the pick, Trump is giving people the impression he is completely sold on her. Many progressives fear that, if Barrett is confirmed, she will vote to overturn Roe v Wade, the landmark 1973 supreme court case that established a woman’s right to abortion access. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany brought Keith Kellogg, the national security advisor to Vice President Mike Pence, up to the briefing room podium to denounce Olivia Troye. Troye, a former member of the White House coronavirus task force, has been publicly criticizing Trump’s response to the pandemic. She said in an interview released today that she felt compelled to speak out against the president because “I think American lives were continuing to be on the line.” Kellogg said he supervised Troye at the White House and fired her because of her declining work performance. “What she has said, I have never heard,” Kellogg said. “That never happened.” Kellogg also dismissed Troye as a “back-bencher” for the task force, although Dr Anthony Fauci has described her as a “good person” and an “important” member of the team. “I’m very proud of the president of the United States,” Kellogg said. “I’m not proud of Olivia Troye.” McEnany briefly took the podium again to dismiss Troye as a “disgruntled former detailee.” With that, she concluded the briefing without taking additional questions about Troye. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump’s long-awaited health care plan will be coming in the next two weeks. A reporter asked McEnany when the president would release his plan, noting that some Democrats have suggested it does not exist. McEnany replied, “It certainly does exist. The president in the next week or so will be laying out his vision for health care.” The press secretary went on to say, “The president will be laying out some additional health care steps in the coming, I would say, two weeks.” The answer recalled this classic 2017 piece from Bloomberg News on the Trump administration: “In Trump’s White House, Everything’s Coming in ‘Two Weeks.’” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeatedly insisted that Trump has been transparent with the American people on the issue of coronavirus. “The president never downplayed critical health information,” McEnany said at her briefing. But again, Trump admitted to journalist Bob Woodward back in March that he was working to downplay the threat of the virus. “I wanted to always play it down,” Trump told Woodward on March 19. “I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic.” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany rejected the notion that Trump was responsible for the US coronavirus death toll, which hit 200,000 today. Asked what she would say to Americans who blame Trump for the country’s death toll, McEnany argued the death toll could have been much higher and the president deserved credit for his response. The US coronavirus death toll is higher than that of any other country in the world. While the US makes up 4% of the world’s population, the country represents about 21% of the global coronavirus death toll. McEnany was also pressed on Trump’s false claim at his rally last night that coronavirus “affects virtually nobody” below the age of 18. Asked why the president was not telling the truth to the American people, McEnany responded, “The president is telling people the truth.” Trump previously acknowledged to journalist Bob Woodward that he had worked to downplay the coronavirus pandemic. McEnany also would not say whether Trump would address the country hitting the grim milestone of 200,000 Americans lost to coronavirus. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted Trump has the full authority to fill the supreme court vacancy. “There is nothing in the Constitution that says the president stops being the president in an election year,” McEnany said. Again, Republicans blocked Barack Obama from filling a supreme court seat in 2016 on the basis that it should not be filled until after the presidential election. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany is holding a briefing, and she opened her remarks by attacking Democratic lawmakers over the supreme court vacancy. McEnany claimed House speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have “blatantly shown their disregard for the US Constiution” after they refused to rule out the possibility of impeaching Trump again to slow down the nomination process. McEnany quoted the Constitution saying the president “shall nominate” supreme court justices, even though Republicans blocked Barack Obama from doing so in 2016. Senator Cory Booker criticized Trump for using him as a “boogeyman” to stir up fear about Democratic policies among suburban voters. “I’m tired, I really am exhausted, at the end of this man’s time as president,” Booker told MSNBC. “He has pushed every racially divisive nerve possible in this country.” At his Ohio rally last night, Trump once again warned (with no evidence) that Joe Biden would “destroy suburbia” if elected president. “You know who’s in charge? You know who’s in charge of the program? Cory Booker!” Trump said. Booker is one of three black members of the US Senate. Here’s where the day stands so far: The US coronavirus death toll surpassed 200,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The US has the highest death toll of any country in the world and accounts for about 21% of the global death toll, even though it represents only 4% of the world’s population. Senator Mitt Romney said he would support moving forward with Trump’s supreme court nominee. The Republican senator’s announcement virtually guarantees Trump’s nominee to replace the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will be confirmed, likely before election day on November 3. Trump said he would announce his supreme court nominee on Saturday. The announcement will follow ceremonies honoring Ginsburg, who will lie in repose at the supreme court and lie in state at the US Capitol this week. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Trump will reportedly meet with one of the judges being considered for the supreme court seat on Friday. Axios reports: President Trump plans to meet with shortlisted Supreme Court candidate Barbara Lagoa during a campaign visit to Florida on Friday, according to two sources familiar with his plans. What we’re hearing: Sources who know both Trump and Lagoa say they still expect the president to pick Judge Amy Coney Barrett, but they view the Lagoa meeting as a wild card because they say she has a charismatic personality that would appeal to Trump. Lagoa is the daughter of Cuban immigrants, and some commentators have speculated her background could appeal to Trump as he attempts to win Florida, with the help of Cuban-American voters, in November. Asked yesterday if politics and his reelection bid were affecting his supreme court choice, Trump said, “I think probably automatically it is. Even if you’re not wanting to do that, it becomes a little automatic.” There is a Groundhog Day quality to the American experience of Covid-19. Back in March there was public outcry that, under Trump, protective gear to keep health workers safe was in critically short supply, testing for coronavirus was woefully inadequate and black Americans were dying in grotesquely disproportionate numbers. Today, six months later, exactly the same laments can be heard. “There is a theme here,” said Eric Topol, professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research in San Diego. “Recreate the crime. We keep on doing it, over and over again.” With autumn on the horizon, when colder weather is likely to drive millions back indoors where the virus can spread more easily and with returning colleges acting as giant disease incubators, the US is poised for another rude awakening. There is simply no chance of containing the contagion when new cases are still running at about 35,000 a day. In March the Guardian asked Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development who was at the forefront of the US government response to Ebola in 2014, to give his take on how the pandemic was being handled. He called the Trump administration’s effort “one of the greatest failures of basic governance in modern times”. We went back to Konyndyk to ask how he sees it now as the country passes the devastating 200,000 deaths mark. “I think my analysis has borne out extremely well,” he said. “We’re on track to have a quarter-million dead Americans by the end of the year with absolutely no reason it had to happen. It was all preventable. So yes, this is a leadership failure of astounding proportions.” It has been less than six months since the US coronavirus death toll hit 1,000. Today, it surpassed 200,000. Democratic nominee Joe Biden tweeted this graphic today, demonstrating how the country’s coronavirus death toll has continued to steadily climb while other countries’ have stabilized. The US has reached another tragic landmark in deaths from Covid-19, with more than 200,000 people now believed to have died because of the virus, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Deaths have reached at least 200,005, according to the count by the university’s coronavirus resource center. The US has the most Covid-19 deaths in the world, ahead of other nations with high death tolls including Brazil, India and Mexico. A recent update of an analysis by the Brookings Insitution of the response to Covid-19 of OECD countries said that virus caseloads and deaths in the US at first declined and then surged again, starting in June. It concluded: “Employment and health outcomes for the US during the pandemic have been worse than in almost any other high-income country in the world. “New virus cases in September in the US are 60% higher than in the average OECD country, and new deaths are five times higher.’” California has the most cases of any US state, followed by Texas and Florida. In recent weeks there has been concern around the growth of cases in the midwest, including Iowa. Experts have said the next few months will be vital in determining how the US will cope with the pandemic through the winter. The US has officially lost more than 200,000 Americans to coronavirus, representing a far higher death toll than any other nation in the world. According to Johns Hopkins University, at least 200,005 Americans have died of coroanvirus since the pandemic started in March. That number represents about one-fifth of the global coronavirus death toll. Brazil has seen the second-highest national death toll, losing 137,272 people to the virus so far. For more coronavirus updates, follow the Guardian’s global live blog: The Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee said he believed a supreme court confirmation vote would happen before election day. Senator Lindsey Graham told reporters that he planned to hold confirmation hearings over three days next month. Asked whether the final vote would happen before November 3, Graham said, “I think so.” As Mitt Romney announced his support for advancing a supreme court nomination, Trump addressed the United Nations General Assembly in a pre-recorded video. In his speech, the US president attacked China, blaming Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic, and celebrated his “America First” agenda. Trump abruptly ended his remarks after seven minutes, using less than half his allocated time. Julian Borger, the Guardian’s world affairs editor, said this of Trump’s remarks: Trump’s speech was a barnstorming seven minutes, less than half the time he was allotted, and in a tone just short of yelling. It was a speech designed for a virtual campaign rally and that is its destiny, to be played on repeat on Republican social media. Much of the speech was a ferocious attack on China. He named the country 11 times in all. In the first few seconds he had named Covid-19 the ‘China virus’, and called for Beijing to be held accountable. Having dismissed the pandemic as affecting ‘virtually nobody’ at a rally yesterday, he called the fight against it as a ‘great global struggle’ comparable to the second world war. And Trump went on to make a series of false claims about what the US government was doing about the pandemic. The first was the biggest. He said ‘we launched the most aggressive mobilization, since the second world war.’ In fact, the federal government has handed over leadership to the states, and its main impact was to broadcast misleading information, downplaying the threat. Trump was speaking just after the US passed the milestone of 200,000 dead from the pandemic - a statistic he did not mention. There will be some relief in the UN, where there were fears that the US president would announce the severing of more US funding of the organisation. Instead the hostile fire was directed mostly on China. The brevity of the speech limited the number of targets. For more updates on the UN General Assembly, follow the Guardian’s live blog: Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer appears to be declaring all-out war against majority leader Mitch McConnell, as Republicans move steadily toward confirming Trump’s supreme court nominee. “Leader McConnell has defiled the Senate like no one in this generation, and Leader McConnell may very well destroy it,” Schumer said, accusing Republicans of stealing two supreme court seats. As a reminder, control of the Senate is up for grabs in the November elections. If Democrats win the White House, they need to flip three Senate seats to take control of the chamber. If Joe Biden loses, they will need to flip four seats. Senator Mitt Romney argued that it was “appropriate” for the court to have a more conservative bent to represent a “center right” country. “It’s also appropriate for a nation that is, if you will, center right to have a court which reflects center right points of view,” Romney told reporters on Capitol Hill. But as a Daily Beast reporter noted, both Trump and Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, lost the popular vote by millions of votes. And while Republicans make up a majority of the Senate, they actually represent a minority of the country, so it’s unclear the US is truly “center right.” It has been a rather remarkable year in terms of the relationship between Trump and Mitt Romney. In February, Romney became the only Republican senator to support removing Trump from office during the president’s impeachment trial. Less than eight months later, Romney now says that same president should be able to nominate a supreme court nominee, with six weeks to go until election day. Senator Mitt Romney told reporters that he made his decision to move forward with a supreme court nominee based on “precedent.” “The decision to proceed now with President Trump’s nominee is also consistent with history,” Romney said. Romney also argued that it is sensible to have a court with “more of a conservative bent than it’s had over the last few decades.” “My liberal friends over many decades have gotten very used to the idea of having a liberal court, but that’s not written in the stars,” Romney said. Capitol Hill reporters pressed Mitt Romney on his statement supporting advancing a supreme court nomination, but the Republican senator dodged questions about voting in a lame-duck session and Mitch McConnell’s refusal to consider Barack Obama’s supreme court nominee in 2016. Senator Mitt Romney’s announcement that he will support moving forward with a supreme court nomination, virtually guaranteeing a confirmation, has intensified demands for Democrats to embrace packing the court. From a legal writer for Slate: Senator Mitt Romney’s announcement that he will support moving forward with Trump’s supreme court nomination increases the likelihood that the vote will happen before election day, on November 3. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell pledged yesterday that a vote would happen “this year,” but he did not specify whether it would occur before or after election day. The president has said he would prefer that the nominee to replace Ruth Bader Ginsburg be confirmed before November 3. With likely 51 Republican senators backing McConnell’s proposal to move forward, the nomination is likely to sail through. Senator Mitt Romney announced he would support moving forward with Trump’s supreme court nominee. “I intend to follow the Constitution and precedent in considering the president’s nominee. If the nominee reaches the floor, I intend to vote based upon their qualifications,” Romney said. Romney was considered the last major question mark in Republicans’ plans to move forward with the nomination, after Cory Gardner announced yesterday that he also supported moving forward with the nomination. Only two Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- have called for waiting to confirm a nominee until after election day, on November 3. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell now has 51 likely votes, one more than necessary, to confirm Trump’s eventual nominee. A new Georgia poll out this morning shows Trump and Joe Biden tied in the traditionally Republican state. The poll, conducted by the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, found Trump and Biden each attracting the support of 47% of the state’s likely voters. Trump won Georgia by 5 points in 2016, and he almost certainly needs to carry the state again to secure a second term. The state’s two Senate races are also hotly contested. Senator David Perdue and Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff are virtually tied, with Perdue at 47% and Ossoff at 45%, within the poll’s 4-point margin of error. The special election for Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler’s seat is also very close. Loeffler leads with 24%, but both Republican congressman Doug Collins and Democratic candidate Raphael Warnock are at 20%. Trump has confirmed that he will announce his nominee to fill the supreme court of Ruth Bader Ginsburg on Saturday at the White House. The president had previously said he would announce his choice either Friday or Saturday, following this week’s ceremonies honoring Ginsburg. Ginsburg will lie in repose at the supreme court on Wednesday and Thursday and lie in state at the Capitol on Friday. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. Olivia Troye, a former aide to Vice President Mike Pence who has been speaking out about her time at the Trump White House, said the president’s comments about coronavirus “disappearing” were “frightening.” Troye told MSNBC host Andrea Mitchell, “When you’re the president, words matter.” Asked why she decided to speak out now, Troye said, “I felt that in my heart and my entire being, I think American lives were continuing to be on the line.” Troye expressed alarm that Trump was more focused on his personal agenda than protecting the country from coronavirus, which has now claimed nearly 200,000 American lives. Troye, a former member of the White House coronavirus task force, also noted the team held a meeting “late January” about how dangerous the coronavirus could be for the country. The former aide also confirmed Trump argued coronavirus could be a positive thing because he wouldn’t have to shake hands with people anymore. Troyte told Mitchell, “He said when you’re a politician, you have to shake a lot of hands. You have to shake a lot of hands. And these people are disgusting. It’s gross. And so maybe, Covid’s probably a good thing, right? I don’t have to shake hands. I don’t have to do that anymore.” The vice president has dismissed Troye as a “disgruntled employee,” but Dr Anthony Fauci described her as a “good person” and an “important” member of the task force. Daniel Chaitin, the breaking news editor at the Washington Examiner, seems to indicate that Saturday is going to be the day for Trump’s pick. And that is it from me today, I’ll be back tomorrow, I’m handing over now to Joan… We’d had reports of some of the details already, but Today has put up some clips of the first TV interview with Olivia Troye, who worked as an adviser to vice [resident Mike Pence before quitting Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force. She was being interviewed by NBC senior Washington correspondent Andrea Mitchell. Troy is described as a lifelong Republican who worked at the Pentagon, was detailed to Iraq, and who worked at the National Counterterrorism centre before joining the coronavirus task force. In the clip she says she spoke out because “I felt that, in my heart, and in my entire being, American lives were continuing to be on the line.” She said that president Trump was mainly focussed on how the virus would affect his PR and image, rather than the agenda of the taskforce, and at one point said coronavirus might be a good thing as he’d have to shake fewer hands. She added “I can’t imagine how any honestly normal human being would ever say that out loud in the middle of a pandemic.” She confirmed that Donald Trump was briefed in late January that coronavirus was going to be “big”, at a point where he continued to dismiss it in public. Troye described watching the president say it was just going to “go away” was “frightening”. “You know, when you’re the president,” she said, “words matter.” You can watch the clip here: Today – Former Pence aide speaks out about Trump’s ‘frightening’ response to coronavirus Nancy Pelosi will later on this morning be attending the Covid Memorial Project’s interfaith memorial service at the National Mall. The project has installed 20,000 Americans flags on the northeast quadrant of the Washington Monument, facing the White House, to mark 200,000 deaths in the US from the coronavirus. Zoe Williams has written for us today on how the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg has put the issue of abortion centre-stage in the US presidential election, and she urges campaigners to seize the opportunity: More of Trump’s supporters have this as a “very important” factor in the way they’ll vote. This is a classic issue of asymmetric polarisation – it pleases the moderate to say there are extremists on both sides, yet the pro-choice side should never have accepted that premise. The anti-abortionists, at their extremes, want to curtail this right for every woman, in every circumstance. There isn’t a pro-choice activist on Earth who wants all pregnancies to end in termination. If the past five years have taught us anything, it’s that the most polarised have the most to gain, politically, from a calcified debate. Precisely because it is insoluble, the issue has an obliterative quality, scorching everything around it. Who wants to talk about tax bands and green energy subsidies, when there is life and death at stake? This, again, appears to play better for Trump, since the left wins when it builds a plausible, detailed, coherent plan for a different future, whereas the right wins when it offers up absolutes and asks the voter to build an identity round one or the other. Read it here: Zoe Williams – Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death means pro-choicers have a fight on their hands News this morning of a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll which sees Trump and Biden “locked in a tie just six weeks to Election Day”. The paper reports: Forty-seven percent of likely voters say they would support Trump for president, and 47% say they would support Biden. Another 4% would vote for someone else and 3% are unsure. A stark gender divide appears to be driving the race as men of nearly every demographic cast their support for Trump, a Republican, and women do the same for Biden, a Democrat. “I don’t know that there’s any race in the history of presidential polling in Iowa that shows this kind of division,” said J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer &amp; Co., the firm that conducted the poll. Trump leads by 21 percentage points with men, 57% to 36% over Biden. And Biden leads by 20 percentage points with women, 57% to 37% over Trump. Trump carried Iowa easily in 2016 with a ten point lead of Hillary Clinton. Read more here: Des Moines Register – Iowa Poll: Donald Trump and Joe Biden are locked in a dead heat six weeks to Election Day Donald Trump has been pushing for it and promising it, but the American public seem increasingly unenthusiastic about the prospect of an imminent vaccine against the coronavirus according to the latest findings of the Axios-Ipsos Coronavirus Index. Just 13% say they’d definitely be willing to try it immediately. Margaret Talev writes that the trend is taking place among Republicans as well as Democrats, and that “It’s another warning of the potential difficulties health authorities will face in convincing enough Americans that a vaccine is safe and effective.” In all, sixty percent say it is not very, or not at all, likely they would get the first generation vaccine, while 39% report that they were very likely or somewhat likely to take it. Ipsos report this represents an eight percentage point drop from last month, when 47% said they would get the first vaccine. The poll also finds that 60% of Americans do not trust pharmaceutical companies to look out for their best interests. Cliff Young, president of Ipsos US Public Affairs, suggests the growing concerns around the vaccine reflect a combination of scientists urging patience and the “political ping-pong” that surrounds it. Read more here: Axios – Vaccine resistance grows If you are above a certain age, you may not have grasped what TikTok is, and why it has become so popular among young Americans. And even if you have grasped that, you still might be somewhat baffled as to why the Trump administration has intervened into the ownership of the social media video sharing app. Fortunately, my colleague Helen Davidson has got you covered, answering why TikTok is for sale, and how the deal for it get so complicated: Donald Trump has accused the video-sharing social networking service of being a threat to national security. He claims its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would give the Chinese government access to user data upon request. TikTok denies the accusation. The US president has demanded a full sale of TikTok to an American owner. But China complicated a potential sale, with an amendment to its export restrictions requiring companies to seek government approval before exporting Chinese tech. It was widely believed to be aimed at the technology driving TikTok’s algorithm – AI interfaces, voice recognition, and content recommendation analysis. There’s a lot more here: TikTok – why it is being sold and who will own it Kamala Harris is making a campaign stop in Michigan today, where she will visit Flint and Detroit. Flint came to national attention with the scandal over its water supply. As the Detroit Free Press reports in advance of her visit: In Washington, Harris is working to address issues that affect residents in Michigan cities such as Flint, where a state-led change in the city’s municipal water supply in 2014 exposed residents — many of them children — to lead. The state agreed in August to a $600-million preliminary settlement of civil lawsuits brought by residents harmed by lead during the water crisis. In July, Harris introduced a bill ensuring American citizens, especially those in at-risk communities like Flint, had access to clean drinking water. The “Water Justice Act” would invest $220 billion for safe water programs. Michigan was narrowly won by Donald Trump last time out by around 10,000 votes, securing him 16 Electoral College votes. Our US election polls tracker currently puts Biden 7 points up this time around. The state can expect a few more visits from both sides before November rolls around. But Flint wasn’t a one-off in the US with regards to water, and we’ve had a whole series looking at the issue of the affordability and quality of water in the country called America’s water crisis. In the latest instalment, Nina Lakhani has been in Martin county, Kentucky. The tap water smells strongly of chlorine, like a swimming pool, and residents frequently report problems with bad taste, discolouration, sediment and irritated or burning skin after bathing. “In Martin county nobody drinks the tap water unless they have to, you can’t trust it, and you can’t trust the water department,” said Reed, a former teacher’s assistant who lives off $780 a month in benefits. Reed ostensibly pays two water bills: $60 to $70 a month to the public utility and $30 or so to the store for bottled water. Her grandson Chance Crum, 18, has never tasted the tap water. “It makes you sick to my stomach,” says Florence Reed, “I would never let my baby drink it, it smells bad and it tastes bad. It’s nasty, but sometimes I have no choice.” Read it here: ‘It smells bad, it tastes bad’: how Americans stopped trusting their water Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has tweeted this morning of pride in the leading role of the US in helping to set up the United Nations 75 years ago. The UN General Assembly opens today, although in a rather different and more virtual format than previous years due to the coronavirus pandemic. Donald Trump will be addressing the UN via a pre-recorded speech on a bill that also features Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, China’s Xi Jinping, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. That’s quite the programming choice from whoever was putting the agenda together. We’ll have a separate live blog for that closer to the time – it starts at 9am. Our world affairs editor Julian Borger has written this scene-setter for us, encouragingly titled: Why the UN’s 75th general assembly could be worse than the world’s worst Zoom meeting Associated Press report that after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis won a court victory to keep felons from voting until they’ve paid off debts, Democratic billionaire and former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has stepped in as part of an effort that has raised more than $20 million dollars on their behalf in order to allow them to vote. That’s in addition to the $100 million Bloomberg has pledged to help Biden win Florida. A federal appellate court ruled on 11 September that in addition to serving their sentences, Florida felons must pay all fines, restitution and legal fees before they can regain their right to vote. The case could have broad implications for the November elections. Under Amendment 4, which Florida voters passed overwhelmingly in 2018, felons who have completed their sentences would have voting rights restored. Republican lawmakers then moved to define what it means to complete a sentence. In addition to prison time served, lawmakers directed that all legal financial obligations, including unpaid fines and restitution, would also have to be settled before a felon could be eligible to vote. With Bloomberg’s help, the Florida Rights Restitution Council is trying to get this accomplished. The group had raised about $5 million before Bloomberg made calls to raise almost $17 million more, according to Bloomberg advisers who weren’t authorized to speak to AP on the record because the announcement hadn’t been made yet. The money is targeted for felons who registered to vote while the law was in question and who owe $1,500 or less. That accounts for about 31,100 people, Bloomberg advisers say. In a state that decided the 2000 presidential election by 537 votes, that could be critical in a year when polls show Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden in a dead heat. Organizers for the group say they aren’t targeting people registered with a particular political party. “To hell with politics, to hell with any other implications or inuations, at the end of the day it’s about real people, real lives, American citizens who want to be a part of this,” said Desmond Meade, the group’s executive director. “People with felony convictions have had their voices silenced for so long.” The Florida Rights Restitution Council said other donors include John Legend, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, MTV, Comedy Central, VH1, Ben &amp; Jerry’s, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., the Miami Dolphins, the Orlando Magic, the Miami Heat and Stephen Spielberg. This has just dropped from the Washington Post: Pentagon used taxpayer money meant for masks and swabs to make jet engine parts and body armor A $1 billion fund Congress gave the Pentagon in March to build up the country’s supplies of medical equipment has instead been mostly funneled to defense contractors and used for making things such as jet engine parts, body armor and dress uniforms. The change illustrates how one taxpayer-backed effort to battle the novel coronavirus was instead diverted toward patching up long-standing perceived gaps in military supplies. The Cares Act, which Congress passed earlier this year, gave the Pentagon money to “prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus.” But a few weeks later, the Defense Department began reshaping how it would award the money in a way that represented a major departure from Congress’s original intent. The payments were made even though US health officials believe there are still major funding gaps in responding to the pandemic. The Post report that: Defense Department lawyers quickly determined that the funds could be used for defense production, a conclusion that Congress later disputed. Among the awards: $183 million to firms including Rolls-Royce and ArcelorMittal to maintain the shipbuilding industry; tens of millions of dollars for satellite, drone and space surveillance technology; $80 million to a Kansas aircraft parts business suffering from the Boeing 737 Max grounding and the global slowdown in air travel; and $2 million for a domestic manufacturer of Army dress uniform fabric.

That seems now not to be the case. Last night Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News: “We’ve got the votes to confirm justice Ginsburg’s replacement before the election. We’re going to move forward in the committee; we’re going to report the nomination out of the committee to the floor of the United States Senate so we can vote before the election.” Crucially, while Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Susan Collins of Maine in saying that they would not back moves to replace Ginsburg until the next president was elected, Charles Grassley of Iowa and Cory Gardner of Colorado, two of the three remaining Republicans who might have opposed filling the seat, announced that they would support moving ahead. That only leaves Mitt Romney in the balance. “Before I have any comment, I’m going to meet with my colleagues, which I’ll be doing tomorrow,” he told reporters. But his dissent alone would not be enough to derail Mitch McConnell’s plans to push the nomination through. Steve Contorno writes for the Tampa Bay Times today that Ginsburg’s death may help Trump and Republicans dismantle the Affordable Care Act. But, Contorno goes on to ask, will that hurt him in the most important swing state? With his third appointment to the high court, Republicans hope President Donald Trump can deliver the final blow to the Affordable Care Act after a decade of GOP efforts to dismantle the federal health care law. The supreme court is scheduled to revisit the law a week after election day in November. But the timing of that case coupled with the vacancy created by Ginsburg’s passing has the potential to alter the political landscape in Florida, the country’s largest battleground and where more people purchase coverage through the Affordable Care Act than in any other state. Former Vice President Joe Biden and his Democratic allies have for months sought to frame the race here around the healthcare fight, and their case is much clearer with the supreme court down a justice who has repeatedly voted to uphold the law. “For those Floridians, if they understand that Trump’s pick or his reelection means they lose their health care, that’s a game-changer,” said Rep. Kathy Castor, a Tampa Democrat. “Justice Ginsburg’s death is going to be a wake-up call when they hear that their health care weighs in the balance.” Read more here: Tampa Bay Times – How the Supreme Court vacancy could turn Florida presidential race into a fight over health care A Joe Biden win in Florida would significantly narrow Donald Trump’s possible paths to Electoral College victory in November. Francisco Alvarado has been in Miami reporting for us on the fight for Florida’s Latino voters. Recent polls show Biden has lost ground among Florida’s Latino voters compared to his predecessors Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, both of whom outperformed their Republican rivals among this key voting bloc. Trump and Biden are virtually tied in Florida, prompting the former vice-president to make his first campaign trip as his party’s earlier this week. Around the same time Mike Bloomberg announced he was committing $100m to turn this crucial swing state blue on 3 November. The “never-Trump” Republican outfit the Lincoln Project also announced it would produce ads targeting Florida’s Latino voters. Meanwhile, Trump is galvanizing his base of Latino conservative voters, especially Cuban Americans in strongholds like Hialeah, by undoing much of Obama’s historic policy to restore relations with Cuba, his hardline approach opposing the Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro, and smearing Biden and the Democratic party as communists and socialists hellbent on destroying America. Read it here: The fight for Florida’s Latino voters: Biden courts Puerto Ricans as Trump rallies Cubans Jeff Mason and Tim Reid from Reuters offer this analysis on what the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg has done for the direction of the Trump campaign. They say that Trump aides are pleased the focus of the election has moved, at least temporarily, to the supreme court rather than the president’s response to the coronavirus. “Trump would much rather make his campaign about the Supreme Court than a referendum on ... his handling of Covid,” Republican strategist Alex Conant told them. The Republican National Committee on Monday sent talking points to state party officials - aimed at Trump’s core evangelical and conservative base - stating that Trump had “an obligation to fill the seat” and that his court choices “will uphold the Constitution and rule of law.” The court vacancy could also play a significant and unpredictable role in races for the Senate, which the Republicans hold by a slim 53-47 majority. Steve Schmidt, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group of Republicans and former Republicans, said pushing through a nominee would endanger the party’s control of the Senate. “All the analysis that this is good for Republicans is wrong. It’s not good for Republicans. It’s terrible,” said Schmidt, who helped steer the confirmations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito during the George W. Bush years. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Sunday found that 62% of American adults want the winner of the November presidential election to name the new justice, while 23% disagreed and the rest said they were not sure. The Lincoln Project has announced a TV advertising campaign targeting Senator Lindsey Graham, who is seeking re-election in South Carolina. Graham opposed efforts by Barack Obama to fill a vacant Supreme Court seat in 2016, arguing it was inappropriate to do so in an election year. The Republican has of course flipped his views in 2020, and said he will support any move by Trump to fill Ginsburg’s seat. A Democratic Senate strategist who asked not to be named told Reuters that the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee will be pouring money into races that could impact any vote on Ginsburg’s replacement, including in Colorado, where Senator Cory Gardner is vulnerable. The focus this week is very much on the supreme court seat vacated by the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg, but as Tom McCarthy writes for us, Donald Trump’s success at appointing more than 200 conservative judges already in his first term amounts to a towering legacy. “I’m going to be up to 280 judges very soon,” Trump bragged to the journalist Bob Woodward in remarks that Woodward captured on tape and released Sunday. “Nobody’s ever had that. Two hundred and eighty. You know? Nobody’s ever had that.” Trump’s number was characteristically inflated: the number of judges he has placed on district- and circuit-court benches and the supreme court totals 214 (out of 865 total); a Ginsburg replacement would make 215. But Trump was exactly right that “nobody’s ever had that” many appointees to the bench so quickly – meaning that no president has done more to shape the future of American life under the law on issues from discrimination claims to marriage equality to gun control. Read it here: ‘Fill that seat’: why Trump’s courts power grab is more than just a political win Speaking of Russian interference in the 2016 US election, Adrian Horton has written for us about Agents of Chaos. It is a two-part series from Alex Gibney attempts to definitively explain Russian interference, from troll factories to hacking to a mutual ‘seduction’ of greed. Agents of Chaos, a two-part investigative HBO series on Russian interference in the 2016 election, confirms some of the most damning findings of the Senate report – for one, extensive contacts between the Trump campaign, particularly former manager Paul Manafort, and “a cadre of individuals ostensibly operating outside of the Russian government but who nonetheless implement Kremlin-directed influence operations.” But the series, from Oscar-winning film-maker Alex Gibney, also visualizes, with first-person interviews from some of the major figures, what the rare bipartisan consensus (on facts, not narrative) cannot: the diffuse, dubiously quantifiable efforts by the Russian government – sometimes tightly organized, sometimes slapdash – to sow chaos in Ukraine and then America, the profit motives which compelled bumbling Trump figures into a “collusion” of mutual interest, and the head-spinning vertigo for average American consumers over what even happened four years ago. Read more here: Agents of Chaos: a shocking look at what really happened in the 2016 election The Washington Post this morning has got some details from Andrew Weissmann’s book. They describe it as “an explosive tell-all that offers the most detailed account yet of what happened behind the scenes during Mueller’s two-year investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election”. A former prosecutor on special counsel Robert S. Mueller III’s team writes in a new book that the group failed to fully investigate President Trump’s financial ties and should have stated explicitly that they believed he obstructed justice, claiming that their efforts were limited by the ever-present threat of Trump disbanding their office and by their own reluctance to be aggressive. He lays particular blame on Mueller’s top deputy, Aaron Zebley, for stopping investigators from taking a broad look at Trump’s finances and writes that he now wonders whether investigators had “given it our all,” knowing they left many important questions unanswered. “As proud as I am of the work our team did — the unprecedented number of people we indicted and convicted and in record speed for any similar investigation — I know the hard answer to that simple question: We could have done more,” Weissmann writes. Read more here: Washington Post – Mueller prosecutor says special counsel ‘could have done more’ to hold Trump accountable Reuters report that a woman arrested on suspicion of sending a ricin-filled envelope to the White House and to five other addresses in Texas will appear before a federal court in Buffalo, New York, later today. She was arrested on the Canada-US border on Sunday and is due to make her initial appearance at 4pm ET. She has yet not been officially identified. Canadian police on Monday searched an apartment in a Montreal suburb linked to the woman. She has joint Canadian and French citizenship, two sources told Reuters. The woman is suspected of sending a total of six letters, with the other five addressed to law enforcement and detention facilities in South Texas, according to a US law enforcement source. So far no links to political or terrorist groups have been found, but the investigation is ongoing, the source said. Here’s a reminder of how yesterday Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell clashed with Democratic minority leader Chuck Schumer over the controversial timing of nominating and confirming a replacement for the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics for Tuesday. Here’s where we are, and what we might expect next. Trump cast doubts on Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s dying wish, claiming without any evidence whatsoever that leading Democrats wrote it. Republicans will move to fill the vacant supreme court seat as soon as possible, with Trump making his nomination on Friday or Saturday, despite polling shows a majority of the public thinks the nomination should be made by the winner of the presidential election. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will become the first woman to lie in state in the US Capitol on Friday. Rosa Parks was the first woman to lie in honor at the Capitol, a designation for non-office-holding citizens. There will be a private interment service for Ginsburg next week at Arlington National Cemetery. Democratic donors smashed fundraising records over the weekend, funneling more than $90m to candidates and progressive groups after the death of Ginsburg. There were 428 new coronavirus deaths and 54,875 new cases reported yesterday, which is an average of 7% more new daily cases than there were a fortnight ago. 17 states and Puerto Rico are seeing cases rise and stay high. Johns Hopkins University reports that the total death toll in the US stands at 199,886. The CDC removed information on the potential airborne transmission of coronavirus from its website. The agency had posted an update on Friday but it was then removed Monday, with the CDC claiming the update was posted in error. The news follows reports that Trump administration officials trying to interfere with CDC reports to paint a rosier picture about the pandemic. The Bobcat fire has become one of the largest in Los Angeles county history, with 156 sq miles burning. Video was released showing Utah police shooting at a boy with autism nearly a dozen times – his mother had called 911, requesting a mental health worker. After a summer where the president has angrily campaigned against calls to defund the police, the Department of Justice has labelled New York, Portland and Seattle ‘anarchist jurisdictions’, and plans to withdraw federal funds from the three cities. House Democrats released their stopgap government funding bill, which would keep the government open until 11 December. But Mitch McConnell quickly signaled he would not support the bill. The government is currently set to close on 30 September if a bill is not passed. Donald Trump will deliver remarks remotely to the UN General Assembly, which opens today. Also on the bill are Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, China’s Xi Jinping, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. Later on, in person, the president will be campaigning in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris is visiting Detroit and Flint today.

          "headline": "TikTok: why it is being sold and who will own it",
          "bodyText": "Why is TikTok for sale? Donald Trump has accused the video-sharing social networking service, which is wildly popular in the US, of being a threat to national security. He claims its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, would give the Chinese government access to user data upon request. TikTok denies the accusation. The US president has demanded a full sale of TikTok to an American owner. In August, he gave ByteDance 90 days to sell up or face a shutdown. He later issued twin executive orders banning US transactions with ByteDance and also the owner of the Chinese messaging and payments app WeChat. But later that month China complicated a potential sale, with an amendment to its export restrictions requiring companies to seek government approval before exporting Chinese tech. It was widely believed to be aimed at the technology driving TikTok’s algorithm – AI interfaces, voice recognition, and content recommendation analysis. Last week, the US department of commerce said if an acceptable deal was not reached it would ban new downloads and updates of TikTok from 20 September before banning the app completely on 12 November. The new deal. What is it? In an attempt to get Trump to cool his jets, ByteDance made a tentative deal over the weekend to create a US subsidiary called TikTok Global, part-owned by the US entities Oracle and Walmart. Four of the company’s five board members would be American, and the fifth likely to be the ByteDance founder, Zhang Yiming. Trump delayed Sunday’s ban by a week. The proposed ownership structure is murky, with conflicting statements from the different companies involved. Oracle and Walmart say they will own 20%, ByteDance says it will own 80% and will float the rest, bringing increased scrutiny in a move likely aiming to allay privacy concerns. Then there’s a statement attributed to Oracle’s vice president: “Upon creation of TikTok Global, Oracle/Walmart will make their investment and the TikTok Global shares will be distributed to their owners, Americans will be the majority and ByteDance will have no ownership in TikTok Global.” Got that? “There are competing claims [about ownership] because no one is really telling the full story,” said Prof Paul Haskell-Dowland, associate dean (Computing and Security), at Edith Cowan University in Perth, Australia. “The best information I can gather is that the Trump administration is supportive of the Oracle Walmart combined bid while at the same time saying the whole ownership must be in the US. But at the same time you’ve got the Chinese owners saying they are retaining the majority share [of 80%]. Then you’ve got news releases from Oracle and Walmart about their respective proposed percentages which amount to 20% with a 12.5% to 7.5% split.” If ByteDance retains 80%, and Haskell-Dowland said they’ve made it clear they don’t intend to completely divest, then the deal won’t meet Trump’s expectations of US ownership. “They actually have no authority to reject the bid, but they can put hurdles in place and they can reinstate the ban,” Haskell-Dowland said. Is the TikTok algorithm still an issue? Absolutely, said Haskell-Dowland. TikTok is still indicating it is not seeking to provide the algorithms driving the apps’ recommendations to the new buyer. “So either it would have to be redeveloped, and that could be part of Oracle’s contribution, or there would have to be some compromise by the parties,” he said. “The platform is valuable because of the algorithm. Oracle and Walmart can still make money out of the platform … but without the key features a lot of the user base will move on.” TikTok’s recommendation algorithm relies on domestic technology. Last month Bloomberg likened a sale of TikTok without the algorithm to a sale of KFC without the 11 secret herbs and spices. What next? The deal seems to be “changing by the hour”, said Haskell-Dowland. China and the US will likely engage in a bit more back and forth over the structure of the deal. Haskell-Dowland says in the end, it’s a political fight between two sparring nations, and not really to do with national security or intellectual property. At the moment, it looks like China is winning since they hold the ace card: the technology. But if Trump rejects the deal and bans the app, he might chalk it up as a win, albeit one that makes a lot of young Americans unhappy. Then there’s WeChat, which is also in Trump’s sights but has been running along a slightly different track. A US court overturned a ban on the messaging app, finding that WeChat users who filed a lawsuit “have shown serious questions going to the merits of the first amendment claim, the balance of hardships tips in the plaintiffs’ favour”."

          "headline": "Twitter apologises for 'racist' image-cropping algorithm",
          "bodyText": "Twitter has apologised for a “racist” image cropping algorithm, after users discovered the feature was automatically focusing on white faces over black ones. The company says it had tested the service for bias before it started using it, but now accepts that it didn’t go far enough. Twitter has long automatically cropped images to prevent them taking up too much space on the main feed, and to allow multiple pictures to be shown in the same tweet. The company uses several algorithmic tools to try to focus on the most important parts of the picture, trying to ensure that faces and text remain in the cropped part of an image. But users began to spot flaws in the feature over the weekend. The first to highlight the issue was PhD student Colin Madland, who discovered the issue while highlighting a different racial bias in the video-conference software Zoom. When Madland, who is white, posted an image of himself and a black colleague who had been erased from a Zoom call after its algorithm failed to recognise his face, Twitter automatically cropped the image to only show Madland. Others followed up with more targeted experiments, including entrepreneur Tony Arcieri, who discovered that the algorithm would consistently crop an image of US senator Mitch McConnell and Barack Obama to hide the former president. Similar outcomes were found for stock photo models, Simpsons characters Lenny and Carl, and even golden labradors and black labradors. In a statement, a Twitter spokesperson admitted the company had work to do. “Our team did test for bias before shipping the model and did not find evidence of racial or gender bias in our testing. But it’s clear from these examples that we’ve got more analysis to do. We’ll continue to share what we learn, what actions we take, and will open source our analysis so others can review and replicate.” Twitter is by no means the first technology firm to find itself struggling to explain apparent racial bias in its algorithms. In 2018, it was revealed that Google had simply banned its Photos service from ever labelling anything as a gorilla, chimpanzee, or monkey, after the company had come under fire for repeatedly mislabelling images of black people with those racist terms."

          "headline": "Contact-tracing app for England and Wales 'hampered by loss of public trust'",
          "bodyText": "Dominic Cummings’ lockdown travels and the exams fiasco could have contributed to dooming the government’s Covid contact-tracing app before it even launches, a technology expert has warned. Evidence of low uptake overseas also suggests the app may not live up to ministers’ early hopes of a panacea. In late May, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, admitted it was “the cherry on the cake but [not] the cake”; in recent weeks it has barely been mentioned. The app, which is due to launch in England and Wales on Thursday 24 September, will use the bluetooth signal in mobile phones to track close and sustained contact between users and then warn those who may have been exposed to an infectious person that they should self-isolate. But to succeed at that goal, the app will need to be installed by a large proportion of the public. That could be hard to achieve, warned Imogen Parker, the head of policy at the tech thinktank Ada Lovelace Institute, because of a series of trust-diminishing scandals over the summer. “In the original modelling, which made the case for a contact tracing app, the magic number to suppress transmission effectively would be 60% - or 80% of smart phones users – downloading, running and adhering to the app. But internationally, the best case scenario we’ve seen has been about 40% uptake, and that’s in countries where the majority of the population lives in a single urban area, and have had apps for longer, like Iceland and Singapore. Examples from larger countries like Germany, and geographically and culturally closer countries like Ireland and Scotland, suggest we’re looking more like 18-30% a few weeks after launch,” she said. “In the UK, uptake is going to be related to trust in government. While we were doing some public work on trust over May, you had the Barnard Castle incident; after that you had the A-level algorithm. But the flip side is that the NHS brand itself is incredibly trusted.” Parker also raised alarm at the prospect of large numbers of people being advised to self-isolate based on “false positive” results. “The best data I’ve seen suggests 45% false positives and 33% false negatives,” she said, “but phone proximity isn’t everything. The growing body of evidence about things like the substantially limited risk outside versus inside really matters. We need to make sure the app can identify risk, not just identify phones.” The latest version of the contact-tracing app is substantially rebuilt from an earlier version. It was pulled from public release at the last minute after tests in the Isle of Wight revealed several flaws with the iPhone version. Some of those changes should help increase uptake and efficacy, said the University of Oxford’s Prof Christophe Fraser, a scientific adviser to the national test-and-trace programme. “We and others have shown through simulations, where we show the integration of the app with manual tracing, social distancing, and so on, even 10 to 15% uptake can have an effect,” he says. The newest version of the app is built with a framework created by Apple and Google, which means it can begin working even before it is installed on devices. It also includes a QR code-led “check-in” function, which lets users record that they have been to public locations and receive alerts for any outbreak linked to that venue. Those features, Fraser says, should help people see that the app isn’t just important for public health but for individual outcomes too. That means that even “false positive” warnings can be useful. “Localised contact tracing provides information, even if you’re not infectious,” he said. “It’s not really a ‘false positive’, because it’s very important to know that Covid-19 is spreading in your local area. We’re faced with a difficult winter, a grave winter, and every little behavioural nudge matters. A little bit of ventilation, mask wearing and hand hygiene does make a difference.” The Department of Health and Social Care has been approached for comment. • This article was amended on 21 and 22 September 2020. Point number seven in the graphic was amended because it is the app user’s personal bluetooth key that is uploaded to a central server, not the data gathered by their phone as an earlier version said. This article was further amended to correctly quote Imogen Parker."

          "headline": "UK coronavirus live: officials meeting today to consider case for new restrictions for London, says Hancock",
          "bodyText": "Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has warned that the UK is at a “tipping point” nationally, while new coronavirus restrictions on London could be introduced in the coming days. Hancock has said that people should report anyone failing to self-isolate to the police - apparently contradicting Boris Johnson, who said last week he had “never much been in favour of sneak culture myself”. Asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr whether he would snitch on a neighbour to police himself, Hancock said: Yes. And for the self-isolation part, that is absolutely necessary because that is how we break the chains of transmission. Sir Keir Starmer has said that the government should act “in the next few days” to tackle the rising number of coronavirus cases, instead of waiting for weeks. (See 10.20am.) Starmer has said that Labour should be less shy about expressing its patriotism. (See 12.26pm.) Shortly after he made the comment in an interview on Times Radio, his deputy Angela Rayner used her speech to Labour’s virtual conference to argue that the “fire and rehire” policies being adopted by some major firms were not just immoral but unBritish. (See 12.19pm.) She said: Mass firing, and re-hiring, on lower pay and worse terms, using the threat of the dole queue to pick the pockets of the very staff who have kept those companies going. So I say to companies like British Airways and British Gas. If you use our country’s name, then you better respect our country’s values. Rayner used her speech to condemn Boris Johnson as a “Bullingdon Club blagger” less equipped to serve as prime minister than any of his predecessors. (See 12.19pm.) I’m afraid this blog is wrapping up now because I’m required elsewhere in the virtual newsroom. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. The Conservative party has put out this response to what Sir Keir Starmer was saying in his morning interviews this morning. It is from Amanda Milling, the Conservative party co-chair. She said: This morning Sir Keir Starmer showed that he’s more interested in criticising and blaming than setting out a credible, alternative plan. Sir Keir failed to set out how Labour’s testing policy would work, failed to back a future trade deal with the EU, failed to back the union and couldn’t name a single policy difference between him and Jeremy Corbyn. During conference season the main parties always put out statements criticising what’s been said by their opponents. Journalists often ignore them because they tend not to tell us anything new. But this statement is moderately interesting because it shows just how hard CCHQ is finding it to develop a credible line of attack against Starmer. They accuse him of not backing a Brexit trade deal, even though he did. They accuse him of not backing the union with Scotland, even though he did. And they accuse him of being too similar to Jeremy Corbyn, when everyone knows he isn’t. The only critique that has some truth in it is that Starmer has not set an alternative Covid plan. But Starmer is quite deliberately not setting out an alternative Covid plan; he is just saying that the existing plan (ie, testing) should actually work. Speaking at Labour’s virtual conference, Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, said the government’s handling of coronavirus had been “hapless”. He said: Unfortunately, and it gives me no pleasure to say this, we’ve all been catastrophically let down by the government. If ministers had risen to this moment, as the British public have, then the loss of many lives and much of the economic hardship could have been avoided. These times called for a government that could put ideology, dogma and ego aside, and calmly and competently do whatever it takes to save lives and jobs. Unfortunately, we got the exact opposite. Just when we required a steady, capable hand on the tiller, we’ve had a hapless government that keeps on steering us onto the rocks. Since it’s Labour conference, here are three books about the party that have landed on my desk - two recently, one around the start of lockdown - that I would recommend. Left Out, the Inside Story of Labour under Corbyn, by Gabriel Pogrund and Patrick Maguire - This has already had plenty of rave reviews, and it really is every bit as good a people say; superbly written, exceptionally detailed, scrupulously fair, but above all gripping. It’s hard to put down. Sample extract: At his best [Jeremy Corbyn] was Delphic; at his worst he was gnomic. It fell instead to his team to decode and debate what little he did say, in the hope they might claim it as a victory for their own competing agendas. One one occasion [Seumas] Milne, [Karie] Murphy and [Andrew] Fisher were forced to do just that, arguing over the meaning of what Corbyn had said as he sat in silence. Another aide recalled: ‘Jeremy sat there, and didn’t speak to offer any clarity whatsoever on what he’d meant. So he was just there, and I remember thinking, “this is mental”. They were interpreting his words in front of him, while he wasn’t saying anything ... It was like he didn’t feel the need to clarify of take control of the situation.’ Beyond the Red Wall by Deborah Mattinson - A former pollster to Gordon Brown, Mattinson is one of Britain’s leading focus group/public opinion experts and this book is her attempt to explain why Red Wall voters abandoned Labour in 2019. It’s clear and compelling. Every Labour MP should have to read a copy, because there is no route back to power without addressing the issues she illuminates. Sample extract: In March 2020, BritainThinks ran a citizens’ jury for the thinktank Labour Together, an organisation seeking to unite the warring Labour party factions ... Asked to create the ‘ideal’ political party, a team drawn from Red Wall constituencies brainstormed with enthusiasm. They summed up their thinking with the slogan ‘Let’s Make Britain Great Again’. The knowing nod to Trump led to a spontaneous chant of ‘Let’s build a wall,’ which everyone joined with joking and laughing. ‘Where would the wall be?’ I asked, wondering if they were referring to the Red Wall, but I was quickly corrected. ‘No! We’ll build a wall around London!’ shouted one and everyone cheered. They could not have been clearer: keeping Londoners in their place would be a very desirable outcome indeed. Warring Fictions: Left Populism and its Defining Myths, by Chris Clarke - This came out earlier this year and, although it says very little about Corbyn, or his policies, it provides real insight into Corbynism by anatomising the mindset of left populism, a key element of the phenomenon. Wide-ranging, clever and original, it’s a vital read for anyone interested in not just left populism, but any sort of populism at all. Sample extract: Beneath this is a deeper truth, which is that consensuses are seldom shaped from opposition. There’s no ‘Duncan Smith’ consensus and no ‘Foot consensus’. Parties almost always need to start inside the Overton Window, before they’re trusted to move it. This acknowledgement is a central difference between left pluralism and left populism. The former’s theory-of-change is based on meeting people where they are and shifting the mainstream; the latter’s is based on taking stances from beyond the window, which drag the mainstream leftwards. The latter approach is flawed, even in the case of Corbyn. Labour’s better-than-expected 207 performance may be seen as proof by some that a radical opposition can make the running. Yet this was enabled by major concessions to the mainstream of the day - on Trident, welfare, Brexit and immigration. It came against a Tory leader who had inadvertently placed herself outside the mainstream. And it was still unsuccessful. This is what Sir Keir Starmer told Times Radio this morning about Labour and patriotism. (See 11.11am.) I think in the Labour party we’ve been very shy about patriotism for too many years. I love my country, I think we’re a great country, I think we could be even better, and I think the Labour party, the Labour movement, actually wants the very best for the country. That’s why we go out knocking on doors, campaigning, trying to form the next government, because we want better for our country. So I think we should not be so shy, we should be proud of being patriotic, and in many senses that reflects the values of the Labour party. And I’m very clear about that. Here is the full text of Angela Rayner’s speech to the virtual Labour conference. It did not contain any announcements, or anything particular surprising, but deputy leaders’ speeches at Labour conference are usually devoted to political knockabout, and this had plenty of punchy, well-scripted attack lines. Here are some highlights. Rayner condemned Boris Johnson as a “Bullingdon Club blagger” who was less equipped to serve as prime minister than any of his predecessors. She said: Never has there been a prime minister more out of his depth and ill-equipped to the task than this Bullingdon Club blagger. He lights up Downing Street green for Grenfell and then whips Tory MPs to block the Grenfell inquiry recommendations. He claps for our carers when it suits him for a photo opportunity. But he doesn’t even know what they earn, and won’t pay them what they deserve. He calls a Covid war cabinet meeting to allow grouse shooting when frontline staff can’t get the tests they need and people can’t say goodbye to their loved ones. Yet it’s always someone else’s fault. Civil servants. The public health body they voted to create in the first place. Or even the public – for doing the right thing and trying to get a Covid test ... [Johnson’s] hero Thatcher once said ‘advisers advise, but ministers decide’. Now the motto seems to be ‘ministers decide, but advisers resign.’ He’d probably make the algorithm resign if he could. She paid a lavish tribute to key workers. She said: This crisis has shown who we cannot survive without. The NHS and social care staff who have put their lives on the line. The posties, bus drivers, shop workers, delivery drivers and so many others who have kept us all safe, fed and connected. She also said Labour would be pushing in particular for people doing these sorts of jobs to stand for the party in the council elections next year. She stressed her own working class background, how much she gained personally from Labour achievements like Sure Start and the national wage, and how much her life experiences different from those of Boris Johnson and some of his cabinet colleagues. She said: My first step in politics wasn’t in the Oxford Union, it was in my trade union. Not debating for bragging rights at the bar but negotiating because our livelihoods depended on it. I know which Union I’d rather be in. Because I was born in Stockport, but I was made in our movement. I never went to university, but when I joined my union I found an education and a vocation. She suggested that the “fire and rehire” policies being adopted by some major firms were not just immoral but unpatriotic. She explained: Mass firing, and re-hiring, on lower pay and worse terms, using the threat of the dole queue to pick the pockets of the very staff who have kept those companies going. So I say to companies like British Airways and British Gas. If you use our country’s name, then you better respect our country’s values. And if they won’t end fire and rehire, it’s time the government stepped up and ended it for them. This was probably the most Starmeresque line in the speech. Earlier today Sir Keir Starmer told Times Radio that he wanted the party to sound more patriotic. (See 11.11am.) Here Rayner was rather neatly doing just that, wrapping a conventional Labour workers’ rights argument in the union flag. Q: Does Labour need a majority of working class votes at the next election? Yes, says Starmer. It needs to earn those votes. (At the last election the Conservatives had a greater share of working class votes than Labour did.) And that’s it. The Times Radio interview is over. Q: If someone voted leave, hates their country being called racist, wants immigration to be controlled and wants a life sentence to mean a life sentence, would they be welcome at a Labour meeting? Starmer says he wants all views to be respected. The party has 580,000 members. People won’t always agree. He says he is committed to rooting out factionalism. Q: You say Labour is under new leadership. But your policy agenda is the same as the old one. Starmer says saying Labour is under new leadership goes beyond policy. Trust in Labour has been damaged, he says. He needs to restore trust in the party. Until you do that, you will not get a hearing on policy. He says when he goes out, he asks to meet people who no longer vote Labour. He does not just want rallies with supporters. Q: Do those pledges still hold? Starmer says Covid means the challenges facing the UK are now even greater than they were. We cannot go through the anguish of the last six months and then return to business as usual, he says. Q: Your 10 pledges imply you still want free movement? Starmer says now the UK has left the EU, free movement no longer applies. But he says people do want the benefits it brought. Gloria De Piero, the former Labour MP turned Times Radio presenter, says Labour has been running adverts this week saying the PM should get Brexit done. But Starmer used to back a second referendum. Which is the real Keir Starmer? Starmer says the UK has left the EU. The remain/leave debate is over. He says some of the options on offer in the last parliament were not ideal. Q: Isn’t the government right to hold firm on state aid and fishing? Starmer says he thinks a deal can be struck on both issues. And he is sceptical of the government’s arguments on state aid because the UK does not spent as much on state aid as currently allowed under EU rules. Times Radio is now broadcasting its interview with Sir Keir Starmer. He started by saying that he thought Labour needed to do more to show its patriotism. Asked if he would be happy to wave the union jack, he said he had done in the past and would be happy to do so again in the future. UPDATE: See 12.26pm for the full quote. Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary, told Sky News this morning that he was not worried “at the moment” about the direction in which Sir Keir Starmer was taking Labour. Starmer should stick with the progressive, ambitious agenda developed under Jeremy Corbyn, McCuskey said. And he said that leftwingers in the party had been much more respectful to Starmer than rightwingers had been to Corbyn. Sky’s Sam Coates says there are members of the cabinet who agree with Prof Carl Heneghan’s argument that imposing further restrictions now would be a mistake. (See 10.45am.) Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, is about to deliver her speech to Labour’s online conference. You can watch it here. I will post a summary once I’ve seen the full text. Here is my colleague Heather Stewart’s story about Matt Hancock’s comments this morning. In an interview on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday Prof Carl Heneghan, director for the centre of evidence-based medicine at Oxford University, said there was no evidence that we are seeing a second wave of coronavirus and that it would be a mistake to impose harsh restrictions now. He explained: What we’re seeing is that the virus is operating in a seasonal way. As we’ve gone back to schools, actually what’s happened now is we’ve seen about a 60% increase in consultations for all the acute respiratory infections and that’s what’s driving the problems in the test and trace programme. All the young children who have coughs and colds and these infections, one is called rhinovirus. As we look at the data, Covid is operating in a similar seasonal way, and mirroring those respiratory infections, so what we have to do now is slow down, this is a long winter. Heneghan said that it would be wrong to impose a new lockdown now. “We can’t afford to go now with harsh measures,” he said. “The impact on the economy here is going to be significant.” It was better to be vigilant. If it becomes worse and it impacts on disease, then, yes, that’s the point when we have restrictive measures, but that time is not now. Q: Will people in London be told to work from home from this week? Hancock says he would not rule that out. On Times Radio Gloria De Piero (the former Labour MP who co-presents the programme with Newton Dunn) asks when Cobra will next meet to discuss coronavirus. Hancock says an alternative decision making structure is in place now. But he says that does not mean Cobra won’t meet again. Q: Will you bring back daily press conferences? Hancock says they have been holding them when necessary. There was one last week. Matt Hancock is now being interviewed by Tom Newton Dunn on Times Radio. So far much of the interview has replicated what Hancock was saying in his other two interviews this morning, but Newton Dunn also asked why NHS Test and Trace failed to anticipate the extra demand for tests. Didn’t they realise children get sniffles when they return to school? Hancock said what they did not anticipate was the number of people without symptoms requesting tests. This is what Sir Keir Starmer told Andrew Marr when Marr asked if he wanted to see further restrictions imposed now. Under Starmer Labour has backed the government’s coronavirus measures, and generally he has avoided advocating an alternative Covid strategy. He has said it is important for public messaging to be clear, and he told Marr he did not want to second guess the PM. But, when pressed by Marr, Starmer said it would be wrong for the government to delay imposing further restrictions (as Johnson is reportedly considering - see 9.53am.) After referring to what Prof Neil Ferguson said yesterday, Marr suggested that bold decisions were needed from leaders now. Starmer replied: Take swift action, do it in the next few days, don’t leave it for two to four weeks ... I want swift action, if necessary local restrictions, look at a national lockdown. The government has got the figures. But I don’t want to leave it two or four weeks. Marr turns to Scotland. As Sophy Ridge did earlier (see 8.50am), he quotes Starmer saying in January that an SNP majority in next year’s elections would create a mandate for a second referendum. Starmer insists Labour will be arguing against one between now and next May. Q: Mark Drakeford, the Welsh first minister, said Westminster should not block a referendum if the Scottish people want one. Starmer repeats the point about Labour being opposed to the idea in principle. Q: And what if the SNP win? Starmer says he does not want to start being “hypothetical”. Marr points out that Starmer already set out his view in January. And that’s it. The interview is over. Q: Should the Brexit transition be extended? Starmer says he does not think that is necessary. He thinks a deal can be achieved. The government should do what it promised. Q: What do you want - extension or no deal? Starmer says he does not think you have to choose. A deal is possible. Starmer says he does not support raising taxes now. But, before the election in 2024, Labour will present its plans for addressing the debt. Q: Are you in favour of a wealth tax? Starmer says it does not make sense to set out tax plans so far ahead of a general election. Writing the manifesto now, four years early, in the middle of a pandemic “does not seem to me very sensible”, he says. Q: Neil Ferguson says action is needed now. Do you support that? Starmer says local restrictions and national restrictions might be needed. And he say it would be a mistake to wait for several weeks. According to today’s Sunday Times (paywall), Boris Johnson is meeting officials to discuss options for further restrictions today. It says Johnson “will reject calls from scientists for an immediate two-week ‘circuit breaker’ lockdown after being urged by the chancellor to minimise the number of businesses affected by any new curbs. It is still under consideration for the half-term fortnight next month.” UPDATE: See 10.20am for the full quote. Sir Keir Starmer is now being interviewed by the BBC’s Andrew Marr. Marr starts with coronavirus, and Starmer is broadly repeated the points that he made on Sky earlier - that testing needs to be fixed, that the PM should apologise, that he should have fixed this over the summer, but that Labour would support new restrictions. Q: Do you think £10,000 fines are too draconian? Starmer says it is important to take action against the few people who are not complying with the rules. Q: Would you dob in your neighbour? Starmer says the police have got this right. They have focused on encouraging people to obey the rules. But where people aren’t, action should be taken. Q: Boris Johnson calls you Captain Hindsight? Starmer says Labour said earlier that testing needed to be sorted out. That was foresight, he says. Q: Would you back a lockdown now? Starmer says he does not want to second guess what the PM is doing. Scotland’s health secretary Jeane Freeman has raised concerns about the impact of the newly-announced Covid fines on working people. Freeman said this morning: We understand that very many people are in low paid jobs, with fragile contracts, sometimes in really difficult circumstances, so we need to win people to this fight with us. Simply imposing fines on them if they don’t, in and on itself won’t be sufficient. Those are big numbers which very many people would be completely beyond their capabilities. Freeman told BBC Breakfast on Sunday that the Scottish government would announce new restrictions very shortly, “not necessarily today, but definitely by the early part of next week”. Yesterday, first minister Nicola Sturgeon reiterated her call for a four nations Cobra meeting in the next 48 hours. Q: Boris Johnson said tests would be turned around in 24 hours. That is not happening. Hancock says around half of people get a result the following day. (Within 24 hours and the next day are not the same thing. Now the government is focusing on the latter measure.) Q: When do you think a useable vaccine might arrive? Hancock says the Oxford vaccine is still at the front of the queue. It could arrive this year. But it is more likely to come early next year. There is still hope that we will get one of the vaccines over the line this year. The Oxford vaccine is still at the front of the queue. More likely is next year, and probably the early part of next year. We have got the cavalry coming over the next few months - the vaccine, the mass testing and the improvements in treatments - but we have got to all follow the rules between now and then to keep people safe. Q: And if they don’t, how many people might die? Hancock says he does not know. And that’s it. The interview is over. Q: Dido Harding said up to 1m people might be asking for a test every day. How many are getting them? Hancock says it is over 200,000. Q: So just one in five? Hancock says the number of people asking for tests has gone down this week. Q: You said people had a duty to get a test. You said, if in doubt, people should get them. Hancock says he meant if people were in doubt about their symptoms. He says 100,000 tests per day are going to care homes. It would be politically easier to give those tests to others, he says. Asked if the government is considering a further national lockdown, Hancock says he is not ruling it out. Q: Death rates are very low. Are you over-reacting? No, says Hancock. He says death rates are a lagging indicator. We have seen in other countries when the case rate shoots up, the next thing that happens is the numbers going into hospital shoot up. Sadly, we have seen that rise, it is doubling every eight days or so - people going into hospital - then, with a lag, you see the number of people dying sadly rise. He says you can compare the UK to two countries. One gives a warning, another gives hope. Spain saw the number of cases going up. At first people said, like Marr, that death rates were not going up. But they are now. Belgium took a different approach. He says, as soon as cases started rising, it brought in restrictions. Q: They weren’t very popular ... Hancock says he is not interested in popularity. Q: What about Sweden? Hancock says Sweden does not provide a better model. It did impose some rules. And people followed strict social distancing measures voluntarily. But it has still had a much higher death rate than its neighbouring countries. Matt Hancock is now being interviewed by the BBC’s Andrew Marr. Marr presses him on whether he would report on a neighbour breaking the rules. He points out that Boris Johnson ruled this out last week. Hancock initially stresses the fact that most people are following the rules, but when pressed he says he would report someone to the police. This is what Matt Hancock told Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday about the possibility of restrictions in London. The first line of defence is people’s behaviour. But then, after that, local lockdowns are necessary, and I’ve brought in local action right across different parts of the country where cases are rising ... I’ve had discussions this week with the mayor of London [Sadiq Khan] and the teams are meeting today to discuss further what might be needed. In a statement issued on Friday Khan said he was “extremely concerned” about the “accelerating speed” of new Covid cases in London and that it was “increasingly likely” new restrictions would have to be imposed soon Q: Do you have the stamina for the fight ahead? Yes, says Hancock. He says incredibly motivated to do the right thing. He says he could increase the number of tests available for drive-through centres. But that would mean taking some away from care homes. He wants to do the right thing, he says. He says in Belgium they were seeing a second wave. But they brought in new restrictions, essentially on socialising, and that enabled them to bring the second wave under control. He says “we can get through this - until the cavalry comes” in the form of mass testing, vaccines and treatments. And that’s it. The Hancock interview is over. Hancock says he is not apologising for the performance of NHS Test and Trace. He defends what staff have done. Hancock says his officials are meeting today to consider the need for lockdown measures in London. He says he has discussed this with Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London. Khan wants new restrictions imposed in the capital from as early as tomorrow. UPDATE: See 9.20am for the full quote. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is now being interviewed on Sky. He says the nation is at a tipping point. If people do not follow the rules, including the rule of six, further restrictions may be necessary. The nation faces a tipping point. We have a choice. Either everybody follows the rules - the rule of six and the need to self-isolate if you have a positive test or if you are contacted by NHS Test and Trace - or we will have to take more measures. I don’t want to see more measures, more restrictive measures, but if people don’t follow the rules that is how the virus spreads. He says the rules are being toughened. Q: If you knew somebody was breaking the rules, would you report them? Yes, says Hancock. And everyone should. Hancock says people should report anyone ignoring social distancing or self-isolation rules. When Boris Johnson was asked a similar question in an interview with the Sun last week, he was not as explicit as this, saying he did not approve of a “sneak culture”. He repeats the point about the need for people to follow the rules. And if they have the virus, they have to self-isolate. Q: Are people following the rule of six? Hancock says people did relax over the summer. But they must follow the rules. If he was not worried about this, the government would not be introducing £10,000 fines. But the government is also offering much more support to people who do need to self-isolate. He says self-isolating isn’t like being in lockdown. You must not leave your home. Q: Why are you a vegetarian? Starmer says he gave up meat a long time ago, for the body and for the environment. But he does miss meat, he says. And that’s it. The interview is over. Q: If the SNP win the Scottish parliament elections, should there be another independence referendum? Starmer says Labour does not want a second referendum. He say the Tories are focusing on Brexit and the SNP on independence. But they should be focusing on coronavirus. He says there should be a Cobra meeting on Covid. Q: In January you said, if the SNP won a majority at Holyrood, they would have a mandate for a referendum. Starmer says, if the SNP win a majority, that will have to be looked at by Westminster. But Labour will be arguing against that. Q: So there should be a second referendum? Starmer sidesteps the question. He says he wants to focus on “the here and now” for the moment. Q: You wanted a second referendum. But now you are telling the PM to deliver Brexit. Will you back any deal? Starmer says he will consider the deal. But a deal is in the national interest. The PM promised a deal. He signed the withdrawal agreement. Did he know what was in it? If he did, why did he mis-sell it to the public? Or was it incompetence - not knowing what was in the deal? Q: Do you really want to move on? Or is this just a political position? Starmer says the last parliament could not agree on anything. Q: What are your principles? Starmer says the UK is out of the EU. The leave/remain debate is over. But of course he wants to get into power, he says. That is what he is politics for. He wants to change lives. And you don’t do that from opposition. Q: What is your message for the Labour conference? Starmer says he wants to stress that Labour has a new leadership. He has spent the last six months listening to what people think about the party. He is focused on 2024. Q: It’s not very subtle, is it? Corbynites won’t like this. Starmer says they lost the last four elections. He is listening to people. And he will take decisive action, for example on anti-semitism. He says Jewish groups told him they would judge him by his actions, not his words. He is happy with that. Starmer says children should be prioritised for testing, like NHS key workers. They should be able to get a test within 24 hours, and results within 24 hours. Q: How much extra testing capacity would be needed for this? Starmer says the government should have increased testing capacity over the summer. Q: But what is needed now? Starmer says Sage said some time ago that, in the autumn, 500,000 people might have Covid symptoms at any one time. So they knew what the demand would be. The system should be able to test 500,000 people a day. Q: Isn’t it unrealistic to prioritise children, when so many other people need tests too? Starmer says this problem has been known about for months. He says parents have seen children, or whole classes, sent home. And this is not going to end. It could go on for months, he says. He says that does not amount to a meaningful return to school. He says everyone knows that children get bugs at school. He cannot believe the government did not scenario plan for this. Sky’s Sophy Ridge is interviewing Sir Keir Starmer now. She starts by asking if he backs the government plans briefed overnight for fines of up to £10,000 on people who refuse to self-isolate. Starmer says he does support these plans. But he say that he thinks in most cases people are obeying the rules. There are a few people that are breaking the rules and something has to be done about that. I have to say that I think that is not going to be the silver bullet, that isn’t going to deal with the problem we’re in. We’ve got rising infection rates, I think the whole country is concerned about that, but we have a testing system, just as we need it to be effective, is barely serviceable and this is a major problem. Q: Would you support the government if it calls another national lockdown? Starmer says he does not think a second national lockdown is inevitable. The priority is to sort out testing, he says. If he were the PM, he would apologise for the problems with testing. He would make fixing it his first priority. And he would bring back the daily briefings, he says. In his Sunday Times interview Sir Keir Starmer also said, when asked if he watched the Queen’s address to the nation on Christmas day, that he watched it live. “In times of crisis and in difficult times people do look to the monarch as a voice and a symbol of what it is that we are as a country,” he said. (The question was probably prompted by the criticism Jeremy Corbyn received when he answered a question on this last year.) Starmer was also asked if he would every be willing as PM to use a nuclear weapon. He replied: “That’s not a question anybody who’s serious about being prime minister will ever answer.” In fact, many prime ministers and leaders of the opposition have said they would be willing to use the nuclear deterrent in extreme circumstances - although generally they never discuss how extreme those circumstances would have to be. At least two of the Sunday newspapers have interviews with Sir Keir Starmer ahead of the Labour conference. Nigel Nelson has spoken to him for the Sunday Mirror and his article is headlined: “Keir Starmer slams Boris Johnson as ‘not up to it’ - but offers to help save Christmas”. Summarising Starmer’s message, Nelson says the Labour leader believes “opposition politicians have a duty to pull together to rescue Britain because the PM is so useless”. That does not sound quite the way Starmer normally phrases things, but it does seem a reasonable summary of his message. Starmer told Nelson: The PM isn’t up to the job. What people have seen for weeks and months is a pattern of refusing to acknowledge a problem exists, then doing a U-turn, and finally shifting the blame on to someone else. I appreciate this is not easy and, if it was just a matter of one or two U-turns, that’s understandable. But he’s done 12. That’s serial incompetence. We are a constructive opposition and will support the government when it gets it right and challenge it when it’s wrong. And Caroline Wheeler has interviewed Starmer for the Sunday Times (paywall). For their headline, the Sunday Times have chosen a softish line - albeit one that does not reflect well on Labour MP. It says: “Once you’ve worked with donkeys, Labour MPs are a breeze.” Starmer’s parents used to look after rescue donkeys and Starmer told Wheeler: It’s quite tough to get a donkey to do something it doesn’t want to. It probably gave me skills in life ... The skills you learn in terms of patience, tolerance and persuasion ... have probably served me well in other areas. Good morning. Today was meant to be the first full day of the Labour party conference in Liverpool. Now it has been reduced to what effectively sounds like a prolonged Zoom call but some conference fixtures remain. There will be major speeches from the leading figures in the shadow cabinet, the Sunday papers are more Labour-heavy than usual and Sir Keir Starmer is doing a series of broadcast interviews this morning. Of course, the coronavirus crisis dominates everything. Overnight Starmer has called on the government to prioritise children for testing. In a statement he said: If the prime minister does not get a grip of the testing crisis, children will be robbed of an education. We are seeing a growing flood of schools closures. The testing regime is not working, nor does it appreciate the unique challenges many families are having to cope with. That is why I’m urging the prime minister, like our key workers, to put children at the front of the queue for testing. To this week give parents a cast iron guarantee that they can get their child a test within 24 hours and the result back 24 hours later. In response, the Conservatives issued this statement from their co-chairman, Amanda Milling. She said: We urge Sir Keir to set aside the political point scoring and work with the government to control the virus and protect lives based on clinical advice. Making sure that children who have coronavirus symptoms get a test is already a priority for NHS Test and Trace. This helps reassure parents and protect teachers and children and keep schools open. A lot of parents who were trying unsuccessfully to get tests for their children last week may be surprised to learn that they were being prioritised. But no doubt we will hear more on this soon from Matt Hancock, the health secretary, who is also giving interviews this morning. Here is the agenda for the day. 8.30am: Sir Keir Starmer is interviewed on Sky’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, and Len McCluskey, the Unite general secretary are also on the programme. 9am: Starmer and Hancock are also interview on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show. 10am: Labour’s online conference, Labour Connected, starts. The opening remarks will be broadcast here, but most events are from members only. 10am: Starmer and Hancock are also interviewed on Times Radio. 11am: Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, speaks at the Labour conference. Here is our global coronavirus live blog. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions, and if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow."

          "headline": "Why Boris Johnson is constantly surprised when his government fails",
          "bodyText": "When Philip Tetlock and Dan Gardner published their much-discussed book, Superforecasting, one admiring reviewer thought it contained essential lessons for governing. He wrote: “Forecasts have been fundamental to mankind’s journey from a small tribe on the African savannah to a species that can sling objects across the solar system with extreme precision. In physics, we developed models that are extremely accurate across vastly different scales from the sub-atomic to the visible universe. In politics, we bumbled along making the same sort of errors repeatedly.” Presumably in the hope of improving the government’s powers of prediction, Dominic Cummings, for he was that reviewer, put Superforecasting on the summer reading list that he issued to ministerial advisers. Alas, it does not appear to have enhanced the ability of the prime minister, his visually challenged colleague or anyone else in this government to see into the future. These are members of a regime that struggles to see into next week. They are particularly terrible at forecasting the consequences of their own actions. The expression on the face of Number 10 is that of a man who never looks where he is going and is then constantly surprised to find that he has stepped in dog excrement. There is an ever lengthening list of things that they could be reasonably expected to have anticipated and yet didn’t. They did not foresee that using an algorithm to depress the A-level grades of thousands of young people would distress them and dismay their parents. They did not foresee that a campaign fronted by an eloquent football star to extend the provision of free school meals would strike a chord with the public. They did not foresee that applying a surcharge to foreign-born workers staffing the NHS would cause a massive backlash. Multiple debacles, rebellions and reverses have even some of those who were once Boris Johnson’s most fervent cheerleaders in despair. This persistent blundering has flowed from a fundamental inability to read the public mood or get on top of events. Throughout the coronavirus crisis, the government has been constantly behind the curve. How did Mr Cummings put it? “We bumble along making the same sort of errors repeatedly.” They are no better in their specialist subject of Brexit. When Mr Johnson signed the withdrawal agreement with the EU that he sold to the British public as “fantastic”, he failed to foresee that he would soon afterwards describe the agreement as so dreadful that he would have to threaten to break it. When he made the declaration that he was ready to violate international law, he failed to foresee that this would trigger condemnation from every living former prime minister and many senior Brexiters. In normal times, this inability to anticipate the consequences of its own decisions would be an embarrassing trait in a government. In the context of the Covid catastrophe, it is a deadly characteristic. When infection rates were surging across Europe at the outset of the pandemic, ministers did not foresee that it would be folly to allow race meetings and football matches to carry on as normal. Among other things they did not foresee was the fatal consequences of decanting elderly patients from hospitals into care homes without first checking whether they were free of the virus. Seven months into the pandemic, and with alarming signs of a swelling second wave, some have learned from the benefit of experience. Scientists have a better understanding of the virus and doctors have improved their methods of treatment. Yet the government’s skills of prognostication are not showing a matching degree of improvement. As the number of hospitalisations accelerates upwards, roughly doubling every eight days, it has again been found wanting in relation to testing for infection. There is particular anger among MPs and those they represent in virus hotspots, where it is particularly vital that testing happens rapidly, that people are being told there are no appointments available or that they will have to travel hundreds of miles to get a swab. In response to the outcry, Dido Harding, the Johnson-appointed head of the testing effort in England, tried to argue that the system is the victim of an unanticipated surge in demand. Not so. This spike was both predictable and predicted. Since the early summer, the government has been urging people to return to the office and bring “bustle” back to high streets. Many Britons have been travelling around the country or holidaying abroad. The reopening of schools has brought the usual seasonal spread of start-of-term coughs and sniffles. You didn’t need to be the world’s smartest epidemiologist to anticipate that a large expansion of social contact would increase the potential vectors of infection for disease. And that, in turn, would lead to a surge in demand for tests. Sometimes ministers have foolishly implied that the public is at fault for putting too much stress on the system. It is true that there are people without symptoms seeking tests because a family member or workmate may have contracted the virus. It is entirely natural that people will take a precautionary approach. “Play it safe” has been the thrust of government advice for months. That has been accompanied by repeated ministerial exhortations to remember that the disease can often be asymptomatic, especially among younger people. Public expectation that the system would have the capacity to provide a test to anyone who wanted one has been further fuelled by the constant prime ministerial hyperbole that the government is building a “world-beating” system. In mid-July, Matt Hancock implied universal availability by urging people to get tested if they had “any doubt” about being infected. Now the health secretary plans to ration access. The testing chaos, coming in the wake of so many other fiascos, has the Tory press beginning to wonder whether Mr Johnson is fit to be in Number 10. “WHY ARE THEY STILL FAILING THE TEST?” demands the Daily Mail. “Losing Track” and “Johnson Adrift” were the lead editorials on successive days in the Times. The cover headline of the most recent edition of the Spectator, which is usually very friendly to its former editor, asks “Where’s Boris?” and is accompanied by a cartoon depicting him alone in an oarless boat on a heaving sea. This echoes the wail of Tory backbenchers that the prime minister needs to “get a grip” and “rediscover his mojo” and “give us a sense of direction”. The implication is that the remedy for a wretched performance is for Mr Johnson to impose more of his personality on the government. This has it precisely the wrong way round. His character is the central source of the repeated inability to anticipate and address challenges. All governments absorb the character traits of the person at the top. The person at the top of this government doesn’t think through the consequences of his actions, is cavalier about detail and bored by complexity, prefers the quick hit of a snappy populist slogan to the steady slog of competent administration. All this was known about him long before the Tory party made him its leader. His flaws as a prime minister are a revelation only to those who wilfully ignored his biography and his record. He has spent a career living for today and letting tomorrow take care of itself. Colleagues and ex-wives can testify to his compulsion for over-promising and then under-delivering. He has been a gusher of dramatic and bogus predictions of what his government will achieve – “a moonshot” this, a “game-changing” that – because spouting wildly boosterish claims is so much easier than getting stuff done. Funnily enough, the book Superforecasting identifies one of the core reasons why this government is failing. “The worst forecasters were those with great self-confidence who stuck to their big ideas,” wrote Mr Cummings himself. They are lousy at understanding the world and coming to good judgments about it. “The more successful were those who were cautious, humble, numerate, actively open-minded, looked at many points of view.” Now, which is a better description of the Johnson-Cummings method of government? “Cautious, humble, numerate, actively open-minded, looked at many points of view”? That doesn’t sound like them at all. “Great self-confidence”, which leaves them stubbornly wedded to their “big ideas”? That’s much more like it. Their biggest idea of the moment is that leaving the EU’s single market without a deal would be fine even in a double-whammy combination with a re-escalation of the coronavirus crisis. Bear in mind his previous record as a soothsayer when the prime minister confidently predicts that a crash-out Brexit would be a “good outcome”. I hazard a guess that this is his most calamitously wrong forecast of all. • Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"

          "headline": "Private and state schools bid to kill off GCSEs",
          "bodyText": "A coalition of private and state schools is expected to launch a campaign to end GCSEs, as growing numbers of schools look at alternatives to the exams following the summer algorithm debacle. Eton, Bedales, St Paul’s girls’ school, Latymer upper school and several substantial academy chains have been joined by Margaret Thatcher’s education secretary, Kenneth Baker, who created GCSEs, to discuss proposals for replacing the exam system. The group, Rethinking Assessments, is likely to launch a formal campaign in the next few weeks, forcing ministers into a battle for control of school qualifications. “If a few of the big multi-academy trusts say: ‘Actually, we don’t think GCSEs work for our young people – we think this other qualification would,’ it would start changing the narrative. That would be a defining moment,” said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, who has been meeting members of the group. Schools are already taking matters into their own hands to ensure that pupils do not face the threat of results by algorithm for a second year. There is escalating unease among headteachers about the lack of direction from ministers about the fairest way to assess children if Covid-19 prevents them sitting their GCSEs and A-levels again next May. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has insisted students will be assessed using exams in 2021 but has given no hint what teachers should do now to prepare in case the pandemic forces exams to be cancelled again. Some schools want to create networks where teachers can moderate course work and mock exams, which could be submitted to exam boards if teacher-assessed grades are needed again. Private schools have more flexibility and greater resources. Tower College, a small independent school in Rainhill, Merseyside, is putting contingency plans in place for a “virtual exam hall”, the school’s exams officer Jo Nugent said, where teachers can invigilate via Zoom with students completing papers by hand or via Microsoft One Note. Others are looking at alternatives to GCSEs. AQA and Pearson both launched fast-track Extended Project Qualifications during lockdown, where students write a research-based thesis worth the equivalent of an AS-level. In 2019, about 43,000 students took EPQs, a number the exam boards expect to rise. Peter Hyman, the co-director of Big Education Trust, said: “We’re both preparing for exams and also assuming they might not happen. That means keeping high-quality records of each student’s progress and ensuring good moderation of mocks and assessments during the year. “There is an imperative for the government to provide support and resources for schools now and not as a panic measure later in the year. Already big inequalities are appearing between students, with some already forced home because of Covid and the lack of testing, and others who have had uninterrupted learning. In the absence of government help and clarity, we will support our teachers and work with other schools to try to deal with all eventualities.” A few private schools have created their own mini-qualifications, following the example of Bedales, which has run a separate system for several years. Students take five GCSEs in core subjects of English, maths, science and languages and choose from assessed courses in subjects from geography and philosophy to ancient civilisations and outdoor work. “In philosophy, religion and ethics, we spend a whole term with the students researching their blueprint for an ideal society, following Plato’s Republic and Thomas Moore’s Utopia,” said Alistair McConville, Bedales’ director of learning. Pupils are assessed by their research, essays, tests and a public presentation to teachers and parents.“Public audiences are a crucial part of assessment,” McConville said. “Having the skill to defend your position from a barrage of questioning is a vital part of life, and it forms part of the assessment.” Cognita, an international chain with 40 schools in the UK which teach 10,000 students, embarked on a similar programme during lockdown. The Inspiring Futures programme assesses children using what David Baldwin, Cognita’s director of education, calls “micro-credentials”. “It’s a mini-qualification that demonstrates you’ve got a particular competency, like units of a degree course,” he said. “This is an opportunity to accelerate some thinking and make some bold decisions around the curriculum. “Our aspiration is that in 18 months’ time, the Inspiring Futures programme will be a core part of every one of our schools in Europe.” The Department for Education said: “We expect exams to take place next year and are working with Ofqual and the exam boards on our approach. There are a range of measures proposed by Ofqual following a public consultation, including a possible short delay to the exam timetable and subject-specific changes to reduce pressure on teaching time. “We will continue to work with school and college stakeholders, Ofqual and the exam boards to ensure that exams in 2021 are fair.”"

          "headline": "Engagement with anti-vaccine Facebook posts trebles in one month",
          "bodyText": "Engagement with anti-vaccine posts on a sample of UK Facebook pages trebled between July and August, analysis by the Guardian has found, triggering calls for a major new push to tackle conspiracy theories. Interactions on posts expressing scepticism or hostility towards vaccines on six UK Facebook pages increased from 12,000 in July to 42,000 in August, according to the analysis, conducted using the Facebook-owned social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. The pages were selected by running keyword searches on terms associated with the anti-vaccine movement, creating a list of pages that frequently shared disinformation and conspiracy theories. A Facebook page for an alternative medicine business that has 1.9m likes shared about 50 posts expressing scepticism about vaccines during the last three months. These included posts containing conspiracy theories about Bill Gates and false claims that vaccines are a form of population control. According to polling published this summer, 53% of the UK population said they were “certain or very likely” to take a potential Covid-19 vaccine, and a further 20% were “fairly likely to”. Another of the pages analysed has more than 500,000 likes and posted several times linking to a feature-length followup to the Plandemic conspiracy theory video that went viral in May. One post promoting the film, hosted on a separate site, received 118,000 views. The film blames the outbreak on big pharma, Gates and the World Health Organization, and warns that wearing masks is dangerous because it “literally activates your own virus”. Other pages analysed included a fan page for the conspiracy theorist David Icke, with 22,000 likes, and a page set up to oppose UK lockdown measures, with 30,000. While some of the increase may be accounted for by discussions of vaccines overall increasing across social media, all the content analysed expressed scepticism or hostility. The Labour MP Chris Elmore, the chair of the all-party parliamentary group on social media, demanded a “ramping up” of government efforts to counter misinformation online, saying a crossroads had been reached. “Ministers need to bring forward a clear, coherent and targeted public information campaign detailing the rigorous scientific procedures that are being followed in developing a vaccine for Covid-19, and the robust safeguards that are in place,” he told the Guardian. “If their strategy isn’t overhauled quickly, misinformation may well erode public confidence to such an extent that it could fatally undermine the success of any clinically safe vaccine once one is identified.” Facebook says it will remove content that poses an imminent risk to health. Disinformation that does not reach this threshold will be left up, but will be eligible for factchecking and may carry a tag letting the reader know the information is false. Its position may also be downgraded in news feeds by Facebook’s algorithm. A Facebook spokesperson said: “This analysis only considers a small sample size and is not representative of our work in this space. Facebook does not allow harmful misinformation on our platforms and we have removed 7m pieces of Covid-19-related misinfo between April and June, as well as posts shared with us by the Guardian that violated our policies. “We also reduce the visibility of vaccine misinformation by putting it to the bottom of News Feed, don’t show it in search results or recommend it to you and don’t allow it in adverts.” Pages associated with anti-mask and anti-lockdown campaigns were found to be growing on Facebook. Five anti-mask pages analysed had 60,000 likes between them, up from 47,000 at the beginning of August, according to CrowdTangle data, a rise of 28%. One viral video shared by a prominent anti-lockdown account shows an employee of a large UK care home chain claiming “Covid is a load of bollocks”. The original post, which received 310,000 views on Facebook, also contained the hashtag #WWG1WGA, a slogan associated with the far-right conspiracy theory QAnon. Heidi Larson, the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a global surveillance programme on vaccine trust, said low trust in government could influence vaccine scepticism, while those opposed to any forthcoming vaccine were capitalising on uncertainty. “A problem is that those behind the ‘pro-vaccine’ sentiment are not really filling that space with much more than talk about, for example, going at ‘warp speed’ or ‘fast tracking’, and that’s not helpful,” said Larson, who advocated a greater focus on explaining why innovation had come about. “I think as much as can be done locally is also best. Governments are really not faring well in the trust index right now, particularly in the US and the UK, neither of which have handled the pandemic well.” Government attempts to rebut disinformation have taken the form of initiatives and bodies such as the “Don’t Feed the Beast” public information campaign and the Cabinet Office’s rapid response unit.. A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: “Since the start of the pandemic, specialist UK government units have also been working rapidly to identify and rebut false information about coronavirus, including working closely with social media companies.” • This article was amended on 22 September 2020 because an earlier version omitted to note that CrowdTangle is Facebook-owned."

          "headline": "Just like Australia, disinformation is thriving during the US fire crisis",
          "bodyText": "Disinformation successfully obscured the real causes of Australia’s catastrophic bushfire season. Now the same thing is happening around me, as I report on a disastrous wildfire season in the American west. In both countries, the response to a pandemic is also being complicated by disinformation, as conspiracy theorists refuse isolation, refuse masks, and ready themselves to refuse vaccines. A lot of the fundamental problems are the same, but there are differences in detail. In the western United States in recent days, backroads vigilantism has seen civilians set up armed road blocks, and journalists held at the point of loaded assault rifles. Australia does not have the complication of American gun culture, which is itself one marker of the clash of ideologies and identities in a deeply divided nation, and also raises the stakes on every other social conflict. Many Australians like to congratulate themselves on their highly restrictive gun laws, figuring that it is the mark of a more civilised society. That may be, but it’s easy to forget that one of the major stumbling blocks to stricter gun laws in the United States is a bill of rights. We can argue whether the right to bear arms is a sensible thing to constitutionally enshrine, but Australia has no such constitutionally defined individual rights, beyond those that the high court has seen fit to torture from the document. The absence of such rights also contains the real world effects of conspiracy theories – the people recently arrested for incitement in Victoria over the promotion of Covid conspiracy theories and anti-lockdown protests would likely enjoy first amendment protections in the US. Whether or not people ought to have the liberty to promote ideas which are, frankly, insane, and a threat to public order, is beyond the scope of this article. In other ways, Australia is worse off. It is easy to make the mistake of thinking that Fox News, or other skewed or tabloid media, is representative of US media as a whole. But America’s media is vast. Conservative media is mostly enjoyed by those who have already committed the necessary cognitive self-mutilation to mistake its output for information, and, speaking very generally, although other corporate and local media may be excessively narrow, and TV networks such as Sinclair do skew right, the country does not suffer under the hegemony that News Corporation has achieved in its country of origin. With its stranglehold on daily newspapers and online news, News Corp in Australia has created the most rightwing media culture in the English speaking world, and they aren’t really accountable to anyone. Their columnists, and even their news writers, played a big, unconscionable role in pushing horse-hockey about arson and hazard reduction burning. In the western United States, it’s simply inconceivable that local mainstream media outlets would deliberately mislead their audience in this way. (Fox News has, but those who take the network seriously are already lost.) News gave the conspiracy theories momentum, while other outlets such as Seven also entertained the idea that vandals, greenies, or anything but climate change might have set the country on fire. If there is a posterity to judge them, it will damn them all. The last, and biggest point of difference is that Australia’s bushfires struck at the beginning of 2020. As we draw to the end of September, the conspiracy culture that fuels wildfire denialism has had nine more months to incubate in the bowels of its principal host, Facebook. Facebook is also the place where we see the two disinformation crises overlap. That website is now nothing short of a threat to civilisation. But the nature of that threat is not easy to see for those who simply use it to keep up with family and friends, post pictures of their dog, or monitor old flames. In 2016, the Facebook newsfeed was flooded with fake news. Scandals followed when it emerged how easily the newsfeed had been manipulated by propagandists like Cambridge Analytica (much of that was first revealed by reporting in the Guardian). In response, Facebook first tweaked its algorithm to de-emphasise content from publishers except where it sparked interest from users’ friends. Then, last year, it tweaked its app to emphasise groups. Ask anyone who professionally monitors the far right, as I do, or conspiracy culture, as I do, and they’ll tell you that the action is all happening in private groups – either those associated with movements like QAnon, with anti-lockdown or anti-mask or anti-vaccine protests, with far right street protests, and lately, with localities affected by natural disasters. To a large extent, now, all of these form one big gumbo of conspiracy culture, anyhow. Facebook will tell you that they have cracked down on QAnon, the Boogaloo movement, and wildfire disinformation. To the extent that they have tried, they have failed. Conspiracy culture continues not only to survive, but thrive on the platform. In the last week, the idea that antifa activists were starting fires was bedded down as settled fact and common sense in rightwing groups, and those associated with many affected rural communities. The idea was impervious to attempts by federal and local law enforcement authorities to debunk it. That’s the most proximate reason that armed men were sticking up journalists, and setting up roadblocks in rural Oregon. There will be future bushfire seasons like 2020’s in Australia, and the American west. The Covid crisis has a long way to run, and it may worsen, and give way to future pandemics which are even more unforgiving. The disinformation will also likely be worse, as will its consequences, because those whose safety is threatened by disinformation cannot, and those who could will not deplatform the conspiracy theorists producing lies at an industrial scale. In Australia, and the US, the prospects of facing up to the underlying cause of longer, more severe, more catastrophic fire seasons – climate change – will be remote unless regulators act against the websites where truth goes to die."

          "headline": "Critics condemn Trump's rewrite of race in America in DC speech – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Here’s a quick recap of what’s happened today: Critics have condemned Donald Trump’s new “patriotic education” plan, created in response to the New York Times’ 1619 project. The Pulitzer-winning project elaborates on the US’s 250 years of slavery and its effects on modern-day race relations. Trump likened such teaching to “child abuse”. Kamala Harris made a pit stop in Pennsylvania as Democrats tapped into Black Voting Power. Eric Trump’s lawyers said that he is willing to answer questions for the New York attorney general’s investigation into the Trump Organization – but only after the election. A former aide to Mike Pence was featured in a scathing attack ad from Republican Voters Against Trump. The aide worked with Pence on the White House’s coronavirus taskforce, and she said Trump’s response to coronavirus has made it clear that “he doesn’t actually care about anyone but himself”. Meanwhile, the House energy and commerce committee wants answers from senior advisor Stephen Miller and health and human services secretary Alex Azar about a “show of hands” vote on child separation. A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s operational changes at the US postal service. Black voters in North Carolina are already getting their ballots rejected four times more than white voters, according to FiveThirtyEight, a concerning indicator of what may be to come as millions of voters fill out mail-in ballots over the next several weeks. Of the over 13,000 ballots that black voters have sent in North Carolina, 647 were rejected. Meanwhile, of the 60,000 ballots white voters sent in, 681 were rejected. A ballot is rejected if a voter made a mistake when filling out a ballot or did not fill out witness information. North Carolina gives a voter the opportunity to correct their ballot, but FiveThirtyEight points out that not all states allow “vote curing”, or the chance to fix their ballot. In Nevada, for example, 45% of 12,000 ballots that had missing or mismatched signatures were properly “cured” and thus counted. What has been, at this point, well over a month of negotiations for a new coronavirus stimulus package is still not seeing success as the House and Senate break for the weekend today. House Democrats passed their $3.4tn package in May and have budged down to $2.2 trillion, according to Politico. Republicans meanwhile have been firm about a much slimmer $650bn relief package. Moderate Democrats have urged House speaker Nancy Pelosi to go along with a slimmer package, with fears that if Republicans refuse to cooperate, there will be no aid until after the election. In a tweet yesterday, Donald Trump urged Republicans to “go for much higher numbers”, though it’s unclear whether the tweet had any real sway on Republican lawmakers. Yosemite national park just announced that it will be closing due to “significant smoke impacts and hazardous air quality” coming from the wildfires along the west coast. Starting at 5pm Pacific time today, park entrance stations and roads will be closed until conditions improve, which could mean closure for the next several days at least. The park said it will continue to assess air quality, smoke impact and fire activity throughout the region to determine when the park will be safe to reopen. Yosemite joins Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks in California, which have also closed due to wildfires in the region. Donald Trump’s response to the attack ad that was released this afternoon by Republican Voters Against Trump: “I never met her.” In the ad, Olivia Troye, who was an aide to Vice-President Mike Pence and was his top staffer on the White House’s coronavirus taskforce, said that Trump “doesn’t actually care about anyone else but himself” and emphasized his careless response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Troye says that she left her job after seeing how the administration was handling the virus, but Trump told reporters that she was “terminated”. Controversial guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that said that those who had been exposed to Covid-19 did not need to get tested if they were not showing symptoms was not written by CDC scientists. The New York Times just published a report that says several sources and internal documents have confirmed that CDC scientists were not onboard with the guidance and that it was written by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which “dropped” it on to the CDC’s website. The Times quoted an anonymous source who said that the guidance came from “the top down, from the HHS and the taskforce”. “That policy does not reflect what many people at the CDC feel should be the policy,” the federal official said. When the guidance was released, multiple public health experts raised alarms that it would hurt efforts to trace and contain the virus and that it was a sign that the CDC’s integrity had been compromised by the White House’s taskforce. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country’s top infectious disease expert, said that he was “worried” by the guidance, specifically that it would lead people to believe that asymptomatic spread of the virus is not a concern. Scott Atlas, a Trump coronavirus adviser, has threatened to sue a group of Stanford professors who wrote an open letter denouncing multiple public statement Atlas has made about responding to Covid-19. A letter from his lawyer said the professors’ statement “maliciously defames” Atlas and demanded the signers of the letters to withdraw their claims or be sued, according to Politico. The open letter, which was published last Wednesday, said that Atlas’s statements and opinions “run counter to established science and, by doing so, undermine public-health authorities and the credible science that guides effective public health policy”. Over 100 faculty members with various medical expertise signed the letter. In recent weeks, Atlas has raised concerns among public health experts by questioning the use of masks and embracing the controversial “herd immunity” response to the pandemic. Atlas was criticized for not having a background in public health or infectious diseases, as Trump’s former top advisors Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci had. Eric Trump, the president’s second-oldest son, said through his lawyers in a court filing today that he is willing to be interviewed by the New York attorney general’s office for its investigation into the Trump Organization – the caveat being that the questioning has to take place after the election. New York attorney general Letitia James is currently investigating the Trump Organization for allegedly inflating the value of its assets to secure loans and deflating it to avoid taxes. The investigation was launched in March 2019 after Donald Trump’s former fixer Michael Cohen told Congress that Donald Trump misrepresented the value of his financial assets. The AG’s office has issued multiple subpoenas, including one for an interview with Eric Trump, which he has refused to comply with and has called “prosecutorial misconduct”. In his court filings today, lawyers for Eric Trump said that an interview must wait for after the election because of his “extreme travel schedule and related unavailability between now and the election” along with his desire to “avoid the use of his deposition attendance for political purposes”. Another former executive branch staffer has joined a group of Republican leaders and former Trump administration officials who are advocating against the president’s re-election. Politico reported this afternoon that Josh Venable, former chief of staff to education secretary Betsy DeVos who served from the beginning of Trump’s tenure until October 2018, has joined the Republican Political Alliance for Integrity and Reform. The group was founded by two former senior Department of Homeland Security officials and is just one of a few groups of Republicans who are advocating against Trump in the lead up to the election, including Republican Voters Against Trump and the Lincoln Project. Venable was listed by the group as an adviser, along with a handful of Republican leaders. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Kenya Evelyn. Republicans Voters Against Trump released an ad this afternoon featuring a former aide of vice-president Mike Pence. In a two-minute ad, Olivia Troye, former homeland security and counter-terrorism advisor to Pence, who also served as Pence’s lead staff member on his Covid-19 response, said that working at the White House led her to see that Trump “doesn’t actually care about anyone else but himself”. Troye described herself as a lifelong Republican, having supported George W Bush and John McCain, but said “at this point, it’s country over party”. A member of the White House’s coronavirus taskforce, Troye said she distinctly remembers when Trump made a comment about how the pandemic may be a “good thing” since he doesn’t like shaking hands with people. “I don’t have to shake hands with these disgusting people,” he remarked, according to Troye’s recollection. Troye pointed out that the “disgusting people” he referred to are his supporters, “the people he still claims to care about”. In an interview with the Washington Post, Troye further elaborated on her opinion of the president, saying that his response to the pandemic has showed a “flat-out disregard for human life” and repeated that his main concerns were his re-election and the economy. A reporter on Twitter said that Pence has responded to Troye comments, saying “one more disgruntled employee who’s left the WH decided to play politics during an election year”. Here’s what you have missed amid a Thursday full of historic debate: Kamala Harris made a pit stop in Pennsylvania as Democrats tapped into Black Voting Power Critics have condemned Donald Trump’s revisionist American history Meanwhile, the House energy and commerce committee wants answers from senior advisor Stephen Miller and health and human services secretary Alex Azar about a “show of hands” vote on child separation A federal judge temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s operational changes at the US postal service Stay up to date as my colleague Lauren Aratani provides you with all the latest from the rest of Thursday right here on the politics liveblog. Following reports of a scrapped plan to send masks to all US residences, a federal judge in Washington state has temporarily blocked proposed operational changes within the US postal service, accusing Donald Trump and Postmaster General Louis DeJoy of being “involved in a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the Postal Service”. The ruling grants a request from 14 states to temporarily block the changes, blaming them for a slowdown in mail delivery that could potentially disrupt the 2020 presidential election. From the Washington Post: Stanley A. Bastian, chief judge of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, said that harm to the public “has already taken place” by changes put in place under DeJoy. Bastian ruled from the bench Thursday afternoon after a two-and-a-half hour hearing. “The states have demonstrated that the defendants are involved in a politically motivated attack on the efficiency of the Postal Service. They have also demonstrated that this attack on the Postal Service is likely to irreparably harm the states’ ability to administer the 2020 general election,” he said. Texas governor allows businesses to expand occupancy Texas governor Greg Abbott announced on Thursday that some businesses across the state will be allowed to expand to 75% occupancy as early as this week. After emerging as a hotspot in the coronavirus pandemic, Texas data now shows low hospitalization levels. But public health experts expect those numbers to surge as businesses and schools reopen. Those permitted to expand capacity include restaurants, gyms, shopping centers, libraries and museums. However, bars will remain closed. Until additional medical treatments are available, we must continue the safe practices that slowed the spread [of Covid-19] this summer. That includes staying at home if you’re sick, sanitizing your hands, maintaining safe distances &amp; wearing a mask. Greg Abbott, governor of Texas More of the fallout from the White House on American history: Following a revisionist speech at the first White House Conference on American History, in which Donald Trump introduced the 1776 Commission that will establish “patriotic” and “pro-America” education: members of the Trump administration - including education secretary Betsy DeVos - remain mum on the backlash. The US House energy and commerce committee announced it has called on Alex Azar, US secretary for health and human services, following an NBC News report detailing White House senior adviser Stephen Miller’s “show-of-hands” vote on family separations. The NBC News report alleges that Miller and “other Trump administration officials were invited to a May 2018 meeting in the White House Situation Room where they voted by a show of hands to separate migrant children who crossed the border illegally with their parents”. New from correspondent Jacob Soboroff: The backlash is swift for Donald Trump following the White House Conference on American History, where he delivered remarks earlier today that critics and journalists quickly factchecked as blatantly false. The president, who called curriculum on race “toxic propaganda, an ideological poison that, if not removed, will dissolve the civic bonds”, continued his administration’s efforts to restrict the telling of American history in schools to erase a legacy of racism, genocide and imperialism. More on that from Politico: Trump recently threatened to nix federal funding for California schools that teach the 1619 Project, while the White House issued a government-wide directive to stop what it called “un-American propaganda training sessions” about race. Responding to the president’s remarks, journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones, the project’s author, made an observation on who isn’t included in Trump’s retelling of American history: This is Kenya Evelyn in Washington briefly taking over our politics live blog. Here’s what we’re following right now. The campaign for Joe Biden continued its outreach to black voters Thursday, with running mate Kamala Harris making a stop in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to engage community leaders in the battleground state. The California senator and VP nominee maintained social distance, however, bouncing elbows with people. Harris later called on Congress to pass voting rights legislation at a “Sister to Sister” community panel on women’s empowerment. Democrats’ fight for black voters ramped up as polls showing the race tightening in states like Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan following the national convention. Harris was just in Milwaukee, where the scaled-down national convention left Democrats with a void of black voter enthusiasm. As anti-racism protests enter their fourth straight month around the globe, the former vice-president and Harris will make additional stops in key states where Black Americans have disproportionately been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and recession that followed. Key up with the Guardian’s coverage of black voters ahead of the 2020 presidential election with our latest series: Black Voting Power. Donald Trump has launched an extraordinary attack on education at a history conference in Washington DC, claiming children have been subjected to “decades of leftwing indoctrination” and saying the founding of America “set in motion” the end of slavery. “Our children are instructed from propaganda tracts, like Howard Zinn,” Trump said. “The left has warped, distorted, and defiled the American story.” Trump said children should know “they are citizens of the most exceptional nation in the history of the world”. The government, Trump says, is planning to introduce a “pro-American education” – “that celebrates the truth about our country’s great history”. Trump then attacked the New York Times’ 1619 Project. The Pulitzer Prize-winning project was published last year to cast a spotlight on the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship arriving in America. The 1619 project “warped” the American story, Trump said. The president said the project claimed the US was “founded on the principle of oppression, not freedom”. Instead, “America’s founding set in motion the chain of events that abolished slavery”, Trump claimed. Trump then moved on to statues – “leftwing mobs have torn down statues of our founders”, he says – in a classic appeal to his base, who disapprove of monuments to slave owners being removed. I didn’t know Mike Pence was due to speak at this National Archives event – officially the event is called the White House history conference – but here he is. Pence sets the scene with a run through of the Declaration of independence and the constitution – “the greatest charters of freedom the world has ever known”, Pence says. Then its a straight-up attack on education and, seemingly teachers: “Sadly we live in a time when some are seeking to erase our history,” Pence says. Millions of people in the US are educated by people who “seek to wipe out our history”, the vice president claims. Pence seems to be setting up Trump to – as reported – denounce some US schools’ focus on slavery and racism in history lessons. Donald Trump is about to speak at the National Archives in Washington – where he’s expected to attack some US schools’ focus on slavery and racism in history lessons. As we noted earlier: “The president will specifically criticize the New York Times’ ‘1619 Project.’ The Pulitzer Prize-winning project was published last year to cast a spotlight on the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship arriving in America.” We’ll post updates, and video of the event is live here. Pennsylvania’s top court ruled Thursday that voters could have more time to return their mail-in ballots to election officials this fall, a move likely to result in thousands more people having their votes counted in the key battleground state. Pennsylvania, seen as crucial to Joe Biden’s chances of winning in November, is one of many states where voters are required to return their mail-in ballots to election officials by election night in order to have them counted. But on Thursday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered the state to count ballots as long as they were postmarked by election day and arrived by 6 November, the Friday after election day. One of the top reasons ballots get rejected is because they arrive too late to be counted. More than 15,000 ballots were rejected for arriving too late, according to an NPR analysis. In previous elections, missing the ballot receipt deadline has been one of the top reasons mail-in ballots get rejected. The court relied in a provision in Pennsylvania’s constitution that says all elections need to be “free and equal” to make its decision and noted that a record number of people are expected to apply for mail-in ballots. “In light of these unprecedented numbers and the near-certain delays that will occur in Boards processing the mail-in applications, we conclude that the timeline built into the Election Code cannot be met by the USPS’s current delivery standards,” Justice Max Baer, a Democrat, wrote for the court’s majority. “Voters’ rights are better protected by addressing the impending crisis at this point in the election cycle on a statewide basis rather than allowing the chaos to brew, creating voter confusion regarding whether extensions will be granted, for how long, and in what counties.” The Pennsylvania supreme court also said that counties could offer voters ballot drop boxes and that the state could only allow people to serve as poll workers in the county where they live. Donald Trump’s campaign had filed a separate suit in federal court seeking to block both requirements. Donald Trump has acknowledged his lack of widespread tv advertising is a problem, venting to advisors about Joe Biden’s seemingly more cash-laden campaign, the Washington Post reports: Trump spent last weekend complaining privately about Biden’s dominance in television advertising, according to three people familiar with the comments, only to tweet upon his return to Washington from a campaign swing that the “fake news” was exaggerating the disparity. The zigzagging messages reflected a desire by Trump and his campaign to move beyond growing Republican concern about his relatively scant advertising budget and doubts about whether he has enough money in the bank to close the race in a strong position. “We have much more money than we had at the same time in 2016,” Trump tweeted this week. “Also spending on other, and different, elements of the campaign.” Biden has been raking in huge amounts of money over the past month, as my colleague David Smith wrote this week: “While Joe Biden and the Democratic National Committee (DNC) raised a record $365m in August, it was revealed this week that the Trump campaign has surrendered what was once a $200m cash advantage. It has already spent more than $800m, the front page of the New York Times reported, leaving its coffers dangerously depleted for the critical final phase.” Trump’s campaign has to report its cash on hand for the end of August by this Sunday. The Green Party presidential candidate Howie Hawkins has been removed from the ballot in Pennsylvania – a win for Democrats ahead of the election. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Hawkins did not strictly follow procedures for getting on the ballot after he took over from Elizabeth Faye Scroggin as the Green party candidate. Associated Press reports: Democrats have long gone to court to keep Green Party candidates off the ballot, worried that they will siphon otherwise liberal voters in close contests against Republicans in the politically divided state. In this case, Democrats targeted what they said were disqualifying irregularities in how Green Party candidates for president and vice president filed affidavits that accompany paperwork to get on the ballot. In 2016 Green Party candidate Jill Stein was blamed by some for drawing votes away from Hillary Clinton, although there is little evidence Stein’s performance made a difference. Donald Trump won Pennsylvania by 46,765 votes while 49,678 people voted for Stein. Still, Hawkins’ absence is good news for Biden, as Pennsylvania has become increasingly crucial to his 2020 chances. According to RealClearPolitics average of Pennsylvania polls Biden has a 4.3% lead in the state. I interviewed Hawkins in August about his chances of clinching the presidency... which he conceded weren’t very high. This ruling means his hoped for 5% of the national vote is becoming a harder target to reach. (This is Adam Gabbatt, covering for Joan E Greve.) Here’s where the day stands so far: Twitter flagged another one of Trump’s tweets about voting by mail as “misleading.” The president once again sought to cast doubt upon the legitimacy of the election, saying in his tweet, “Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to ‘voters’, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED.” In reality, voter fraud is very rare, and secretaries of state of both parties have offered reassurances that ballots will be accurately counted. Trump is reportedly expected to denounce some US schools’ focus on slavery and racism in history lessons when he delivers remarks at the National Archives later today. According to Bloomberg News, the president will specifically criticize the New York Times’ “1619 Project.” The Pulitzer Prize-winning project was published last year to cast a spotlight on the 400th anniversary of the first slave ship arriving in America. Attorney general William Barr received criticism for attacking justice department staffers and comparing coronavirus shutdown orders to slavery. Barr said during an event hosted by Hillsdale College yesterday, “You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history.” I’m handing the blog over to my Guardian colleague, Adam Gabbatt, for the next couple hours, so stay tuned. Trump is reportedly expected to denounce some US schools’ focus on slavery and racism in its history lessons when the president speaks at the National Archives later today. Bloomberg News reports: ‘The president will deliver remarks on his administration’s efforts to promote a more balanced, accurate, and patriotic curricula in America’s schools,’ the White House said in a statement. That includes criticizing what the White House calls ‘the liberal indoctrination of America’s youth.’ Trump is expected to explicitly fault the New York Times’ ‘1619 Project.’ The Pulitzer-Prize winning public school curriculum developed by the newspaper orients American history from the date that the first slave ship arrived in what later became the U.S. One of Trump’s top advisers, secretary of state Mike Pompeo, similarly attacked the “1619 Project” during a July speech at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. “The New York Times’s 1619 Project — so named for the year the first slaves were transported to America — wants you to believe our country was founded for human bondage. They want you to believe America’s institutions continue to reflect the country’s acceptance of slavery at our founding,” Pompeo said. “They want you to believe Marxist ideology that America is only the oppressors and the oppressed. The Chinese Communist Party must be gleeful when they see the New York Times spout their ideology.” The University of Georgia announced it would provide an on-campus site for in-person early voting, reversing a widely criticized decision not to do so. In a statement, the university said Stegeman Coliseum, where the school’s basketball team plays, would serve as a polling station for early voting. The statement noted the stadium is large enough to host voters while still respecting social distancing guidelines. The university’s previous announcement that it had not found a suitable location for early voting was met with a fierce backlash, as many critics noted the school was moving forward with college football despite the coronavirus pandemic. The intense public pressure appears to have worked, given the school reversed its decision just one day after announcing it. Trump’s businesses have charged the US government more than $1.1 million since the president took office, according to the Washington Post. The Post reports: The documents, including receipts and invoices from Trump’s businesses, were released by the Secret Service after The Washington Post filed a public-records lawsuit. They added $188,000 in previously unknown charges to The Post’s running total of payments to Trump’s properties related to the presence of Secret Service agents. In Bedminster this spring, the records show, Trump’s club charged the Secret Service more than $21,800 to rent a cottage and other rooms while the club was closed and otherwise off-limits to guests. The documents don’t give a reason for these rentals. Trump didn’t visit the club while it was closed, but his eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her family reportedly visited at least once. The family visited the club in April to celebrate Passover, a period that overlaps with several of the largest Secret Service charges. At the time, both the District of Columbia — where Ivanka Trump lives — and New Jersey had imposed ‘stay-at-home’ orders, telling residents to avoid travel except under limited circumstances. Ivanka Trump was criticized after the New York Times reported on the April trip, with many noting the president’s daughter was simultaneously urging people to respect stay-at-home orders as she traveled out of state. Democrats have also broadly criticized the president for allowing his businesses to charge the federal government while he is in office, sparking accusations that Trump is using the presidency for his own financial gain. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy insisted Trump was right to challenge the CDC director’s timeline for the development of a coronavirus vaccine. “If I just take the words of the CDC and the president, the president is right,” the Republican leader told reporters on Capitol Hill. McCarthy added, “One of those two individuals had more information than the other, and that was the president.” During his Senate testimony yesterday, CDC Director Robert Redfield said a coronavirus vaccine would not be widely available to the American public until “late second quarter, third quarter 2021.” That comment is in line with timelines offered by other health experts, but Trump attacked Redfield at his press conference yesterday, insisting the CDC director was “confused” when he testified. “I think he made a mistake when he said that. It’s just incorrect information,” Trump said. Twitter has added another label to one of Trump’s tweets about voting by mail, which the president has falsely claimed is particularly vulnerable to voter fraud. In reality, voter fraud is very rare, and the US has been using mailed-in ballots in its elections for decades. The president tweeted this morning, “Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to ‘voters’, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED, which is what some want. Another election disaster yesterday. Stop Ballot Madness!” This is not true. Several states are mailing ballots to all registered voters because of the coronavirus pandemic, but they are not sending ballots to “wherever.” And while it may take longer to count the votes in certain states because of the higher level of voting by mail, the accurate results of the presidential race will be known shortly after the November election. Twitter said of Trump’s tweet, “We’ve added a label to this Tweet for making a potentially misleading statement regarding the process of mail-in voting, and to offer more context for anyone who may see the Tweet. This action is in line with our recently-updated Civic Integrity Policy.” Twitter has previously labeled other Trump tweets about voting by mail because, as the social media giant said last month, the false messages “could potentially dissuade people from participation in voting.” CNN’s chief fact-checker, Daniel Dale, said Trump “might be more dishonest about voting and election integrity than about any other subject.” That’s a fairly remarkable statement, considering the president has made more than 20,000 false or misleading claims since taking office. Addressing reporters at House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s weekly press conference, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer denounced Trump’s comments about coronavirus deaths in Democratic-controlled states. Schumer said Trump’s comments yesterday were “outrageous.” “What a despicable man,” the Democratic leader said. “How low can he go?” During his press conference yesterday, Trump suggested that the US coronavirus death toll would be much lower if the deaths in Democratic-controlled states were ignored. “If you take the blue states out, we’re at a level that I don’t think anybody in the world would be at. We’re really at a very low level. But some of the states, they were blue states and blue state-managed,” Trump said. A new poll shows a close race in Arizona, a state that Trump won by 3.5 points in 2016 and Joe Biden is hoping to flip in November. According to the Monmouth University poll, Biden has a 4-point lead over Trump among Arizona’s registered voters, 48%-44%. But Biden’s small advantage narrows even further when likely voters are polled. If the election sees a high level of voter turnout in Arizona, Biden leads by 2 points, 48%-46%. But if voter turnout is low, Trump and Biden are tied, 47%-47%. If Biden were to win Arizona, he could afford to lose either Michigan or Wisconsin and still capture the White House, assuming he maintained control of all the states that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Despite some promising polling results for Biden, Republicans note that the last Democratic presidential candidate to carry Arizona was Bill Clinton in 1996. As far as the Arizona Senate race, Democratic candidate Mark Kelly has a 6-point lead over Republican senator Martha McSally among Arizona’s registered voters, 50%-44%. But Kelly’s lead among likely voters narrows to 1 to 4 points, depending on the level of turnout. Health and human services secretary Alex Azar will appear before the House select committee on the coronavirus response next month, House majority whip Jim Clyburn just announced at House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s weekly press conference. Clyburn said the October 2 hearing with Azar will mark the health secretary’s first appearance before Congress since February. Democrats have criticized Azar’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, accusing him of helping Trump to downplay the threat of the virus. Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer called on Azar to resign earlier this week. Schumer said in a floor speech, “We need a secretary of health and human services who will look out for the American people, not President Trump’s political interests.” Former FBI Director James Comey is expected to appear before the Senate judiciary committee later this month, according to a Politico reporter. The Republican chairman of the panel, Lindsey Graham, said he had also invited Robert Mueller to appear, but the former special counsel declined because of a lack of time to properly prepare. Both Comey and Mueller have become targets of the president’s ire, given their roles in the investigation into Russian election interference. FBI Director Christopher Wray also took a question about threats of domestic terrorism, specifically about Antifa, which the president has repeatedly denigrated. Wray emphasized that the FBI did not view threats in terms of liberal or conservative politics. “We’re focused on the violence, not the ideology,” Wray said. Wray noted that the domestic terrorism threats the FBI monitors range from “racially motivated violent extremists” to “anti-government, anti-authority violent extremists.” “We look at Antifa as more of an ideology or a movement than an organization,” Wray added. Senior intelligence officials, including the FBI director, are currently testifying before the House. FBI Director Christopher Wray has repeatedly addressed election interference in his testimony to the House committee on homeland security, saying the bureau is committed to blocking such interference efforts in this year’s elections. Wray specifically said the bureau has witnessed “very active efforts by the Russians to influence our election in 2020.” The FBI director said Russian agents were mainly trying to affect the election through “malign foreign influence,” such as social media, state media and the use of proxies. Wray noted the Russians’ efforts were meant “primarily to denigrate Vice President Biden and what the Russians see as kind of an anti-Russian establishment.” A previous report from the director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center described efforts by Russia to attack Biden, but the report also claimed China was against Trump’s reelection, although it included much less detail about Beijing’s interference efforts. Democrats have complained that the report inappropriately equated China’s criticism of Trump with Russia’s extensive interference efforts against Biden. Watch the rest of the House hearing here. Attorney general William Barr is attracting severe criticism for his comments yesterday during an event hosted by Hillsdale College. For one thing, the attorney general described shutdown orders issued at the start of the coronavirus pandemic as the “greatest intrusion on civil liberties” since slavery. “You know, putting a national lockdown, stay at home orders, is like house arrest. Other than slavery, which was a different kind of restraint, this is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties in American history,” Barr said, prompting applause from the crowd. Barr also attacked more junior justice department staffers and dismissed accusations that he had inappropriately interfered with cases involving associates of Trump. “Name one successful organization or institution where the lowest level employees’ decisions are deemed sacrosanct, there aren’t. There aren’t any letting the most junior members set the agenda,” Barr said. He added, “It might be a good philosophy for a Montessori preschool, but it is no way to run a federal agency.” Barr also seemed to argue FBI agents were carrying out their duties to serve him. “These people are agents of the attorney general. As I say, FBI agents, whose agent do you think you are?” Barr said. He went on to say, “And I say, ‘What exactly am I interfering with?’ When you boil it right down, it’s the will of the most junior member of the organization who has some idea he wants to do something. What makes that sacrosanct? “They do not have the political legitimacy to be the public face for tough decisions and they lack the political buy-in necessary to publicly defend those decisions.” The comments will likely further inflame tensions in the justice department, given career prosecutors have repeatedly raised concerns that Barr is politicizing law enforcement. From former acting attorney general Sally Yates: This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam. The Cook Political Report has moved Arizona from “Toss Up” to “Lean Democrat,” after a new poll shows Joe Biden leading Trump by 5 points in the state, which the president won in 2016. The Cook Report’s Amy Walters writes: Arizona is geographically large, but its population is concentrated in Maricopa County (Phoenix). About two-thirds of the vote comes from Maricopa. Voters there, as in other suburban areas in and around big metro areas, have soured on Pres. Trump. Biden leads Trump there by six points, 46 percent to 40 percent. In 2016, Trump carried Maricopa with almost 52 percent of the vote. Another troubling sign for Trump in Arizona is that GOP voters are not as committed to supporting him as they are in the other Sun Belt states. ... Trump is also struggling with Latino support in Arizona, taking just 17 percent of the vote to Biden’s 55 percent. In Florida, however, where Latinos also make up a similar percentage of the electorate, Trump is taking 36 percent of the vote to Biden’s 53 percent. This poll tracks with other recent surveys of Arizona which show Biden ahead. The FiveThirtyEight average puts Biden’s lead in the state at five points (49-44 percent). The new data in this poll, combined with other recent polling in the state, all find Arizona slipping away from Trump. We are moving it from Toss Up to Lean Democrat. Biden’s strength in Arizona could also help Democrats’ chances of winning the Senate, considering Democratic candidate Mark Kelly is trying to unseat Republican senator Martha McSally in Arizona as well. Secretary of state Mike Pompeo has just tweeted that he is off on his latest trip. He will be touring Suriname, Guyana, Brazil, Colombia and then dropping into Texas on the way back. The state department has billed the trip as highlighting “the United States’ commitment to defend democracy, combating Covid-19 while revitalizing our economies in the pandemic’s wake, and strengthening security against regional threats.” On the Brazil leg of the trip they specifically say that “Pompeo will underscore the importance of US and Brazilian support for the Venezuelan people in their time of need by visiting with Venezuelan migrants fleeing the manmade disaster in Venezuela.” And it is wheels up for me too, as I am finished for the day. My colleague Joan Greve in Washington will be along to take over shortly. White House chief of staff Mark Meadows said he would meet with airline CEOs today as industry workers face layoffs. He urged lawmakers to embrace a $1.5 trillion coronavirus aid package proposed by a bipartisan lawmakers group, which has also been embraced by President Donald Trump. That has set Trump against the fiscal hawks in his party who have been pushing instead for a ‘skinny’ relief bill. “I’m meeting with airline CEOs today. We’ve got tens of thousands of people that are about to be laid off,” he said in an interview with Fox News. “So if nothing more, let’s go ahead and put that package on the floor and pass that. Because hopefully all of us can agree that laying off airline workers at this particular time is not something we should do.” The $25 billion in federal aid airlines received when the deadly Covid-19 first began spreading across the country and around the world is set to expire this month, report Reuters. Companies such as American Airlines are now pleading for a six-month extension while they simultaneously negotiate with employees to minimize thousands of job cuts that are expected without another round of aid. Air travel has plummeted over the last six months and with a major revenue plunge, airlines have had to turn to the federal government for help in saving jobs. The Washington Post this morning have a report on the crisis engulfing the United States Postal Service (USPS) which they say is based upon nearly 10,000 pages of emails, memos and other private documents. The documents, which mostly span March and April, depict an agency in distress, as its deteriorating finances collided with a public-health emergency and a looming election that would be heavily reliant on absentee ballots. The key points that the Post raises include: USPS occasionally used the legal counsel of Stefan C. Passantino, formerly a top White House lawyer under president Trump, and part of a new pro-Trump legal coalition preparing for a legally-contested election, raising ethics flags over USPS conduct running up to the election. In April, USPS leaders drafted a news release announcing plans to distribute 650 million masks nationwide. The idea had originated out of the department of Health and Human Services, and appears to have been further along than previously thought. The plan was stopped by the White House. The USPS was swamped with messages from concerned workers and their families that as essential workers they were being forced to work without adequate protection against the spread of coronavirus. In April the Treasury Department demanded operating control over the agency in return for emergency Covid funding, a move that the USPS’s legal team determined to be illegal. Despite Trump’s repeated evidence-free allegation that the USPS under-charges Amazon, the documents reveal that the online outfit drove roughly $3.9 billion in revenue, and $1.6 billion in profit for the USPS in 2019. However the documents reveal that renegotiating the USPS contract with Amazon earlier in the year was fraught. There’s much more, too. Read it here: Washington Post – A scrapped plan to ship masks to Americans. A standoff with Amazon amid pressure from Trump. New documents detail USPS’s spring in crisis The debate over the sale of TikTok to Oracle continues to rumble on this week. The US government is currently reviewing the plan, while TikTok’s current owners have said that the Chinese government will also have to approve the move. China late last month updated its export control rules to give it a say over the transfer of technology such as TikTok’s user recommendation algorithm to foreign buyers. ByteDance and its founder Zhang Yiming have faced public criticism in China for seeming to give in to US pressure. This morning Reuters report that, when asked about ByteDance’s comments regarding the need for China’s approval, the Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday urged the United States to respect the principles of the market economy and fair competition, and to stop politicising normal economic and trade cooperation. Which I’m sure will go down brilliantly in Washington. Pensacola International Airport remains closed and officials say they need to assess the safety of the runway and its facility before it reopens after Hurricane Sally came ashore on the Gulf Coast yesterday. The westernmost city in the Florida Panhandle bore the brunt of the hurricane yesterday. Hurricane Teddy, in the meantime, has become a Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm is currently located about 625 miles (1006 km) east-northeast of The Lesser Antilles. Teddy is moving toward the northwest at about 12 miles per hour (19 kph), the general motion it is expected to continue through the weekend. Satellite images show six tropical storm systems swirling around the Atlantic and Pacific oceans near the Americas. Additional strengthening is forecasted to happen during the next couple of days, and Teddy could become a major hurricane Thursday night or Friday, the Associated Press report. Mike Ryan, one of the health experts at the World Health Organisation, described the science around the coronavirus as “complicated stuff” this morning in Geneva. Jessica Glenza has been looking for us at one of enduring mysteries of Covid, including how long a person’s immune system protects against the virus after an infection. A man in Nevada was infected with Covid-19 in March. He recovered and then tested negative for Covid-19. His would have been an unremarkable story amid a pandemic that has infected millions of people in America – if he had not been infected again less than six weeks later. The 25-year-old male from the American south-west became what appears to be only the second published case of Covid-19 reinfection in the scientific literature, alongside a case of reinfection in Hong Kong. Researchers believe he was reinfected when a family member, also an essential worker, brought a slightly different coronavirus strain home in early June. The man had to be hospitalized on his second bout with Covid-19, but eventually recovered. He is still suffering side-effects. Read it here: Nevada reinfection case raises question: how long does Covid immunity last? The president’s first tweet of the day is to again cast doubt on the result of the forthcoming election. Trump writes: Because of the new and unprecedented massive amount of unsolicited ballots which will be sent to “voters”, or wherever, this year, the Nov 3rd Election result may NEVER BE ACCURATELY DETERMINED As mentioned earlier [see 6:56], Trump’s former director of national intelligence Dan Coats has called this morning in the New York Times for Congress to establish a bipartisan commission to monitor voting and ensure that laws and regulations are followed in November’s election. Former REM singer Michael Stipe has written for us this morning, saying “Athens, Georgia, was my home. Its leaders are letting Covid-19 wreak havoc” Early this year, great friends in Italy, and later in NYC, witnessed suffering and community-wide devastation that should have presaged wise action around the globe, so others would not have to experience the same pattern of heartbreaking deaths. Unfortunately, cities here in Georgia were soon to face the burden of some of America’s worst tendencies toward magical thinking and ignorance of science, and the most basic of disease prevention tactics. Our leaders are largely to blame. Georgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, a Donald Trump acolyte, was slow to order safety measures and quick to lift them, even limiting individual cities’ abilities to create a stronger framework than his recommendations. Despite weak steps from state leadership, Athens was full of smart and careful residents, and the community remained much lower in case and death metrics than other population centers in Georgia throughout the spring and summer. Hold tight. The return of tens of thousands of young university students to the University of Georgia here has upended this sense of relative safety. Read it here: Michael Stipe – Athens, Georgia, was my home. Its leaders are letting Covid-19 wreak havoc Hawaii’s governor says that starting on 15 October, travelers arriving from out of state may bypass a 14-day quarantine requirement if they test negative for the coronavirus. Associate Press report that Gov. David Ige said travelers will have to take the test within 72 hours before their flight arrives in the islands. Ige says drug store operator CVS and healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente will conduct the tests. The state has previously delayed the start of the pre-travel testing program twice as Covid-19 cases spiked on the U.S. mainland and in Hawaii. Leaders hope pre-travel testing will encourage tourists to return while keeping residents safe. Tourism traffic to the state has plunged more than 90% during the pandemic, closing hundreds of hotels and putting many people out of work. Hawaii has recorded just over 100 deaths from coronavirus. Kari Paul in San Francisco has been reporting for us on some of the problems that have been hampering firefighters attempting to deal with the unprecedented wildfires that have ravaged the west cost of the US. When wildfires burned near Palo Alto last month, emergency workers in this city legendary for its resident high-tech companies relied on relatively low-tech tools to coordinate a response. Emergency response units talked by two-way radio and sent each other text messages with photos of paper maps, said Kenneth Dueker, the director of Palo Alto’s office of emergency services. “Here we are right in the middle of Silicon Valley,” Dueker said. “Why am I using paper and pencil and a two-way radio when I should be using geospatial tools? It’s very 1920s, frankly.” California fires are evolving amid global warming, becoming more frequent, more intense, faster-moving and more difficult to contain. The communications of those who fight them, however, are stuck in the past, Dueker said. Read it here: Paper maps, two-way radios: how firefighting tech is stuck in the past In an op-ed this morning for the New York Times, Dan Coats who served as the director of national intelligence from 2017 to 2019 has called for Congress to establish a bipartisan commission to monitor voting and ensure that laws and regulations are followed in November’s election. It is expected that both the process and results will be heavily contested, with Joe Biden already assembling an army of attorneys for the expected post-election legal fight. Coats writes: Our democracy’s enemies, foreign and domestic, want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent; that sinister conspiracies have distorted the political will of the people; that our public discourse has been perverted by the news media and social networks riddled with prejudice, lies and ill will; that judicial institutions, law enforcement and even national security have been twisted, misused and misdirected to create anxiety and conflict, not justice and social peace. If those are the results of this tumultuous election year, we are lost, no matter which candidate wins. No American, and certainly no American leader, should want such an outcome. Total destruction and sowing salt in the earth of American democracy is a catastrophe well beyond simple defeat and a poison for generations. An electoral victory on these terms would be no victory at all. The judgment of history, reflecting on the death of enlightened democracy, would be harsh. The most urgent task American leaders face is to ensure that the election’s results are accepted as legitimate. Electoral legitimacy is the essential linchpin of our entire political culture. We should see the challenge clearly in advance and take immediate action to respond. Read it here: New York Times – Dan Coats: The election needs oversight A wedding in Maine has been described as a “superspreader event” and linked to 170 Covid cases and seven deaths. A rural church wedding and reception on a beautiful day in the shadow of Mount Katahdin was no doubt a happy day. But it has spread misery ever since. That single event on 7 August is linked to coronavirus outbreaks in at least two other locations in Maine, with more than 170 people contracting the virus and seven deaths since. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control, said the single event has the power to undo much of the state’s progress during the pandemic. The virus can become “the uninvited guest at every single wedding, party or event in Maine”, he warned. The “superspreader” event started with wedding attendees in the Katahdin region and spread to the community at large and to a nursing home in Madison. An attendee worked at the York county jail, 220 miles away, where there are more than 70 cases. The state is also investigating an outbreak at a church in Sanford, home of the wedding’s officiant. None of those who died actually attended the wedding and reception. Read it here: Maine ‘superspreader’ wedding linked to 170 Covid cases and seven deaths Those contradictory statements over masks were raised in Geneva this morning. Reuters report that the World Health Organization’s top emergency expert, asked about Trump and his director, said it was important for all countries to have “consistent messaging” for their public. “It is important that we have consistent messaging from all levels, and it’s not for one country or one entity; consistent messaging between science and between government,” the WHO’s Mike Ryan said in response to a question about the exchange. The science around the coronavirus was “complicated stuff”, with data and new evidence evolving, Ryan said. “So it isn’t easy and it isn’t easy for everyone to be on message all of the time.” “What is important is that governments, scientific institutions, step back, review the evidence, and give the most comprehensive easy-to-understand-and-digest information so that people can take the appropriate action.” Ryan, a veteran of Ebola outbreaks in Africa and other epidemics, said authorities must engage with communities to address anxieties. “It’s understanding the confusion, it’s understanding their concern, it’s understanding their apprehension. And not laughing at it and not turning that into some kind of political football,” he added. Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead for Covid-19, said it recommended a comprehensive package of measures including physical distancing to prevent spread of the virus. “Masks are part of it,” she added. Here’s a reminder of the contradictions that Donald Trump and CDC Dr Robert Redfield. Redfield said: “This face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid than when I take a Covid vaccine” and he added they were “the most important public health tool we have.” Later on, during his press conference yesterday, Trump said of him: “As far as the mask is concerned, he made a mistake.” Newt Gingrich has made an unfortunate typo in a tweet this morning, which he has acknowledged himself, but it has allowed people to leap on it. By mistake, meaning to talk about vaccines, he tweeted “How can Joe Biden and Kamala Harris wage a campaign to convince Americans to not take a virus”. CNN’s John Harwood has responded to say that “35K of them are unwillingly taking it [the virus] daily, and 1K are dying from it” suggesting that is why “Trump is losing and reacting by openly injecting politics into vaccine research” The first volume of former US president Barack Obama’s memoirs is to be published globally on 17 November 2020 by Penguin Random House, placing the release just two weeks after the US election. It will be issued simultaneously in 25 languages. The publishers describe the first volume as covering the story of “his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world” indicating that it will cover his ascendency to being the first Black American president of the United States, and his first term in office. Obama himself tweeted about the publication, stating “There’s no feeling like finishing a book, and I’m proud of this one.” He said that in the volume he tries to “provide an honest accounting of my presidency, the forces we grapple with as a nation, and how we can heal our divisions and make democracy work for everybody.” The publishers state that Obama “offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of US partisan politics and international diplomacy.” Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House situation room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Valdimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about US strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune’s Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. Penguin Random House say that in the book “He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment.” Obama adds “I hope more than anything that the book inspires young people across the country—and around the globe—to take up the baton, lift up their voices, and play their part in remaking the world for the better.” In the US, the print edition, which includes two 16-page photo inserts, will sell for $45, while there is an $18 digital edition. An unabridged audio edition of the book, read by the author himself, will be simultaneously released in digital and physical formats Details about an Obama book tour will be announced later this autumn. A publication date for the second, and concluding, volume of the memoirs has not yet been set. Amy Dorris alleges she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump in 1997, when she was 24. Speaking publicly about the alleged incident for the first time, the former model claims Trump grabbed her as she came out of the bathroom of his VIP box at the US Open tennis event, forced his tongue down her throat and held her in a grip from which she could not escape. Trump’s lawyers said he denied in the strongest possible terms having ever harassed, abused or behaved improperly toward Dorris. Here’s her interview: The claim from Amy Dorris that Donald Trump sexually assaulted her in 1997 makes her at least the 26th woman to come forward and accuse him of acts like this in allegations that span decades. Trump has denied every charge, dismissing his accusers as liars and publicity seekers, claiming never to have met some of them and, in at least two cases, suggesting they were not attractive enough for him. Here’s a backgrounder on all of the allegations that have been made about the president’s conduct: ‘It felt like tentacles’: the women who accuse Trump of sexual misconduct We have an exclusive this morning from Lucy Osborne, that former model Amy Dorris alleges that president Donald Trump forced his tongue down her throat and groped her at 1997 US Open. A former model has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexually assaulting her at the US Open tennis tournament more than two decades ago, in an alleged incident that left her feeling “sick” and “violated”. In an exclusive interview with the Guardian, Amy Dorris alleged that Trump accosted her outside the bathroom in his VIP box at the tournament in New York on 5 September 1997. Dorris, who was 24 at the time, accuses Trump of forcing his tongue down her throat, assaulting her all over her body and holding her in a grip she was unable to escape from. Read it here: Donald Trump accused of sexual assault by former model The Washington Post this morning have a report from a whistleblower about the extent to which law enforcement official were trying to stockpile ammunition and source weapons before clearing protesters from Lafayette Square, Washington DC in early June. The Post reports the sworn testimony DC National Guard Maj. Adam D. DeMarco, saying: DeMarco’s account contradicts the administration’s claims that protesters were violent, tear gas was never used and demonstrators were given ample warning to disperse — a legal requirement before police move to clear a crowd. His testimony also offers a glimpse into the equipment and weaponry federal forces had — and others that they sought — during the early days of protests that have continued for more than 100 days in the nation’s capital. The weapons sought included “devices that could emit deafening sounds and make anyone within range feel like their skin is on fire”. DeMarco said they were looking to use crowd control technology deemed too unpredictable to use in war zones. Overnight Congresswoman Ilhan Omar responded to the reports, saying the current behaviour of authorities was “a test of the strength” of the US Constitution. Read it here: Washington Post – Federal officials stockpiled munitions, sought ‘heat ray’ device before clearing Lafayette Square, whistleblower says The clean-up may have started after Hurricane Sally hit the Gulf coast yesterday, but experts are warning that there may be more danger yet to come for residents in Alabama and Florida from rivers swollen by the storm’s rains. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned residents and visitors in flooded areas that they would need to remain vigilant as water from the hurricane subsides, because heavy rains to the north were expected to cause flooding in Panhandle rivers in the coming days. “So this is kind of the initial salvo, but there is going to be more that you’re going to have to contend with,” DeSantis said at a Wednesday news conference in Tallahassee. Pensacola bore the brunt, with nearly 3 feet (1 meter) of water covering streets downtown, the National Weather Service reported. Some Pensacola streets looked like rivers with whitecaps at times. The waters swamped parked cars before receding. A replica of Christopher Columbus’ ship the Nina was missing from where it was docked at the Pensacola waterfront, police said. The ship was later seen run aground in downtown Pensacola, Pensacola News Journal reported. The storm was a nerve-racking experience for University of West Florida student Brooke Shelter. She was wide awake Wednesday morning as strong winds and rainfall battered her home, marking her first experience with a hurricane. “The damage around my home is pretty minor, for which I am thankful for,” Shelter said. “However, it is so sad seeing how flooded downtown is.” Here’s some of the latest on the wildfires from the Associated Press, which reports that the smoke from the western United States is stretching clear across the country and even pushing into Mexico, Canada and Europe. Susan Montoya Bryan writes that while the dangerous plumes are forcing people inside along the west Coast, residents thousands of miles away in the east are seeing unusually hazy skies and remarkable sunsets. Although experts say the smoke poses less of a health concern for those who are farther away, and New Yorkers were flooding social media with shots of a spectacular sunset, on the west coast, air quality conditions were among some of the worst ever recorded. Smoke cloaked the Golden Gate Bridge and left Portland and Seattle in an ashy fog, as crews have exhausted themselves trying to keep the flames from consuming more homes and even wider swaths of forest. Satellite images showed that smoke from the wildfires has traveled almost 5,000 miles (8,000 kilometers) to Britain and other parts of northern Europe, scientists said Wednesday. The current weather system, which favors a westerly wind across the higher levels of the atmosphere, is to blame for the reach of the smoke, experts explained. “We always seem, at times, to get the right combination of enough smoke and the upper level jet stream to line up to bring that across the country, so we’re just seeing this again,” said Matt Solum with the National Weather Service’s regional operations center in Salt Lake City, Utah. “It’s definitely not the first time this has happened.” Kim Knowlton, a senior scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York City, said she woke up Wednesday to a red sunrise and more haze. She said millions of people who live beyond the flames can end up dealing with diminished air quality as it’s not uncommon for wildfire smoke to travel hundreds of miles. Although the health impacts are reduced the farther and higher into the atmosphere the smoke travels, Knowlton and her colleagues said the resulting haze can exacerbate existing problems like asthma and add to ozone pollution. Overnight Joe Biden continued his theme of calling Donald Trump a ‘climate arsonist’ and attempting to make the president’s response to wildfires a campaign issue. Good morning and welcome to our US politics live blog for Thursday. Here’s a quick catch-up on where we are, and a taster of what might be coming up during the day The CDC director Robert Redfield said a coronavirus vaccine won’t be widely available until late 2021. Donald Trump outlined a national federal plan to distribute it, but contradicted him and said it would be ready mid-October. Redfield also suggested that face masks may be “more guaranteed to protect me against Covid” than a vaccine. Trump also later contradicted that, saying “No, vaccine is much more effective than the masks.” Joe Biden said “Let me be clear, I trust vaccines. I trust scientists. But I don’t trust Donald Trump, and at this moment, the American people can’t either.” There were 993 new coronavirus deaths recorded in the US yesterday. There were also 39,124 new Covid cases. The last couple of days have seen a slight movement up again on the national caseload, and levels are very similar to that seen a fortnight ago. A study has found that minorities are much more likely than white people to test positive for Covid. Hurricane Sally has killed one person and left ‘historic flooding’ across the metropolitan areas of Pensacola, Florida, and Mobile, Alabama, encompassing nearly a million people. Wild fires continue to burn on the west coast as armed civilian roadblocks in the Oregon town of Corbett fuel fears over vigilantism. Acting secretary of homeland security Chad Wolf, FBI director Christopher Wray and national counterterrorism center cirector Christopher Miller will testify before the House committee on homeland security at 9am. Nancy Pelosi has demanded an investigation into a whistleblower’s claims that there were forced hysterectomy procedures at an Ice centre in Georgia. The president’s plans today include a credentialing ceremony for newly appointed ambassadors in the morning, delivering remarks at the White House Conference on American History which is being held at the National Archives Museum in DC, and then he heads for a campaign stop in Mosinee, Wisconsin. Biden will be fund-raising in the morning, and hosting a virtual Rosh Hashanah event this afternoon. Then later on in Scranton, Pennsylvania he will be doing a CNN town hall.

          "headline": "Disadvantaged students narrow GCSE attainment gap in England",
          "bodyText": "Disadvantaged students in England improved their results at GCSE this summer, narrowing the attainment gap with their peers, according to an analysis. After summer exams were cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there were fears that disadvantaged students could lose out from results based on teacher assessments because of the risk of bias. Research by FFT Education Datalab found no evidence that the attainment gap had widened. Instead, it identified a slight narrowing of the gap at the crucial grade 4 or above threshold, equivalent to the bottom of an old C grade. The 4 grade at GCSE is considered crucial because it allows pupils to go on to further study or training. Those who do not gain a 4 in English and maths must retake the exams while they remain in post-16 education. Based on analysis of this year’s results at 1,200 secondary schools, researchers found that 56% of disadvantaged pupils achieved a grade 4 or above in English and maths at GCSE, compared with 78% of non-disadvantaged pupils. Although at 22 percentage points, the attainment gap remains vast, it is an improvement on last year, when the comparable figures were 46% and 72%, a gap of 26 percentage points. Philip Nye, a researcher at FFT Education Datalab, said: “After the chaos of this summer’s results season, the news that the disadvantage gap does not seem to have widened comes as a relief. “The gap remains worryingly large – but many of us feared that disadvantaged pupils might have lost out with the cancellation of GCSE exams and the move to an alternative awarding approach. That does not seem to have happened. “All efforts should now be made to support disadvantaged pupils who will take their GCSEs in 2021 to ensure that the attainment gap does not widen next year.” There was an outcry among teachers and pupils after an algorithm designed by the exams regulator Ofqual to standardise results across England caused the widespread downgrading of centre-assessed grades (Cags) at A-level. The government performed a dramatic U-turn, scrapping the algorithm and allowing Cags, set by teachers and schools, to be used instead to award grades for both A-levels and GCSEs. Figures published by Ofqual at the start of summer showed its algorithm would probably have caused a slight widening in the attainment gap in GCSE results between pupils who were on free school meals and those who were not."

          "headline": "YouTube viewers to help uncover how users are sent to harmful videos",
          "bodyText": "YouTube viewers are being asked to become “watchdogs” and record their use of the site to help uncover the ways in which its recommendation algorithm can lead to online radicalisation. Mozilla, the non-profit behind the Firefox web browser, has produced a new browser extension, called RegretsReporter, which will allow YouTube users to record and upload information about harmful videos recommended by the site, as well as the route they took to get there. “For years, people have raised the alarm about YouTube recommending conspiracy theories, misinformation, and other harmful content,” said Ashley Boyd, Mozilla’s head of engagement and advocacy. “One of YouTube’s most consistent responses is to say that they are making progress on this and have reduced harmful recommendations by 70%. But there is no way to verify those claims or understand where YouTube still has work to do. “That’s why we’re recruiting YouTube users to become YouTube watchdogs. People can donate their own recommendation data to help us understand what YouTube is recommending, and help us gain insight into how to make recommendation engines at large more trustworthy.” More than two years ago, the Guardian revealed how YouTube’s recommendation algorithm, the workings of which are not fully understood outside the company, gave “dangerously skewed” video suggestions. In the years since, users have repeatedly expressed surprise and dismay at the harmful content they are encouraged to view. After watching a YouTube video about Vikings, one user said they were recommended content about white supremacy; another found You’ve Been Framed-style footage led to grisly clips from real-life fatal accidents. “More than 70% of all videos viewed on YouTube are suggested by the site’s recommendation engine,” Mozilla said. “But even the basics of how it works are poorly detailed. The organisation says it wants to research the answers to questions like what type of recommended videos lead to racist, violent, or conspiratorial content, and whether there are specific YouTube usage patterns that lead to harmful content being recommended. The company says it will share findings from the research in an open-source fashion.” In a statement, a YouTube spokesperson said: “While we welcome more research on this front, we have not seen the videos, screenshots or data in question and can’t properly review Mozilla’s claims. Generally, we’ve designed our systems to help ensure that content from more authoritative sources is surfaced prominently in recommendations.

          "headline": "Australia beat England by three wickets to win ODI series – as it happened",
          "bodyText": "Here’s Adam Peake. “Buttler drops Blackwood, West Indies win the first Test of the summer,” he notes. “Buttler drops Maxwell, Australia win the final game of a wonderful summer of cricket. Thanks for all your commentary and writing, great stuff. Be well.” Thanks, you too. And here’s Lola Jones. “I was trying to finish writing my personal statement for my uni application,” she says, “but was instead glued to my phone the last few hours hoping England would make it! So much for getting it finished before the last minute.” The last minute is the very best time to do it. Never mind uni – you have a bright future as a live-blogger. So the series went to the last over, and the summer went to the last warm September evening. Immense credit goes to the ECB and their overseas counterparts, to Manchester and Southampton, to Lancashire and Hampshire CCC, to two overworked groundsmen, and even (grudgingly) to the English weather. To Jason Holder and Ben Stokes, the captains who got the ball rolling, and all the others who tossed a coin or changed the bowling – Joe Root and Eoin Morgan, Andy Balbirnie, Azhar Ali and Babar Azam, and Aaron Finch, who became the only one of those visiting captains to win a series. All of them were dignified, statesmanlike, and straightforward – can they please run for office in due course? Credit too to Sky and the BBC, which brought cricket back to a wide audience. To all the commentators, led by Michael Holding and Ebony Rainford-Brent with their superb testimony for Black Lives Matter. To all the fans who couldn’t be there, but were absolutely there in spirit, cheering on Woakes and Buttler, Anderson’s 600th and Broad’s 500th, Zak Crawley’s 267. I’m in grave danger of thanking everyone, as people do at the Oscars. And the winner is ... cricket. Thanks for reading, for writing, for following and for caring. It’s been a treat. “So much,” says Jota Jony, “for my observation of this being an anticlimax. You were right to call this - amazing partnership which almost contrived to throw away, again! A strange gamble from Morgan but simply incredible, incredible!. A summer for the ages. Phew.” Nicely done. Are you after my job? Most of the match feels like it took place several days ago, but there are others who need mentioning in dispatches. Adam Zampa was very good (unlike his hair), luring Morgan and Buttler into soft dismissals, caught in the ring. Mitch Starc started the match by taking two wickets in two balls and finished it by walloping 11 off three. Chris Woakes batted beautifully and bowled well. Mark Wood took a great catch under the highest pressure. Eoin Morgan came out with two strokes of genius, bowling Root early and Rashid late (his third and final gamble, keeping Rashid on at the death, didn’t go so well). But the day belonged to Alex Carey and Glenn Maxwell. On Sunday one of them had been constipated and the other not even that, but today they were majestic, and they put together one of the all-time great one-day partnerships. Maxwell, who made 77 in the first game, was pivotal to both Australia’s victories, and he deservedly wins Player of the Series. “I just feel really calm at the crease,” he says, which is a massive victory of another kind after his mental troubles. “Damn cricket,” says Kat Petersen. “I’m trying to have an extremely nice dinner in Jersey for my 40th birthday and we’re now glued to an app each in the hope that Australia won’t ruin the evening.” They haven’t ruined it! They’ve played an absolute blinder. (But also, happy birthday – hope you’re allowed more than five guests.) Steve Waugh used to say that if you’re going to lose, at least make sure it takes a good performance to do it – and England did that, as Bairstow, Billings and Woakes rescued them from their worst-ever first two balls in an ODI. We’ve had 600 runs in the day, and the richest entertainment. We’ve even Joe Root collecting more wickets (two) than balls faced (one). Starc, who got a golden duck on Sunday, is the hero here with six, one, and a sweep for four. England lose a home series, for once, as Australia seal the victory that Carey and Maxwell deserved with that fabulous partnership of 212. 49.3 overs: Australia 301-7 (Cummins 4, Starc 7) Single to Cummins. England are desperate for a dot. 49.2 overs: Australia 300-7 (Cummins 3, Starc 7) Starc loft-wafts Rashid for... a single. Three needed off four. The gamble isn’t working. 49.1 overs: Australia 299-7 (Cummins 3, Starc 6) After a superb over from Archer, Morgan goes with ... Rashid! And Starc hits his first ball for six! Unbelievable. Australia’s to lose now. 49th over: Australia 293-7 (Cummins 3, Starc 0) Cummins squeezes another single, doing his duty, giving Carey the strike. Morgan is taking his time. Archer bowls a wide-ish one and gets away with it as Carey strikes thin air. And again – but this is a wide, just. Ten needed from seven. And Carey is caught!! At third man, by Wood – a fabulous diving take, off the very shot that nearly did for Carey all those hours ago. You couldn’t make this up. Australia need ten off the last over. Mid-49th over: Australia 291-6 (Carey 106, Cummins 2) Cummins takes another single as Archer returns. Carey drives, handsomely, but Tom Curran at mid-off saves three. Archer strikes Cummins on the arm – ouch. Australia need 12 off nine. 48th over: Australia 289-6 (Carey 105, Cummins 1) Carey sweeps Rashid for two, then pokes for a single. Australia need 15 from 13 as Pat Cummins faces his first ball, after sitting through a stand of 212. Cummins manages a single, down the ground. Terrific stuff from Rashid, and Morgan, but Australia are still in the driving seat. They need 14 from 12 balls. Maxwell top-edges Rashid – twice! And the second one is an easy chance for Tom Curran (who juggles it) at backward point. The gamble has paid off. End of a great innings. 47th over: Australia 282-5 (Carey 101, Maxwell 106) Somewhere in there, Woakes beats Carey outside off, but again the edge eludes England Australia need only 21 now, off three overs, so the rate is down to a very manageable seven. England can only get back into this by taking wickets. And Rashid is loosening up! Not Root? Another ball, another milestone. Carey shovels to leg for a single and he has 100 off 106. Since he got to 40, he’s been excellent, cool and calm. Brought up by a six from Carey, off Woakes. This is phemonenal. 46th over: Australia 271-5 (Carey 93, Maxwell 103) Throw in a few singles and that’s 11 off Curran’s over. The partnership is 197 – scarcely believable. That no-ball is looking horribly expensive, although the delivery from Archer might not have drawn the error if it had been bowled from a few inches further back. Australia need 32 from 24 balls, and they are firm favourites now. Needing five to reach his century, Maxwell lofts Curran for six. He goes to 101 off 84 balls with seven sixes and four fours. He’s been immense. 45th over: Australia 260-5 (Carey 90, Maxwell 95) It’s a double change as Woakes returns. The plan is off-cutters, but these two have got their eyes so well in now, they can adjust. The closest England get to some joy is an appeal for a run-out as Sam Billings fires in an Exocet from deep square, but Carey’s dive is equal to it. Australia need 43 off 30 balls, and both men are in the nineties. Please can they be nervous. “In reply to Geoff Wignall,” says Brian Withington, “can I suggest a third lesson of the summer without endorsing the second - #3 Buttler to hang up the tin gloves in all forms.” Ouch. 44th over: Australia 252-5 (Carey 86, Maxwell 91) It’s Curran, after a lengthy conference, at which he is joined by Woakes and Archer as well as Morgan. His over goes dot, one, appeal for caught behind (off the hip), one – and then a four, as Maxwell waits for a slower ball and carves it over mid-off. One more single, and even a good over has gone for seven. The force is with Australia: Obi Eoin is going to have to pull out something special. “This evening,” says someone on Twitter, “marks six months since theatres across the UK shut, due to Covid.” It’s a big worry, what’s happening to the arts. But the theatre is alive and well – it’s just staging cricket matches. 43rd over: Australia 245-5 (Carey 85, Maxwell 86) Morgan is sticking with pace at both ends, and it’s giving the batsmen something to work with. Maxwell tickles Wood for four, and then there are five singles. Australia need 58 from 42 balls. Time, surely, for Woakes or Curran – Bendicks Bittermints or liquorice allsorts. 42nd over: Australia 236-5 (Carey 83, Maxwell 80) Archer follows Carey as he steps away to leg and is frustrated to find a wide called. Archer fights back with a yorker and a length ball, both dots. Carey, sensing the short one, steps away again and upper-cuts for four. A chip, not off the middle, but it lands safely for a single. A slower ball, and Maxwell slashes for two. Another yorker, arrow-straight, and Maxwell whips it for a single. Nine from the over. Australia need 8.38 off the remaining eight - 67 off 48 balls. This is riveting. 41st over: Australia 227-5 (Carey 78, Maxwell 77) Carey cuts Wood for a single and that’s the 150 partnership, off 144 balls. Formidable stuff. But then Wood beats Carey outside off, angling it across him, and Maxwell too misses as he steps away to take a big swing. Five off the over – pretty good, Wood. Australia need 76 off 54 balls. 40th over: Australia 222-5 (Carey 77, Maxwell 74) Morgan takes Rashid off and brings on Archer. He was the bowler who had Carey caught by Rashid at third man, only to find it was a no-ball. Carey plays the same shot again, with more control, and beats Rashid’s despairing sprint. Australia need 81 from the last ten overs. England badly need that wicket: they may have to turn to Root. 39th over: Australia 216-5 (Carey 72, Maxwell 73) Morgan is checking with the umpire to see how many overs each bowler has left. The good thing about giving Root as many as eight is that it provides flexibility now: if anyone gets carted, Morgan can take him off. Wood’s radar has a wobble as he dishes up two wides, and Australia need 87 off 66 balls. You’ll never guess what England had at this stage: yes, 216-5. “Evening Tim,” says Simon McMahon. “England on boundary count back after a Super Over?” 38th over: Australia 209-5 (Carey 68, Maxwell 72) When Rashid tosses up his leg-break, Maxwell is beaten outside off, but he instantly forgets about that and lofts another six over midwicket. What an innings this is. Australia need 93 off 12 overs at a rate of just under eight. The PA, rising to the occasion, plays Talking Heads’ Psycho Killer. 37th over: Australia 201-5 (Carey 67, Maxwell 65) Morgan summons Wood, but even his pace can’t bring the breakthrough. It’s as if all Morgan’s bowling-change magic was used up in those wickets for Root. “Good evening Tim” Good evening to you, Geoff Wignall. “If England win this then thank goodness for Bairstow’s knock. Without it there might be no choice but to make Woakes man of the match and that would never do.” Ha. “Lessons of the summer. #1 Buttler to bat at 6 in tests. #2 Buttler to open against the white ball. Has he made the Wisden 5 yet?” Yes! I wrote the piece myself. 36th over: Australia 196-5 (Carey 64, Maxwell 64) Rashid continues, and Maxwell continues to looking like a man who sorely misses the old hotel buffet. He lifts the first ball for possibly the biggest six of the summer – over a sign that says “Fly better”. Can’t fly better than that. A few singles, and that’s ten off the over: Rash has gone for 40 off his five. Australia need 107 off 84 balls. England need wickets. Here’s Brian Withington, bearing poetry. “A bit of warm weather at this time of year,” he says, “always has me recalling Thomas Hardy’s description of the Mayor of Casterbridge’s wife, Susan Henchard, enjoying a Martinmas in life – a late Indian summer of melancholic contentment. In passing, this is looking like a procession for Australia now. Surely they can’t fail to get across the line this time?” You’re not resorting to the curse of the commentator, are you? 35th over: Australia 186-5 (Carey 62, Maxwell 56) Morgan gambles, as he does, by keeping Woakes on. The batsmen again treat him with respect, taking only two, so Australia need 117 off 90 balls. Perfectly feasible, if these two stay together for a bit. 34th over: Australia 184-5 (Carey 61, Maxwell 55) Maxwell clonks Rashid, mis-timing it, but the single brings up the hundred partnership. And then he brings up his fifty with a six over the short boundary. It’s been a sparkling knock. That’s 12 off the over, and Australia need 119 off 16 overs. They’re almost the favourites now. 33rd over: Australia 172-5 (Carey 57, Maxwell 47) Before getting into that bizarre tangle, Maxwell reached 3000 runs in ODIs. He’s a thrilling player on his day, and it has been his day twice in the past week. He and Carey take two singles each off Woakes, hoping to see him off for now. Australia need 131 off 17 overs. 32nd over: Australia 168-5 (Carey 55, Maxwell 45) Adil, it turns out, was just changing ends. Maxwell goes for a big mow, misses or maybe nicks it, but Buttler can’t take it cleanly – and UltraEdge shows that it was dropped. Maxwell tries a reverse sweep, misses, falls over, and there’s a review for LBW, not given – it was plumb, but the ball hit the wristband (which counts as part of the glove), not the arm (which would have been out). Maxwell survives, even if his dignity doesn’t. And that’s drinks, with Australia threatening a classic heist. 31st over: Australia 163-5 (Carey 51, Maxwell 44) Adil Rashid only gets two overs, where Joe Root got eight. Interesting, Back comes Chris Woakes, and Carey plays a stylish pull to reach fifty off 58 balls. He’s been much better in the past ten minutes. Woakes, finding his mojo again, beats Maxwell outside off. This is now a good contest, and it may yet be the finale the summer of 2020 deserves. 30th over: Australia 158-5 (Carey 46, Maxwell 44) Morgan, needing to make something happen, turns to Mark Wood. Carey enjoys the extra pace and uses it to steer for four through the slips, which are inexplicably vacant. “How do you think [Lawrence] Booth will choose the five Wisden cricketers of the year?” wonders Rob Razzell. “How did you do it back in the day? I guessed four out of the five last year, but this year I’m stumped... Jason Holder... um... Tom Banton perhaps – what do you think?” Personally, I picked the people who had owned that year – Michael Vaughan and Adam Hollioake. Then, among the more marginal options, went for players who had built a big career – Nasser Hussain, Matthew Hayden and Shaun Pollock. Lawrence has a problem I didn’t have, in that most of England’s star players have already been chosen. Even so, I wouldn’t bet on Banton. 29th over: Australia 151-5 (Carey 41, Maxwell 43) Rashid bowls a long hop and Maxwell can’t believe he’s pulled it to square leg for no run. His strike rate is 116, to Carey’s 80: Maxwell’s silver hammer is coming down on England’s head. 28th over: Australia 146-5 (Carey 37, Maxwell 42) For a one-day specialist, Carey is not good at rotating the strike. After a row of dots, he finally manages to guide Curran to third man, whereupon Maxwell launches a pent-up on-drive for six. The fact that he comes in after Carey is looking like a miscarriage of justice. But they’re still there, and Australia are only two behind England at the same stage (148-4). 27th over: Australia 139-5 (Carey 35, Maxwell 36) At last, Root comes off, giving way to England’s premier spinner, Adil Rashid. He makes a confident start before Carey sweeps him for a wind-assisted six that just evades Root at deep square. The partnership is 65 off 61 balls. England are still favourites, but... 26th over: Australia 130-5 (Carey 29, Maxwell 34) Maxwell, facing Curran, plays the shot of the innings, a lovely delicate glide through a narrow gap at backward point. John Vegancatering is back for more. “If your guess turns out to be true,” he writes, “imagine 5 tests in India! Could we all please make a small prayer for Leach and Rashid and Bess in the tour party?? At last England have some really good spinners, we must use them. All the best, John (my surname is not my job) Christiansen.” Ha. And let’s not forget Moeen Ali, who has taken plenty of Indian wickets in his time. 25th over: Australia 122-5 (Carey 28, Maxwell 28) It’s Root again! I don’t believe it. Maxwell, after being tied down for two balls, tucks in with a straight six. Carey adds a late cut and that’s eight off the over. That’s the halfway stage, with Australia clawing their way out of a nightmare. And Morgan confounding everyone by giving Root nearly a third of the overs so far. “That’s enough I think,” says David Lloyd, gently. 24th over: Australia 114-5 (Carey 27, Maxwell 21) Tom Curran finally concedes a run off his ninth ball as Carey, hemmed in, pulls out the reverse sweep. He’s not great at giving the strike back to Maxwell, but he redeems himself with a cuff for four past cover. The partnership is a promising 41. 23rd over: Australia 108-5 (Carey 22, Maxwell 20) Morgan mysteriously rejects my advice and opts for one more over from Root, who bowls his first really amateurish ball – a half-tracker which is pulled for four by a grateful Carey. Root now has two for 38 off seven overs. “Living in Sweden,” says Julian Menz, “I have followed the cricketing summer as closely as possible, and not always 100% legally (a big shout to our Sri Lankan neighbour and his forest of satelite bowls, antennae, and frankly rather dodgy links).” Ha. “I can only echo others who have said much the same, but cheers to the West Indies, Pakistan, the Aussies, for making a summer of great cricket possible in these trying times. Even my 5-year-old daughter has taken to using her mini ice-hockey club as a cricket bat, and the local wildlife might well be surprised by the proliferation of bald tennis balls in the adjacent forest.” Not, presumably, the forest of dishes? 22nd over: Australia 100-5 (Carey 16, Maxwell 18) At the other end, Archer has a breather, after bowling better than his figures (6-0-41-0) are willing to admit. On comes Tom Curran, bearing dots – five of them, as Alex Carey takes no risks. In fact, it’s a maiden. Maybe Carey has worked out that it’s all down to this partnership. 21st over: Australia 100-5 (Carey 16, Maxwell 18) It’s still Root, who is threatening to do Adil Rashid out of a job, but not threatening the bat as much as he was. Time for a change. So, Michael Klinski, you asked about England’s winter. Nothing is fixed yet, and prediction is even more of a mug’s game than usual, but the assumption is that England will tour India, for five Tests circa February. Maybe Sri Lanka as well, for the two Tests that were postponed in March; and maybe South Africa for some one-layers before Christmas. But nobody knows anything. 20th over: Australia 95-5 (Carey 12, Maxwell 17) Carey celebrates his reprieve by swiping the free hit for three. And then Maxwell top-edges, almost deliberately, for four, over Jos Buttler’s head. Nine off the over, and maybe the Aussies see a glimmer at the end of the tunnel. That no-ball, by the way, was the first Jofra had ever bowled in an ODI. Archer persuades Carey to steer to third man – but it’s a big no-ball. Is that a turning point? 19th over: Australia 86-5 (Carey 9, Maxwell 12) Another good over from Root, who is threatening to bowl his full ten. I put it to you that he should be treated as an all-rounder in Tests, which will mean that England can replace Dom Bess with the more testing Jack Leach. And his glasses, which have now been immortalised by a nine-year-old. 18th over: Australia 83-5 (Carey 8, Maxwell 10) Australia desperately need a counter-attack: cometh the hour, cometh Glenn Maxwell. As Morgan tries to go for the kill by bringing back Archer, Maxwell’s eyes light up and he lofts a six over the short boundary. Great start. And here’s Michael Klinski. “Sitting here in my home-office in South Dakota,” he begins, “and trying to console myself that this game doesn’t spell the end of English cricket until next summer. What’s the latest on England’s hopes for a tour this winter?” Perhaps I can answer that when the game calms down a bit. 17th over: Australia 73-5 (Carey 8, Maxwell 0) Morgan persists with Root, and Labuschagne seizes on a half-volley to cover-drive for four. That was a hockey player’s shot. Then there’s a near run-out, then an actual run-out, so the decision to keep Root on pays off, indirectly. What?! Labuschagne, having just survived one ill-advised run, succumbs to another one as Sam Billings fires in a fine throw from midwicket. The Aussies are turning a drama into a calamity. 16th over: Australia 67-4 (Labuschagne 15, Carey 7) Six off the over from Wood, who is bowling very fast but comes closest to a wicket when he slows down a bit. He nearly lures Labuschagne into a drag-on as he drives at a wide off-cutter without remembering to move his feet. 15th over: Australia 64-4 (Labuschagne 13, Carey 6) Root’s magic may be fading like September sunshine: he concedes his first four as Carey plays a beefy sweep. And that’s drinks, with everything Eoin Morgan touches turning to gold. “As glorious a summer and series as this has been,” says Jota Jony, “it is proving to be a hugely disappointing anticlimax. Oh well, feast often precedes famine, as it were.” Still time for a proper finale. England didn’t exactly start well, Labuschagne can play the anchor, and the man who made Australia’s highest score in the series so far, Glenn Maxwell, is still to come. 14th over: Australia 56-4 (Labuschagne 10, Carey 1) Alex Carey comes out to find Mark Wood bowling 95mph at one end, and Joe Root taking wickets for fun at the other, but he survives. That’s a maiden. Meanwhile Root can’t stop smiling, which is fair enough. He’s taken more wickets today than he faced deliveries. 13th over: Australia 56-4 (Labuschagne 10, Carey 1) Mitch Marsh, so staunch in the first match of this series, had got off the mark with a neat lap for two, but that was all he had to offer. And now Joe Root has figures of 2-0-8-2. C’mon Aussies, give us a game. It’s a rout! By Root! Bat, pad, pop up, dolly. I know Eoin Morgan’s a great captain, but this is ridiculous. 12th over: Australia 52-3 (Labuschagne 9, Marsh 0) After his gamble on Root paid off, you’d expect Morgan to go for the kill and post a few slips. But he keeps it cautious for Wood, with no close catchers, even though he’s steaming in. Just a single off the over. 11th over: Australia 51-3 (Labuschagne 8, Marsh 0) When Root came on, Shane Warne said: “Bash him out of the attack!” As it was, he bashed Warner out of the game. ROOOOOT! He’s just a part-time off-spinner, not seen in this series till now – but he finds some big turn, as Warner steps away top leg, and gets those illuminated bails jumping. 10th over: Australia 47-2 (Warner 23, Labuschagne 6) Morgan decides to keep six overs of Jofra up his sleeve and turns to his other fast man, Mark Wood. Like Archer, he makes an expensive start – Labuschagne punches for two, then Warner flicks for four, but Wood bounces back, beating Warner with a jaffa. And the Powerplay ends with England on top, but two dangermen at the crease. “Loving the OBO as always.” Thank you, John Vegancatering (I take it that’s your real name). “You have the best job that I know of.” We do. “Surely Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid are the first names on the team sheet?? Also, I think Bairstow has just saved his international career for which I am, as a Yorkie, very very thankful.” 9th over: Australia 40-2 (Warner 19, Labuschagne 3) More respect for Woakes – a few ones and a couple of dots. The Aussies have a cunning plan: they’re going to get ’em in singles. 8th over: Australia 36-2 (Warner 16, Labuschagne 1) Someone needs to make a hundred here, and both these two have it in them. Warner is an all-or-nothing player who owes his team runs; Labuschagne is a more of an all-or-40 merchant, phenomenally consistent for a relative beginner. Just the one run off this over from Archer, who went for 14 off his first and only nine off the last three. 7th over: Australia 35-2 (Warner 16, Labuschagne 1) Woakes, who is now being treated with the respect he deserves, goes for only two singles. And here’s Abhijato Sensarma, coming off his full run. “An English cricketing summer is greater than the sum of its parts, and the last one was the greatest of all. 2020, on the other hand, has proven that a cricketing summer is also stranger than the sum of its parts. This year gave us what we never knew we missed about the sport - the Denly debates, rants about poor light, and speculating about Anderson’s future even as he reached another milestone. It also gave us unexpected joy in the form of resilient opponents and mercurial collapses. It gave us the heroic Stokes, the resurgent Buttler, the youthful Crawley, the classy Blackwood, the exuberant Zampa, and the ageless Hafeez. But most importantly, this sport brought back the feeling of familiar comfort in our lives with its mere presence. Cheers, and long live cricket!” Are you Neville Cardus in disguise? 6th over: Australia 33-2 (Warner 15, Labuschagne 0) Archer is fit to continue – he’s not going to pass up the chance to terrorise Warner, who nearly perishes to a Harrow drive, staying back to a fast fierce full one. 5th over: Australia 31-2 (Warner 13, Labuschagne 0) Stoinis had just crashed a drive through Jofra Archer’s grasp at mid-off. He did get a hand to it, and may well regret it as he’s now trotting off the field, with David Lloyd saying he saw some blood. Hang on, he’s back. And Woakes has got rid of Stoinis, who seems to have thought he was playing Twenty20. Another one! A slower ball, a simple chip to midwicket, and Stoinis has gone the same way Morgan and Buttler did earlier – all too tamely, given this handsome pitch. Woakes is on fire. 4th over: Australia 27-1 (Warner 13, Stoinis 0) Warner faces his nemesis, Archer. He drives him for four, fends unhappily at a short one, then punches for two. He’s not in form yet, but he’s pulsating with intent. 3rd over: Australia 21-1 (Warner 7, Stoinis 0) Well done Woakes, who has one for seven off his two overs. He seems to be making a blatant bid for Player of the Match, which he could easily have been on Sunday, only to see it go to his new-ball partner. Got him! Woakes nips one back, the finger goes up, there’s no review, the dangerous Finch has gone and for once in this series, David Warner has outlasted him. 2nd over: Australia 18-0 (Warner 4, Finch 12) It’s Jofra Archer, of course – Morgan knows his opening pair and trusts them to the hilt. Jofra’s quick, 90ish, but not yet as accurate as usual – he goes wide, wide, dot, dot, four, four, as Finch tucks into a couple of half-volleys. He’s already bowled six balls and there are still two left. One is a slower ball, craftily done. The last is an edge – but another four, as Finch flashes over the two slips. Aussies on top, although there’s a long way to go. Thanks Tanya, hello everyone and sorry this paragraph is the wrong side of the one before – I nipped out for a rather ill-timed walk. 1st over: Australia 4-0 (Warner 4, Finch 0) Woakes, after that dreamy cameo, takes the new ball – and his first delivery goes for four as Warner, clipping to leg, gives him a taste of his own medicine. Woakes recovers with five dots, but Australia’s start is already a whole lot better than England’s. Whenever you feel England might be slipping behind the rate, they always find someone to pull them through. Here it was Chris Woakes, with the help of Adil Rashid, who drew out of his stylish man bag some truly innovative strokes . A brilliant hundred by Jonny Bairstow kept the tempo up through the innings and Sam Billings has done his chances of future selection no harm at all. All Australia’s bowlers had their moments but Adam Zampa was the pick again - clever and smart, finishing with 3-51. Time for a cup of tea here. Thanks for all your emails, Tim de Lisle will lead you through the final strokes of the summer. I wager it will be a tight one. 50th over: England 302-7 (Woakes 53, Rashid 11) Oh Chris Woakes, most elegant! Somehow he turns a lap into a fine outside edge via a sidestep and a wiggle. Another four comes through backward point, his fifty arrives off just 38 balls. A great total by England - magic recovery from 0-2 after two balls of the innings. 49th over: England 288-7 (Woakes 39, Rashid 11) Wowzers! Rashid takes a punt, shuffles wides of his stumps and plays an astonishing golf shot over square leg. SIX! The only boundary of the over. Starc stops just as he’s about to deliver to warn Rashid not to steal a single. 48th over: England 276-7 (Woakes 34, Rashid 4) Rashid somehow survives a beautiful Hazlewood yorker. A sensational over, just five from it. Two emails arrive simultaneously. “I’ve learned from TMS today that Australians call ‘putting the mockers on someone” is “mozzing”, taps John Starbuck, “So thanks Neil Withers for mozzing Tom Curran!” “Sorry everyone” says a bashful Neil Withers. 47th over: England 272-7 (Woakes 33, Rashid 1) An eventful over, after the six over cow corner, and the reverse-swinging yorker, Woakes elegantly wafts Starc over extra cover for four. One for the style-council. The ball after smashing him for six, Curran is undone by a yorker to die for, as he prepares to have a swing. 46th over: England 260-6 (Woakes 28, Tom Curran 13) Woakes falls elegantly down on one knee to drive but misses a full toss. Recovers his poise to dance into a cut off Hazlewood over backward point for four. Then Starc falls on his ankle fielding on the boundary - slipping and tumbling - shades of Glenn McGrath in 2005 at Edgbaston. It feels so undignified for a fast bowler. “Afternoon Tanya, afternoon everyone.” Hello Neil Withers! “Can I just point out that as Tom Curran is scoring more runs, his batting average (46.83) is sneaking up to his highest score (47)? Join me in some polite (and socially distant) applause when they draw level!” 45th over: England 248-6 (Woakes 22, Tom Curran 9) Woakes chips Starc over his head but only gets the single. Just a couple more of those to add to the score and Starc is bowling smart. Five overs left - time for some acceleration. The phantom Steve Smith appears, this time on the Australian balcony. I’m pretty sure he’s dozing, but with sunglasses on it is hard to tell. “I enjoyed the articles about Jack Leech’s glasses and Vicky Holland’s bronze medal,” writes Chris Lamb. “Congratulations to both winners! Any chance we’ll see some of the other entries?” I don’t know Chris, but I’ll ask. 44th over: England 246-6 (Woakes 20, Tom Curran 8) Woakes, as if swinging open the arms of a compass, pips Marsh back over his head. He innovates through the rest of the over with a couple from a hook with his head hidden by his arms. Six to go. 43rd over: England 236-6 (Woakes 13, Tom Curran 7) Woakes slams a four into that short boundary, nine from Cummins over. 42nd over: England 225-6 (Woakes 6, Tom Curran 3) End of a super spell from Zampa. An outside edge off Curran’s bat to his penultimate ball, one that zips in from outside leg, would have been grabbed by a slip, had there been one. He finishes with 3-51. “Given the pitch and conditions, what do you rate as a decent score for England to defend?” asks Richard Mansell. The commentators have said that the last 8 matches played at Old Trafford have been won by the side batting first, throw in dew, early-autumn darkness, the short boundary and England’s refusal to die - I’m guessing they would want 270 as a minimum - though there was talk of 320 when Bairstow was still in. 41st over: England 221-6 (Woakes 4, Tom Curran 1) Brilliant innings there by Bairstow, fluent and intelligent, after his mind-over-batter effort earlier in the series. Immediately puts the breaks on England - just one run from the over. Great little stat on Zampa. From nowhere, Bairstow foxed by Cummins who squeezes through the gap between arm and pad, ball exploding into the stump. 40th over: England 220-5 (Woakes 4, Bairstow 112) Just four singles from Zampa’s over and we move into the final chorus. 39th over: England 216-5 (Woakes 2, Bairstow 110) Great work from Mitch Marsh, a couple of slower balls, on the money. Just one from the over. An email arrives: “While I was enjoying the imagery of the undulating material on Starc’s trousers and your son rapping on the door like an angry debt collector, a question occurred to me about Bairstow, sparked by Abhijato’s comment. Has YJB’s technique visibly changed since he kept being bowled out last season? I’ve barely seen any live England cricket to observe him myself, though not sure I’d know what to look for.” Hmmm, Oliver Haill, I’m not claiming to be a technical expert here - some of you will have a far better eye than me. Though from memory his particularly long run of being bowled came in red-ball rather than white-ball cricket. No-one could ever fault Bairstow’s work ethic, or talent, so my hunch is that whatever the problem, he’ll find a way. 38th over: England 215-5 (Woakes 1, Bairstow 110) Zampa gets his man, though Bairstow pulls back some of the advantage with a dreamy extra-cover drive for four. A reverse-sweep too far. 37th over: England 208-4 (Billings 56, Bairstow 105) That’s the Bairstow hundred! With a six, whipped, smartly, over the short boundary, a flick of the wrists to a near-enough 90 mph ball. The next stroke is even better, four, straight, as if viciously swiping butter over his toast. That’s his tenth ODI century, and his slowest (116 balls.) 36th over: England 196-4 (Billings 55, Bairstow 94) Zampa comes in for some stick as Billings decides that with only 14 overs left, he has to go. He zips to his fifty with a pull and flays another two boundaries, one a rank slog to cow corner, another lofted drive over mid on. Billings continuing to grasp every opportunity this series. 35th over: England 180-4 (Billings 44, Bairstow 93) Shot of the day! Billings spreads his legs and pans Starc over fine leg for six. Starc retaliates with a slower ball that deceives Billings who sends the ball billowing to cover where it lands safely. 34th over: England 175-4 (Billings 35, Bairstow 93) Marsh resumes after the break, but England can’t crack him to the boundary. “Jonny Bairstow has made slow starts in both his big knocks in this series,” types Abhijato Sensarma, “yet he’s made up for the dot balls along the course of his innings. Glad to see he isn’t a one-trick pony. Big anchoring blinders (substantial scores with SR just below 100) will be crucial on the slow pitches of the subcontinent!” Yes, it’s going to come up so quickly, Covid-permitting. Each of these matches is really an audition for the slightly-fringe players. Even non-fringe players. England won’t want to drop Roy but, with Banton in the wings, he could do with some runs. 33rd over: England 168-4 (Billings 33, Bairstow 89) There’s a look of a taller, altogether chunkier Richard Hadlee to Starc’s approach as the cross wind continues to blow vigorously, undulating the material on Starc’s trousers and shirt. And that’s six! Billings slams the ball, from an almost proposal position, over the short boundary, over the car park and into the Old Trafford nets. One of the Australian squad has to be sent out in his plastic gloves to fetch it. And that’s drinks! 32nd over: England 159-4 (Billings 25, Bairstow 88) England resort to nervy singles, and Billings has a huge swing-n-miss at Michell Marsh. Unperturbed, he pulls him next ball but it is cut off by Stoinis who stops the ball with his stomach as he lands. 31st over: England 155-4 (Billings 23, Bairstow 87) Just a single from Hazlewood’s over as Australia, somewhat surprisingly, create some pressure from nowhere. I’m sure England have got this though, they always seem to know what they’re doing. 30th over: England 154-4 (Billings 23, Bairstow 86) The clouds pull over Old Trafford and Mitch Marsh returns for his next spell. A neat, tight over, offering England little as my son raps like an angry debt collector on the door his return from school. Let’s hope for another week, another month... 29th over: England 151-4 (Billings 22, Bairstow 86) A nifty over from Hazlewood with hits of revere swing into the cross breeze. Billings comes within inches of chopping on and then tries a wild swing. Time for Bairstow to whisper some sweet words of calm? 28th over: England 148-4 (Billings 21, Bairstow 85) England take a breath and seem to have decided to take a bite of Matthews. Billings reverse-sweep him, gloriously, then Bairstow sweeps him through the keeper’s gloves. More on the nuanced refund debate, this time from Edward Collier. “I’m a member of MCC who was not offered any refund on my subscription, despite not having been able to attend Lord’s this year. I think the main reason they didn’t even offer it is because, prior to lockdown, the club embarked on a very expensive project rebuilding the Compton and Edrich stands, which relied to a great extent on ticket sales and which, of course, had to be refunded (and, of course, no income from hospitality either). I would have been happy to have donated my subscription, but it would have been nice to have been asked. Fellow members argue that there are still benefits from membership without attending Lord’s for matches, but as I live 98 miles from St John’s Wood I can’t really take advantage.” 27th over: England 138-4 (Billings 16, Bairstow 81) A huge lbw appeal from Cummins against Bairstow finds favour neither with his captain or the umpires. Careful procurement again by the two Bs. 26th over: England 136-4 (Billings 16, Bairstow 81) Maxwell has huge smile on his face as he continues to frustrate England with his ticklers. England bleed him for singles but can’t pierce the field. From Nova Scotia, Michael Bishop writes “ I just want to thank the aussies for their guts and passion aussies are famous for... coming over in these crazy times shows what we need... six great matches that make me want to get over to coffs harbour to see my daughter... cheers to both teams!” Aye, and to West Indies and Pakistan too. Thanks for making the summer. 25th over: England 130-4 (Billings 13, Bairstow 77) Finch brings Cummins back. Billings steals a quick single which might have been out had David Warner not fumbled in the covers. Bairstow has a huge swing and miss, suggesting a building up of frustration. We’ve reached the half way stage. England have a good base for acceleration. 24th over: England 126-4 (Billings 10, Bairstow 74) Maxwell storming through these overs, so quickly that England can’t really keep up with him. Three singles patted away. 23rd over: England 123-4 (Billings 10, Bairstow 74) Starc’s long legs gobble up miles in every stride. Bairstow drives him with outstretched arms, in quite an ugly fashion, for four. They sprint two, both extremely quick between the sticks. Starc not yet bringing the breakthrough Finch is hoping for. “While I accept Richard O’Hagan’s point,” taps Rendel Harris. “Surrey are a very rich club, with a turnover of approximately £35M last year with £3.5M profit, I believe. We’ve been in the black every year for the last ten years, and we pay £1 a year to the Duchy of Cornwall for ground rent. It was somewhat ironic that the letter informing us of the decision on membership had in the envelope a flyer advertising the new luxury hotel Surrey are building opposite the ground! The club will not go under if they refund/roll over this year’s membership. Had they written to us explaining that they were going to go bankrupt by not refunding membership I would have probably have been happy to help, but they didn’t because they won’t. This is not some cash-strapped charity but a major and very rich business. Numerous other clubs, by the way, including Glamorgan, Northants, Leicestershire, Warwickshire and Somerset, all of whom don’t have the reserves Surrey or of the MCC, are offering refunds and/or membership rollovers. Odd that the two richest clubs in the country aren’t - guess that’s how the rich get and stay rich. I mentioned that to Karl Marx once and he said he thought there might be a book in it...” 22nd over: England 116-4 (Billings 9, Bairstow 68) Bairstow and Billings, the chalk and cheese of English cricket, knock Maxwell for a succession of singles. 21st over: England 112-4 (Billings 7, Bairstow 67) England milk Zampa better this over - nine from it. 20th over: England 103-4 (Billings 6, Bairstow 58) I’ve been brought a cup of tea. Absolute nectar. If I had to give one up, I’d easily choose tea over alcohol, but can’t split tea or coffee. Like choosing an on form Bairstow or an on form Roy A nice plump four to Billings off Starc, learning quickly to make the most of this tempting short boundary. 19th over: England 97-4 (Billings 1, Bairstow 57) A most peculiar lbw review by Australia finishes the over, with the replay showing the ball lolloping off the edge of the bat. Buttler out cheaply again - T20 his forte this season. “The sight of David Warner smiling just below the score makes me feel happy; it’s almost impossible to begrudge unconfined joy nowadays, wherever it resides.” I’m with you Alexander Pick. Zampa pockets another! Buttler tries to drive but a prowling Finch collects well in the covers. 18th over: England 96-3 (Buttler 8, Bairstow 57) A first over for Mitchell Marsh and it’s a mixed bag. A cutter, then a bouncer that Bairstow ducks beneath, then four leg byes flat off the grill of Bairstow’s helmet 17th over: England 90-3 (Buttler 8, Bairstow 55) It’s a pleasure to watch Zampa spinning the ball from hand to hand before his short twinkle-toed approach. England milk him for five singles. A very thoughtful email arrives from Richard O’Hagan, in reply to Rendell Harris : “I’m a director of a wildlife Trust (www.hawk-conservancy.org) and also a parent of a child who is somewhat accidentally at private school. I have some sympathy with what has been said by other people, but I think that the important thing to remember is that these organisations still have costs to cover even if the country is locked down. You pay your membership, fees or whatever for the opportunity to see cricket, receive an education or watch owls by moonlight. But you also pay for the provision of the infrastructure that provides those opportunities. “From my own perspective, we had no visitors for over three months, but we still had birds to feed, suppliers to pay, grounds to maintain and so on. When we reopened, we could not do so at full capacity, so incurred all of our usual costs with much reduced footfall. “It is a massively difficult balancing act and I’m not surprised that some people are unhappy with the outcome, but you would lose all of these resources if the fees were simply refunded in full.” 16th over: England 75-3 (Buttler 6, Bairstow 52) With a wobbly swivel off Cummins, Bairstow snatches an inside edge down to the boundary and moves to his fifty off 48 balls. They pause for drinks. David Gaskell, with a hat tip to AA Milne Oh bother!” said Roy climbing the stairs. “ Oh bother too!” said Joe scampering after him. “Oh well “ said Roy, “ could be honey for tea”. 15th over: England 79-3 (Buttler 5, Bairstow 47) Zampa continues. Butler doesn’t get his teeth stuck into a full toss and seems slightly mis-weighted today, as if he’s put his watch on the wrong wrist. No – you cannot be bowled off a wide. In fact the width of a ball is determined by where it passes the stumps – not where it pitches. If that makes sense? 14th over: England 75-3 (Buttler 1, Bairstow 42) Cummins continues his careful work and Buttler is watchful. David Harris is also mildly fed up: “Regarding Rendell Harris’, point (no relation), Kent have graciously decided to hold onto 100% of membership fees this year, with a stated intention (no guarantees) of offering a 25% discount on renewals next year. Junior members will get their renewal for free, although if we’re not allowed into the grounds by next summer that’s not really saying much. As I mentioned in a very similar comment on Naylor’s Blast summary from yesterday, I’d probably have volunteered my membership fee for this year, but it would have been nice of the club to ask.I think the clubs can get away with it because we’re buying membership of our respective clubs, which brings the benefit of being allowed to attend all (home) matches. In contrast, a football club season ticket is exactly that, a ticket to every game.” 13th over: England 71-3 (Buttler 1, Bairstow 42) I can’t work out if the Australians are growing mullets as part of a team bonding exercise. Anyway, Zampa has bought in, and bowls a cracking over. Buttler pays him almost exaggerated respect, then tries to off-drive him but is beaten and returns to reverence. Just one from this over. Good fightback by Australia in this little post-power-play period. 12th over: England 69-3 (Buttler 1, Bairstow 42) Cummins has a remarkably dirty right trouser leg - not quite sure how he’s managed it as it isn’t very muddy out there. Just two off the over, Cummins on point. “Good Afternoon Tanya.” Good afternoon Robert Hill! “In response to Rendel Harris’s enquiry, I would imagine that any number of private schools would fit the bill. No pun intended. Or, indeed, made.” 11th over: England 68-3 (Buttler 1, Bairstow 41) The answer to Finch’s question was Adam Zampa, who has proved irresistible to England’s batsmen this series, and does it again, second ball. An unusual miscalculation by Morgan. The spinner strikes in his first over! A deeply frustrated Morgan picks out the tallest man in the Australian side. He tried to send Zampa over mid-off but Starc is able to reach up and pluck it safely into his giant paws. 10th over: England 67-2 (Morgan 23, Bairstow 41) Bairstow, all angled elbows, prods at Hazlewood and the ball accelerates over the fast-tracked outfield to the boundary. It’s a batsman’s life. That’s the power play over, quite the recovery from 0-2. “By way of reply to Rendel’s melancholic rage I think another Covid villain would be most of the insurance industry (at least prior to this week’s High Court ruling)“ taps Brian Withington. “Doubt if that helps though ...” 9th over: England 59-2 (Morgan 22, Bairstow 39) Morgan turns a slightly wide Cummins off his backside and down for four but Cummins then regroups and cramps him and no runs come from the remaining balls. Steve Smith walks round the ground, disposable mask under his chin, dark glasses covering his eyes. With asterisks? 8th over: England 54-2 (Morgan 18, Bairstow 34) Fifty up in the eighth, as Bairstow and Morgan move into cruise control. 7th over: England 47-2 (Morgan 16, Bairstow 29) Pat Cummins is whistled up by Aaron Finch, the Patrick Swayze of the Australian side, but Bairstow is in belligerent mood, pecs bursting out of his shirt in bristling intent. He whips Cummins, high and with the wind for six, then through cover for four. “Hi Tanya,” thumps Rendel Harris into his typewriter. “If we’re talking melancholy, a close second (more boiling rage than melancholy TBH) to not having seen any live cricket at all is the fact that Surrey CCC, in their wisdom, has arbitrarily decided that having had no cricket at all to watch members will still lose 75% of their membership fees for 2020; to add insult to injury the letter informing us of this invited us to forgo the 25% refund to help the club out. The fact that we’re better off than MCC members, who are getting no refund at all, isn’t much consolation. Can anyone think of any other business that has taken payment in advance, been unable to provide the goods/services paid for due to Covid, then decided it has the right to refuse to refund the monies paid?” 6th over: England 37-2 (Morgan 16, Bairstow 19) England have refound their head, they’re so good at this stuff now. Morgan dances down the pitch at Hazlewood - it looked pre-meditated - and cuts him for four. Then hooks him - quick hands-to the deep-square rope. Three overs for 20. 5th over: England 25-2 (Morgan 7, Bairstow 16) A stylish whip off the toe of Bairstow’s boots sends Starc back over his head for four, which is followed next ball by a squished-up fly-swat which flies off the top edge for another boundary. Awkward but effective. Tick, tock. “Absolutely brilliant article from Rebecca that you linked to earlier,” writes Neil Dobson. “It got me thinking that perhaps the OBO contributions from readers should be subjected to some sort of age-based algorithm to ensure that the next generation of inveterate witterers get their head. As someone who recently looked down the biscuit barrel of 39 and has for several weeks now had his hand deep in that particular jar, I doubt very much to benefit from this new system, but if that’s the quality of output we can expect from the nonophytes of this world then I’ll happily disperse in to the eternal word pond.” The biscuit barrel gets a lot deeper than 39... 4th over: England 13-2 (Morgan 4, Bairstow 8) This is proving quite the test for England. Bairstow unveils his late-cut to shoot the ball down to the short boundary, but other than that he is troubled by Hazlewood, edging short of slip and gesturing with irritation at the umpire for a wide that wasn’t given. 3rd over: England 9-2 (Morgan 4, Bairstow 4) Starc:, from the back a window cleaner, white cloth tucked into the back of his trousers, from the front a 1970s popstar, all swarthy facial hair and a thick black headband. Morgan plays him tentatively, unusure, feet not quite in the right place, nearly tempted into a swish, uncomfortable against the short stuff. “Tanya,” writes John Starbuck. “I’ve got a feeling that neither side will use the full 50 overs in this game. It’ll be great if they do go the distance but there seems to be a change in the air now (end of term effect?).” I think you could be right. Very hard to stay in the zone for the last few metres of a long race. 2nd over: England 8-2 (Morgan 4, Bairstow 4) Bairstow, who could only watch as Starc caused carnage at the other end, safely negotiates Hazlewood’s first four balls, then drives him, with panache, for four. Perhaps this is the way its going to be - boundaries, or wickets. 1st over: England 4-2 (Morgan 4, Bairstow 0) The hat-trick ball passes harmlessly down the legisde and Eoin Morgan, whose capacity to clear his mind is spooky, knocks the next delivery for four through cover. Interesting start by England. Roy was particularly furious, slamming his bat into the stairs and letting rip some of his juiciest catch-phrases. Second ball! The ball swings into Root’s back pad and that’s that! He has a chat with Bairstow who takes a ridiculously long time to tell him that he’s got no chance on review. Hat-trick ball! First ball! Roy’s eyes light up at a ball outside off stump, he has a dart and the ball flies straight into the hands of Maxwell at backward point. The Aussies walk out in bright banana yellow to a very dramatic version of Jerusalem, and Mitchell Starc has the new ball.. Something to throw into the mix: because of the position of the pitch, there is an extremely short boundary on the left hand side of the ground, with the wind blowing towards that rope. Do write in with your summer thoughts/melancholy on this final day of men’s cricket this season. England: Jason Roy, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Sam Billings, Jos Buttler (wkt), Chris Woakes, Tom Curran, Adil Rashid, Jofra Archer, Mark Wood. Australia: David Warner, Aaron Finch (capt), Marcus Stoinis, Marnus Labuschagne, Mitchell Marsh, Alex Carey (wkt), Glenn Maxwell, Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Adam Zampa, Josh Hazlewood. Thanks to Nick Moreton for pointing out this smashing article by the Guardian’s young sports writer of the year, age 7-9, Rebecca Close. A sensational idea, wonderfully done. Congratulations! Australia are unchanged - so no Steve Smith for England to worry about. He’s still “a little big groggy.” Finch would have batted as well. It is breezy out there, his shirt rustling across his chest. Australia “mis-executed” on Sunday, he’s hoping for better today. Sam Curran, most unluckily, misses out for Mark Wood. “Sam’s an extremely young, versatile cricketer but we’ve gone for extra pace.” The bio bubble has its challenges and you can’t but think there will be an air of last day at school to today’s proceedings. “It’s almost one day at a time...” said Justin Langer when asked yesterday. “it’s just when you start looking ahead to when we get home and then quarantine and how the summer looks and if you keep looking too far ahead, then it gets challenging.” Jofra Archer, who has spent more days in the bio bubble than any other player, was more outspoken. “It has been mentally challenging. We’ve been here for 16 weeks. It is going to be more rare going home or being normal again. Here (OT) has become the new normal. We’ll have to adjust agains when we get some time off.” They haven’t got long to rest - Australia and England’s IPL players fly to Dubai on Thursday to join their franchises. Good early afternoon from Old Trafford, where the sun is high, the cabbage whites are having a last autumn flutter and England play their final match of this long, strange, covid summer. And what a few months they’ve had - albeit tucked inside the bio-secure bubble - series wins against West Indies in the Tests (2-1), Ireland in the one-dayers (2-1), Pakistan in a Test series (1-0), Australia in the T-20s (2-1), a drawn T-20 series against Pakistan (1-1), and yet, after all that, this final game perfectly poised - with both Australia and England having won one game each. Like all of England’s opponents this summer, Australia have had to arrive, bubble, and hit the ground running. After an easy win the the first ODI, it seemed they had made up for lost time, but the batting collapse on Sunday night will have pursued Justin Langer into the night. Australia hope to bring Steve Smith back into the team after his concussion scare, but Langer said Smith was “rusty” in the nets and a late call will be made. England face a difficult choice of whether to bring back Mark Wood and Moeen Ali to replace to the Curran brothers, who couldn’t have done much more to retain their places. The pitch at Old Trafford is a new one, so Moeen could well miss out. Other things to watch out for: Archer’s continued mastery over Warner, Sam Curran’s golden arm, Adam Zampa’s irresistibility, the Manchester DJ’s last tunes of summer. Play starts at 1pm - see you there!"

          "bodyText": "Catie Stewart was on her way home from a vacation in early August when her phone reconnected to cell service and she realized something was wrong. As the communications director for Scott Wiener, a California state senator, Stewart manages her boss’s Instagram account, a task that usually involves responding to a handful of messages each day. But while Stewart had been out of cellphone range, a bill authored by Wiener had become the target of a misinformation and harassment campaign by activists who oppose coronavirus public health measures and followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory. “FUCKING FILTH. BLOW YOUR HEAD OFF,” read one representative message that accused Wiener of “creating a law to allow pedophiles to be charged on a lesser degree”. Others fantasized about dragging Wiener’s body behind a car until he died, accused him of worshipping “Moloch”, or declared an intention to find and kill him. One meme posted on Instagram featured an image of Wiener photoshopped to enlarge his nose and add sidelocks, a yarmulke and a Jewish prayer shawl. Over the next month, Stewart and Wiener were left to confront a constant digital onslaught of death threats, homophobia, antisemitism and baseless allegations of pedophilia. “I didn’t know what QAnon was a month ago, and it’s totally changed my life,” Stewart said in an interview. The frenzied pile-on against Wiener may have begun in fringe internet communities, but it soon grew to include much of the rightwing press and major figures in both the state and national Republican party. In early September, the Texas senator Ted Cruz tweeted a photo of Wiener with the false allegation: “Today’s CA Dems believe we need more adults having sex with children, and when they do, they shouldn’t register as sex offenders.” The president’s adult son Donald Trump Jr joined in, tweeting, again falsely: “Why are Joe Biden Democrats working in California to pander to the wishes of pedophiles and child rapists?” In some ways, what happened with SB145 is a local story about the politics involved in updating California’s outdated legal codes. But it also serves as a cautionary tale for the future of political debates in the US as the QAnon conspiracy movement grows and Republican party leaders do little or nothing to stop it. QAnon followers believe, without evidence, that the world is run by a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping Democrats and Hollywood celebrities who are engaged in wide-scale child trafficking, pedophilia and cannibalism. A national politics infected by QAnon is wholly incompatible with the evidence-based debate and compromises required to govern any society. Within QAnon there is no room for nuance or rationality; there is only good v evil, and any disagreement with QAnon dogma is evidence of abject depravity in the form of child murder. And yet, in recent weeks, Donald Trump has praised QAnon followers, a QAnon-backing candidate has all but assured her election to Congress in November, and the #SaveTheChildren hashtag campaign has introduced QAnon to millions of potential new recruits. On 15 September, Trump retweeted a statement that appeared to accuse Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, of pedophilia. “The Republican party has been deeply infected by QAnon,” Wiener told the Guardian. “We’ve seen this kind of mass political infection before, all the way back to the Salem witch trials and McCarthyism. Unfortunately, there are always going to be opportunistic politicians who sense that there are people who think this and jump at the chance to get political support. It’s shameful, but it’s reality, and that’s what’s happening with QAnon. “We’re seeing it from the president. We’re seeing it from a couple of my Republican colleagues. We need to push back hard.” Creating a false narrative The battle over SB145 was always going to be politically tricky due to its sensitive subject matter: sex offender registries. But Wiener, a 50-year-old gay Democrat from San Francisco, says that representing the city renowned for its liberal politics and large LGBTQ+ community carries with it “an obligation to take on the hard progressive bills that not all members [of the legislature] can take on”. In 2017, he authored a bill that completely overhauled the sex offender registry, and in 2019, he took on another, more modest problem with the registries. Wiener’s proposed law dealt with people who are convicted of having non-forcible sex with minors above the age of 14 and who are themselves no more than 10 years older than the minor. Judges in such cases were able to exercise discretion when deciding whether or not to place a convicted offender on the registry if the sex act was penile-vaginal sex but not if it was anal or oral sex or non-penile sexual penetration. The bizarre status quo stemmed from a 2015 California supreme court ruling which reasoned that if the victim in such a case became pregnant, placing the offender on the registry would make it harder for them to provide for the child. To Wiener, this inequity was part of the legacy of the criminalization of LGBTQ+ people. “It used to be much more explicit and obvious in terms of anti-sodomy laws,” he said. “This is one example where the judge can keep straight kids off the registry, but the gay kids have to go on the registry. It’s mortifying that in 2020, in California, this discrimination continues to exist in our penal code.” SB145 was, essentially, a clean-up bill that would allow judges to exercise discretion in all such cases, regardless of the sex act involved. It did not change the criminality of sex with a minor (which remains illegal) nor did it change the criminal penalties for breaking the law. The bill was introduced in January 2019 and had the official support of LGBTQ+ groups, prosecutors, police chiefs, public defenders, civil liberties groups and advocates for survivors of sexual assault. Nevertheless, it quickly attracted some negative attention. A conservative online news outlet, the California Globe, began covering it closely, with headlines that cast it as a “bill to protect sex offenders who lure minors”. A factual article by FoxNews.com actually tamped things down substantially by explaining the controversy and the true aim of the bill, Wiener recalled. A bigger setback came when the Democratic assembly member Lorena Gonzalez, a staunch progressive, argued that the 10-year age gap in the bill was too large. She delayed a final vote on the bill, pushing it on to the 2020 legislative agenda. The delay left the bill “hanging out there for a year”, Wiener said, where, like legislative fly paper, it continued to catch bad-faith attacks. One such attack came in January 2020, when the website Law Enforcement Today (LET) published an inflammatory article headlined: “California lawmakers introduce bill to protect pedophiles who sexually abuse innocent kids”. “If you’re a pedophile and want to rape sweet, innocent, young children, then California is the state for you,” the piece began, before blatantly mischaracterizing the provisions in the bill. The LET article performed well on the outlet’s Facebook page, garnering more than 10,000 shares in January. But it really took off in late July, when it was reposted by LET’s Facebook page, just as a highly effective rebranding campaign by QAnon evangelists was catching fire on Instagram and Facebook under the twin hashtags #SaveTheChildren and #SaveOurChildren. While “classic” QAnon memes and content are aggressively pro-Trump, militaristic and often include blatantly antisemitic tropes and references, #SaveOurChildren has provided QAnon with a decidedly softer aesthetic and rhetorical appeal. Rather than enticing new recruits with the promise to unveil military intelligence secrets about the supposed evils of the Clintons and Obamas, #SaveOurChildren captures attention with exaggerated statistics about the prevalence of child sex trafficking, then draws susceptible readers down the rabbit hole of increasingly implausible falsehoods. It’s a softer, gentler “red pill” than traditional QAnon material, but the result – blatantly false beliefs about Democrats sexually abusing children in order to extract a life-extending chemical from their blood – remains the same. The #SaveOurChildren version of QAnon has been particularly popular among a new coalition of anti-public-health activists who have been galvanized by the coronavirus pandemic. As the Guardian reported in June, Facebook’s recommendation algorithm helped facilitate cross-pollination between Facebook groups dedicated to anti-vaccine activism, anti-coronavirus lockdowns and QAnon. (In Europe, it appears that a similar synergy occurred among anti-5G activists.) Membership in QAnon Facebook groups exploded throughout the summer, and QAnon infiltrated many online subcultures, including those formed around evangelical Christianity, New Age spiritualism and alternative medicine or “wellness”. SB145 landed like a lit rag amid all that dry social media tinder. On 31 July, the same day LET reposted its inflammatory article, the cause was picked up by Denise Aguilar, an anti-vaccine activist who was arrested at the California state capitol during a protest against the coronavirus lockdown measures in May. Aguilar misstated the facts of the bill in her Instagram post, to more than 70,000 followers, and referred to Democrats as “DEMONcrats”. The eight-month-old LET article quickly racked up more than 20,000 new shares, including across Facebook groups dedicated to QAnon and #SaveOurChildren. The misinformation spread fast and furiously. One Facebook post that falsely declared pedophilia to be “now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA” was viewed more than 8m times. Rightwing news outlets jumped on the story, often using photographs of a semi-shirtless Wiener at the Folsom Street Fair, an annual celebration of the gay leather scene. PJ Media tried to tar the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, Kamala Harris, by association, with a headline noting her endorsement of the “California Lawmaker behind ‘Pro-Pedophile’ Bill SB145”. Political opportunists also swarmed in. Angela Stanton King, a Georgia congressional candidate who denies supporting QAnon despite frequently sharing QAnon content on social media, posted about the bill multiple times on Instagram. In one post, she used the hashtag #SaveOurChildren; in a second, she reshared a post by a popular QAnon and Pizzagate Instagram influencer. Major Williams, a Republican planning to run for California governor in 2022, began posting aggressively about #SaveOurChildren and SB145, racking up more than 90,000 likes on a post that stated, falsely, that SB145 would mean that “there will be no felonies for sex with a minor any longer in CA”. (Instagram appended a label noting that the post contained “partly false information”.) Even some of Wiener’s colleagues in the state senate joined in. Melissa Melendez, a Republican state senator from Riverside county, tweeted that SB145 “allows adults who have ‘consensual’ sex with a 14 year old to not be charged as sex offenders”, which is false, and called it a “disgusting bill”. When Wiener responded with a factcheck, she tweeted back: “I know exactly what the bill does. Because read it [sic]. You’re trying to normalize sex with children. And I’m not going to let you get away with it.” Melendez did not respond to a request for comment from the Guardian. Shannon Grove, the minority leader for the state senate, also posted against SB145, using the #SaveOurChildren hashtag on Twitter and Instagram. A spokesman for the Senate Republican Caucus, Hector Barajas, said that Grove’s use of #SaveOurChildren was not a reference to QAnon. “Senator Grove does not believe in, support, or affiliate with QAnon,” he said in a statement. “Senator Grove believes in ‘Saving Our Children’ from human traffickers, child predators and her use of this hashtag is not an endorsement or affiliation with the actions of QAnon.” ‘An illness that afflicts people’s minds’ In the end, SB145 passed both the state assembly and state senate and was signed into law by the governor, Gavin Newsom, on the evening of 11 September. “In 2017, when we passed the major restructuring of the sex offender registry, something like a third of Republican senators voted for it,” Wiener recalled. “This time we got zero … The difference between now and 2017 is the existence of QAnon. This sort of semi-organized structure on social media that just pumps out massive, orchestrated misinformation. It just flies across the internet, and if people see it on their timeline, they think it’s true.” Wiener and Stewart, his communications manager, said they did their best to engage with people who were contacting him on social media, as long as their messages didn’t include overt threats, and found that many were open to hearing the facts. “You have a lot of people who are getting caught up in the QAnon craziness, who are not inherently QAnon people,” Wiener said. “They see things on their timeline and they’re convinced it’s true and they get very angry, but they’re QAnon-adjacent.” For those true believers, however, Wiener sees QAnon as “an illness that afflicts people’s minds”. “It’s one of the scariest and most bizarre things I’ve seen,” he said. Speaking to the Guardian a few days before Newsom signed SB145, Wiener appeared relatively assured that the death threats and harassment would die down eventually. “I feel for the people who don’t have the resources and privileges that I have as a public official,” he said. “Lives are being destroyed by QAnon and we’re not doing enough to push back against it.” As for the continued dissemination of memes that attempt to portray him as a predator, he said: “I’m not going to change a thing about who I am or what I represent. I have thick skin.” For the moment, it appears that Republican party leaders who have embraced QAnon have no intention of changing their behavior either. Throughout the day on Monday 14 September, Donald Trump Jr continued to tweet false information about the SB145. “They’re normalizing pedophilia,” he tweeted, falsely, alongside a link to an article about Newsom’s signing of the bill. “It’s insanity and we must stop it.”"

          "headline": "England's exam system is broken –  let's never put it together again",
          "bodyText": "Congratulations, you’re in charge of education in England. Your first task is to decide how many children should get an A* in their exams next year. “As many as deserve them” is the obvious answer. But where do you draw the line? And, when that line is drawn, what if you suddenly find that almost every child receiving a top grade is from a private school? This question is not trivial. The exams debacle last month, in which the government attempted to give students a set of grades via a statistical calculation, highlighted the instinctive unfairness of rationing grades. But, in truth, top grades are rationed every year. The Labour government decided in 2009 it needed to do something about grade inflation. This was because it was politically tricky to keep up the increases, but also because universities were complaining they could no longer easily pick between candidates. Since then, the exams regulator, Ofqual, has worked with exam boards to ensure that around 8% of young people get the very top grades in their A-levels and GCSEs, while the mid-point pass rate (of a C or grade 5) is around 75% and 65% respectively. The system has always been controversial, with Labour MPs regularly disavowing it as a cap on aspiration. What if more students suddenly became brighter? It would be unfair to deny them their rightful grade. The argument was that, largely, they didn’t. Just in case, however, a random selection of young people sat a national reference test each year as a quick check. If results were in line with previous years, then so were the grades. This system is now smashed to smithereens. When the education secretary opted in August to let pupils in England keep grades submitted by their teachers, he doubled the number of pupils holding top grades and increased the numbers getting a C by about 10% on previous years. Many more students were suddenly eligible for top university places. Sixth forms have seen a swell of applicants for A-levels. And the year groups due to sit exams in 2021 are left asking: what will you do for us? As I see it, the government has three choices: to ration grades at the old rate, ration at the new rate, or do something different altogether. If ministers are smart, they will take the third approach. Back in March, when schools were given 48 hours to close, few had the technological infrastructure to flip straight into distance learning. In a survey of more than 8,000 teachers, just 14% of state school teachers said that while in lockdown they could continue with the same content and pace of learning. In private schools, that figure was 60%, and a further 30% only minimally changed their content. Most of their pupils barely missed a beat. Let us be clear, this advantage isn’t because private schools have special organisational skills or because their teachers aren’t in unions (they are, actually). It’s because of money. Private schools can more easily assume their pupils have laptops and high-speed broadband and had the means to invest in digital packages. Meanwhile, in the state sector, the MP Jess Phillips told the Commons she was running around giving out Sim cards so parents could download worksheets on to a phone to allow their children a crack at some homework. Many of the laptops the government promised the most vulnerable pupils still hadn’t materialised by July. Private school students are now likely to be much further ahead than state pupils, even more so than usual. Labour has asked for exams to start later to make up for lost time, but that is like asking for extra time in a football match when you’re already six goals down. Clawback chances are slim, and the scoreline could get worse. We also don’t yet know the effect of local lockdowns, but they are unlikely to be equitable. So the question resurfaces: what would you do if you were in charge? Exam grades this year were seen as unfair because a computer created them. Next year they will be seen as unfair because they will have been affected by random conditions, created by the pandemic. But even if everything clears up for 2022, we have to be honest: an algorithm and the randomness of where you were born affects every young person’s grades every year. The problem is not the pandemic. It is that we have constructed a system where a set of tests, taken over a couple of weeks, are the gateway to many of life’s choices. That system is now broken. Why try to put it back together?"

          "headline": "Oracle confirms it will partner with TikTok after Microsoft's bid rejected",
          "bodyText": "Oracle, the tech company, confirmed on Monday that it will partner with video-sharing app TikTok as the company works to head off a ban by the Trump administration. The hugely popular app has been caught in a geopolitical standoff, with the Trump administration accusing it of spying on Americans and Chinese officials attacking US protectionism. Oracle confirmed in a statement that it is part of the proposal submitted by ByteDance, TikTok’s Chinese parent company, to the treasury department in which it will serve as the “trusted technology provider”. The US treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, confirmed that the Trump administration would this week review the deal. “From our standpoint, we’ll need to make sure that the code is, one, secure, Americans’ data is secure, that the phones are secure and we’ll be looking to have discussions with Oracle over the next few days with our technical teams,” Mnuchin told CNBC. ByteDance has been in talks to sell its US business since Trump threatened last month to ban the service if it was not sold. The president’s executive order in August gave American companies until 15 September to stop doing business with the video platform’s Chinese parent company, or it would be shut down in the US. It effectively set a deadline for a potential pressured sale of part of the tech company to an American bidder. But the nature of an Oracle-TikTok deal remains unclear. And any deal will also now need approval from the Chinese authorities after Beijing changed its export rules a few weeks ago. The Washington Post reported that Oracle had been chosen by ByteDance as a “technology partner” to allay US concerns, and Reuters quoted a source saying it would be a restructuring rather than a sale, with Oracle handling TikTok’s US user data. The source did not disclose how much of TikTok’s US operations ByteDance and its investors would continue to own. Oracle’s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a Trump supporter and has held fundraising events for his re-election. However, Chinese state media, citing sources, reported on Monday that ByteDance would not be selling TikTok’s US operations to Oracle. ByteDance will need approval for the deal from both Washington and Beijing, which recently implemented new export controls on the kind of artificial intelligence technology behind TikTok’s algorithm for deciding which videos to serve to users. It is not clear whether Trump, who wants a US technology company to own most of TikTok in the US, will approve the proposal. Beijing reportedly opposes a forced sale of TikTok’s US operations and would prefer the company shut down, according to a previous Reuters report, citing three people familiar with the matter. ByteDance and Oracle did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment. Oracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech firms such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as business software specialists such as Salesforce. Microsoft said on its blog on Sunday that ByteDance would not sell TikTok’s US operations, despite the company being “confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok’s users, while protecting national security interests”. “To do this, we would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation, and we made these principles clear in our August statement.” Retailer Walmart, which had been participating in negotiations with Microsoft, still had an interest in a TikTok investment, and was still in discussions with ByteDance leadership and other parties, Reuters reported. “We know that any approved deal must satisfy all regulatory and national security concerns,” Walmart said. It is unclear whether TikTok’s algorithm, considered its key asset, would be included in any sale. The state-run China News Agency said on Monday that ByteDance had decided its algorithm would not be sold or transferred. On Monday, the South China Morning Post said ByteDance would not sell or transfer the algorithm behind TikTok in any sale or divestment deal, quoting a source briefed on the Chinese company’s boardroom discussions and citing new Chinese government export controls. In late August, Beijing issued new restrictions or bans on tech exports, requiring companies to seek government approval – a process that can take up to 30 days. The rules, which had not been updated since 2008, were believed to be aimed at delaying the sale of TikTok to US buyers. Some technologies were removed from the list of regulated exports, including vaccine technologies, but the 23 new additions included tech relating to AI interfaces, voice recognition, and content recommendation analysis. TikTok’s feeds of short video clips feature everything from hair-colouring tutorials to dance routines and jokes about daily life. It has been downloaded 175m times in the US and more than a billion times around the world. Trump has claimed TikTok could be used by China to track the locations of federal employees, build dossiers on people for blackmail, and conduct corporate espionage. The company has said it has never provided any US user data to the Chinese government, and Beijing has attacked Trump’s crackdown as political. “It is not just TikTok. Hi-tech Chinese companies in the US have been attacked partly on the grounds of so-called national security. Starting with the attack on Huawei, the scope has become more and more extensive,” said Shi Yinhong, an expert in US-China relations at Renmin University, in Beijing.

          "bodyText": "There’s a woman I know running a wellness coaching business in Sydney’s eastern suburbs who tells me Trump is a “light worker”. There are people who “follow” me – mums making their own bone broth, yoga teachers posting Rumi memes – who believe the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is storing kids in tunnels under Melbourne’s CBD. When he’s not giving daily Covid-19 press conferences in his reassuring polar fleece, they tell me, he is involved in a global child sex trafficking cabal. Some retweet Pete Evans’ links to David Icke, a Holocaust denier who thinks the world is run by shape-shifting lizards from outer space. As Victoria’s lockdown takes its toll, these people I loosely know have flooded my social feeds with impassioned pleas for me to “wake up” and fight #msm (mainstream media), quoting what we now know to be QAnon conspiracy jargon, hashtagged and often in screaming caps. When I ask to see their research (I’m genuinely curious and the sheer onslaught has made me question my adherence to the scientific method) that coronavirus is a hoax dreamed up by a satanic cell of elites, I am directed to alt-right YouTube links and the viral documentary Plandemic. When I flag (in what I hope is a calm digital tone) the film has been removed from most digital platforms and Science magazine has systematically disproved most of its claims, I’m told it’s me who’s been sucked into the (#msm) conspiracy. #DOYOUROWNRESEARCH, they scream-text at me. I asked one commenter the other day, “How do you know vaccines are a ‘Deep State’ plot to wipe out white people?” “How do YOU know it’s not?” was the reply. It felt like biting my own teeth. I’m active on social media, I’m an Australian woman in the public eye and I regularly share political posts. Which is to say, I am a repository for the full psychological kaleidoscope of public opinion, fear and blame circling the zeitgeist. I’ve also spent the past three years researching the colliding Black Swans and Hyperobjects that have culminated in the clusterfuck that is 2020, for my latest book This One Wild and Precious Life. I thought I’d mined most of the dark corners, was alive to all the “unprecedents”. But little prepared me for this most recent pop-political mash-up, coined conspiritualism. It’s certainly a Venn overlap that is hard to fathom. How did wellness warriors come to unite with the alt-right QAnon community? How did the “love and light” go so dark? Well, first it’s worth acknowledging that this is not the first time the new age community has joined forces with the far right. The Nazis used astrologers; Hess, the deputy führer, opened a centre for alternative medical practices. It’s also not uncommon for child sex trafficking theories to become the convergence point for conspiracy groups from both ends of the spectrum – hurting children is an easy way to demonise an enemy. Even tunnel theories have been around for decades. Things today are crazy uncertain. The climate and biodiversity devastation, a global pandemic, worldwide recession – we know the gnarly gist. In such magnitude-10 wobbly times, we have often mobilised against an enemy. It’s kept us united with our tribe and feeling safe. But this is not a war. No one identifiable force caused the viral leaps that led to the coronavirus pandemic, no one generation caused global warming. When we don’t have an identifiable enemy – or worse, the enemy is “us” – it is tempting to create one. As the cruel chasm between the haves and have-nots widens, it’s understandable the “elites” of politics, science, Hollywood and business become a target for terrified people. There’s also this. My sense, as something of a veteran (albeit retired) of the wellness realm, is there’s a genuine desire for truth behind the phenomenon. The wellness and alternative spiritual crew have united over the past decade to expose the vested interests of the food, pharmaceutical and oil industries – for valid and worthy reasons. Drug companies have abused our health. The Gates Foundation should be more transparent and accountable, considering the massive influence it has over global public health. And the fight to expose truth has united this community. Meanwhile, political trust is at an all-time low globally. Media and other moral structures that once held the status quo accountable have desiccated. It’s understandable that we be suspicious and questioning. I am on a number of issues. But as the world gets more complex and noisy, truth can easily become confused with “truthiness”. Under the sheer volume of competing facts and studies, news stories and social media posts that bludgeon us daily, we succumb to truth-lite. The overwhelm sees us seek expedient options. As I argue in my book, we are wholly ill-equipped to deal with fake news. We have lost the ability to read closely and deeply. Our attention spans are shot – rendering us entirely incapable of being resilient to bullshit. Studies show most of us simply can’t work our way through complex issues like life-affecting contracts and information relating to our political responsibilities (um, Brexit!). Ditto the science that explains how viruses and vaccines work, or how to check if science is gold standard. Or whether a YouTube documentary is reputable. We have access to more information, but no one taught us how to sift through it. Indeed, a recent study found that people are a lot more likely to share false coronavirus information than they are to think about whether it’s true. Thinking about whether something is true or not is hard work, and so as Maryanne Wolf puts it, this cognitive flaccidity “incentivises a retreat to the most familiar silos of unchecked information, which require and receive no analysis, leaving us susceptible to false information and demagoguery”. I’d also add that sharing exclusive information after you’ve done “your own research” (flaccid or otherwise) can provide us with a sense of agency in a world that has left us feeling increasingly overwhelmed and powerless. We “know” there’s an international cabal of sex traffickers telling us to wear face masks because – everyone on Facebook says it’s true. It’s a bit like why we all bought toilet paper when the pandemic first hit: because everyone bought toilet paper. Studies show we repeatedly trust social proof far more than evidence-based proof. It’s human, understandable. Truth-lite then conflates with what I call spiritualism-lite. Contemporary spiritualism has tended to cherry-pick the “love and light” feel-good bits of the various traditions, the bits that promote personal freedom and individuality, leaving out the responsibility, service and the sacrifice to the greater good. We connect to our yoga mats and go inward to connect to ourselves, we attend to self-care of our gut microbiota, but eschew politics and heavy stuff. When these diet versions of the real thing converge, being told to isolate or wear a mask is seen as an affront to flowy freedom – so must amount to a conspiracy, rather than a noble act of civic engagement. There’s a meme a wellness blogger with a gut powder range quoted back at me in my Instagram comments thread, after I posted what could certainly be read as a condescending remark. It’s a Rumi line I feature in my book, for there truly is a Rumi line for every moment of human despair: “Out beyond ideas of wrongdoing and rightdoing, there is a field. I’ll meet you there.” We are capable of meeting in this field. Human history is full of such moments where we have unified not around an enemy but around a bigger, higher cause. Often it’s truth. We are all reeling from the disconnection and competitive fragmentation that the neoliberal model has driven us to, and we all know that nothing but a monumental shift will steer the ship right. We will indeed need to do our own research and demand more truth. But we will also need to defer to and respect science to do so. We need to understand that research done via YouTube is not “your own research”. It’s an algorithm at play that handcuffs us to our worst cognitive biases. We need to be sceptical – but for the sake of understanding, not to create more tribalism. I would argue that we also need, at a broader level, to instigate fake news resilience training, like Finland has. It works. I find my ultimate comfort and hope in this: conspiracy theories don’t satiate for long. We move on from them, as we do with all diet or “lite” versions of things. We ultimately seek the full-fat version of life. Climate activist, Trump supporter, bone broth maker – we are all feeling unsatiated, disconnected, baffled. We’re all trying to find truth and certainty. Ironically, it’s our disconnection that unifies us. And it’s our yearning for full-fat life that, I hope, will see us meet in the field.

The news in clues Hello again, and a reminder that we have signposts for those who prefer their crosswords to be timeless – or at least an escape from the story we’re calling “This”. Not that the smaller stories are something to which you’d choose to escape. Here’s Brendan: 22ac Part of educational foundation improperly agreed to alter mark (7) [ wordplay: one of the three Rs (‘part of educational foundation’) + anagram of (‘improperly’) AGREED ] [ R + EGRADE ] [ definition: to alter mark ] If you missed it, Knut has a puzzle themed on the subject of the REGRADE, from which I’d choose this clue … 7d Might oral be getting reviewed because of this?

Perhaps I’m not nice, but I’m doing a great job for you. (Applause.) True. Well, it’s true. Latter patter Here’s a clue from Crosophile in the Independent: 5ac Non-white group embracing, totally, golf and tennis perhaps (4,4) [ wordplay: abbrev. for ‘black, Asian and minority ethnic’ (‘non-white group’) surrounding (‘embracing’) synonym for ‘totally’ &amp; ‘golf’ in Nato alphabet ] [ BAME surrounding ALL &amp; G ] [ definition: tennis perhaps ] While en route to the answer, BALL GAME, did you say “BAME” in your head as four letters, or to rhyme with “dame”, as we do with the Nato that gave us the alphabet that gave us the golf that gives us the G? (BTW, BAME, as far as I know, was first used for crossword purposes by Vulcan, last year.) When BAME was first said in the Commons, it was spelled out: you can hear Lynne Featherstone doing so here in 2010. Last week, Theresa Villiers said it to rhyme with “same”. So, which way will it end up: initialism or acronym? We don’t seem as game for acronymming as the speakers of some languages, as in the case of the imported words you can hear around Europe such as “suvs”, “leds” and “vips”. (Does anyone know whether it’s true that the Faroese “vesi” for “toilet” comes from our “WC”?) Now, it’s early days: some style guides (such as this one) require it to be spelled out in full at first mention. But even so, I can’t at the moment see BAME becoming “bame” all the time … but that may just be because I can take no pleasure in making the sound of that acronym version. Certain words are so pleasing to utter that they could have been designed to become acronyms. So it is with the subject of our next challenge, described by Fowler’s A Dictionary of Modern English Usage as: A slogan that became an acronym that became a word that begat another word Reader, how would you clue “nimby”? Cluing competition Many thanks for your clues for PRUSSIAN BLUE. For the audacity award, Lizard acknowledges his own omission of “Peter” in the charming “Paul Rubens is mixing a colourful pigment”, but those laurels must surely go to Wellywearer2’s anti-clue “Blau”. (I think for the sake of GappyTooth, I’ll simply link to that clue’s surface imagery and pass on.) The runners-up are Dunnart’s “Basic medicine for Serbian sick with lupus” and Montano’s “Dark tone of Buñuel’s Paris recreated”; I think our winner among various approaches has to be BethLacan’s “Doctor in lab pursues treatment for radioactive poisoning”. I enormously enjoyed returning after a break and endeavouring to successfully untangle the various variants of similar approaches. I have also enjoyed a pause, with a few evenings in the Brecon Beacons by a charcoal and wood fire, listening to the haunting sounds of distanced orchestral musicians trying to applaud each other while still holding their instruments at the Proms. For our next instalment of Healing Music Recorded in 2020 to Accompany a Solve or Even Listen to, I cannot enough urge Anoushka Shankar’s Prom and would add this more embeddable and more poignant solo rendition: I cheerfully acknowledge that four minutes and 48 seconds might be a speedy solve. Kludos to BethLacan and please leave entries for this fortnight’s competition – and your picks from the broadsheet cryptics – below. And I note with perhaps sadness that our musical interests are no longer being stalked by YouTube.

          "bodyText": "Labor says a new code to force Google and Facebook to pay for the value they receive from the distribution of Australian journalism must be “workable” and the regime should also be extended to include the ABC and SBS. The shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, told Guardian Australia the code was yet to go through Labor’s internal deliberative processes, but she said the regime should cover the public broadcasters because the revenue would be used to boost regional news services, and the “merits of that argument are pretty clear”. Rowland said given the complexity of the arrangements being proposed, the Morrison government would be best placed bringing a settled package to the parliament that is capable of securing majority support. “This is a very complex proposal,” Rowland said on Monday. “This shouldn’t be something that gets amended on the floor of the parliament.” The ABC and SBS are currently outside the proposed code. The Greens have signalled they could support the proposal if the government extended it to cover the national broadcaster and augmented it with a rescue package for the news wire service AAP. The proposed code aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants, and force the Google and Facebook to pay for the value they receive from use of Australian journalism. It would also require Google and Facebook to provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. If they failed to comply, they could be forced to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was asked to develop the mandatory code in April by the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, after negotiations between the digital platforms, the ACCC and media companies stalled, and media companies experienced a sharp fall in ad revenue due to Covid-19. Google and Facebook say the code is unworkable. The companies have engaged in a major lobbying effort to persuade parliamentarians not to support the proposal. Rowland said Labor was listening to the tech companies, and was “meeting with anyone who asks”. She said some of the concerns raised by the tech companies were “not entirely baseless” and there needed to be a good response to queries about value transfer in the media ecosystem. She said she had been briefed in detail by the ACCC chairman, Rod Sims, but there had been “zero outreach” from the government about the package. “We understand how important this is,” Rowland said. “We understand it needs to happen. We need progress on it.” She warned there was a risk of “new deserts” developing in the Australian media landscape because of the commercial pressures. If Labor and the Greens insist that the code must cover the ABC and SBS, and the government disagrees, it will have to run the gauntlet of the Senate crossbench. The Centre Alliance senator Stirling Griff told Guardian Australia on Monday the ABC and SBS needed to be compensated by the tech companies if their content was being used. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has signalled it is unlikely the code will cover the broadcasters because the ABC and SBS “have secure government funding, and accordingly the ABC and SBS are not the policy focus when it comes to remuneration aspects of the proposed mandatory code”. But Griff said it didn’t matter whether the organisations were publicly funded or not. The point was ensuring news organisations were compensated for the value they added. Rex Patrick, the independent senator for South Australia, said he was yet to assess the proposal in detail, so he did not have a position on whether the taxpayer-funded broadcasters should be included. But he said the code seemed like a sound idea. “I have a very strong interest in making sure we have a strong media, so something needs to change. I’m not yet across the finer details, but my predisposition is to get proper payments for media organisations that do the hard work.”"

Its communications spokeswoman, senator Sarah Hanson-Young, told Guardian Australia the Greens were reserving their position until they saw the Morrison government’s legislation but said: “If the government wants to save journalism in Australia, then they need to deliver more than a sugar hit to Murdoch. “The code as it is is incomplete, and it needs to be fixed if it is to pass the parliament and save public interest journalism. “The ABC is Australia’s most trusted news source and there is no excuse for locking them out of any arrangements that force the tech giants to pay their fair share. “The ABC has been a punching bag of this government for too long. Fixing this code, including the public broadcasters and saving AAP, is what Australia’s news landscape requires.” The signal comes as Facebook and Google have engaged in a major lobbying effort to persuade parliamentarians not to support the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) draft code for digital platforms. The code aims to address the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants and force the platforms to pay for the value they receive from use of Australian journalism. It would also require Google and Facebook to provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm.

Google and Facebook say the code is unworkable. The ABC and SBS are outside the proposed code. The communications minister, Paul Fletcher, has signalled that is unlikely because the publicly funded broadcasters do not rely on advertising revenue. Fletcher has said the ABC and SBS “have secure government funding, and accordingly the ABC and SBS are not the policy focus when it comes to remuneration aspects of the proposed mandatory code”. In signalling preparedness to negotiate on the code, Hanson-Young pointed to the importance of AAP in supporting independent journalism in Australia. AAP provides news copy and photographs to news outlets, which is an important service given major media players have all downsized because of ongoing threats to the viability of the industry. In early August a slimmed-down AAP began its new life after the 85-year-old news wire was saved at the 11th hour by a team of 35 investors and philanthropists after major shareholders News Corp Australia and Nine Entertainment pulled out. But it remains under financial pressure and it is appealing to the public for help. AAP’s chief executive, Emma Cowdroy, has told Guardian Australia some clients have signed for “much shorter periods” as they may be “testing the service and they also know there is a new entrant coming into the market”. “It’s probably fair to say that things have been a lot tougher than we thought,” Cowdroy said."

Surely this is the point? The party that governs this country is not the Conservative party, but the Cuckoo party, which, like its avian cousins, has no scruples about ejecting the legitimate occupants of the “nest” to further its interests. The cuckoos are an evolved species of the Farageist breed, led by an unelected algorithm, controlling a puppet, to manipulate the public and party. Boris Johnson is the ideal frontman. Together, using the Conservative label, they have succeeded in occupying the space of authentic Conservatives to deliver a version of the party that bears no resemblance to the original model. No wonder regions are now considering secession from the union. Unless parliamentarians of all parties unite to drive these interlopers out, England will be reduced to an isolated, corrupt, poverty-stricken outpost of an empowered EU.

          "bodyText": "Two books about hate and gender have been published in recent weeks; one is pretty much irrelevant, but has been propelled into the global spotlight thanks to an overly zealous French official and a tiny but astute publisher. The other is a profoundly important piece of work that is unlikely to get the universal attention it deserves. These topsy-turvy reactions reveal much about skewed societal reactions to feminism. First, the irrelevant: a tract entitled I Hate Men by a 25-year-old French feminist, set for an initial print run of 450. None of us would have heard of it but for the civil servant who wrote to her publishers telling them to pull it because “incitement to hatred on the grounds of gender is a criminal offence”. Except it turns out the civil servant was freewheeling rather than speaking for the French government. I’ve never encountered any feminists who hate all men, but the global media’s fascination with this niche provocation shows that there is something irresistible about associating feminism with misandry. That is the wry observation of Laura Bates, the author of Men Who Hate Women, a book everyone should read. “It makes me smile when people ask me whether you have to be a woman who hates men to write a book about men who hate women… in reality the opposite is true,” she writes. Her book is a chilling investigation into the world of online extreme misogyny and its real-world consequences: the incels (“involuntary celibates”) who believe women are denying them their right to have sex and consequently deserve to be raped and murdered; the pick-up artists who believe women can be manipulated and controlled into sleeping with them; the “men who go their own way”, who believe women are so toxic they must cut them out of their lives altogether. It is too easy to dismiss these as sinister but irrelevant internet cesspits, filled with dysfunctional loners who fantasise about committing sick acts of violence against women that they will never get the chance to act upon. That is a mistake: one of the most disturbing aspects of Bates’s book is how she came to her subject matter. She realised a couple of years ago through her regular work with schools that some boys were increasingly parroting the kinds of arguments about women common in these online communities. Bates also documents the murderous rampages inflicted by incels: men such as Elliot Rodger, who killed six people and injured 14 others in California in 2014, or Ben Moynihan who stabbed three women in Portsmouth the same year. Yet despite fitting the definition for terrorism – the use or threat of action designed to intimidate the public to advance a political, religious, racial or ideological cause – there is only one case of an incel attack being treated by authorities as terrorism, when a 17-year-old murdered a woman using a machete in Toronto earlier this year. It seems a dangerous hatred of women simply doesn’t meet the ideological bar, a bizarre and troubling minimisation of extreme misogyny. Links between terrorism, misogyny and domestic violence have been well-documented; last year, Joan Smith described how most terrorists involved in far-right and Islamist attacks have a track record of abusing women. There is, however, little evidence that this insight has filtered through to the government’s counter-terrorism efforts. Yet Smith observes that one thing that unites far-right and Islamist extremists is their embrace of rape and domestic violence and its use as a recruiting tool. But there is another link between extreme misogyny and other forms of terrorism that Bates exposes: the ways in which boys and young men are radicalised into these extremist ideologies. The grooming techniques are identical: pushing initially relatively mild misogynist memes and humour on to vulnerable teenagers with low self-esteem on platforms such as YouTube, Instagram and bodybuilding websites, which then leads to darker and more violent stuff. The platforms are complicit: Bates describes how YouTube’s content-pushing algorithm takes someone searching “what is feminism?” to an interview with Milo Yiannopoulos decrying feminism as “primarily about man-hating” and spreading a “constant message that men are evil” via just one other video. These are important insights into how technology is changing the way the men who objectify and hate women are created, making it ever easier for vulnerable young men to be caught up in the damaging orbit of extreme misogyny. Only a tiny number of these will engage in the terrorism of a Rodger, but the same is true of far-right and Islamist terrorism, and that, rightly, does not prevent us from pouring billions into countering them. And that is before we consider the wider costs: how many of these boys will grow up more likely to be domestic abusers? (To put this in context, 49 people tragically lost their life to terrorist attacks in the UK between 2010 and 2017 –around one every 10 weeks – but two women a week are murdered by a current or former partner.) Or the worrying trend of women in their 20s being pressured to take part in dangerous sex acts such as choking. We need to start taking extreme misogyny seriously rather than writing it off as a community of oddballs: not to do so is to utterly fail in our duty to keep this generation of boys and girls safe. It is imperative that misogyny gets classed as a hate crime in the same way as crimes motivated by hostility towards people because of their race, disability or sexual orientation are. This is not about criminalising wolf-whistling, but understanding the extent to which crimes are motivated by hatred of women. Treating it as terrorism could at a sweep multiply the resources available to tackle violent misogyny many times over. And we need to develop our understanding of how to help those boys at risk of getting groomed down this path and prevent it from happening in the first place. As Bates says, failing to act is the mark of a society that devalues not just women, but men. • Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and an Observer and Guardian columnist"

          "bodyText": "That’s it from me for today. For all the latest on coronavirus, you can head over to our global live blog: Thanks for following along. Here’s a summary of the top UK coronavirus developments from this afternoon. A total of 3,539 new Covid-19 infections have been recorded in the government’s daily figures. A further six people have also died in the past 24 hours within 28 days of testing positive for the virus. The health secretary’s suggestion that people taking unnecessary tests were responsible for a shortage has been described as “profoundly dangerous”. Independent Sage group member Prof Stephen Reicher said Matt Hancock’s comments could result in people delaying getting a test. Tougher coronavirus restrictions have been announced for Birmingham and parts of the West Midlands. From Tuesday, households will be banned from mixing in the city, as well as Sandwell and Solihull, the West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, announced. The R-value across the UK has risen to between 1.0 and 1.2. Data released on Friday by the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) shows the estimate for R across the UK is between 1.0 and 1.2. The Welsh first minister has warned of a “gathering storm” as cases in the country hit 20 per 100,000. Mark Drakeford said: “There is a serious risk of the virus spreading more widely once again.” The Covid-19 app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September. Before its introduction businesses, including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas, are being urged to ensure they have NHS QR code posters visible on entry so customers with the app can check in. A further six people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for the virus, bringing the official death tally to 41,614. As of Friday afternoon, 863 Covid-19 patients were in UK hospitals, while 78 patients required ventilator beds. A total of 3,539 new infections have been recorded in the government’s daily coronavirus figures. The UK’s total caseload now stands at 361,677. Hundreds of students who met the A-level requirements of their first-choice university after the government’s grading U-turn have still not secured a place at an institution, figures show. Ucas said fewer than 1,500 students across the UK who were initially rejected by their preferred university on results day had still not secured degree places despite their grades rising. The admissions service said some courses carried other conditions, such as professional tests, which these students might not have met, while some school leavers could still be looking through clearing. Some of these students may also have opted to sit an exam in the autumn with an aim of starting a degree in January, while others may have decided against going to university altogether. Ucas estimated that up to 15,000 A-level students across the UK who did not have their firm choice confirmed on results day may have subsequently achieved the academic requirements of their offer after Ofqual decided to abandon its algorithm and allow grades to be based on schools’ estimates. Of these, the majority (87%) have been placed at one of their top choices or, after entering clearing, at an institution with similar entry requirements. But 9% had yet to secure a degree place for this autumn or 2021, Ucas said. The health secretary, Matt Hancock’s suggestion there has been a surge in people seeking inappropriate coronavirus tests has been branded “profoundly dangerous” by a member of the Independent Sage group. Hancock said earlier this week that there had been an increase in people seeking tests when they had no symptoms of Covid-19. One school sent a whole year group for tests, which was “not appropriate”, he said. He also said some people who were going on holiday had sought a test, which is “not what the testing system is here for”. But his comments were criticised on Friday by Prof Stephen Reicher, a member of the Sage group, who said: “The government seem more intent on managing blame than managing the pandemic. “To tell people off for getting tests is profoundly dangerous, because the real problem is this, that when people are unsure ... if you tell them, ‘Oh you mustn’t get a test if you’re not unwell,’ they will delay. “It will be longer before people get tests, they will be infectious for longer without doing anything about it, and the infection will spread more. “So what Matt Hancock said is not only wrong, it’s profoundly dangerous and it will increase the pandemic.” The current testing programme has faced considerable criticism for struggling to meet demand, with many people trying to access a test receiving an error message telling them to try again. On Tuesday, NHS Test and Trace’s director of testing apologised to people who were unable to get a test. The leader of Manchester city council has warned of a full lockdown if coronavirus cases do not begin to fall in the city. Sir Richard Leese said: “Over the past few months guidance has been confusing and I appreciate the frustration that many people must have felt. “But there can be no confusion about what the end result will be if the number of Covid-19 cases do not start to go down: a full lockdown in Manchester. “I am determined that we will avoid this, but this can only be achieved through the actions of every resident, business and community. This is our Manchester, and as a city we will always pull together in times of crisis.” A ban on two households mixing is currently in place in Manchester, where the weekly rate of infection has risen to 71.6 per 100,000 people. Birmingham city council leader, Ian Ward, said the spread had primarily occurred in private households and in places where social distancing was not being observed, with younger people disproportionately affected by infections. “We know this is difficult. The virus has not gone away, it has not weakened, it is relentless and we must be relentless in dealing with it,” he said. The leader went on to express some frustration at the government about lack of clarity surrounding its Covid marshall scheme announced earlier this week. “We need extra clarity on how it will work on the ground,” he said. Ward added that he was pressing for “a route map” for what would happen next, particularly if infection rates came down. “This will ensure residents have incentives to follow the rules for now,” he said. Speaking to members of the press during a West Midlands weekly coronavirus update on Friday, Street said the restrictions did not apply to schools, workplaces or transport. “This decision has been made in collaboration with local leaders who are considering additional local measures to tackle the increase in the number of cases,” he added. A full government announcement on measures, which could potentially affect other parts of the country, was expected later, Street said. The West Midlands mayor, Andy Street, has announced a ban on households mixing in Birmingham, as well as the neighbouring Solihull and Sandwell boroughs, after a rise in Covid-19 infections. Street said he had been permitted to read out a statement headed “Ban on household mixing in Birmingham, Sandwell and Solihull”, with the agreement of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, who had been due to make the announcement. The mayor said: The following areas will now be escalated to an area of national intervention, with a ban on people socialising with people outside their own household. The ban will take effect from Tuesday 15th September, but residents are advised to avoid household mixing before then as it has been identified as one of the drivers of transmission. You can read the full story from my colleague, Nazia Parveen, here: Support for Scottish independence has sustained a majority despite a rise in coronavirus cases, according to a new survey. The poll by Survation shows 53% in favour of breaking with the union, with 47% against. It is the latest in a series of surveys since the beginning of the pandemic showing a majority of Scots are in favour of independence – including one by Panelbase which held support at 55% last month. The SNP deputy leader, Keith Brown, said: This is yet another significant poll for the SNP and the independence movement – showing people want decisions about Scotland to be made by the people who live here, and not Boris Johnson. Faced with the increasing threat of a hard or no-deal Brexit, and an unprecedented power grab on the hard-won powers of the Scottish parliament, it’s no wonder people in Scotland are demanding the right to choose a better future. The reproduction number, or R-value, of coronavirus transmission across the UK has risen above 1. Data released on Friday by the Government Office for Science and the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) shows the estimate for R across the UK is between 1.0 and 1.2. It comes as the number of newly diagnosed cases continues to rise, with higher incidence seen in young people aged 18 to 24 years. According to Government advisers, the last time R was above 1 was in early March. R represents the average number of people each Covid-19 positive person goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. In England, R is between 1 and 1.2. The figure is slightly higher in London and the north-west - between 1.1 and 1.3 in both regions. The estimates for R and growth rate are provided by the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a subgroup of Sage. The growth rate of coronavirus transmission, which reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, has also increased slightly. For the whole of the UK, the latest growth rate is between -1% and +3% per day. This means the number of new infections is somewhere between shrinking by 1% and growing by 3% every day. The most likely value is towards the middle of the range, experts advising the government say. But they also said R and growth rates are not the only important measures of the pandemic and should be considered alongside other metrics. These include the number of new cases of the disease identified during a specified time period (incidence), and the proportion of the population with the disease at a given point in time (prevalence). In the east of England, the R number is 0.9 to 1.2, while the growth rate is between -1% and +4%. The R number in the Midlands is 0.9 to 1.1, while the growth rate in the region is between -1% and +3%. In the north-east and Yorkshire, the R-value is 1.0 to 1.2, while the growth rate is between +1% and +5%. In the south-east, the R-value is 1.0 to 1.2, while the growth rate is between 0 and +4%. The south-west has an R-value of 0.9 to 1.2 and a growth rate of between -1% and +4%. In London, the growth rate is between +2% and +4% while in the north-west, the figure is between +2% and +5%. Downing Street defended the test-and-trace programme amid rising coronavirus cases. The prime minister’s official spokesman said: “What test and trace is doing is testing hundreds of thousands of people a day and is helping to identify people who would otherwise inadvertently be spreading the virus and that is helping to control infection rates.” Asked if the public should expect further restrictions, the spokesman said: “We keep all measures under review but it was on Wednesday that we set out the steps which we think are currently required in order to help us to bring the virus under control.” The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has criticised the UK government’s “Operation Moonshot” mass testing idea. Drakeford said: “I’m a bit allergic to these ‘with one leap they were free’ solutions. We’ve heard a number of these over the months. I remember when the prime minister said that antibody testing was going to be a game-changer. “I think we need to concentrate less on magic bullets. I think there is a risk it distracts people. All too often, these magic bullets turn out to be less magic than they were hoped for.” Drakeford said Wales was looking at giving local authorities extra lockdown powers, such as the ability to impose curfews or limit the amount of alcohol an individual could buy at any one time. Trade talks between the UK and the EU this week were “more constructive” than expected despite the near-catastrophic clash over Boris Johnson’s plans to renege on part of the Brexit deal, British officials have said. Talks will continue in Brussels next week after there were some breakthroughs on process, but continued significant differences over major issues, including fisheries and state aid. A senior UK negotiating official said: Talks this week have been relatively more constructive than you might expect, but ultimately progress will be determined by whether we get more realism from them on the key areas of divergence. Whilst we are beginning to get discussions of substance of some issues, big important areas remain unresolved. We will carry on talking in Brussels next week. On subsidies we are asking that the EU agree with us what they have agreed with so many others in this area. Despite their insistence to the contrary, on fisheries their position is still a long a way from the huge change we need to get an agreement. It is understood progress has been made in some areas, including trading of goods, services and social security. The UK is also concerned over what it perceives to be a veiled threat not to put Britain on the “third country list” for food exports. Progress was achieved after the EU dropped its policy of parallelism – the insistence that progress had to be made on all elements of the talks, ranging from the fundamental stumbling blocks of state aid and fisheries to smaller, easier issues to settle. A government department says it has taken “urgent action” after inspectors found social distancing was not being enforced in one of its offices. Health and safety inspectors visited the Department for Work and Pensions’s (DWP) Quarry House building in Leeds and issued a notice of contravention. Office staff were pictured gathered around a desk at the centre, which is also used by NHS staff. According to the BBC, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspected the offices on 27 August and its report said: “You are failing to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health and safety of your employees/agency staff at work because you have not implemented necessary measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19.” It said the DWP’s risk-assessed Covid-safe capacity for the office of 50% full “may be ambitious and unrealistic”. An HSE spokesman said: “We received a workplace concern and this has been processed in line with our concerns handling procedure. Following a site visit, a letter (notification of contravention) was sent to DWP.” A DWP spokesman said: “We take the health and safety of staff extremely seriously, and have implemented Covid-secure measures across our sites to ensure they comply with government guidelines. “We have taken urgent action to rectify all issues identified by the HSE.” Downing Street suggested it would not review the decision to include children in the six-person limit on social gatherings despite Scotland and Wales exempting those under 12. The prime minister’s official spokesman told a Westminster briefing: “We looked at all of the evidence in advance of the decision that was reached on Wednesday and it was decided to proceed with a rule of six that applies to all ages. “What we have done is ensure that the rules have been simplified and strengthened so they are easier to understand. Social distancing measures can only be effective if the public understands them and abides by them.” Evidence suggests the rate of new infections in private households in England has increased in recent weeks, the ONS has said. An average of 3,200 people per day were estimated to be newly infected with Covid-19 between 30 August and 5 September, the ONS said. This was up from an average of 2,000 people per day between 19 and 25 August. The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has said he has spoken only once to Boris Johnson since May. Here’s a summary of the changes in Wales: From Monday, it will become compulsory for people over 11 to wear a face covering in public indoor spaces, such as shops. There will be exemptions for people who cannot wear face coverings for health or medical reasons. Face coverings will not be required in pubs or restaurants for the time being but the Welsh government is carrying out a rapid review of the evidence about whether they should be extended to the hospitality sector. From Monday, only a maximum of six people from an “extended household” will be able to meet indoors at any one time. This rule applies in pubs and restaurants as well as in people’s homes. Children under 11 will not be counted in the six. Up to four households are allowed to join together in an “extended household”. However, this will not apply in Caerphilly county borough council area where stricter local restrictions have been introduced to control a sharp rise in coronavirus cases. Ministers will also be giving local authorities new powers to close premises on public health grounds to tackle the spread of the virus. Drakeford said there had been a “significant increase” in the number of people wanting to be tested for Covid-19. He said one drive-in centre had been testing about 350 people a week. Last week this rose to 2,200. An estimated 39,700 people in private households in England had Covid-19 between 30 August and 5 September, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This was the equivalent of around 0.07% of the population or one in 1,400 individuals. The estimate is an increase from the previous figures for 19 to 25 August, which were 0.05% of the population, or one in 2,000 individuals. The figures do not include people staying in hospitals, care homes or other institutional settings. Hello everyone, I am taking over the UK coronavirus live feed while my colleague takes a break.

The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, has warned that his country faces a “gathering storm” as the Wales-wide Covid-19 rate hits 20 per 100,000 people. “There is a serious risk of the virus spreading more widely once again,” he said, adding there was a short window to “get ahead of a gathering storm”. Drakeford said that as well as limiting the number of people who could meet indoors, the Welsh government would reinforce its message that people should work from home where possible. He told a press conference in Cardiff that it had never been his government’s policy to encourage people back to the office, unlike England. Drakeford said from Monday most people would need to wear face coverings in public places such as shops. They would face fines if they knowingly and deliberately refused to do so. Two people have been arrested in England over a suspected £70,000 coronavirus job retention scheme fraud, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has said. Officers from the department arrested a 43-year-old accountant and a 51-year-old company director after attending two homes in Romford and Walthamstow on Thursday. The whole of the Merseyside region has been included on Public Health England’s watch list of areas with rising coronavirus cases. The move means that Liverpool, Wirral, Sefton, Knowsley and St Helens are at risk of stricter measures because of surging infections rates. Steve Rotheram, metro mayor of the Liverpool city region, said: Over the past week we have seen a rapid increase in coronavirus cases across the Liverpool city region. We are not yet at the stage of having extra restrictions imposed on us – as other areas have – but, if we continue on our current trajectory, it will become a case of when, not if, this happens. There is still time for us to stop that happening – but doing so depends on us and what we choose to do. I am working hard with our local councils and other partners to do everything in our power to keep the spread of the virus under control, but we cannot do that without your help. The launch of the government’s flagship Covid-19 app on 24 September comes after a lengthy delay. In June, it was forced to abandon a centralised coronavirus contact-tracing app that experts had repeatedly warned would not work. Matt Hancock then announced in a U-turn that the NHS would switch to an alternative designed by US tech companies Apple and Google. At the time, officials conceded it was unlikely to be ready until winter. Originally, Hancock said the app would be rolled out nationally in “mid-May”, with work starting on the abandoned app as the pandemic unfolded in March. The idea behind the app is that it will trace anybody that a person with coronavirus symptoms came into close contact with by using the Bluetooth connectivity on a standard smartphone, and notify them to self-isolate. The Covid-19 app will be launched across England and Wales on 24 September, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Before its introduction businesses including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas are being urged to ensure they have NHS QR code posters visible on entry so customers who have downloaded the new app can use their smartphones to check in. The department said ongoing trials in the London borough of Newham, on the Isle of Wight and with NHS volunteer responders showed the app was “highly effective when used alongside traditional contact tracing to identify contacts of those who have tested positive for coronavirus”. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said of the app’s launch: QR codes provide an easy and simple way to collect contact details to support the NHS Test and Trace system. Hospitality businesses can now download posters for their premises ahead of the launch of the NHS Covid-19 app. This will allow the public to seamlessly check in to venues using the app when it launches. It is vital we are using the NHS Test and Trace system to reach as many people as possible to prevent outbreaks and stop this virus in its tracks. This function will make it simple and easy so we can keep this virus under control. Grassroots campaigners for EU nationals in the UK and Britons in Europe have expressed fears that they too could be hit by a government U-turn on the Brexit deal. They say that Boris Johnson’s willingness to backtrack on the Northern Ireland protocol he agreed in January undermines trust that he will stick with the other core parts of the deal in the future including the section on citizens’ rights. “The statement in the House of Commons and the published bill send a clear message to the EU that if the UK does not intend to honour one critical part of the withdrawal agreement, it cannot be trusted to implement other parts of the agreement, including on citizens’ rights,” they said in a statement issued by British in Europe and The3million. “We now ask Prime Minister Johnson to do the decent thing and make an urgent statement in the house confirming that the UK will honour its obligations towards EU nationals in the UK and its own citizens living in the EU in the full spirit and to the letter of the withdrawal agreement.” Former prime minister Gordon Brown has said Britain faces a “tsunami of unemployment” unless efforts to protect jobs are stepped up. Brown told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I think that there should now be an operational target that interest rates will not rise and stimulus will continue until employment returns to pre-crisis levels. It’s in line with what the Federal Reserve is doing. I think other banks around the world are going to do something similar. And I think the Bank of England, at this point, is, I’m afraid, behind the curve. They have got to send a signal that employment really matters. We are facing a tsunami of unemployment. He added that the country currently faced a “cliff edge” when the government’s furlough scheme ends on 31 October. Boris Johnson is facing revolt from some Tory backbenchers over new lockdown restrictions limiting social gatherings to groups of six people in England. On Friday, the Telegraph reported that senior Tories want younger children to be exempt from the so-called “rule of six” in England, while the Daily Mail claimed the health secretary, Matt Hancock, was the only cabinet minister on Johnson’s coronavirus strategy committee to support the plan at a meeting on Tuesday, the day before the prime minister announced it. Speaking on Friday, the Tory former minister Steve Baker told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: I think it is now time to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people. It’s time to move to a voluntary system - unless the government can demonstrate otherwise. And it is time for us to actually start living like a free people, not subjecting ourselves to constantly shifting legal requirements, which I think now no one can fully understand. The changes come as coronavirus rates continue to rise across parts of England, with Leeds and Birmingham among areas at risk of further lockdown measures. The government has secured its first major post-Brexit trade deal after signing an agreement with Japan which will boost trade by an estimated £15bn. The UK-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement was agreed in principle by Ms Truss and Japan’s foreign minister Toshimitsu Motegi, in a video call on Friday morning. International trade secretary Liz Truss said it was a “historic moment” for the two countries which will bring “new wins” for British businesses in the manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. The Government said the deal brings benefits beyond the EU-Japan trade deal, giving UK companies exporting to Japan a competitive advantage. Almost all exports to Japan (99%) will benefit from tariff-free trade. Truss said: The agreement we have negotiated - in record time and in challenging circumstances - goes far beyond the existing EU deal, as it secures new wins for British businesses in our great manufacturing, food and drink, and tech industries. “From our automotive workers in Wales to our shoemakers in the North of England, this deal will help build back better as we create new opportunities for people throughout the whole of the UK and help level up our country. “Strategically, the deal is an important step towards joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership and placing Britain at the centre of a network of modern free trade agreements with like-minded friends and allies.” Foreign secretary Dominic Raab congratulated Truss in a tweet. Face masks will be mandatory in shops and indoor spaces in Wales from Monday, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said the country had reached a threshold where 20 people in 100,000 were suffering from coronavirus. But if the rate fell and Covid-19 was “effectively suppressed”, the Welsh government would revisit the issue, he said. Wales will make indoor meetings of more than six people illegal from Monday, though children under the age of 12 will not count towards that total. Challenged on why the London government had not followed the path of devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales, which have exempted children under the age of 12 and 11 respectively from so-called rule of six limitations on gatherings, business minister Nadim Zahawi said that the move had been taken in England to ensure “simplicity.” “It goes against the grain, the DNA of a Conservative government to curtail people’s liberties but the evidence suggests that the virus is at its most virulent in those social interactions, in the home, in the pub and outside, which is why we are reluctantly introducing the rule of six,” he told the BBC’s Today programme. New regulations limiting gatherings in England to no more than six from Monday and moves to have Covid-19 marshals have sparked alarm among some Tory MPs who want parliament to have the power to review measures. Greater parliamentary scrutiny was needed, according to the Tory former minister Steve Baker, who said it was “now time to say that this is not a fit legal environment for the British people” and that there should be a “voluntary system”. “And it is time for us to actually start living like a free people, not subjecting ourselves to constantly shifting legal requirements, which I think now no one can fully understand,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “It seems to me the effect of having Covid marshals will be to turn every public space in Britain into the equivalent of going through airport security where we are badgered and directed … I’m not willing to live like this.” Strict new coronavirus restrictions look set to be imposed across Birmingham after infections rocketed. The city of 1.14 million people is widely expected to have tighter rules imposed on Friday, following two days of discussions between the government and regional health and local authority leaders. Earlier this week, West Midlands mayor Andy Street, who travelled to London to meet with officials, said additional restrictions were “very, very likely”. Stressing no final decisions had yet been made, he added: [The] simplest form of restriction would be city-wide”. The city’s director of public health Dr Justin Varney said the uptick was “linked primarily to private household gatherings”, at the end of August and across the bank holiday weekend. An increase in testing had also turned up more positive results, he added. Licensed premises, like pubs and bars, and restaurants flouting contact-tracing rules and social distancing, are also believed to be part of the problem behind rising rates. The mayor also said younger people “had got to take responsibility” with the biggest growth in the under-40s age groups. According to NHS Digital data, the latest seven-day rate for the city to September 8 showed 78.2 cases per 100,000 with 892 cases over the period – among the highest in Birmingham since April’s peak. Good morning. Both Scotland and Wales are bringing in stricter “rule of six” regulations amid warnings that coronavirus cases are surging again. On Thursday, the Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said she hoped the new limit of six people from two households would apply indoors – in houses, pubs and restaurants – and outdoors, including in private gardens. The announcement from both countries came after Boris Johnson announced a ban on meetings of groups of more than six people from up to six households in England, applying indoors and outdoors from next Monday. Mask-wearing and lockdown rules are also now causing deeper social divides than Brexit, according to a UK-wide study. Polling of 10,000 people found that half of mask-wearers in Britain (58%) have severely negative attitudes towards those who do not wear a mask, and the majority (68%) of people who did not break lockdown rules have strong negative views about lockdown rule-breakers.

          "bodyText": "Is Trevor Paglen a hyper-suspicious activist exposing the state? Or is he an artist who has found that adopting such a stance helps him reveal things about how we live now? It’s hard to tell. Previously, he has photographed secret military installations in the desert and taken long-exposure pictures of the night sky that at first glance look like astronomy, but in reality record the paths of satellites watching our every move. That was before Covid-19, which seems to have driven Paglen to new depths of paranoid introspection, responding with the blackest of humour in an exhibition that may not even be an exhibition but a lure to catch the unwary in his sinister web. The white walls and partitions of the gallery are hung with what look like artworks. Big photographs of flowers and woodlands bring the outdoors into this city interior. Paglen appears to have turned to nature for solace during lockdown. Like David Hockney and Nan Goldin, who have produced lockdown images of trees and flowers, he has wandered in pastoral meadows to relieve the stress – or so it seems. Except these meadows are unreal. They were produced using artificial intelligence. The harder you look, the less soothing they are. The colours are hyper-intense yet unseasonal. The leaves and petals are brittle, even plasticky. This is the most convincing algorithm-composed art I have ever seen. Yet Paglen is not an AI huckster who wants you to believe a machine is a great artist and aims to make a fast buck at Christie’s with technophile blather. On the contrary, these unnatural images of nature are presented to disturb. Paglen’s digital gardens are upsetting in a similar way to his pictures of a night sky, where the wonders of the universe are obscured by surveillance machines. But he is just showing the truth. And when you look into the dead soulless spaces of his fake nature scenes, the reality is brutal. They reveal the vanishing of nature, but it’s nature as seen through layers of sentimental myth, TV documentaries, or the window of a people carrier racing down a country lane – a faint cliche of the picturesque that’s no more alive than these monstrous AI visions. This, however, is almost incidental. By the time you’ve started to feel the strangeness of the art on the walls, you are also intensely, awkwardly aware of something else. The gallery is full of surveillance cameras watching your every move. Some are blatantly set up in the midst of the space, others are more discreet, and at least one is hidden inside an artwork. They are not for show. The exhibition is being screened as a live webcast called Octopus. Those cables slung about the space like tentacles are taking images of you directly so people around the world can watch you on the webcast as you look at art. I felt paralysed and I tried to find a corner where no camera could see me. Then I composed myself and went around posing as an art critic looking at art. But the experience was now anxious, mediated and false. Paglen is not only paranoid, he’s able to create paranoia in others. He has created a layered project in which nothing is what it seems. I genuinely don’t know how seriously to take the art on the walls. For the real “exhibition” appears to be me. Paglen explodes the complacency of contemporary culture with cruel clarity. This is a bonfire of modern illusions. For one thing, he takes apart the cult of interaction and participation that was so huge in art before the pandemic. Paglen’s show is participatory – but in a cold, voyeuristic way, without the consent of the gallery visitor. Sure, there’s a warning that you will be webcast. But, short of refusing to enter the space, you have nowhere to hide. Watchers at home, meanwhile, get the ultimate online exhibition. I dashed home and caught an art deal going down, a security guard checking his watch. Here Paglen aims his telescopic sight on lockdown culture. Galleries and museums around the world have been putting on virtual exhibitions and events. This is the reductio ad absurdum of that. As art lovers gaze at synthesised flowers, we are watched on a split-screen webcast. It’s fascinating for the homebound, excruciating for the gallery-goer. This is lockdown culture as a human zoo. Paglen distrusts everything and everyone. The technological layers of 21st-century life, he suggests, are mind-boggling traps. For you are kidding yourself, hypocritical voyeur, if you think you’re safe as you watch me in the gallery. As we all know, but choose to forget, every move we make online is open to surveillance. Paglen’s live webcast exhibition dramatises and makes visible the hidden watchers everywhere: the cameras we don’t usually notice, the invisible servers that know what you are reading right now, the poison bloom of an infinitely ramifying system of illusion and control. At Pace Gallery, London, and on online until 10 November."

          "bodyText": "If there’s one thing this government has consistently proven itself to be good at, it’s coming up with a catchy slogan which is then impossible to de-escalate. We saw it first with “stay at home, protect the NHS, save lives”, which I think kind of worked actually – if there’s one thing the British people love, it’s a reminder that the NHS is so sacred that to invest public money in it in any significant way would be somehow unholy, so please stay indoors and clap and hope for the best. This lasted two months before it became, “stay alert, control the virus, save lives”. Then there’s Rishi Sunak’s one-man high-street-restaurant renewal plan, which, when he first unveiled it, might as well have been written on a Post-it as “something like ‘eat out to help out’? Not that obviously”, but has perversely stuck. And – oh, what’s that? Matt Hancock’s on Radio 1? What’s he saying? What new catchphrase does he have for us? “Don’t kill your gran,” he told Newsbeat. Ah, OK. There’s more: “Don’t kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on. And you can pass it on before you’ve had any symptoms at all.” I have to admit that it’s ghoulishly catchy, though have to question the wisdom of going on a youth-focused news programme and more or less accusing them all of passively enacting senicide. “Hey, kids! What about that Ed Sheeran, hey? Anyway, listen: every thoughtless action of your life is now a mortal threat to your grandmother. TikTok!” Personally, I think it’s a bit rich to lay responsibility for containing Covid on the shoulders of an age group that has only just recovered from the shock of having their university dreams torn away from them by an algorithm. But what do I know? It just feels odd that just after the government pushed so hard to open schools again, it is now blaming 17- to 22-year-olds – many of whom are, you know, in school still – for interacting with their mates. I’m not saying young people are entirely innocent; there have been many documented instances of social distance-flouting raves and house parties being broken up by the police, and on a personal note, many of my days in lockdown have been ruined by an 18-year-old humiliating me online at Fifa. But if groups of people are so bad for the R value, then why has the government made no eye-catching statement about the recent thousands-strong anti-mask protests? They’ve given firmer warnings to young people following the guidelines than the furious middle-aged people actively not. But then this is straight from the playbook, really: weaponising that early-lockdown feeling of neighbourly betrayal that simmered across the country for a number of weeks, a fever only broken by the VE Day conga. What the Conservatives understand better than any party is that peculiarly English tendency to get quietly furious with anyone you perceive to be having an easier time than you. It starts in cul-de-sacs, when Her Next Door gets a luxurious new car on finance, and it trickles down to the people on benefits who dare to own a TV. It reared its head, ugly and angular, when the early-lockdown rule that we could only leave the house once a day – and any breaking of that code could be reported to the police – set the curtains twitching. Only in a nation as deranged as England could people drive four hours to a beach and then tut to find other people there. The Tories know this and are using that energy to play people off against each other. It’s interesting that these anti-young catchphrases have come in the wake of a weeks-long government push to get us “back to normal”, which has been gleefully embraced by furlough critics (“You’ve had the summer off, now back to work!”), office-work proponents (“Two hours commuting on a train each day is actually very precious You Time!”) and the aforementioned anti-muzzle movement (I’ve put myself in a hypnotic trance more than once this week watching a talkRadio host inelegantly snip apart a mask). But I fear it’s all poised to get worse when autumn turns greyer, and the nights draw closer, and the looming spectre of Lockdown Part II – don’t say it, don’t make eye contact with it, in case it notices us – heaves ever nearer. England had the highest excess deaths in Europe during the first wave, and that’s more to do with this and previous Conservative governments than it is to do with us. They are telling us to get back to normal – go to school, go to work, go to the pub and please please go to restaurants – but are already setting the groundwork to blame us when the next spike erupts. Don’t let Matt Hancock chiding Newsbeat listeners go unnoticed. He’ll be out for Radio 4 next. • Joel Golby is the author of Brilliant, Brilliant, Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant"

          "bodyText": "In 2010, the writer Zadie Smith urged users of Facebook to step back and consider the look of one’s Facebook “wall”: doesn’t it look ridiculous, she asked, “your life in this format? The last defense of every Facebook addict is: but it helps me keep in contact with people who are far away! Well, email and Skype do that, too, and they have the added advantage of not forcing you to interface with the mind of Mark Zuckerberg.” The year 2010 is basically archaic, in social media terms, and yet Smith was spot on in reading Facebook not as an inspiring phenomenon, or even a world-opening tool of connection, but as a flattening, bottomless manmade trap – a series of narrow, insidious design choices made by a select group of real people. “Never before in history have the decisions of a handful of designers (mostly men, white, living in SF, aged 25–35) working at 3 companies” – Google, Apple and Facebook – “had so much impact on how millions of people around the world spend their attention,” wrote Google “design ethicist” Tristan Harris in a 144-page PowerPoint manifesto called A Call To Minimize Distraction &amp; Respect Users’ Attention, which exploded within the company in 2013. Then a software designer working to make Gmail more “enjoyable”, Harris was concerned by the company’s ravenous pursuit of profit through attention without consideration of its consequence. At the time, Harris’s presentation garnered buzz but largely fell on deaf ears; social media and tech companies’ hunger for growth and engagement through distraction and division continued apace. But in the years since the 2016 election, in which Russian disinformation campaigns on Facebook played an influential if not consequential role in helping to elect Donald Trump, numerous tech insiders have joined Harris in publicly condemning the tools they built. “I wish more people could understand how this works, because it shouldn’t be something that only the tech industry knows,” says Harris in The Social Dilemma, a new Netflix documentary on the untenability of our current social media landscape. “It should be something that everybody knows.” The Social Dilemma, directed by Jeff Orlowski, explores and animates a philosophical shift in Silicon Valley: that the tech industry’s tools, most predominantly social media, aren’t promising tools but too-powerful entities fragmenting attention and rewiring brains by design; that addiction to phones and social media is a function of their business model; that this divisive, degrading status quo is driving us straight to dystopia. This is a dark conclusion many have already reached, be it relative of a QAnon convert or everyday American whose hand has been reshaped into a phone-sized claw, but the film grounds its critique in first-person warnings from Silicon Valley insiders, most prominently Harris, but also: former Facebook platform operations manager Sandy Parakilas; Bailey Richardson, one of Instagram’s 13 original employees who has since deleted the app; virtual reality pioneer, philosopher and “tech oracle” Jaron Lanier; and Justin Rosenstein, the guy behind Facebook’s “like” button. The film is part accounting of the grave psychological and social damage caused by algorithmic, growth-determined content feeds, as explained by experts such as Dr Shoshana Zuboff, the author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, and it’s part dramatization of destructive design choices – Mad Men’s Vincent Kartheiser anthropomorphizes an amoral algorithm programmed to feed addictive and jittering content. The point is that our current social media impasse, a concentration of power over users made both twitchy and sluggish, is neither acceptable nor changeable without a radical reimagining of tech companies. It’s a far cry from the expansive, hopeful dialogue of the early aughts, when Orlowski repped Apple computers as a Stanford undergraduate and believed the internet “could take us further, and faster – this technology could be massively empowering”, he told the Guardian. But by 2017, when Orlowski caught up with Harris, an acquaintance from college who left Google in 2015 to form the Center for Humane Technology, a cultural “techlash” over the perils of surveillance capitalism, the psychological damage of social media designed to fragment attention, and the grave threat of widespread misinformation had begun to cement. That techlash – from the combative anti-trust congressional hearings with tech CEOs last month to the #StopHateForProfit campaign against Facebook – is still a relatively recent phenomenon. When Orlowski began work on The Social Dilemma, in 2017 and early 2018, it was difficult to get people to voice their gnawing concerns on the record. “I don’t think [The Social Dilemma] could’ve been made five years ago,” he said. “It took quite a while until we got to a place where we had enough people on camera who were willing to speak out.” But by 2018, the power of mushroomed technology companies had forced many in Silicon Valley to re-evaluate the purpose of the tools they built, and the impact of capitalist incentives of design choices. “Technology is not inevitable,” said Orlowski. “People are making it based on, in part, the market and market forces, and in part their values, ethics and choices. Google and Facebook chose to go down a path that really optimized financial profitability.” Facebook, for example, developed a bureau of talent known for “growth hacking” – design that prioritized as much “user” growth as possible to rake in ungodly profits, algorithms that elevated emotionally manipulative, divisive content. Orlowski compared the scale and rapidity of social media to the discovery of oil, which propelled humanity to previously unfathomed speeds and distances and physical connectivity at devastating long-term ecological cost. Similarly, he said, what once seemed like a utopian promise of connection has been revealed to burn through our data and attention and emotional stability for profit. “We’ve become the resource. We have become the oil,” he said. “They’re mining and extracting us, with no regards for the consequences it has on the society.” The Social Dilemma is particularly concerned about the political polarization accelerated by social media networks, how Facebook, Instagram, Google and Twitter have “become the digital infrastructure, they’ve become public utilities”, said Orlowski. “They are the backbone of our information communication and yet they are systemically putting people on their own islands of thought.” But it doesn’t have to be that way – “we can design a better internet,” he said. The US could enact stricter laws around privacy on social media; companies could reorient to deeper connections with fewer people rather than encouraging unlimited reach that collapses context and a sense of scale. We could tax data collection; there could be a shift toward what Lanier calls “data dignity” – ownership over whatever data and insights you contribute to the cloud. There could be platform bankruptcy, in which the giants would reset their user and group follower counts to zero and rebuild from the ground up with robust disinformation and hate speech policies. But all of these measures would be temporary Band-Aids; many, including several Social Dilemma speakers, have concluded that the behemoth that is Facebook is too large to govern responsibly, making reform impossible; the promised utopia of a connected, generative online world is not achievable with the current architecture of social media, but that doesn’t mean we can’t imagine a better internet. That’s the hope proffered by The Social Dilemma, which ends on a note of possibility for conscience-oriented tech to guard us from societal doom. “This is a climate change-scale problem,” said Orlowski, noting a comparison of collective, systemic change required over individual action. It’s possible, he said, if you believe in the promise of more humanely oriented technology. “We can design technology that works for humanity,” he said. “It’s absolutely a huge shift, but it’s completely doable.” The Social Dilemma is available on Netflix on 9 September"

          "bodyText": "After the catastrophe of the past eight months, a new political consensus seems to be emerging. The government has to get a tighter grip of the country and the crisis we are facing. Taking back control now means that Boris Johnson must change his management style. Instead of remaining an aloof chairman of his government, he must become its hands-on chief executive. Ministers need to discover misplaced competence – from the reopening of schools to securing a Brexit deal (or preparing for no deal), and from reigniting a beleaguered economy to supporting the tens of thousands of people who will lose their jobs when the furlough scheme ends. And Covid-19 will have to be kept in check through a judicious mix of personal hygiene measures, physical distancing, mask-wearing, testing, quarantine and targeted short-term lockdowns. But none of these measures recognise the true scale of the social pathology underlying Britain’s national crisis. They do not constitute a strategy for national revival, or offer a long-term vision for our nation. And they do not deliver any prospect for hope and regeneration, let alone the promise of “levelling up” the country. Science cannot guide the government in formulating this strategy. A plan for Britain’s future must be guided instead by our values and the lessons learned from the human consequences of this pandemic. It’s time for Johnson’s government to stop saying it is simply “following the science”. By this, I don’t mean that ministers should ignore the advice of scientists as they manage the continuing presence of coronavirus in our communities, but that we don’t elect scientists to lead our nation. We elect politicians to offer and deliver a vision for our country and a practical plan for our collective future. As summer fades, it’s becoming clear that our government has no vision and no plan for the future of the nation it was elected to protect and strengthen. The writer Elif Shafak, in her recently published essay How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division, recalls seeing signs in public parks during the pandemic asking: “When all this is over, how do you want the world to be different?” She points out that we are suffering from a widespread disillusionment about our bewildering predicament, and describes how people are feeling anxious and angry. She argues that alienation and exclusion are breeding mistrust, that communication between people and politicians is broken, and that despite the crisis we face we are nowhere near being able to answer a question about how we want the world to be. How do we begin to answer that question? First, we must understand the true nature of the crisis that confronts us. Our nation suffers from a political disease of historic proportions. The bonds that once held communities together are fraying. The confidence we once felt that generations after our own would have greater opportunities has ebbed away. And the beliefs we once embraced about the inherent strength and resilience of our national institutions and welfare state have been exposed as mere illusions. The coronavirus pandemic has exposed the reality of contemporary Britain: the country is defined by poverty, insecurity and inequality. To solve this crisis, we must begin by hearing the stories and listening to the experiences of those who have borne the brunt of Covid-19, especially the families who have suffered grievous losses and those who fell ill on the frontlines of the response. Illness and death have been concentrated among the elderly, those living with chronic disease, people from black, Asian and minority ethnic communities, and those who have been working in frontline public services, from health and social care to transport, food production and distribution. The closure of schools has placed a particular burden on children and young people. And a shadow pandemic has harmed women and children, who have suffered rising levels of violence and domestic abuse at home. A more equal society is a safer, kinder and more prosperous society. Specific policies to meet the urgent needs of these groups can lay the foundations for economic recovery and build resilience to future crises. We must demand parental support to improve prospects for child development and policies to advance adolescent physical and mental health. We should have stronger assistance and legal protections for women and children at risk of domestic violence and abuse. And we need more interventionist disease prevention and health promotion campaigns across people’s lifetimes, prioritising cancer prevention, heart disease and severe lung disease – and recognising the role that poverty and insecurity play in determining ill health. Working conditions must be improved, and frontline workers must receive a wage that respects and recognises the critical role they have played in protecting our communities from collapse. It was these frontline workers who did not have the luxury of staying at home. Thousands of women and men, working on zero-hours contracts or in dangerous factory conditions without sick pay, had no choice but to work in environments that put them at the highest risk of contracting infection. At the heart of this vision would be a new settlement to achieve intergenerational and socioeconomic equality. The pandemic has exposed how brittle our society is at the extreme ends of the age spectrum. We have systematically neglected our older citizens by denying them the esteem and material needs they have earned from their lifetimes of work and care. We have hurt our children by outsourcing their futures to a hopelessly flawed mathematical algorithm. We have to take education as seriously as we do healthcare; and, currently, we do not. We have spent decades underinvesting in education, leaving generations of children to struggle, with little hope and dwindling prospects. And the time for integrating adult and children’s social care within the NHS is long past. This pandemic has dehumanised us all. The effects of Covid-19 have been described in terms of mortality statistics, rates of infection, epidemiological models and league tables. The biographies of those who lost their lives to this virus have been largely forgotten. But they can be recovered and brought into the political foreground by fashioning a new vision for our nation that puts their lives and sacrifices at its centre. These priorities will not be achieved with mere changes in the style of government. They require an accurate diagnosis not of what went wrong in the response to the pandemic – that will come later – but of who has endured the greatest harm. We don’t need a public inquiry to tell us who has suffered the greatest burden of Covid-19. There will of course be vigorous, even rancorous, political debates about policies to advance the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable communities. But those debates should at least be forged in the service of a coherent, determined and optimistic plan for national rejuvenation. Covid-19 is not our destiny. It’s time to look beyond this appalling, cruel pandemic and towards a more optimistic future. • Richard Horton is a doctor and edits the Lancet"

          "bodyText": "Global tech giants Google and Facebook are using the Australian public as human bargaining chips as they raise the stakes in their bid to block what would be world-leading laws to end the conceit that news content is a free natural resource. While the legislation in question is complex and technical – the product of more than 18 months review and consultation – the political battle is totemic: should big tech be responsible for its impact on our broader democracy? That’s the underlying premise of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission inquiry that informed the laws: the rise of the big tech platforms has created an unfair market, where media companies can no longer compete fairly. That distortion has led to the collapse of the media business model, leaving a space filled with conspiracy theories, self-reinforcing filter bubbles and voter manipulation. After steadfastly refusing to take accountability for the dissemination of fake news and disinformation on its platform, Facebook last week threatened to block real news from the accounts of its Australian users if “pay for content” becomes law. Google too has warned users their service is at risk, making veiled threats of ending free internet search while revving up YouTube creators in suggesting they will be disenfranchised and disadvantaged if they have to explain how they make their money off news content. It’s a brazen show of strength premised on the notion that the millions of Australians who search and scroll on their platforms will continue to stare into their screens even without the fact-based journalism that for many is an anchor point of their online engagement. So what do we human bargaining chips think? Results in this week’s Guardian Essential Report should serve as a caution to the Silicon Valley overlords, with majority support for propositions that reinforce the Morrison government’s roadmap to sustain the ailing news media. The clear impression from the public responses to these propositions is that the public agrees there should be some form of recalibration. Not only do they think it’s reasonable to pay for news, a majority also believe that the platforms have too much power. While there are high numbers of uncommitted, the core statements break against the platforms 2:1. Dig under the headline figures and two trends emerge: first, support for bringing big tech to account is skewed older (as is usage of the platforms as a primary news source); but more significantly, the issue breaks stronger with Coalition voters long conditioned to oppose regulation of any kind. Perhaps that’s a result of the simple fact it is a Morrison government initiative, bought forward with the vigorous support of the Murdoch press, which sees obvious self-interest in the legislation. But this should not be a reason to reject it out of hand. There is a very, very narrow section on a Venn diagram showing the crossover of Murdoch self-interest and national interest but the proposition that the big tech platforms should pay for premium journalism content is bang in the middle of that graph. While a proposition that supports News Ltd’s business model will stick in the craw of many progressives, the reality is that without its advocacy the Morrison government would be unlikely to be pushing this issue. The legislation is not perfect. After rejecting another recommendation from the ACCC to adequately fund public broadcasting, the omission of the outlets from this part of the code creates a two-tier media, with the real risk that the platforms use this “free” content instead. More glaringly, there is no requirement the negotiated payment would be spent on actual journalists, rather than filling the pockets of shareholders – something that should be persuasive in future negotiations. These reservations aside, if you believe (as I do) that these companies need to be regulated before they roll over the top of democracy, the question is: if the government won’t step up with the urging of Murdoch, then when will it? Establishing a beachhead of regulation around media content is an important first step in the broader project civilising surveillance capitalism. Second are concerns (vigorously fuelled by Google and Facebook) that the changes will give News Ltd even greater power in the Australian media, a power it repeatedly uses to pile on progressives and run partisan campaigns. But the dominance of Murdoch in the Australian media is a symptom of the media’s decline, not justification for its ongoing erosion. Fair funding for the use of journalistic content is our best chance of supporting other publishers, such as Guardian Australia, to build viable models to invest in civic journalism. And finally, to the extent that News Ltd abuses its power, it does so in plain sight: there is nothing subtle about the old-school media mogul wielding influence for power. Their nefarious activities are baked into our political system and because we understand them, we have the opportunity to respond. In contrast, Facebook and Google’s excesses occur behind the algorithm: the softly, softly seduction, the extraction of personal information and the repurposing of our reality, is done under the slick veneer of progress. Remember Cambridge Analytica? By drawing this line in the sand, Facebook and Google have actually fessed up to how significant these regulations are, a chance to establish not just national but global ground rules that could help quell the takeover of our public square with lies and bile. And if they make good on their threat to walk, then maybe we will have the chance to reimagine what our public square could be. A separate question in this week’s report suggest we will find a way through. Three-quarters of us say we will go to a news website and choose the news for ourselves, while more than half will find another social platform. Yes, the majority predict they will read less news, but 30% say they would also use Facebook less. For companies whose value lies in their human network, these are the highest stakes. If you start using your humans as bargaining chips, you risk losing them altogether. Lose your network and you are just another website. • Peter Lewis is executive director of Essential Media and director of the Australia Institute’s Centre for Responsible Technology. He will discuss this week’s results with Guardian Australia political editor Katharine Murphy at 1pm on Tuesday"

          "headline": "The Guardian view on educational inequality: no quick fixes",
          "bodyText": "The evidence that educational inequality has grown sharply in England during the six months since schools closed in March may not be surprising. But it is dismaying. The gap in the results and post-school prospects of children from different socioeconomic backgrounds is a longstanding problem in the UK – not just for those whose opportunities are limited by weak qualifications, but for the society they belong to. Education is important in all sorts of ways, and is linked to health as well as income. New research suggesting that the gulf between disadvantaged and better-off pupils at English state schools has widened by 46% in a year should set alarm bells ringing. The fiasco surrounding this summer’s exam results makes the situation all the more worrying. It took intense public pressure to force a U-turn that ministers should have made as soon as it was clear that the algorithm used to calculate grades could accentuate existing links between attainment and wealth. Urgent and careful consideration must now be given to next year’s exams, in Scotland and Northern Ireland as well as England and Wales, to avoid a situation where pupils from poorer backgrounds are penalised. Since they are much more likely to have lost out on lessons than richer pupils, particularly those at private schools that delivered more remote teaching, the risk of exacerbating unfairness continues. Adjustments to the timetable and content of exams would be a sensible mitigation. The creation of a £1bn budget for catch-up tutoring was a positive sign that the government recognises the problem. But there is no quick fix for the learning loss caused by the pandemic. While evidence so far is based on teacher assessments of how much pupils missed between March and July, other factors have yet to be taken into consideration. These include the likelihood of further interruptions, which is greater in deprived households and neighbourhoods, where more people live in crowded conditions and suffer from ill health. Then there are issues connected with the return to school, with children who are already vulnerable to exclusion expected to find the adjustment to new rules and systems hardest, and concerns that 20,000 children with special educational needs have been “forgotten”. In London, the expected end of free public transport for children will create a further barrier to education for thousands of families who lack the money for fares. None of this is to say that the past six months have been a disaster for everyone. For some children who find school difficult, the break was a relief, while sons and daughters of key workers were in school (in smaller classes) throughout. But despite the initial sense of national emergency and feeling of togetherness that the pandemic fostered, it is beyond dispute that it has had a polarising effect. When people are forced out of the public sphere and on to their private resources, then the differences in those resources – be they physical space, relationships or access to education and technology – are amplified. Self-evidently, this situation is worst for those who have least. For future graduates whose education will continue to age 21 or later, three months is a smaller proportion (and loss) than for pupils who leave at 18. Rising unemployment and a dysfunctional housing market mean that missed school is only one among many serious difficulties faced by millions of low-income households. Schools policy cannot on its own solve the many problems associated with poverty, particularly when the latter is increasing. But targeted support for pupils who are recognised to have missed out, combined with a renewed focus on high-quality teaching, should help to minimise the harm caused to “generation Covid”. The boost in teacher recruitment that always accompanies a recession should at least ensure that ministers, headteachers, unions and everyone else involved in the recovery effort will have colleagues to work with. Their work is of the utmost importance."

          "bodyText": "“We have no hesitation in making the national identity card scheme an unfortunate footnote in history. There it should remain – a reminder of a less happy time when the government allowed hubris to trump civil liberties.” That was then home secretary Theresa May speaking in 2010 as she scrapped the previous Labour government’s multi-billion pound ID scheme, following a Conservative election campaign that included a pledge to “reverse the rise of the surveillance state”. Only last year, the Home Office minister Baroness Williams told parliament that the introduction of identity cards would be “prohibitively expensive and would represent a substantial erosion of civil liberties”. What a difference a year makes. Under the guise of the coronavirus pandemic, the government has announced plans to create online ID cards and a digital identity system to “revolutionise the use of data across government”. Although the Times reports that the details have not been finalised, under the proposals people “will be assigned a unique digital identity to help them with such tasks as registering with a new GP”. Pub owners, the article suggests, “would be able to digitally verify drinkers’ ages”. Given recent events, you’d be forgiven for being sceptical about the government’s ability to deliver its ambitions. More than £11m has been spent on a failed contact-tracing app. The test-and-trace scheme was launched unlawfully without a privacy impact assessment. A decision to use an algorithm to grade A-level students led to widespread protests. And then there’s the establishment of a frankly dystopian array of secret agreements to share vast amounts of our personal health data with tech corporations, one of which has been accused of facilitating the Trump administration’s immigration policies. It isn’t just the recent response to the pandemic that does little to inspire trust. In the space of a single week in April 2019, the Home Office had to apologise to both EU nationals and Windrush citizens for data breaches involving hundreds of people. Nor is the picture rosy in other nations with fully fledged ID systems. In March 2018, a data leak from a state-owned company in India allowed anyone to download the private information on all holders of an ID card, exposing their names, unique digital reference number, information about the services they used and even their bank details People often ask why objections to proposed ID systems in the UK have historically been so strident when such schemes are widespread in mainland Europe. What gets missed when the debate revolves around pieces of plastic is that these systems tend to entail massive centralised government databases spanning entire populations. Introducing one in the UK would fundamentally reshape our relationship with the state, making it far easier to access records across a whole host of different agencies – health, tax, immigration, education, and so on – and linking previously siloed and purpose-limited datasets to build up an intimate picture of almost every aspect of our lives. And, of course, the simple existence of many of those datasets – the gangs matrix and the Prevent database to name just two – is already highly controversial. Combined with biometric records and facial recognition, a digital ID system would take us perilously close to the state being able to track and record huge amounts of information about all of us in real time. This isn’t the stuff of fantasy: in Pakistan’s “smart cities”, for example, facial recognition-equipped CCTV cameras are integrated with the national ID database and a SIM registration database. What’s at stake therefore goes well beyond our privacy rights. When people know they are being watched they change their behaviour: a nationwide digital ID system could put at risk our freedoms to protest, strike, organise politically, practise our religion and express ourselves freely. This isn’t about a philosophical position on privacy. It’s about who the government shares our information with, and how it treats us based on what it thinks it knows about us. In the UK, the hostile environment has ushered in increasing demands for ID as a requirement for accessing basic goods and services like housing, banking, work, and the NHS. As well as violating the rights of the people that it targets, the policy has essentially been an experiment in using secret data-sharing and matching to automate the process of shutting people out from everything they need to live a dignified life. History tells us that the list of those who fall foul of the government of the day is rarely fixed for long – one need only look at the treatment of political dissidents, Muslims, people claiming benefits and trade unionists over the decades to imagine who might end up on such a list in the future. We shouldn’t blithely accept a digital ID system as a necessary evil in the modern world. There’s a lot more at stake here than being able to buy a pint more conveniently. Why not press for the one option that is all too often overlooked: rather than massively increasing state and corporate surveillance capacity in a bid to make ID checks easier, what if we simply got rid of some of them altogether? For starters, hostile environment checks – such as making landlords and banks check people’s immigration status – could and should go. The coronavirus pandemic has magnified a whole host of urgent issues that we must as a society prioritise. An intrusive, expensive and unjustified identity database simply isn’t one of them. • Gracie Mae Bradley is policy and campaigns manager for Liberty"

          "bodyText": "In 2019, a survey asked 3,624 Americans if Arabic numerals should be taught in school. An affronted 56% – and 72% of Republican respondents – said no. Only 29% said yes. The nos didn’t seem to know that Arabic numerals are the things they type with the keypads of their phones. Something similar has happened with architecture. You can read titans of art history such as Kenneth Clark or Nikolaus Pevsner, who took upon themselves the task of defining European civilisation, and barely find a mention of the Great Mosque of Córdoba or the Alhambra in Granada – extraordinary and important works of architecture that are unarguably located in Europe. It’s a breathtaking omission. Acccording to Diana Darke, the thing called “gothic”, versions of which (Notre-Dame, Houses of Parliament) have been claimed as the national style of several northern European countries, which theorists such as John Ruskin and Augustus Pugin saw as quintessentially Christian, is deeply indebted to Arab and Muslim builders in the centuries following the life of Muhammad. Pointed arches, ribbed vaults, spires, campaniles, rose windows, certain types of dome construction, variants of stained glass, the machicolations of castles, twin-towered cathedral fronts, possibly the cloister – all can be traced, says Darke, to older buildings in the Middle East and southern Spain. She argues that the trefoil arch – a three-lobed shape often used on churches as a symbol of the Trinity – is also Arab in origin. Through a hilariously mistaken belief that the Muslim Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem was Solomon’s Temple, a number of churches copied it. Nor was the influence confined to the middle ages. Brunelleschi’s dome of Florence’s cathedral, an early masterpiece of the Renaissance, seems to have been based on knowledge both of Islamic construction techniques and the writings of Ibn al-Haytham, a scientist in 11th-century Cairo. Antoni Gaudí, devoutly Catholic architect of the church of the Sagrada Família in Barcelona, explicitly learned from the Islamic masterpieces in Spain. The possible routes of influence were multiple: interaction between the Muslim-ruled parts of Spain and their Christian neighbours, the travels of Crusaders and pilgrims to Jerusalem, trade between cities such as Venice and Arab countries. Even when, as often, these relationships were hostile, opposing sides found ways to borrow or steal ideas from each other. Often they appropriated the necessary craftsmen as well. Sometimes Darke overstates her case. Some of the connections she makes don’t convince – a link she tries to make between Big Ben and the minaret of the Great Mosque in Aleppo is a bit of a stretch – but she assembles overwhelming evidence that extensive exchanges of ideas and knowledge took place. This shouldn’t be surprising. At a time when long-distance travel was often by sea, the Mediterranean connected more than it divided. Arab civilisation also gave Europe considerable knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, medicine and philosophy, including the words algebra and algorithm. For good measure the word “tabby”, as in cats, comes from a striped fabric named after an Umayyad prince called Attab. So it’s to be expected that Islamic achievements in architecture should have been passed on. Nor, in fact, is any of this news: as Darke points out, Christopher Wren identified what he called the “Saracen” influence on the misnamed “gothic” style 300 years ago. Motivated by a desire to counter the culture wars that attach themselves to architecture – there are Twitter feeds that pump out photographs of beautiful European buildings in order to make some point about racial supremacy – Darke feels the need to restate Wren’s argument. Not that she wants to make any claims for superiority of one over another. As she points out, the influences sometimes went the other way, for example from Rome via Byzantium to the Arab world. “My aim is not to denigrate European architecture and its many brilliant achievements,” she writes. “My purpose has been to show that no one ‘owns’ architecture, just as no one ‘owns’ science.” (Nor, one could say, the tabbiness of cats.) Which reasonable point, I’m sure, will not be enough to stop a torrent of rage from some quarters. But for most sane people her book is a useful reminder of the interconnectedness of civilisation. • Stealing from the Saracens: How Islamic Architecture Shaped Europe by Diana Darke is published by Hurst (£25).

          "bodyText": "Will Thursday 13 August 2020 be remembered as a pivotal moment in democracy’s relationship with digital technology? Because of the coronavirus outbreak, A-level and GCSE examinations had to be cancelled, leaving education authorities with a choice: give the kids the grades that had been predicted by their teachers, or use an algorithm. They went with the latter. The outcome was that more than one-third of results in England (35.6%) were downgraded by one grade from the mark issued by teachers. This meant that a lot of pupils didn’t get the grades they needed to get to their university of choice. More ominously, the proportion of private-school students receiving A and A* was more than twice as high as the proportion of students at comprehensive schools, underscoring the gross inequality in the British education system. What happened next was predictable but significant. A lot of teenagers, realising that their life chances had just been screwed by a piece of computer code, took to the streets. “Fuck the algorithm” became a popular slogan. And, in due course, the government caved in and reversed the results – though not before a lot of emotional distress and administrative chaos had been caused. And then Boris Johnson blamed the fiasco on “a mutant algorithm” which, true to form, was a lie. No mutation was involved. The algorithm did what it said on the tin. The only mutation was in the behaviour of the humans affected by its calculations: they revolted against what it did. And that was a genuine first – the only time I can recall when an algorithmic decision had been challenged in public protests that were powerful enough to prompt a government climbdown. In a world increasingly – and invisibly – regulated by computer code, this uprising might look like a promising precedent. But there are several good reasons, alas, for believing that it might instead be a blip. The nature of algorithms is changing, for one thing; their penetration into everyday life has deepened; and whereas the Ofqual algorithm’s grades affected the life chances of an entire generation of young people, the impact of the dominant algorithms in our unregulated future will be felt by isolated individuals in private, making collective responses less likely. According to the Shorter Oxford Dictionary, the word “algorithm” – meaning “a procedure or set of rules for calculation or problem-solving, now esp with a computer” – dates from the early 19th century, but it’s only comparatively recently that it has penetrated everyday discourse. Programming is basically a process of creating new algorithms or adapting existing ones. The title of the first volume, published in 1968, of Donald Knuth’s magisterial five-volume The Art of Computer Programming, for example, is “Fundamental Algorithms”. So in one way the increasing prevalence of algorithms nowadays simply reflects the ubiquity of computers in our daily lives, especially given that anyone who carries a smartphone is also carrying a small computer. The Ofqual algorithm that caused the exams furore was a classic example of the genre, in that it was deterministic and intelligible. It was a program designed to do a specific task: to calculate standardised grades for pupils based on information a) from teachers and b) about schools in the absence of actual examination results. It was deterministic in the sense that it did only one thing, and the logic that it implemented – and the kinds of output it would produce – could be understood and predicted by any competent technical expert who was allowed to inspect the code. (In that context, it’s interesting that the Royal Statistical Society offered to help with the algorithm but withdrew because it regarded the non-disclosure agreement it would have had to sign as unduly restrictive.) Classic algorithms are still everywhere in commerce and government (there’s one currently causing grief for Boris Johnson because it’s recommending allowing more new housing development in Tory constituencies than Labour ones). But they are no longer where the action is. Since the early 1990s – and the rise of the web in particular – computer scientists (and their employers) have become obsessed with a new genre of algorithms that enable machines to learn from data. The growth of the internet – and the intensive surveillance of users that became an integral part of its dominant business model – started to produce torrents of behavioural data that could be used to train these new kinds of algorithm. Thus was born machine-learning (ML) technology, often referred to as “AI”, though this is misleading – ML is basically ingenious algorithms plus big data. Machine-learning algorithms are radically different from their classical forebears. The latter take some input and some logic specified by the programmer and then process the input to produce the output. ML algorithms do not depend on rules defined by human programmers. Instead, they process data in raw form – for example text, emails, documents, social media content, images, voice and video. And instead of being programmed to perform a particular task they are programmed to learn to perform the task. More often than not, the task is to make a prediction or to classify something. This has the implication that ML systems can produce outputs that their creators could not have envisaged. Which in turn means that they are “uninterpretable” – their effectiveness is limited by the machines’ current inability to explain their decisions and actions to human users. They are therefore unsuitable if the need is to understand relationships or causality; they mostly work well where one only needs predictions. Which should, in principle, limit their domains of application – though at the moment, scandalously, it doesn’t. Machine-learning is the tech sensation du jour and the tech giants are deploying it in all their operations. When the Google boss, Sundar Pichai, declares that Google plans to have “AI everywhere”, what he means is “ML everywhere”. For corporations like his, the attractions of the technology are many and varied. After all, in the past decade, machine learning has enabled self-driving cars, practical speech recognition, more powerful web search, even an improved understanding of the human genome. And lots more. Because of its ability to make predictions based on observations of past behaviour, ML technology is already so pervasive that most of us encounter it dozens of times a day without realising it. When Netflix or Amazon tell you about interesting movies or goods, that’s ML being deployed as a “recommendation engine”. When Google suggests other search terms you might consider, or Gmail suggests how the sentence you’re composing might end, that’s ML at work. When you find unexpected but possibly interesting posts in your Facebook newsfeed, they’re there because the ML algorithm that “curates” the feed has learned about your preferences and interests. Likewise for your Twitter feed. When you suddenly wonder how you’ve managed to spend half an hour scrolling through your Instagram feed, the reason may be that the ML algorithm that curates it knows the kinds of images that grab you. The tech companies extol these services as unqualified public goods. What could possibly be wrong with a technology that learns what its users want and provides it? And at no charge? Quite a lot, as it happens. Take recommendation engines. When you watch a YouTube video you see a list of other videos that might interest you down the right-hand side of the screen. That list has been curated by a machine-learning algorithm that has learned what has interested you in the past, and also knows how long you’ve spent during those previous viewings (using time spent as a proxy for level of interest). Nobody outside YouTube knows exactly what criteria the algorithm is using to choose recommended videos, but because it’s basically an advertising company, one criterion will definitely be: “maximise the amount of time a viewer spends on the site”. In recent years there has been much debate about the impact of such a maximisation strategy. In particular, does it push certain kinds of user towards increasingly extremist content? The answer seems to be that it can. “What we are witnessing,” says Zeynep Tufekci, a prominent internet scholar, “is the computational exploitation of a natural human desire: to look ‘behind the curtain’, to dig deeper into something that engages us. As we click and click, we are carried along by the exciting sensation of uncovering more secrets and deeper truths. YouTube leads viewers down a rabbit hole of extremism, while Google racks up the ad sales.” What we have also discovered since 2016 is that the micro-targeting enabled by ML algorithms deployed by social media companies has weakened or undermined some of the institutions on which a functioning democracy depends. It has, for example, produced a polluted public sphere in which mis- and disinformation compete with more accurate news. And it has created digital echo-chambers and led people to viral conspiracy theories such as Qanon and malicious content orchestrated by foreign powers and domestic ideologues. The side-effects of machine-learning within the walled gardens of online platforms are problematic enough, but they become positively pathological when the technology is used in the offline world by companies, government, local authorities, police forces, health services and other public bodies to make decisions that affect the lives of citizens. Who should get what universal benefits? Whose insurance premiums should be heavily weighted? Who should be denied entry to the UK? Whose hip or cancer operation should be fast-tracked? Who should get a loan or a mortgage? Who should be stopped and searched? Whose children should get a place in which primary school? Who should get bail or parole, and who should be denied them? The list of such decisions for which machine-learning solutions are now routinely touted is endless. And the rationale is always the same: more efficient and prompt service; judgments by impartial algorithms rather than prejudiced, tired or fallible humans; value for money in the public sector; and so on. The overriding problem with this rosy tech “solutionism” is the inescapable, intrinsic flaws of the technology. The way its judgments reflect the biases in the data-sets on which ML systems are trained, for example – which can make the technology an amplifier of inequality, racism or poverty. And on top of that there’s its radical inexplicability. If a conventional old-style algorithm denies you a bank loan, its reasoning can be explained by examination of the rules embodied in its computer code. But when a machine-learning algorithm makes a decision, the logic behind its reasoning can be impenetrable, even to the programmer who built the system. So by incorporating ML into our public governance we are effectively laying the foundations of what the legal scholar Frank Pasquale warned against in his 2016 book The Black Box Society. In theory, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) gives people a right to be given an explanation for an output of an algorithm – though some legal experts are dubious about the practical usefulness of such a “right”. Even if it did turn out to be useful, though, the bottom line is that injustices inflicted by a ML system will be experienced by individuals rather than by communities. The one thing machine learning does well is “personalisation”. This means that public protests against the personalised inhumanity of the technology are much less likely – which is why last month’s demonstrations against the output of the Ofqual algorithm could be a one-off. In the end the question we have to ask is: why is the Gadarene rush of the tech industry (and its boosters within government) to deploy machine-learning technology – and particularly its facial-recognition capabilities – not a major public policy issue? The explanation is that for several decades ruling elites in liberal democracies have been mesmerised by what one can only call “tech exceptionalism” – ie the idea that the companies that dominate the industry are somehow different from older kinds of monopolies, and should therefore be exempt from the critical scrutiny that consolidated corporate power would normally attract. The only consolation is that recent developments in the US and the EU suggest that perhaps this hypnotic regulatory trance may be coming to an end. To hasten our recovery, therefore, a thought experiment might be helpful. Imagine what it would be like if we gave the pharmaceutical industry the leeway that we currently grant to tech companies. Any smart biochemist working for, say, AstraZeneca, could come up with a strikingly interesting new molecule for, say, curing Alzheimer’s. She would then run it past her boss, present the dramatic results of preliminary experiments to a lab seminar after which the company would put it on the market. You only have to think of the Thalidomide scandal to realise why we don’t allow that kind of thing. Yet it is exactly what the tech companies are able to do with algorithms that turn out to have serious downsides for society. What that analogy suggests is that we are still at the stage with tech companies that societies were in the era of patent medicines and snake oil. Or, to put it in a historical frame, we are somewhere between 1906, when the Pure Food and Drug Act was passed by the US Congress, and 1938, the year Congress passed the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which required that new drugs show safety before selling. Isn’t it time we got a move on? John Naughton chairs the advisory board of the new Minderoo Centre for Technology and Democracy at the University of Cambridge"

          "bodyText": "The last time I wrote about my shambolic back garden, an internet algorithm meant that the headline began popping up in the middle of other pieces of Guardian writing. “My Ugly Scrappy Plot Smacks of Personal Failure” showed up midway through another article I’d written about menopause. Below the line, comedians from Cardiff to Canberra suggested lubricating pessaries and vajazzles. This did little to help my sadness. The plot just north-east of my kitchen still resembled somewhere Nasa could stage a fake moon landing. And I still feared that time had got the better of me when it came to gaining green thumbs. I’d worked day and night for years to live in a home with space to grow things, and by my mid-40s that meant I had missed any opportunity to tell a petunia from a black-eyed Susan. Time had been against me almost every weekend since 2010, when tending to life admin overtook any urge to read about acidic top soil or study the “Chelsea chop” or how to mulch a bush. Time, time, time. I never had it. But then Covid-19 came and time, in my home at least, slowed into a sticky, trudging fog. March slid into April peppered by questions such as, “Have I eaten today or was that yesterday?”, and “Is it really fair to agree to push a nasopharyngeal swab this far into an 83-year-old man’s head, when dementia means he doesn’t even know there’s a pandemic?” Also, “Before I worked this hard all the time, what did I actually want, and will I ever go back to that way of life?” Somewhere around this stage I looked out of the window and noticed rosebuds growing. “The rose bush on the far left-hand side is about to bloom, I think,” I told my bloke Charles via WhatsApp. We were staying apart – theoretically – to keep me uninfected. “But there’s a frightening knotweed strangling the bush. And the pyracantha has gone feral: it’s all black and vicious at the bottom like something from a Grimms’ fairy tale.” I found clippers and gloves and began gingerly pruning. Soon after that, I was defiantly lopping. The pyracantha fought back, attacking me several times with its spikes. But as the pile of clippings grew, the pain felt curiously positive. OK, this is why people get into gardening, I realised. Pulling up weeds in the paving, I found, feels satisfying, like squeezing pimples. Adding a capful of stinky fertilising liquid to a sad geranium basket and waking up one morning to new shoots felt nothing short of a holy miracle. One week later, an old half-dead strawberry plant I’d chucked water at began to flourish. Then, incredibly, it grew berries, and soon long, green spindly stalks that a helpful man on a YouTube channel in Illinois explained were “runners” to nurture new plants. By this point, I was fully evangelical. “Next year,” I told people excitedly, “I’ll have a whole row of strawberry plants!” The roses on the now emancipated bushes began to bloom in a shade of vibrant New Romantic pink that I once bought a C&amp;A snood in. Nothing in the world was OK, I accepted; but there would be a next year in the garden. Now, as we slide into autumn, I should underline that I don’t have remotely the garden I dreamed of when I bought it in 2005. The one I’d hoped to grow one day, when time allowed, was a charmingly curated plot with a honeysuckle-draped trellis, coordinating hardy perennials, a verdant green Wimbledon-style lawn, buoyant fig trees and a pretty Heals garden set, where I’d drink pastis in a wide-brimmed hat. Instead, what I’ve achieved is some randomly chucked grow bags with rows of higgledy-piggledy radishes. Bags planted with Pink Fir Apple potatoes sit beside pots of coriander. Some tall sedums I planted grew wildly, then fell over under their own weight. A bag of tasteful wildflower seed that I scattered fetched up nothing more than dandelions and clover, which cheer me up each time I look at them. “I’ve grown designer weeds,” I tell people proudly. When lockdown relaxed, I joined the queue at B&amp;Q to buy their most tasteful terracotta pots, surrounded by other socially distancing amateur gardeners. The shelves of seedling compost and perlite were ransacked. I bought some bigger, more terrifying loppers, determined to tame the hedge at the front that had begun ensnaring the postman. I bought hanging baskets full of fuchsias, pinched them back, fed them, transforming the curb appeal of my house to emit “genteel lady in control of her life” rather than “woman planning to die alone surrounded by cats”. I even had a little shufty through some seed and bulb pre-order catalogues. Monty Don will never broadcast from my garden on a Friday evening; in fact, I think he would sit in the corner and have a little plaintive weep. But I don’t care. My small successes, in the face of so much sadness, make me very happy. Time has begun moving vaguely forwards. My ugly scrappy plot still smacks of personal failure, but I wouldn’t change a thing."

          "bodyText": "Guardian writers’ predicted position: 7th (NB: this is not necessarily Paul Doyle’s prediction but the average of our writers’ tips) Last season’s position: 5th Odds to win the league (via Oddschecker): 150-1 How Leicester do over the next eight months will be determined to an important extent by how they do over the next four weeks. They need to recruit well and start the season strongly. Leicester have a splendid team that can get even better. But, with others improving, they could go backwards if they do not adequately address shortcomings that led to last season’s weird anticlimax, when a better-than-predicted fifth-place finish was greeted like the output of a tawdry government’s algorithm. The sagging in the second half of the season – when they won four of their last 17 league matches and slunk out of both domestic cups – was down to a variety of factors, including a lack of depth and a lack of mettle when it mattered most. If the first of those problems is not solved by transfers then the second risks becoming worse. When Leicester are at their best, they are brilliant – not just glorious entertainers but infernal opponents (they won more tackles than any other team in the league last season) but when their confidence goes pop, they lose their snap and crackle. They should sign reinforcements to strengthen their ability to cope with the kind of injuries that sabotaged them, especially if they want to go far in the Europa League, a challenge they did not face last season. Overall, Brendan Rodgers used his squad well but when injuries and losses of form hit, he did not have as many options as he would have wanted, which is why the only managers to make fewer substitutions were Sean Dyche and Nuno Espírito Santo. No club can pre-empt every eventuality but here is a Leicester wish list, from the urgent to the desirable: a right winger, a centre-back, a striker, a creative midfielder. Last season’s major signing, Ayoze Pérez, had a mediocre campaign and seldom convinced on the right wing, especially after the injury to the wonderful full-back Ricardo Pereira, who is essential to Leicester’s defensive solidity and attacking potency. Demarai Gray has yet to find consistency; he may develop it but, at 24, he has yet to progress beyond the role of impact sub. An upgrade would be welcome. When everyone is in form, Leicester’s defence is excellent, and their goalkeeper among the best in the league. That should remain the case despite the sale of Ben Chilwell to Chelsea, especially now Timothy Castagne has joined from Atalanta and if Luke Thomas builds on the impressive potential he showed when filling in at the end of last season. James Justin also did well when called upon, without reaching Pereira’s heights. The middle of the defence is where an addition is needed most even though Harry Maguire was barely missed because Caglar Soyuncu stepped in superbly, at least until July’s ludicrous defeat at Bournemouth. Jonny Evans marred an otherwise pristine season with a sending-off on the final day and is suspended for the first three matches. Rodgers will probably have to improvise in defence for the opening games. That could mean action for Filip Benkovic, back after a loan at Bristol City. Even if Leicester get through the start without suffering further blows to their confidence, the purchase of at least one powerful centre-back would improve their chances of sustaining tightness and morale, especially if Rodgers decides to use the back-three formation that was practically forced on him towards the end of last season. Leicester’s attack will again be led by Jamie Vardy even though Rodgers’ predecessor, Claude Puel, suggested their evolution required developing other lines of attack. He was right but Rodgers pulled it off while also finding a way to help Vardy preserve his firepower and earn the Golden Boot and a new contract. Kelechi Iheanacho, who seemed next to useless a year ago, also improved and now represents a valuable attacking option. But Leicester would still benefit from buying a centre-forward, ideally one powerful in the air as well as dextrous on the ground. The strikers will be served – and the scoring duties shared – by a cast of wonderful creators, especially when James Maddison recovers from his hip injury. Harvey Barnes and Youri Tielemans cause damage in different ways, the former thrillingly explosive, the latter elegantly cutting. They, and Dennis Praet, will be expected to be more consistent, especially with the immaculate Wilfred Ndidi giving them a secure platform on which to perform. The manager On the touchline Rodgers tends to stand as close as possible to the action, often penning notes in his jotter or miming instructions to players. Known to commend fine play with a curious rapid handclap action that brings to mind a toy robot playing a mini-accordion. On Zoom Rodgers is among the league’s most engaging managers, usually happy to explain his decisions and elaborate on points of interest whether concerning his team or football in general. His takes on tactics or players’ attributes are almost always interesting. The key Absolutely no one is saying Vardy is the new Jack Southworth – who was 37 when he finished No 1 in the top flight’s scoring charts in 1894 – but, at 33, last season’s Golden Boot winner remains as precious as ever to Leicester, who gave him a new three-year contract in August. The owners Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha initially got involved as a shirt sponsor but in 2011 the Thai businessman took over the club, leading it first to promotion and then to its greatest victory. Following Vichai’s tragic death in a helicopter crash at the stadium in 2018, his son Aiyawatt has worked hard to perpetuate the legacy and make the club’s success sustainable. Young blood The sale of Chilwell could mean more opportunities for the 19-year-old Thomas, an academy graduate who made his debut in July. He was so composed and authoritative in that, and his two subsequent appearances, that he was awarded a new contract in August. New blood Castagne played chiefly on the right for Atalanta but the Belgian international also excels on the left, either as full-back or wing-back. His versatility will give Rodgers welcome options and his speed and intensity make him ideal for the dynamic attacking style the manager wants. Kit story Leicester changed colours often in their early years as they sought an identity distinct from their city’s rugby club. Their imagination did not take them far, as they alighted on white shorts and “Cambridge blue”. Those have been their home colours for a century, except for 1972-73, when an executive brainwave spawned an all-white kit modelled on Real Madrid. Notes from an empty stadium In normal times the King Power is one of the league’s more animated grounds, not just thanks to the fans but also the bands and entertainment outside. There is none of that now, and the absence weighs. Euros vision England are not exactly struggling for explosive wide players but if Barnes, a fast and thrilling 22-year-old, develops more consistency he could make an irresistible case for inclusion in Gareth Southgate’s squad."

          "bodyText": "Nonfiction This autumn will be like no other in the world of books. It’s always a busy season, but Covid-19 postponements mean that in September alone, 16,443 titles will be published in the UK (including ebooks and audio): 76% of these are nonfiction. Publishers are worried that much will get lost, but one of the surefire hits is Caitlin Moran’s memoir More Than a Woman (Ebury). Coming a decade after the mega-selling How to Be a Woman, this mid-life book follows, with Moran’s irresistible comic candour, a day in the life of a woman in her early 40s as she deals with ageing parents, divorcing friends, teenagers having “micro-breakdowns”, greying hair, “maintenance shags” and the tyranny of the to-do list. Other writers have covered this ground, but very few are as funny. As £100m was spent on cookery books in the UK last year, publishers will be putting much financial faith in new offerings by established favourites, among them Ottolenghi Flavour by Yotam Ottolenghi (Ebury, September), Nadiya Bakes by Nadiya Hussain (Michael Joseph, September) and Cook, Eat, Repeat by Nigella Lawson (Chatto, October). Despite endless predictions of the decline of the celebrity memoir, the book industry will also be relying on the smiles prompted by Once Upon a Tyne: Celebrating 30 Years Together on Telly by Ant &amp; Dec (Sphere): nostalgia offers comfort in anxious times. Rather different is the powerful Just Ignore Him by QI star Alan Davies (Little Brown), which looks back to a dark childhood. The memoir by punk poet John Cooper Clarke, Bard of Salford, entitled I Wanna Be Yours (Picador, October), is perhaps one of very few books to feature both Nico and Bernard Manning. Rupert Everett’s first two volumes of memoir had a gossipy, bittersweet brilliance, so the latest, To The End of the World: Travels with Oscar Wilde (Little Brown, October), about his decade making the film The Happy Prince, is eagerly awaited. Dollyites will celebrate the arrival of Dolly Parton’s Songteller: My Life in Lyrics (Hodder, November), while the two major football memoirs are by contrasting figures in the game: Jamie Redknapp, who has written Me, Family and the Making of a Footballer (Headline, October) and Arsène Wenger, whose account of his 22 years of managing Arsenal appears under the title My Life in Red and White (Weidenfeld, October). In more writerly vein, the novelist and critic Anthony Quinn has written a love-letter to the Premier League title winners in Klopp: My Liverpool Romance (Faber, November). Mary Gaitskill’s sharpness and singular honesty are in evidence in Lost Cat (Daunt, November), a book-length essay about loss, safety and fear that centres on her fostering of two siblings. Orwell prize winner Kate Clanchy has written How to Grow Your Own Poem (Picador, September), an encouragement to write verse; in similar vein, Clive James’s last book The Fire of Joy (Picador, October) is a set of personal, quintessentially Jamesian commentaries on 80 of his favourite poems. John F Kennedy and Boris Johnson are among the subjects of this season’s stand-out biographies. JFK: Volume 1: 1917-1956 by Fredrik Logevall (Viking) draws on original material, including Oval Office tapes and interviews with Jackie Kennedy. It is a mere 18 months since Tom Bower’s life of Jeremy Corbyn, a book judged by one review to be “catastrophically” guilty of distorting the truth: headlines are nevertheless guaranteed for his latest effort, Boris Johnson: The Gambler (WH Allen, October). Less controversial will be Jasper Rees’s Let’s Do It: The Authorised Biography of Victoria Wood (Trapeze, October), which draws on the much-loved comedian’s personal archive and interviews with friends such as Julie Walters, Dawn French and Celia Imrie. A revealing portrayal of the stubborn-man-behind-the-genius is expected from Stephen Hawking: A Memoir of Friendship and Physics, by his long-term collaborator Leonard Mlodinow (Allen Lane, September). Hermione Lee’s Tom Stoppard: A Life (Faber, October) will come out while Stoppard’s latest play, Leopoldstadt, is still stalled by Covid-19. Ideas and movements that change the world are reflected on bookshop shelves, and books help to effect the change. Following the Black Lives Matter protests, publishers are more alert than ever to the need to amplify BAME voices in both fiction and non-fiction. Loud Black Girls: 20 Black Women Writers Ask: What’s Next? (4th Estate, October), edited by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené, the authors of hit book and podcast Slay in Your Lane, ranges from Marvel’s Black Panther to “how we can teach our daughters to own their voices”. Later in the season, the journalist Kenya Hunt is bringing out Girl: Essays on Black Womanhood (HQ, November). It includes a valuable piece on the meanings of the term “woke”, a favourite of the rightwing press. The BLM movement has also given a sharper edge to various “history wars”, especially the study of the British empire. Michael Taylor’s excellent The Interest: How the British Establishment Resisted the Abolition of Slavery (Bodley Head, November) issues a warning against complacent narratives of British imperial history, and African Europeans by Olivette Otele, professor of the history of slavery at Bristol University (Hurst, October), charts human movement from one continent to another over two millennia. Kick in the Belly: Women, Slavery and Resistance by Stella Dadzie (Verso, October) considers the multiple ways women were involved in slave resistance. It is unclear to what degree Sasha Swire’s Diary of an MP’s Wife: Inside and Outside Power (Little, Brown, September) is an act of rebellion but it is, by all accounts, amusing, indiscreet and causing some consternation in parliament. A journalist and parliamentary researcher, Swire has for over 20 years been married to Hugo Swire, who was the Conservative MP for East Devon from 2001 to 2019. During these two decades, she has also been keeping a secret diary about life as a political plus-one, with lots of details of mansplaining and mixing with Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg and David Cameron. Essex Girls: A Defence of Profane and Opinionated Women Everywhere by Sarah Perry (Profile, October) is a polemic that makes room for both Kim Kardashian and Harriet Martineau. The feminist and founder of the Everyday Sexism Project Laura Bates has written Men Who Hate Women (Simon &amp; Schuster), a fierce response to misogyny and the incel movement, while Rachel Holmes follows her acclaimed life of Eleanor Marx with Sylvia Pankhurst: Natural Born Rebel (Bloomsbury, September). In a less conventional form of nonfiction, Karrie Fransman and Jonathan Plackett have taken original versions of 12 fairytales and switched all the genders, via computer algorithm: Gender Swapped Fairy Tales (Faber, November) is bound to provoke debate. The autumn will also offer another chance to consider Hilary Mantel’s widely misunderstood feminist critique of the royal family – the Duke of Edinburgh is said to have approved of Kate Middleton because she would “breed in some height” – in Mantel Pieces: Royal Bodies and Other Writing from the London Review of Books (4th Estate, October). With the pandemic, healthcare and “care” generally have assumed a position right at the centre of our lives. Christie Watson, who went back to hospital wards during the crisis, follows her acclaimed The Language of Kindness: A Nurse’s Story with The Courage to Care: A Call for Compassion (Chatto, September). Labours of Love: A Crisis of Care by Madeleine Bunting (Granta, October) is the result of five years of conversations with charity workers, social workers, in-home carers and parents, in an exploration of care as “the hidden glue that binds us together”. Investigations into dark and difficult areas of society give a presence to people who usually remain invisible. Journalist Maeve McClenaghan’s No Fixed Abode: Life and Death Among the UK’s Forgotten Homeless (Picador, September) is a vital exposé of the crisis on British streets. Another form of “invisible labour” is uncovered in Nick Duerden’s Dishing the Dirt: The Hidden Lives of House Cleaners (Canbury, September). Many of his interviewees are immigrants who came to the UK dreaming of a better life, and ended up draining buckets of bleach. They have hair-raising stories to tell about their employers: “Naturally and reflexively,” the author says, cleaners “are cultural anthropologists”. “Now more than ever before, we need to look long and hard at how we view and interact with the natural world. We’re living through the world’s sixth great extinction, one caused by us.” Helen Macdonald, introducing the essays in Vesper Flights (Cape), conveys one reason nature writing continues to flourish in nonfiction lists: every book in its way engages not only with how we live and balance our lives but with environmental crisis. Her previous work H is for Hawk established Macdonald as a brilliant practitioner of nature-memoir; this new book cautions against viewing the natural world as a ‘mirror of ourselves, reflecting our own world-view and our own needs, thoughts and hopes’. It collects together light, lovely, personal essays, many of which recall the author’s discovery of birds and plants in childhood. Merlin Sheldrake’s Entangled Life: How Fungi Make Our Worlds, Change Our Minds and Shape Our Futures (Bodley Head) has already been hailed as a fascinating breakthrough in natural history. David Attenborough reflects on the environmental emergency in A Life on Our Planet: My Witness Statement and Vision for the Future (Ebury, October), while in The Corona Crash: How the Pandemic Will Change Capitalism (Verso, October), Grace Blakeley asserts the need for Covid-19 to be a global wake-up call, and makes the case for a Green New Deal. High-profile, bestselling books have played a vital role in focusing opposition to the Trump presidency, from Michael Wolff’s Fire and Fury to the recent broadsides fired by John Bolton and Mary Trump. Rage, Bob Woodward’s follow-up to his 2018 White House expose Fear (Simon &amp; Schuster, September) is no doubt timed to influence voters in the November election. Other big-name political books include What Is at Stake Now by Mikhail Gorbachev (Polity, September), an exploration of global instability and renewed threats to peace, and Collateral Damage: Britain, America and Europe in the Age of Trump by former British ambassador to the US Kim Darroch (William Collins, September). Behind the Enigma: The Authorised History of GCHQ by John Ferris (Bloomsbury, 20 October) is the first authorised account of Britain’s most secretive intelligence agency, written with unprecedented access to classified archives. Two other appealing works of history also involve secrecy. Chris Bryant’s The Glamour Boys: The Secret Story of the Rebels who Fought for Britain to Defeat Hitler (Bloomsbury, 12 November) rescues the reputation of a group of gay and bisexual MPs who visited Germany in the early 1930s and then spoke out against appeasement. Jack Macnamara, Ronnie Cartland, Victor Cazalet and others were accused of warmongering: Neville Chamberlain had them followed, harassed, spied on and derided in the press. Written out of history for decades because of their sexuality, Bryant records their heroic wartime exploits. Ben Macintyre’s latest historical pageturner is Agent Sonya: Lover, Mother, Soldier, Spy (Viking, September) about Ursula Kuczynski, the German communist who spied for the USSR and was the handler of nuclear scientist Klaus Fuchs. Hidden realities of a different kind lie beneath the story of Kate Summerscale’s The Haunting of Alma Fielding: A True Ghost Story (Bloomsbury Circus, October), which delves into the 1930s case of the “Croydon Poltergeist”, investigated by Nandor Fodor, chief ghost hunter for the International Institute for Psychical Research. Esteemed librarian Richard Ovenden’s Burning the Books: A History of Knowledge Under Attack (John Murray) began life as an article in which he deplored the destruction of the official Windrush records. It journeys from ancient Mesopotamia to Nazi bonfires and the deletion of Trump’s tweets, identifying repositories of knowledge destroyed by those who set out to “deny the truth and eradicate the past”. Two noteworthy celebrations of books are Dear Reader: The Comfort and Joy of Books by Cathy Rentzenbrink (Picador, September) and Ex Libris: 100+ Books to Read and Reread by Michiko Kakutani (William Collins, October). But for sheer enthusiasm, it will be hard to beat Martin Latham, bookseller at Waterstones Canterbury for three decades. His The Bookseller’s Tale (Particular) is a collection of tales about famous writers and bibliophiles, but above all a love letter to pages between covers. And now that his shop is returning to something like normal, with the huge tide of autumn titles washing in, he will once again “see customers stroking books, opening them to smell them with closed eyes” and even “giving them a post-purchase hug”. Fiction First up in the flood of autumn fiction are the last two unpublished novels from the Booker longlist: Gabriel Krauze’s Who They Was (4th Estate), a hard-hitting debut set amid London gang culture, and US author Diane Cook’s The New Wilderness (Oneworld), in which a mother and child escape a polluted metropolis for a dangerous experiment in living. While the Booker list has been rich in new voices, several literary grandees return in September: Inside Story (Jonathan Cape); an autofiction from Martin Amis – “almost certainly my last long novel” – delivers on its title, with frank portraits of friendships with Saul Bellow and Christopher Hitchens, squirming accounts of sexual escapades from earlier life, and firm instructions on prose style for the would-be writer. There’s also the rare treat of a new novel from Marilynne Robinson, whose Jack (Virago) revisits the world of Gilead for a story of interracial love after the second world war. Yiyun Li delves into family tragedy in Must I Go (Hamish Hamilton), while Rose Tremain’s Islands of Mercy (Chatto) ranges from 19th-century Bath to Borneo via Paris and Dublin exploring colonialism, self-determination and the nature of desire. “I began writing the novel in 2018, long before the current pandemic,” Don DeLillo has said of The Silence (Picador, October). “I started with a vision of empty streets in Manhattan …” Covid-19 casts extra resonance on this slim disquisition on catastrophe, in which a group gathers in a New York apartment to watch the 2022 Super Bowl – and then the world goes dark. Elena Ferrante continues her key themes of female adolescence and Neapolitan life in The Lying Life of Adults (translated by Ann Goldstein, Europa), an atmospheric portrait of a novelist in the making. Andrew O’Hagan considers male friendship in Mayflies (Faber), as memories of youthful camaraderie in 1980s Scotland are refracted through experience and loss in the decades that follow. Hari Kunzru’s Red Pill (Scribner) is a stylish examination of far right culture and the roots of our contemporary chaos. Jonathan Coe promises some much needed escapism in Mr Wilder and Me (Viking, November), in which a young woman works for the Hollywood director on a Greek island during the summer of 77. Cinema is also at the centre of William Boyd’s Trio (Viking, October), which goes back to the summer of 68 for a love triangle at a time of incendiary global politics. Two comic chroniclers of romance offer new perspectives on the complications of love: Nick Hornby’s Just Like You (Viking, September) features an age-gap, opposites-attract relationship between a divorced teacher and an aspiring DJ, while Roddy Doyle’s Love (Cape, October) reveals an old secret. There are second novels from young writers getting into their stride: The Death of Vivek Oji by Akwaeke Emezi (Faber) explores a young Nigerian’s gender identity, while in Sophie Mackintosh’s dystopia Blue Ticket (Hamish Hamilton) motherhood is enforced or forbidden by a patriarchal lottery. Exit Management by Naomi Booth (Dead Ink, September) is a timely, original dissection of class and desperation in Brexit London; in The First Woman by Kintu author Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi (Oneworld, October), a young woman comes of age in 1970s Uganda. Sayaka Murata has written many novels in Japanese, but the gloriously quirky Convenience Store Woman made her name in the UK; Earthlings (translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori, Granta, September) features another heroine who refuses to conform. Iraqi-born Hassan Blasim follows searing short-story collections with his first novel God 99 (translated by Jonathan Wright, Comma, Nov ember), in which an Iraqi refugee tracks down the real stories behind Europe’s “refugee crisis”. There is some interesting lane-switching from Sarah Crossan, known for her brilliant YA verse novels: Here is the Beehive (Bloomsbury) brings the same form to an adult tale of love, betrayal and loss. Michel Faber, meanwhile, branches out into children’s fiction with Narnia-esque fable D: A Tale of Two Worlds (Doubleday, September). Philip Pullman’s Serpentine (Penguin, October), a previously unseen story of Lyra in the Arctic written before his current trilogy, will be gobbled up by fans. In the world of crime and thrillers, Cormoran Strike investigates a cold case in the latest hefty volume from JK Rowling’s alter ego Robert Galbraith, Troubled Blood (Sphere, September), while John Banville writes crime under his own name for the first time in Snow (Faber, September), a typically elegant country house mystery. Secrets are duly uncovered in an Irish village in Tana French’s The Searcher (Viking, November); in The Thursday Murder Club (Viking), set in an upscale retirement complex, Pointless co-host Richard Osman pulls off that rare feat, a celebrity novel as likable as its author. Stuart Turton won the Costa first novel award for his audaciously high-concept The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle; his follow-up The Devil and the Dark Water (Raven, October) looks set to be a deliciously dark thriller aboard a 17th-century sea voyage from the Dutch East Indies. SF guru Kim Stanley Robinson’s recent fiction has focused on climate change; in The Ministry for the Future (Orbit, October) he imagines the tumultuous decades to come. Notable short story collections include Daddy by The Girls author Emma Cline (Chatto), spooky tales about the horrors of technology from John Lanchester in Reality and Other Stories (Faber, October), and eccentric snapshots of the west of Ireland in That Old Country Music by Kevin Barry (Canongate, October). With so many hundreds of books, it’s hard even to scratch the surface, but one debut to look out for is Canadian prizewinner Reproduction by Ian Williams (Dialogue, September), an enjoyably offbeat family saga set in polyglot Toronto. Meanwhile, Australian Laura Jean McKay gets her first UK publication with The Animals in That Country (Scribe, September), a powerful, uncanny tale of a flu pandemic that allows humans to understand the language of animals. Finally, two one-of-a-kind novels that remind us of fiction’s power to take us to another world and expand our understanding of this one. When We Cease to Understand the World by Benjamín Labatut (translated by Adrian Nathan West, Pushkin) describes itself as “fiction based on real events”; it illuminates unexpected and often darkly ironic connections between scientific discoveries, and showcases the minds seeking to pierce the mysterious heart of mathematics. Piranesi by Susanna Clarke (Bloomsbury, September) performs a very different kind of magic from her beloved Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell: austere, otherworldly and profound, it’s best embarked on absolutely fresh."

          "bodyText": "In the wake of the school exam results fiasco, the prime minister told a roomful of schoolchildren: “I am afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm.” This sounds like a peculiarly unexciting 1950s sci-fi B-movie in which an evil artificial intelligence busies itself exclusively with causing chaos in teenage education, but where exactly does “mutant” come from? Originally from “mutare” the Latin verb “to change”, it arrived in English at the turn of the 20th century via the Dutch evolutionary biologist Hugo de Vries, and his book translated as “The Mutation Theory”. On this theory, new species formed not gradually (on the classical Darwinian view) but suddenly, through the spontaneous appearance of “mutants” with entirely different characteristics. Algorithms do not breed, of course, but they could potentially mutate due to copying errors. In this case, though, the exam-marking “algorithm” (or mathematical procedure) was not some supercomputer deep-learning system gone rogue, or even a list of sums copied down wrong: it was a policy designed by humans, for which the prime minister wished to take no responsibility. Coincidentally, perhaps, US English offers a pertinent sense of “mutant” that means “someone regarded as having antisocial or sociopathic tendencies”. • Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."

          "bodyText": "Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has warned Conservative MPs that some tax rises may be needed to “correct” the public finances after the coronavirus crisis. But he also said he was not proposing “a horror show of tax rises with no end in sight”. (See 3.01pm.) He spoke out after days of media speculation about what will be in his autumn budget, with some reports claiming that the tax burden may have to rise by £30bn. The crisis has pushed the national debt above £2tn for the first time, and in July the Office for Budget Responsibility put the budget deficit (the annual shortfall, rather than the total historic debt owed by the UK) at £128bn. Although the budget is still many weeks away, an intense debate is already under way in the Conservative party as to what should be in it. Earlier Thérèse Coffey, the work and pensions secretary, suggested Sunak should be cutting taxes, not raising them. Labour has said it does not support tax increases now. (See 1.42pm.) The government has reimposed lockdown restrictions on half a million people in Greater Manchester just 12 hours after they were lifted, after a rise in infections. Ironically, the announcement was made during PMQs, just after Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, and Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, taunted Johnson about the many coronavirus U-turns he had already performed. Labour has responded furiously after Boris Johnson accused Keir Starmer of complicity in tolerance for the IRA, pointing to the prime minister’s acceptance of the former Brexit party MEP Claire Fox as a peer despite her prior support for the IRA’s Warrington bomb. Boris Johnson has doubled down on his refusal to meet a group of families bereaved by coronavirus, claiming the group are in litigation against the government to bring about an independent inquiry into the handling of the pandemic. Ofqual’s senior leadership told MPs that Ofqual should not be blamed for the fiasco that engulfed this summer’s exams in England, and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of causing the weekend of chaos that followed the publication of A-level results. The EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he is “worried and disappointed” over the UK’s approach to the talks, fuelling fears that the UK will leave the bloc in January without a deal. A data specialist recruited to the civil service following Dominic Cummings’ call for “weirdos and misfits” to work for the UK government was sacked recently after posting on social media that police should use live rounds against Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the Guardian can reveal. Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary in charge of the newly merged Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, has moved to quash reports that the government will ditch its statutory commitment to spend 0.7% of gross national income (GNI) on aid. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, is under intense pressure to quit after senior MSPs said the party faced “catastrophic defeat” in next year’s Holyrood elections. That’s all from me for today. But our coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. The government has updated its daily coronavirus dashboard. Here are the key figures. A further 10 UK coronavirus deaths have been recorded, taking the headline total to 41,514. But this chart only records people who have died within 28 days of a coronavirus tests, and so it significantly understates the true number of coronavirus deaths in the UK. Taking into account all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, there have been 57,310 deaths in the UK. (See 11.56am.) A further 1,508 coronavirus cases in the UK have been recorded. This confirms that, overall, case numbers are still rising. These are from my colleague Peter Walker, who is outside the Commons committee room where Boris Johnson is addressing the Conservative backbench 1922 Committee. Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, has said talk of taxes going up is “pure speculation”, Sky’s Aubrey Allegretti reports. In Westminster politics, the word “speculation” is sometimes used to mean real, actual speculation. But more often it is used as a piece of Whitehall-speak, a form of non-denial denial, to refer to something that is actually planned, or at least anticipated, but that cannot yet be confirmed. The Commons education committee has published a transcript of its hearing this morning with the Ofqual chair, Roger Taylor, and his colleagues. There is a link here. (It normally takes a bit longer for committee transcripts to materialise.) A data specialist recruited to the civil service following Dominic Cummings’ call for “weirdos and misfits” to work for the UK government was sacked recently after posting on social media that police should use live rounds against Black Lives Matter demonstrators, the Guardian can reveal. The full story is here. This week’s Guardian Politics Weekly podcast is out. Jessica Elgot chats to Peter Walker after the first prime minister’s questions following the summer recess. MPs tell us about their thoughts as they head back to Westminster, and Anne Alexander explains why UK democracy requires more black political journalists. It’s here. The UK risks crashing out of the EU without a trade deal by refusing to compromise and break the deadlock in post-Brexit negotiations, Michel Barnier has warned. As PA Media reports, Brussels’ chief negotiator said that he was “worried and disappointed” after his counterpart in Downing Street, David Frost, did not make any concessions to end the impasse during informal talks. Barnier reiterated that a deal must be brokered by the “strict deadline” of the end of next month in order to have it in place for the close of the transition period on 31 December. At an online event hosted by Dublin’s Institute of International and European Affairs thinktank, Barnier said: We need a breakthrough, we need to move. If the UK wants a deal with us and a fair agreement for a zero-tariff, zero-quota access for British access to our market of 450 million consumers then they will have to move and it is their choice, it is their responsibility. We are ready to make fair and constructive compromise but not at the detriment of the EU. Here is a fuller version of the quote from Boris Johnson when he told Conservative MPs from the 2019 intake that the political situation was going to get tougher. (See 3.25pm.) Johnson said: I know it’s been tough. I’ve got to warn you it’s about to get tougher. The waters are about to get choppier. But we are going to deal with it. And when we build back better and faster and greener we will create a platform for the dynamism and innovation and enterprise to flourish and to create new jobs. He also told them the Conservative party should “speak out loud and proud” for the UK’s history, amid an “orgy of national embarrassment”. He said: I do think this country is going through an orgy of national embarrassment about some of the things that other people around the world love most about us. People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections. It’s crazy for us to go around trying to censor it. It’s absolutely absurd and I think we should speak out loud and proud for the UK and our history. Johnson was clearly referring to the row about whether Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory should be sung at the Last Night of the Proms. But the row was to a large extent confected by the media, because few people were calling for the songs to be dropped, and the BBC said its original decision to drop the singing (but not the tunes) was for Covid-related reasons. Now the BBC has said the words will be sung after all. NHS England has recorded seven further coronavirus hospital deaths. Three were in the Midlands, two in the north-west and one in the south-east. The details are here. In Scotland one further death has been reported. And Northern Ireland has also recorded one further death. There have been no further deaths in Wales. There have been at least 16 confirmed cases of Covid-19 involving three different parties who flew back to Cardiff on a TUI flight (no 6215) from Zante on 25 August, Public Health Wales (PHW) has said. Seven out of the 16 were infectious at the time of flying. As a result, PHW is advising that all passengers on this flight are considered close contacts and must self-isolate. Dr Robin Howe, incident director for the Covid-19 outbreak response at PHW, said: Our investigations into a number of cases of coronavirus have indicated that a lack of social distancing, in particular by a minority of the 20-30 year age group, has resulted in the spread of the virus to other groups of people. I would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 were they to test positive, should they pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious and even fatal. Eighty people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Wirral over the past week, many of them young women, according to the local authority. Julie Webster, director of public health for Wirral council, said: “This is a big increase, from the two cases a day we were seeing at the beginning of August.” There is no particular source for therise, with cases linked to pubs, gyms and care homes, she said. There has been a noticeable increase in young women under the age of 30 testing positive, as well as people in the same households, said Webster. Wirral’s infection rate is now 24.7 per 100,000 people — which puts it higher than many other places on the government’s “watch list” of areas giving cause for concern. In his address to Conservative MPs from the 2019 intake (see 3.01pm) Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, said that economic competence was the party’s key advantage over Labour, a nod to how the party has been losing ground to Keir Starmer’s party in the polls. He told MPs, many of whom have slim majorities in traditionally Labour areas, that there would be a clear difference on tax between the Conservatives and Labour. He said: We cannot, will not and must not surrender our position as the party of economic competence and sound finance. If we argue instead that there is no limit to what we can spend, that we can simply borrow our way out of any hole then what is the difference between us and Labour? He also stressed his belief in a “dynamic low-tax economy” – a phrase designed to counters rumours that the Treasury is planning significant hikes in corporation tax, fuel duty, capital gains tax or self-employed national insurance contributions, all likely to be opposed by different wings of the rank-and-file party. The former Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, has expressed concern that a rise in support for independence in Scotland and England could lead to a “chaotic” breakup of the UK. Jones, who served as first minister until 2018, said Brexit could result in Scotland and England breaking away and accused the UK government of not understanding the pressure on the union. Speaking as he launched his biography, Not Just Politics, Jones said: I don’t think the UK will be sustainable without Scotland. My great fear is that if Scotland goes, there’s no reason why England might not also leave the UK. I worry about the possible rise in English nationalism that would lead to that. Wales might find itself in a situation where both England and Scotland have left. This is a scenario that a few years ago would have been unlikely in the extreme. With Brexit and with the possibility of Scotland leaving the UK all manner of strange things become possible. We see a rise in English identify as opposed to British identity. My fear is that if Scotland went, it would cause a backlash in England that would lead some people to say: ‘Why can’t we in England be independent. Why are we stuck with the Welsh and Northern Ireland?’ If Scotland leaves, what do you call the country that is left? What flag do you have? Everything that we have known starts to unravel. Jones said a breakup of the union would cause financial hardship in Wales and difficulties on both sides of the England/Wales border. “It leads to chaos, it’s in nobody’s interests,” he said. The Bank of England’s executive director for financial stability, strategy and risk has told the Treasury committee it simply isn’t possible for all office workers to return to their desks yet. Alex Brazier told MPs that public health worries – and the challenge of complying with public health guidelines – meant the return to work would be gradual. Brazier was asked about the reluctance of major financial institutions to bring employees back to the office. He explained there were two reasons: The first is people have a caution about the public health issues. I feel safe coming to work, but I quite understand why many people might not. Public transport capacity is a related factor there … [Secondly] it’s not possible to use office space, particularly in central London and dense places like that, with the intensity that we used to use it. It’s not possible to bring lots of people back very suddenly. Brazier added that we should expect “a more phased return”, depending on the public health outcomes we see in coming weeks and months. There is more from the Treasury committee hearing, which is still going on, on our business live blog. It’s here. And, according to the Times’s Steven Swinford, Boris Johnson told Tory MPs that the political situation was going to get tougher for them before it got better when he addressed the 2019 intake. Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, have both been speaking to Conservative MPs from the 2019 intake this afternoon. Steve Back, a photographer who covers Downing Street and who tweets as @PoliticalPics, managed to get a picture of Sunak’s speaking notes as he was leaving No 11. This is what the note says. We will need to do some difficult things, but I promise you, if we trust one another, we will be able to overcome the short term challenges. Now this doesn’t mean a horror show of tax rises with no end in sight. But it does mean treating the British people with respect, being honest with them about the challenges we face, and showing them how we plan to correct out public finances and give our country the dynamic, low-tax economy we all want to see. This is what we will deliver for you. Perhaps the note was left exposed inadvertently, although this happens so often now that it must be quite likely that Sunak wanted this quote to go public. Sunak is due to deliver a budget in the autumn, and for the last few days now Conservative-leaning papers have been full of stories about possible tax increases that the government might introduce. “Treasury officials are drawing up plans for a £30bn tax raid on the wealthy, businesses, pensions and foreign aid — to plug a hole in the nation’s finances caused by the coronavirus crisis,” the Sunday Times reported. Fuel duty and national insurance for the self-employed have also been identified as areas where taxes may rise. It is hard to know how many of these proposals are being seriously considered, and how many are being briefed by people hoping a newspaper backlash will lead to them being ruled out, but Sunak’s note suggest some tax increases or spending cuts are in the pipeline. Interestingly, Labour is ruling out tax increases at this point. (See 1.42pm.) But whether the opposition would in practice vote against, say, a proposal to increase corporation tax (an option Sunak is considering, according to the Sunday Times, and a Labour manifesto policy in 2019), is another matter. UPDATE: Treasury sources have confirmed that that this was Sunak’s speaking note for the meeting, and that he did deliver words along these lines. But it was a meeting of Conservative MPs from the 2019 intake, not a meeting of the 1922 Committee as the first paragraph of this post originally said. (It’s now been corrected.) Earlier, when I covered what Boris Johnson said in response to the point of order from Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster, complaining about No 10 blaming Blackford for leaking the location of Johnson’s Scottish holiday (see 12.43pm), I did not quote what Johnson said in full, and I missed a section that made Blackford’s complaint sound a bit less justified than it otherwise did. That was not intentional, I just missed the full quote. But here it is. In response to Blackford, Johnson said: However, I just draw his attention … to a tweet by a chap called Torcuil Crichton on August 17 saying: ‘Ferocious midge count in Wester Ross tonight, I hear. Must be bad if you’re fair-skinned and camping’ to which an account, which purports to be (Mr Blackford) but I’m sure it isn’t because of what he’s just said, says ‘I wonder if an education at Eton stands you in good stead for these blighters’. Anyway, I’m happy to accept his assurances and protestations and I think we should leave it at that. This certainly looks like a reference to Johnson, although it does not in any way prove that Blackford revealed the location of Johnson’s holiday home to journalists. Wester Ross is not exactly a small place. The chair of Scottish Labour, Cara Hilton, has given her backing to party leader, Richard Leonard, after three MSPs called for him to stand down after Labour’s support plummeted in the polls. Hilton urged the party to rally behind Leonard and chided the three rebels, James Kelly, Daniel Johnson and Jenny Marra, for undermining him so close to a Scottish parliamentary election. With party sources adamant Leonard would remain in post, Hilton tweeted that the party should be “100% focused” on fighting the Scottish National party and the Tories. Earlier Rhoda Grant, a Labour list MSP for Highlands and Islands, also tweeted her support. She said: “The crisis facing our country requires bold thinking and it requires a united Scottish Labour party, under the leadership of Richard Leonard, fighting for the real change we need.” Leonard was teased about the revolt by Nicola Sturgeon during first minister’s questions after she had first acknowledged Labour could claim credit for the national care service she plans to create. Asked about a review on policy on care homes during the coronavirus pandemic, she said that would report in January, but added: “I’m not sure whether Richard Leonard will still be standing in his place by then, we will wait and see.” The deaths of thousands of people in England and Wales may have been hastened at the height of the coronavirus pandemic although their deaths were not registered as Covid-19 related, my colleague Pamela Duncan reports. More than 96,000 non-Covid-19 deaths were registered between 7 March and 1 May 2020, 12,774 more than the five-year average, or 15.3%. A further 33,602 Covid-19 deaths occurred in the same period. Her full story is here. Turning back to this morning’s evidence to the Commons education committee from Ofqual (see 11.23am), Labour says Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, should now explain to MPs why he tried to blame the exams regulator for the grading debacle. In a statement Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said: The evidence given by Ofqual today has raised serious questions about Gavin Williamson’s role in this summer’s exam fiasco. Gavin Williamson has repeatedly tried to blame Ofqual and officials for the crisis over exams. It is now clear he was responsible. Williamson must urgently come to the Commons to offer an explanation and to take responsibility for his own incompetence. Ireland has adjusted its exam grading system to avoid repeating the UK’s A-level results fiasco. The government this week decided to leave teachers’ estimated grades largely unchanged and to not rely on a school’s previous performance in the calculated grades process. The decisions will leave the estimated grades of 79% of Leaving Certificate students unchanged, according to initial data from the department of education. Some 17% will have have grades reduced, in most cases by one grade, and 4% will have grades increased. The 60,000 students are to receive their final results next Monday, after which college places will be allocated. Teachers awarded more than twice the number of the top H1 grades than would have been expected in normal Leaving Cert results, producing grade inflation, but Irish officials refrained from major intervention after the UK’s bungled attempt to produce results that conformed with previous years. At first minister’s questions in Edinburgh Nicola Sturgeon emphasised that new indoor gathering restrictions in west of Scotland were “targeted, necessary and proportionate”, explaining “the data so far suggests that transmission is happening mainly in people’s homes”. Some concerns have been raised about confusing messaging, given that people are still allowed to meet family and friends outdoors or in cafes, but not in their own homes. She confirmed that there had been 156 new infection cases overnight, with 86 of those in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. There was also one death, while weekly figures released at midday by the National Records of Scotland showed that there had been six deaths over the previous week. The embattled Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, said he welcomed the first minister “coming round to our way of thinking” after Sturgeon announced in yesterday’s programme for government a review of adult social care, which will set out options for a “national care service”, something Leonard’s party has been calling for over many months. Referencing the number of care homes in the hands of private providers, some registered overseas, Leonard underlined the importance of removing the profit motive from social care. Sturgeon said she agreed with him, but said there was a difference between calling for something in opposition and delivering it in government, which is why time was needed to work out the detail of a new national service. Asked by Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie about plans for students arriving in Glasgow in the coming weeks, many from oversees, Sturgeon emphasised that testing was not an alternative to quarantine for returning students. In a post-PMQs briefing for journalist, asked about calls for Scottish Labour’s leader to quit, a spokesman for Sir Keir Starmer said: This is a matter for Scottish Labour, but Keir and Richard have a very good working relationship and they are both focused on next year’s Scottish elections. Starmer’s spokesman also praised the BBC’s Proms U-turn as “the right decision ... the pomp and pageantry is a staple of the British summer”. And said it was “the wrong time” for tax rises if the government wants to get the economy back on track. This was in response to reports that Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, is planning to raise taxes in his autumn budget to help address the black hole in the nation’s finances created by coronavirus. Normally, when faced with a new and difficult challenge, people get a little better with practice. But, remarkably, when it comes to facing Sir Keir Starmer at PMQs, Boris Johnson seems to be getting worse. He was never very accomplished in the first place - Starmer won most of their exchanges before the summer recess, often quite easily - but today Johnson was even less impressive than he has been before. His problems were the same as those on display earlier in the year: a refusal to engage with substance, and an over-reliance on attack lines that just don’t work. Today, with no relevance at all to the question in hand, Johnson launched into a diatribe about Starmer being anti-Brexit and on the side of “an IRA-condoning politician” (ie, Jeremy Corbyn - who would contest the claim he condoned terrorism) before accusing Starmer of being opposed to pupils returning to schools. At one point Johnson delivered a half-decent swipe against Starmer, describing him as “Captain Hindsight” and saying that Labour never challenged the exam grade algorithm plan it is now criticising so robustly. But Starmer dealt with this very effectively (telling Johnson he was governing by hindsight - a good example of why being able to think on your feet counts for so much at PMQs), and the rest of Johnson’s lines failed either because they were irrelevant, or because they were never true in the first place. (See 12.30pm and 12.46pm.) It is normal for politicians to attack their opponents in terms that are not entirely fair. But the good ones know when what they are up to when they are doing this. Today Johnson sounded like someone who might even believe his own propaganda - always a worrying trait. Although this was in many ways a replay of some of the PMQs we had before the summer, there were at least three new factors in play today that should be concerning for Tory MPs. First, Johnson doesn’t seem to even be trying to get better. He has had the whole summer to think about how he could improve at PMQs, but today there was no evidence that he has done so. It is one thing to be bad at a particular task; but to try not to get better is less forgivable. This would not matter much if it were just lefty journalists saying that he has been poor at PMQs, but even in the rightwing press it is hard to find anyone saying he has been a success. Second, Starmer is getting even more confident and authoritative. In the past his PMQs performances have been forensic, but a bit arid, but the more time he spends facing Johnson, the harder he seems to finding it his concealing his contempt for the PM. His anger comes over as more authentic than Johnson’s, and it was particularly on display when he spoke about his time prosecuting terrorists as DPP. At one point No 10 seemed to think that labelling Starmer as a lawyer would harm is reputation. Today that strategy looks more ineffective than ever. And, third, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, seems to have finally lost patience with Johnson too. When John Bercow was Speaker he would sometimes interrupt David Cameron when he embarked on lengthy, anti-Labour rants at PMQs. Hoyle has been much less interventionist as a Speaker than Bercow. But today he shut the PM up when Johnson started to use his dispatch box platform to try to link Starmer to the IRA. He even went further in the next exchange, asking Johnson to address Starmer’s call for that remark to be withdrawn. This suggests that Johnson will have less scope than he might have done for using PMQs as a party political platform. The Mirror’s Oliver Milne has more evidence of Sir Keir Starmer calling for children to be back in school months ago. PMQs is over, but the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, allows a point of order. It’s from Ian Blackford, the SNP leader at Westminster. He says in August the Sun quoted a No 10 source blaming Blackford for revealing the location of the PM’s holiday in Scotland. He says this was a political smear. He says he did not reveal where the PM was staying, and was not aware of it. He says this has resulted in Blackford himself, and his family, facing security threats. He says Johnson’s face in the chamber suggests he does not take this seriously, but it is a serious matter. Johnson says he had a wonderful staycation in Blackford’s constituency. He says he is happy to accept the assurances Blackford gives. But he quotes a tweet from the Daily Record journalist Torcuil Crichton, which he seems to imply undermines what Blackford was saying. Here is the tweet. It does not at all prove what Johnson implies that it does (that Crichton heard about where Johnson was camping from Blackford). Hoyle says he is very concerned about the security implications. Lee Anderson (Con) asks when the government will fix the asylum system. Johnson says he has a great deal of sympathy for people who are so desperate. But they are breaking the law, and undermining the system for genuine asylum seekers, he says. That is why the government will take advantage of Brexit and legislate for a new system, he says. Kate Osborne (Lab) asks the PM to extend the job retention scheme. Johnson says he has already addressed this. There will always be people arguing for an infinite extension of the scheme. The best solution is to get people back into work. He says the government will continue to support people. But an indefinite furlough is not the answer. Johnson says HS2 will pay compensation where local roads are closed. Ruth Cadbury (Lab) asks which of the 12 U-turns he has performed is the PM’s favourite. Johnson says it is a rare privilege to ask a question in the Commons, and he says he is surprised she asked that. He urges Labour to back people going back to work. This is from Georgina Bailey from the House magazine, showing that Sir Keir Starmer was on record as saying schools were safe before today, contrary to what Boris Johnson claimed. There has been another coronavirus government U-turn, my colleague Helen Pidd reports. This is what Andy Burnham, the Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, was calling for this morning. This is from my colleague Josh Halliday. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson (DUP) urges the PM to look at targeted support for certain employment sectors, and to do more for the self-employed. Johnson says all sorts of schemes are available to help people. He says he is trying to give people the confidence to go back to work. An ounce of confidence is worth a tonne of taxpayers’ money, he says. Damian Green (Con) says many people will only want to go into the office on two or three days a week. Will the government encourage rail companies to introduce flexible season tickets? Johnson says the government is working with rail companies on introducing new products. Ian Blackford, the SNP’s leader at Westminster, starts by supporting the condolences to the rail crash victims and the tribute to John Hulme. Referring to what Johnson said yesterday about the need for the government to sometimes change course in response to changing circumstances, he says the PM admitted he was all at sea. He says the government has performed eight U-turns. Will he do a ninth, and extend the furlough scheme? Johnson says the furlough scheme has already cost the country £40bn. It keeps people in suspended animation. Instead he wants them to go back to work. He says that is what the Kick Start scheme does. Blackford says the furlough scheme protects people. France, Germany and Ireland have extended theirs into 2021. Johnson says the UK furlough scheme is far more generous than anything in some other European countries. The government is helping people get back into work, he says. Starmer says there have been 12 U-turns. That is serial incompetence. He says Johnson should take full responsibility. Johnson says he does take responsibility. He says he is trying to get the country back to work. He says the country should come together and says it is safe for kids to go back to school. He says Starmer has not said schools are safe. He should say so. Starmer says: “Schools are safe.” His own kids have been in school throughout, he says. (Starmer’s wife is a healthcare worker, and so his children qualified for school on the grounds she was an essential worker.) He says Johnson said he would meet relatives of those who died during coronavirus, but that changed his mind. Will he meet them? Johnson says the group involved is taking legal action against the government. He says he will meet the relatives when that is over. He says this was the first time in four months that Starmer said schools were safe. He says Starmer should now say it is safe for workers to return to work. He says the test and trace system is “superlative”. It has conducted more tests than any other European country. Starmer should say than, instead of sneering, he says. Starmer says Johnson is governing by hindsight. He says Johnson should withdraw what he said about the IRA. Starmer says as DPP he spent five years prosecuting the IRA. Johnson now has to take a decision about the furlough. Will he extend it? Johnson says Starmer is a doubter. Rather than extend the furlough, he wants to get pupils back into work through the kick-start scheme. He wants to move Britain forward. Labour doesn’t. That is the difference. Hoyle asks Johnson to address the IRA point. Johnson says what Starmer says now he should have said when he supported Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. Starmer says he has already congratulated students. But Johnson ignored the question, either because he did not know, or because he did know and did nothing. So when did he know? Johnson says Ofqual said the system was robust. He accuses Starmer of undermining confidence. He says Labour still does not support children going back to school. Will Starmer say schools are safe? Starmer says Johnson has a tin ear. He says Labour has said it wants pupils back. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said so in the Commons yesterday. The government has no grip. That’s right, isn’t it? Johnson says Starmer wanted to stay in the EU. He backed an IRA-condoning Labour leader. Hoyle intervenes. He says it would be helpful for Johnson to answer the question. Johnson says Labour says nothing against the Ofqual system. He calls Starmer “Captain Hindsight”. Sir Keir Starmer also pays his condolences to the rail crash victims. And he pays tribute to John Hume, the former SDLP leader who died during the recess. Turing to the A-level grade debacle, he asks when the PM first knew there was a problem with the alogrithm. Johnson says he and Gavin Williamson understand how difficult it has been for parents and pupils. He says the government did act. Students know have their grades. Will Starmer congratulate those students? Andrew Bowie (Con) asks about the rail crash in Scotland that left three people dead in August. Boris Johnson expresses his condolences. He says we must learn the lessons from what went wrong. UPDATE: Originally this post described Andrew Bowie as an SNP MP. In fact, he is a Conservative. Sorry. PMQs is starting. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, starts by wishing Sir Keir Starmer happy birthday. This morning the ONS published its latest weekly bulletin on deaths in England and Wales. In the week ending 21 August (or week 34, as the ONS calls it) 138 of the deaths registered involved coronavirus. That was 1.4% of the total and the lowest number of coronavirus deaths for 22 weeks. The ONS said that, for the second week in a row, overall deaths were again above the five-year average. But that was not driven by coronavirus, it said. Taking into account the latest figures, PA Media says just over 57,300 deaths involving Covid-19 have now been registered in the UK. Today’s ONS figures show that 52,217 deaths involving Covid-19 had occurred in England and Wales up to 21 August, and had been registered by 29 August. Figures published last week by the National Records for Scotland showed that 4,222 deaths involving Covid-19 had been registered in Scotland up to 23 August, while 871 deaths had occurred in Northern Ireland up to 21 August (and had been registered up to 26 August), according to the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency. Together, these figures mean that so far 57,310 deaths have been registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate, including suspected cases. This is much higher than the daily headline figure for the UK published by the government, which is currently 41,504. That’s because the headline daily figure only includes people who died within 28 days of testing positive. Although testing is much more commonplace now, in the early days of the pandemic thousands of people died from coronavirus without being tested. The Scottish Labour leader, Richard Leonard, is under intense pressure to quit after senior MSPs said the party faced “catastrophic defeat” in next year’s Holyrood elections, my colleague Severin Carrell reports. His full story is here. Here are the main points from the written submission to the education committee from Roger Taylor, the Ofqual chair. Taylor says Ofqual now accepts that trying to award grades without allowing students to be assessed was an “impossible task” because it seemed fundamentally unfair. He says: Any awarding process that does not give the individual the ability to affect their fate by demonstrating their skills and knowledge in a fair test will not command and retain public confidence ... To try to deliver comparable qualification results in the absence of students having taken any assessments (examinations) proved to be an impossible task. He suggests that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has to accept some of the blame for what went wrong. Taylor says: Understandably, there is now a desire to attribute blame. The decision to use a system of statistical standardised teacher assessments was taken by the secretary of state and issued as a direction to Ofqual. Ofqual could have rejected this, but we decided that this was in the best interests of students, so that they could progress to their next stage of education, training or work. The implementation of that approach was entirely down to Ofqual. However, given the exceptional nature of this year, we worked in a much more collaborative way than we would in a normal year, sharing detailed information with partners. He rejects claims that Williamson was not aware of the potential problems. In August Williamson claimed that he only became aware of the full scale of the problems after the A-level results were published. But Taylor says: We kept the Department for Education fully informed about the work we were doing and the approach we intended to take to qualifications, the risks and impact on results as they emerged. However, we are ultimately responsible for the decisions that fall to us as the regulator. Taylor says Ofqual wanted exams to go ahead in a socially distanced manner, but it was over-ruled by Williamson, who wanted grades to be awarded instead. Taylor says: In March, Ofqual was consulted by the secretary of state on how to manage school qualifications in the context of a pandemic. Our advice at that time was that the best option in terms of valid qualifications would be to hold exams in a socially distanced manner. We also set out alternative options including the use of standardised teacher assessments and the risks associated with them. On March 18, the secretary of state for education took the decision to cancel exams this summer. The loss of schooling and the likely parental concerns about sending children back into schools to take exams meant that exams were not considered a viable option. Taylor says that originally there was general agreement that using an algorithm to allocate grades was “a good idea”, even though 0.2% of students would be treated unfairly. It was thought that could be resolved by the appeal system, he says. The principle of moderating teacher grades was accepted as a sound one, and indeed the relevant regulatory and examination bodies across the four nations of the United Kingdom separately put in place plans to do this ... Using statistics to iron out these differences and ensure consistency looked, in principle, to be a good idea. That is why in our consultations and stakeholder discussions all the teaching unions supported the approach we adopted. Indeed, when we consulted on it, 89% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed with our proposed aims for the statistical standardisation approach. We knew, however, that there would be specific issues associated with this approach. In particular, statistical standardisation of this kind will inevitably result in a very small proportion of quite anomalous results that would need to be corrected by applying human judgment through an appeals process. For example, we were concerned about bright students in historically low attaining schools. We identified that approximately 0.2% of young peoples’ grades were affected by this but that it was not possible to determine in advance which cases warranted a change to grades. That is why the appeals process we designed and refined was so important. He says Ofqual subsequently realised its approach was “unacceptable” to the public. He says: Ultimately, however, the approach failed to win public confidence, even in circumstances where it was operating exactly as we had intended it to. While sound in principle, candidates who had reasonable expectations of achieving a grade were not willing to accept that they had been selected on the basis of teacher rankings and statistical predictions to receive a lower grade. To be told that you cannot progress as you wanted because you have been awarded a lower grade in this way was unacceptable. He says an addition problem was that the lockdown went on for longer than originally expected, with the result using autumn exams to allow students to improve their grades was no longer an easy solution. He says: The original policy was adopted on the basis that the autumn series would give young people who were disappointed with their results, the opportunity to sit an examination. However, the extended lockdown of schools and the failure to ensure that such candidates could still take their places at university meant that this option was, for many, effectively removed. This significantly shifted the public acceptability of awarding standardised grades. The education commitee has published the written submission it has received from Roger Taylor, chair of Ofqual, about the exam grade debacle. There is a link to it here. The submission reflects what Taylor has been telling the committee in the hearing that is still taking place. I will post a summary of the key points shortly. Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has posted a nine-item thread on Twitter explaining the reasons for the decision to tighten coronavirus restrictions in three local authorities in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area. It starts here. Here are the tweets where she explains why people in these areas are being told not to visit other people in their homes. Here is the tweet where Sturgeon explains why Greece has been added to Scotland’s quarantine list. Sturgeon ends the thread by saying these developments should be seen as a “wake-up call”. The Commons education committee has started taking evidence from Roger Taylor, chair of Ofqual, and some of his colleagues about the exam grade debacle. You can watch a live feed of the hearing here. Here are some of the main points so far. Taylor said that Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, took the decision to cancel this year’s exams and award grades instead. Taylor said that Ofqual wanted exams to go ahead. Its second choice option was to delay exams, he said. Awarding a “teacher certificate” was its third choice option, he said. But he said Williamson took the decision to cancel exams without consultation. He said thinking that the system being used to allocate grades would be acceptable to the public was a “fundamental mistake”. He said that Williamson’s office agreed new guidance on appeals that was issued after the publication of A-level results provoked uproar. That advice had to be withdrawn after Williamson subsequently decided he no longer supported it, Taylor said. Taylor said that at that point he felt the situation was “rapidly getting out of control”. This morning Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, said there was “no logic” to the changes in lockdown regulations in the north-west. (See 7.57am.) He was referring to the fact that rules have been eased in two local authority areas, Bolton and Trafford, even though the number of cases is rising in those areas and the restrictions remain in force in neighbouring areas, where the number of cases is lower. Last night PA Media published new coronavirus case figures for every local authority area in England. Here are the 50 authorities with the highest number of new cases in the seven days to 29 August, listed in order. After the name of each council area, there are four numbers. They are: rate of new cases in the seven days to 29 August, expressed as the number of new cases per 100,000 people; actual number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to 29 August; rate of new cases in the seven days to 22 August; number (in brackets) of new cases recorded in the seven days to 22 August.

This is from Rachel Reeves, the shadow Cabinet Office minister. These revelations that bereaved families had to write to Boris Johnson five times asking to meet him – for him to privately go back on his public word and refuse are astounding, and upsetting for so many whose families and lives have been impacted by Covid in this way. 41,504 people have tragically lost their lives to this virus. The very least the prime minister could do is respond truthfully to their families, and have the heart to meet some of them and their representatives. The prime minister has been going back on his word all summer – but to not even meet with grieving families hits a new low. Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: The ONS is due to release coronavirus death figures for England and Wales. 9.45am: Four officials from Ofqual give evidence to the Commons education committee about the exam grade debacle this summer. 12pm: Boris Johnson faces Sir Keir Starmer at the first PMQs since the summer. 12.20pm: Nicola Sturgeon takes first minster’s questions in the Scottish parliament. 12.30pm: Chris Philp, a Home Office minister, is due to answer an urgent question about migrants crossing the Channel. 1pm: Michel Barnier, the EU’s Brexit negotiator, speaks at an online event organised by the Irish thinktank, the Institute of International and European Affairs. 2.30pm: Andrew Bailey, the governor of the Bank of England, and other Bank officials give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the economic impact of coronavirus. Boris Johnson has come in for heavy criticism for backing out of a meeting with members of a campaign group representing families bereaved by coronavirus. Fiona Kirton, whose father, Bernard, died after being transferred from hospital to a care home without being tested, has told Today: We’re just bewildered. We’ve written to him five times and he’s refused to meet us in the letter, then he says he doesn’t know about the letters, then he says he will meet us. Now, he says he will not meet us. There’s no logic. Kirton said the threat of legal action, which Johnson cited as a reason he was unable to meet the group, came only because he was not responding. Our main aim was to meet him. And, from our firsthand experience of what has gone wrong in the government response – and this has in lots of cases, we feel, led to unnecessary deaths – we are hoping to actually meet him and put our experience, which is a wealth of experience, before him so that these things can be investigated. None of us want to take legal action. We’re all grieving for our families. We would prefer to just quietly heal and feel that we can mourn our loved ones without having to go to this amount of effort. But we’re only doing it because we know that, for example, we’re preparing for a challenging winter report, which the government itself commissioned [and which] predicts a wort-case scenario death toll of 119,000 people this winter. And we do not want this to happen to other people. She said her members believe that the 111 system has failed and that a lack of PPE had caused infections in hospitals, adding that the prime minister is unlikely to have gained such a wealth of firsthand experience as the group could offer from his own experience of being treated in hospital. As the west of Scotland adjusts to new limited lockdown restrictions preventing indoor household gatherings and lasting for the following two weeks, some critics on social media have been questioning why people cannot meet in their homes but can in pubs and restaurants. Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland programme, the deputy first minister, John Swinney, explained: In the west of Scotland it isn’t hospitality that is driving the increase in cases from the contact-tracing work that’s been done so far, it’s household contacts, so we’re taking targeted and focused action to try to address the source and the cause of the increases in the hope that we don’t have to do it in other circumstances and of course in hospitality sector there are very strict constraints that have to be followed in all hospitality premises. Interviewed on the same programme, Linda Bauld, a professor of public health at Edinburgh University, said Scotland had made “huge progress” in reducing infection but that it was a “global phenomenon” to see a rise in cases once lockdown was released. Asked if there was danger of a “scunner factor”, where people took less heed of restrictions as they were reimposed, she said she believed people would be even more fed up if restrictions were tightened further, for example to close businesses again. What I hope is that these types of restrictions send a pretty clear message to everybody that there are things that it’s important that all of us do to protect ourselves and protect others, so I hope these local restrictions will actually help with compliance on not having large gatherings indoors so people understand if they do that they avoid restrictions in the future. My colleague Josh Halliday has put together a comprehensive rundown of the changes to the local lockdowns in Manchester – and the somewhat unfavourable reaction to them this morning: The Welsh government is pressing for an urgent meeting with the UK government and the other devolved nations over holiday-makers returning from Zante. In the last week, the NHS Wales test trace protect service has identified six separate Covid-19 clusters linked to Zante. The cases amount to 30 cases from four flights, two of which landed in England. A rise in the number of cases in Cardiff is also being attributed in part to holiday-makers returning from Zante. The Welsh government said: There are concerns from our public health teams that the current advice and control measures for returning travellers are insufficient. Unfortunately, our consultants in communicable disease control have several examples of Covid-19 positive travellers who have not self-isolated on return to Wales. That is a real concern for all of us. Without action, it is likely that there will be significant health and economic impacts arising from new clusters of infections and renewed disease transmission in Wales. All passengers on a flight from Zante to Cardiff on Tuesday night were given a letter before leaving the airport requesting that they self-isolate for 14 days. The government also asked for travellers returning to Wales from Zante from other airports outside of Wales to self isolate. The government has not ruled out introducing a regime of testing at airports. Its health minister Vaughan Gething also said he would not hesitate to bring in local lockdowns if necessary. Welsh ministers are keen to discuss with their counterparts in the UK whether a common approach to Zante – and possibly the Greek islands as a whole – should be adapted. The Welsh government is keen for a decision to be made on Wednesday. Speaking on BBC Radio Wales on Wednesday, Gething said: We think the evidence is very clear on Zante with that number of clusters of cases from a relatively small island but it’s a tourist destination and we don’t believe it’s uniquely Welsh tourists that are acquiring Covid on the island of Zante. I’m sure UK ministers will make their own announcements for England. I’m very confident we’ve done the right thing to keep Wales safe. The Guardian has been told that the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, was offered evidence of serious flaws in the grading of this year’s exams two weeks before A-level results were published in England, Richard Adams and Heather Stewart write. But Williamson and the Department for Education were reassured by the exam regulator Ofqual that the flaws could be managed by allowing schools to appeal in cases of unusual results. It is the most compelling evidence to date that Williamson, the DfE and Ofqual had detailed warning of the problems that would later turn into a fiasco, disrupting the lives and education of hundreds of thousands of young people. The details are likely to raise difficult new questions for Ofqual, whose chiefs go in front of MPs on Wednesday – but also for Williamson, who initially suggested he had only been aware of “real concerns” about A-level grades after the initial results were published on 13 August. Earlier, Greater Manchester’s mayor called the lifting of restrictions in some areas and not others “completely illogical”. Here, from my colleague Josh Halliday, is some illuminating context: The former Tory leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt has said he “dodged a bullet” in not becoming prime minister shortly before the pandemic. Hunt, who also served as health secretary and now chairs the health select committee, told Sky News: Well, I certainly dodged a bullet if you look at the year poor Boris has had ... it’s been a very tough year for anyone who was prime minister. He added that he wanted the government to introduce weekly testing for secondary school teachers. Boris Johnson has declined to meet members of a campaign group representing families bereaved by coronavirus, despite appearing to promise to do so on live TV last week, Heather Stewart and Jessica Elgot write. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, which says it represents 1,600 bereaved families, is campaigning for a rapid public inquiry into the government’s response to the pandemic and is taking legal action to force one, sending pre-action letters to the government. Challenged live on Sky News last week about repeated requests from the group for a face-to-face meeting, the prime minister said he was “not aware” of their letters, but “of course” he would meet them. Speaking to the same programme about the possibility of further restrictions being placed on people travelling to the UK from Greece, the latter’s tourism minister Harry Theoharis has said Greece has “a much lower number of infections compared to most other countries in Europe”. We’re actually in the right direction. We’re going down in terms of the average numbers. We’re taking specific targeted measures where we see specific concentrations of cases. Measures that have been successful and have been working in the past few days. So I think we’re doing everything in our power to ensure that every person that comes from the UK is kept safe in Greece. Of course, everybody should also have some restraint, understand that this is a different summer. You mentioned it before, it’s not exactly the same like the past few years. We should all keep control of the situation, use our masks where it’s required, follow the rules etc in order to ensure that everybody is kept safe. Asked what people in the two boroughs should do if invited to someone else’s home, Burnham said: People can, so people will have to use their judgment. But ... we’re in an unsustainable position. How can we explain this to the public now? The lockdown, as people call it, was always hard to explain and now there is just no logic for it. And that’s why we’re saying to the government: talk to us today about an exit strategy from this because, actually, blanket restrictions I don’t believe are as effective as the targeted interventions ... I think they were effective in the early stages, when they were first introduced. But their effectiveness has diminished over the weeks and I think we now need to move to these high-impact, targeted interventions at a community level. And that means resourcing our 10 councils to carry out that kind of work. The government promised that it would release resources from the national test and trace system to local authorities and that hasn’t happened yet. And it needs to happen – particularly with schools coming back. Here’s a little more on those comments from Andy Burnham, who’s called the easing of restrictions in Bolton and Trafford “completely illogical”. He told Today that people in Bolton and Trafford should “continue to follow the guidance” not to have gatherings in their homes. We find ourselves at a completely unsustainable position this morning – that’s the politest way I can put it. Overnight, we’ve had restrictions released in two boroughs where we’ve got a rising number of cases – in one case, in the red zone. And neighbouring boroughs are still under restrictions but with much lower numbers of cases. These restrictions were always hard to explain to the public but they are completely illogical now. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s UK live blog. I’ll be taking you through the next few hours, before handing over to the usual custodian, Andrew Sparrow. ‘Decide restrictions exit strategy’, ministers told The current system of restriction is unsustainable, the mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has said, as plans to lift conditions on more than half a million people were thrown into confusion. The Trafford and Bolton boroughs were released from restrictions despite the increasing rates and last-minute local requests for a deferment that went unanswered, Burnham has said, while neighbouring boroughs with lower numbers of infection were still living under lockdowns. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he has called for ministers to agree an exit strategy today – including door-to-door testing and tracing interventions, which he said has proven most effective when used in Manchester. Travellers from Greece face quarantine Westminster is facing pressure to reconsider quarantine rules for people arriving in England from Greece after Scotland and Wales introduced similar measures over concerns about rising numbers of cases. The Greek tourism minister Harry Theoharis stressed that his nation had recorded fewer cases than many others in Europe in an interview with Today. Prime minister to face MPs Boris Johnson faces his first prime minister’s questions since the government was forced into a string of embarrassing U-turns over post-16 exams that have soured Conservative backbench opinion towards his government’s handling of the pandemic."

          "headline": "Amy Hunt: 'I thrive under pressure. It was the same in my Cambridge interview'",
          "bodyText": "Few people have been able to blunt the stellar rise of Amy Hunt, the brilliant teenager who is so quick she holds the under-18s world record over 200m and so smart she is heading to Cambridge University in October. But last month the education secretary, Gavin Williamson – and a dodgy computer algorithm – came closer than most by downgrading Hunt’s A-level results to leave her dreams of studying English at Corpus Christi in a hideous holding pattern. Hunt almost wore out the refresh button on her computer before finding out from Ucas, the admissions agency, that her college would accept her regardless. This week, she overcame a second challenge by passing her driving test. But another examination awaits on Friday as she attempts to win her first senior British Athletics title, over 100m, and lay down a marker on the journey towards next year’s Tokyo Olympics. Juggling a degree course at Cambridge with being an elite athlete would leave many feeling daunted. But Hunt, who turned 18 in May, is relishing what lies ahead. “I live my life very chaotically at times,” she says, laughing. “I have to deal with a lot of stress both from academia and the sport so I’d like to think that I thrive under pressure and I embrace it. It was the same in my Cambridge interview. I really like performing to my ultimate potential and pushing myself to see how far I can go.” Hunt plans to study and train at Cambridge during the week before returning to Loughborough to see her coach at weekends. A call from the world 4x100m relay silver medallist Adam Gemili convinced her it was possible to thrive. “I had an amazing call with Adam about travelling to and from university, being prepared and really being on top of planning,” she says. “Over the years I have developed a few coping mechanisms to manage stress and I have just got to push myself to do my best in as many fields as possible.” That said, Hunt’s normal coping mechanisms briefly failed her when she feared she would miss out on Cambridge. “When I was in the moment it felt awful,” she admits. “I was initially knocked down a grade and ended up waiting for Ucas Track for about 50 minutes. I had all these nerves and was trying to refresh the page and it kept crashing. But then at the end it was complete euphoria.” For now, Hunt’s focus is on finishing the truncated 2020 season with a bang. She emphatically advertised her blossoming talent last year by running 22.42sec over 200m, a time that not only broke the women’s under-18 world record – the men’s version is held by Usain Bolt – but was the third fastest by a British woman and would have won a bronze medal behind Dina Asher-Smith at the 2019 world championships. She missed that event in Doha through injury and has barely raced in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, but she believes the postponement of the Olympics by a year will give her more time to make a mark in Tokyo. “I’ve been in the gym a lot and another year means I’ll naturally be fitter, stronger and faster,” she says. “It allows me to feel I can get there and compete on the world level against some really incredible girls.” In the past most British sprinters have been intimidated by the Jamaicans and Americans, but Hunt says Asher-Smith has shown that they are beatable. “Dina has done an amazing job of proving that British sprinters – and British women particularly – can compete on that world stage and win global gold,” she says. “I’ve been inspired by that and hopefully I can follow in her footsteps. You have to focus on yourself. If you are getting too scared about your competition then you’re not doing the right thing.” Sadly, Asher-Smith, like many of Britain’s biggest names will be missing the UK championships at Manchester on Friday and Saturday, which means Hunt will be one of the main attractions. Not that she minds. “I definitely feel a sense of pressure,” she says. “But I always like it. I embrace it. My philosophy is always to go out and enjoy the race. “I feel like I am progressing to that next stage of my life, as cringey as it sounds, with going to university and passing my driving test and moving away from home. And I feel like I’m heading in the right direction.” Britain’s top athletes return this weekend at the Müller British Athletics Championships with live coverage on BBC2 from 6pm-9pm BST on Friday and on BBC1 1.15pm-4.30pm on Saturday.

          "headline": "Gavin Williamson to blame for England exams fiasco, says Ofqual chair",
          "bodyText": "Ofqual’s senior leadership told MPs that Ofqual should not be blamed for the fiasco that engulfed this summer’s exams in England, and accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of causing the weekend of chaos that followed the publication of A-level results. Roger Taylor, Ofqual’s chair, said Williamson directly called the regulator to tell it to scrap new guidelines on appeals just hours after they had been approved by the Department for Education (DfE), including Williamson’s office, and published. Taylor also revealed that Ofqual told the government in March that awarding grades using a statistical model was “the worst-case scenario”. “At the outset, our initial advice to the secretary of state was that the best way to handle this was to try to hold exams in a socially distanced manner, and that our second option was to delay exams. But the third option, if neither of these was acceptable, was to have to try and have some form of calculated grades,” Taylor said. “It was the secretary of state who then subsequently took the decision and announced – without further consultation with Ofqual – that exams were to be cancelled and a system of calculated grades was to be implemented.” The DfE responded: “As we’ve consistently said, the government never wanted to cancel exams because they are the best and fairest form of assessment. “We listened to views from a range of parties, including Ofqual, and given the public health requirements at the time, made what was a very difficult decision on the basis that it was a necessary step to fight the spread of coronavirus.” The education committee hearing was Ofqual’s first public foray since it announced two weeks ago that it would dump the statistical model it had developed to allocate A-level and GCSE grades this year, and would instead rely on grades produced by teachers and schools. In a long session before the MPs, the Ofqual leaders sought to explain why it bore little responsibility for the mess, saying that it had informed the government at every step. The officials said they briefed No 10 a week before A-level results were published, and outlined the expected dangers. Julie Swan, an Ofqual executive director, said the regulator had “meetings with the schools minister [Nick Gibb] on a weekly basis throughout” and that its advice to ministers in March said that “it would be challenging if not impossible to attempt to moderate grades that would be fair for all this year’s students”. Swan said: “We briefed No 10 on 7 August, and again the paper written there was very alert to the risks, both to disadvantaged and outlier students, to centres that had expected improved grades this year and the impact on low-entry cohorts including independent schools.” Taylor also publicly confirmed a report first published by the Guardian last month that he threatened to resign as chair unless Ofqual received public backing from Williamson. Taylor gave a detailed account of the controversy over Williamson’s proposal that mock exam grades could be used in appeal by pupils unhappy with their Ofqual-moderated results. It was the first explanation of why Ofqual published and then abruptly retracted the appeals notice late on a Saturday night. Taylor said Ofqual’s board approved the new appeal process, and claimed it was also approved by the DfE, with the guidelines published at 3pm on 15 August. But that evening, Taylor said Williamson phoned Sally Collier – the Ofqual chief regulator who resigned last week – and told her to withdraw the guidance. “We had agreed [the appeal guidelines] with the Department for Education and, to our understanding, with the secretary of state’s office. We then published this on the Saturday. We were subsequently contacted by the secretary of state later that evening and were informed that this was in fact not, to his mind, in line with government policy,” Taylor said. After discussion by Ofqual’s board, the advice was taken down just before 11pm on Saturday, with Taylor saying it left the regulator with no option but to ditch calculated grades in favour of centre assessments. “At this stage we realised we were in a situation which was rapidly getting out of control, that there were policies being recommended and strongly advocated by the secretary of state [Williamson] that we felt were not consistent with our legal duties, and that additionally there was a growing risk around delivering any form of mock appeal results,” Taylor said. Ofqual feared that Williamson’s proposal would result in 80%-90% of pupils winning higher grades on appeal but unfairly leaving the rest with no recourse. “For these reasons, we felt we were in a situation that was rapidly moving out of control and that it was likely that the only way out of this was to have centre-assessed grades,” Taylor said. Asked by an MP why Ofqual had persisted with its algorithm “like the charge of the Light Brigade”, in spite of warnings from the likes of Cambridge Assessment, Taylor replied that Ofqual’s process would have worked “if people had been prepared to accept it as the unfortunate consequence” of the coronavirus lockdown. Taylor also admitted that “the fundamental mistake was to believe that this would ever be acceptable to the public”. Ofqual told the MPs that it was considering a delay to 2021’s exams, as well as a “plan B” to allow pupils to take exams remotely. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, said Williamson now needed to appear before parliament to explain his actions. “The evidence given by Ofqual has raised serious questions about Gavin Williamson’s role in this summer’s exam fiasco. Gavin Williamson has repeatedly tried to blame Ofqual and officials for the crisis over exams. It is now clear he was responsible,” she said. • This article was amended on 3 September 2020. Julie Swan told the committee that Ofqual’s advice to ministers in March had been that “it would be challenging if not impossible to attempt to moderate grades that would be fair for all this year’s students”. An earlier version wrongly had this as “it would be challenging but not impossible”."

          "headline": "Keir Starmer condemns Johnson for accusing him of IRA tolerance",
          "bodyText": "Labour has responded furiously after Boris Johnson accused Keir Starmer of complicity in tolerance for the IRA, pointing to the prime minister’s acceptance of the former Brexit party MEP Claire Fox as a peer despite her prior support for the IRA’s Warrington bomb. The row erupted after a notably bad-tempered prime minister’s questions where Johnson criticised the Labour leader for his tenure as shadow Brexit secretary under Jeremy Corbyn, but was himself reprimanded by the Speaker for repeatedly dodging questions. Johnson said: “This is a leader of the opposition who supported an IRA-condoning politician who wanted to get out of Nato, and now says absolutely nothing about it.” A clearly angry Starmer pointed to his work combating Northern Ireland terrorism as the director of public prosecutions and demanded Johnson “do the decent thing” and withdraw the comment, which the prime minister refused to do. After PMQs, Starmer’s spokesman said Johnson should refrain from making such remarks and instead block the peerage of Fox, who defended the 1993 Warrington bombing when she was a member of the Revolutionary Communist party (RCP). “One thing we would remind the prime minister is that he has the power to block Claire Fox being nominated as a member of the House of Lords. So if he wants to take any action on this issue we suggest he does that,” he said. Colin Parry, the peace campaigner whose 12-year-old son, Tim, was one of two children killed in the blast, has condemned the decision to make Fox a non-aligned peer in nominations announced at the end of July. Fox has said she does not condone violence, but has not disowned her comment, made in an RCP newsletter after the attack, defending “the right of the Irish people to take whatever measures necessary in their struggle for freedom”. In the Commons, Starmer angrily rejected Johnson’s comments about his work under Corbyn and the IRA: “I want him to take it back. I worked for five years with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as director of public prosecutions, prosecuting serious terrorism, working with the intelligence and security services, and the police. Can the prime minister have the decency to withdraw that comment?” Johnson at first ignored the question. Then, when prompted by the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, instead repeated the assertion. Starmer replied: “When the prime minister has worked with the security and intelligence forces, prosecuting criminals and terrorists, he can lecture me. I asked him to do the decent thing, but doing the decent thing and this prime minister don’t go together.” Johnson had by then already been reprimanded by Hoyle after he ignored Starmer’s questions on when he had first known about issues with the algorithm for giving A-level students results in the absence of exams. Twice Johnson failed to respond to Starmer’s request for “a straight answer to a straight question”, instead asking the Labour leader to congratulate pupils on their hard work, and then condemning Starmer for “going around undermining confidence, spreading doubts”. When Johnson ignored a further question, about Tory MPs’ criticisms of the government’s problems over the summer, and made his comments about the IRA, Hoyle made an intervention – rare during PMQs – to tell him to be less evasive. “I think there are questions being asked,” the Speaker told him. “We do need to answer the question being put to the prime minister. It would be helpful to those watching to know the answers.” Johnson resumed: “Mr Speaker, I think it would be helpful for those watching to know …” Hoyle cut him off abruptly, saying: “Prime minister, I think I’ll make the decisions today.” Asked about Labour’s comments on Fox, a Downing Street source repeated a statement made when she was announced as a peer: “Claire Fox has addressed her historic comments about the Troubles, and acknowledged the pain that the families of the victims of terrorism have faced. “She is not a Conservative peer, and her political views will differ from those of the Conservative government.”"

          "headline": "Wage underpayment: inquiry urges payroll solution to industrial relations 'complexity'",
          "bodyText": "The federal government should promote payroll software to boost small and medium businesses’ compliance with complex industrial awards setting pay, the financial technology and regulatory technology inquiry has concluded. The Senate committee’s report, tabled on Wednesday, lends weight to a push from small and family business ombudsman Kate Carnell to use industrial relations reforms to boost uptake of payroll solutions to underpayment, including the possibility of “safe harbour” from prosecution. The committee chairman, Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, told Guardian Australia the best case was agreement between unions and employers to simplify awards, and use of payroll software was the “second best option” but one he would endorse. The inquiry also recommended making temporary Covid-19 measures including telehealth and electronic AGMs a permanent feature of health and corporations laws, and extending portable digital data laws to the superannuation and insurance sectors. In August, Guardian Australia revealed the industrial relations roundtables on compliance and award simplification had considered reforms to allow businesses that accidentally underpaid staff to make backpayment without further penalty if they used payroll tools approved by the government. The fintech and regtech inquiry noted Carnell’s call for the fair work ombudsman to accredit particular solutions and provide safe harbour for employers who use them and payroll company Tanda’s proposal for a rating system for software. The committee recommended that the Australian government “explore options to promote the use of regtech solutions in assisting small and medium-sized enterprises to comply with their obligations under industrial awards”. Bragg said although it was “very hard for a government agency to approve an algorithm” the FWO could offer safe harbour – declining to prosecute employers who used a certified payroll software. “This is a second best option,” he told Guardian Australia. “The best option is that the attorney general is able to solve these issues via award simplification. “What you’re saying here is that ‘we’ve failed to simplify the awards and therefore we now need a computer program to help simplify these horribly complicated provisions’ – in the retail and hospitality awards it can be up to 500 different pay points. “But it’s not a bad insurance policy to have. Everyone agrees that simplification is ideal – the challenge is to get the vested interests to agree which is what the attorney is trying to do as we speak.” Bragg said “large employer groups are just as guilty as big unions” at failing to reform the system. Some employer participants have privately expressed the view the roundtable process has largely stalled, with the best hope now to develop a set of options for government to choose from rather than achieving a grand bargain bringing unions into agreement on major reforms. On Tuesday the attorney general, Christian Porter, said that was a “very austere summary” of the process, telling reporters in Canberra there was still an enormous amount of “good faith, good will and intelligence” on display in talks. Porter said the five roundtables were narrowing the issues and were “moving towards outcomes” and he was “considerably more optimistic” they will produce “consequential outcomes” to boost jobs. Guardian Australia understands that after being excluded from early sessions of the industrial relations roundtables for breaching confidentiality rules, KPMG did provide independent expertise – including on the issue of payroll software to improve compliance. A spokeswoman for payroll company Xero told Guardian Australia although it has no ongoing role it had presented to the roundtables on 12 August, discussing “the capability and limitations of software to support the correct payment of award wages”. “Many of our app partners that integrate with Xero, including Tanda and Deputy, offer an award interpretation feature,” she said. The fintech and regtech inquiry called on the government to “lock in technology gains” made during the Covid-19 pandemic, including allowing companies to communicate with shareholders electronically, sign documents electronically and witness them via videoconferencing. It called on the government to provide “further clarity around eligibility for the research and development tax incentive” – including limits on clawing back payments retrospectively, and ensuring software innovation qualifies. The committee called for the council of financial regulators gain a mandate to report on competition in financial services markets."

          "headline": "Williamson told about flaws in A-level model two weeks before results",
          "bodyText": "Gavin Williamson was offered evidence of serious flaws in the grading of this year’s exams two weeks before A-level results were published in England, the Guardian has been told. But Williamson and the Department for Education were reassured by the exam regulator Ofqual that the flaws could be managed by allowing schools to appeal in cases of unusual results. It is the most compelling evidence to date that Williamson, the DfE and Ofqual had detailed warning of the problems that would later turn into a fiasco, disrupting the lives and education of hundreds of thousands of young people. The details are likely to raise difficult new questions for Ofqual, whose chiefs go in front of MPs on Wednesday – but also for Williamson, who initially suggested he had only been aware of “real concerns” about A-level grades after the initial results were published on 13 August. The new disclosures come from Cambridge Assessment, which operates OCR, one of the three big examination boards that administer most GCSE and A-level qualifications. It said it approached ministers and the DfE in July, two weeks before A-level results were published, and again days before GCSE results were released, after it identified major problems in the way grades were being allocated by Ofqual’s statistical model. Tim Oates, Cambridge Assessment’s group director of research, told the Guardian DfE officials including Williamson’s advisers and the schools minister, Nick Gibb, were eager to hear about the problems his organisation had uncovered. “I cannot fault their reaction, the DfE responded swiftly and energetically, taking our analysis extremely seriously,” Oates said. Cambridge Assessment’s internal research team identified anomalies that were punishing “outlier” students – talented individuals in large schools with poor track records – as well as middle-ranking students who were assessed as gaining Cs but were inexplicably being given a failing U grade by Ofqual’s model. “This year’s approach – like all assessment – had technical limitations. We investigated those we identified through targeted research quickly and forensically. Two issues – outliers and the odd pattern of results – passed an evidential threshold and we contacted the DfE the moment this happened,” Oates said. Cambridge Assessment’s warnings in July spurred the DfE into action, pushing Ofqual to allow schools to appeal if “the grades of unusually high or low ability students been affected by the model” or if they received a “very different pattern of grades” compared with previous years. Sources within the government say that Ofqual assured the DfE that the enhanced appeals process would be enough to cope with what it said would be a small number of unusual cases generated by its algorithm. In a statement to parliament on Tuesday, Williamson admitted that the appeals process that was to fix Ofqual’s model would have been inadequate. He told MPs: “Ofqual had put in place a system for arriving at grades that was believed to be fair and robust. It became clear however that there were far too many inconsistent and unfair outcomes for A-level students, and that it was not reasonable to expect these to be dealt with, even through a boosted and enhanced appeals process. “This situation has I know caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty and I’m deeply sorry that those who have borne the brunt of it have been students themselves. I can only apologise to them for this. “We took immediate action to provide certainty, as soon as it was clear that if we didn’t, too many students would receive grades that didn’t reflect their hard work and their ability.” But evidence submitted by Cambridge Assessment to the House of Commons education committee – ahead of its questioning of Roger Taylor, the Ofqual chair – shows that it approached the regulator and DfE a second time after it had found a significant flaw within a database used by Ofqual’s model that caused grades to be dragged down. A timeline included in the evidence states: “14 August: Cambridge Assessment informs secretary of state’s office and Ofqual’s chair [Roger Taylor] that the likely cause of the anomalous centre grades appears to be the way in which Ofqual had implemented its national standards correction to maintain standards. The same issues were likely to arise with GCSE results.” The timeline explains Williamson’s comments that he only learned of the serious problems within Ofqual’s model the weekend following A-levels, because it was then that the flaw was identified as likely to also affect GCSE results. Cambridge Assessment’s evidence reveals: “We suggested to the DfE that GCSE results should be delayed and rerun, and we made Ofqual aware of the detail of our analysis and of our policy recommendations. Ultimately, Ofqual took another course of action.” Taylor later announced that both A-levels and GCSE grades would be decided by school assessments. Ofqual said: “These are astonishing comments. Cambridge Assessment and OCR were totally key to the development, testing and quality assurance of the algorithm right from the beginning through to delivery. Their warning about A-levels came a day after results were released and was incorrect. “It also came as Ofqual itself was developing a possible appeals process. Ultimately, it’s clear that no appeals process would have provided a satisfactory outcome to this affair while still retaining national standards. That is why Ofqual ended up returning to centre-assessed grades.” Relations between Ofqual and the DfE have deteriorated throughout the summer, culminating in Taylor’s threat to resign just days before GCSE results were published unless he was backed by the government. Last week Sally Collier, the chief regulator, stepped down. Williamson has been the target of derision after he insisted there would be no U-turn on awarding grades through assessments, following school closures and exam cancellations prompted by the coronavirus pandemic. But Cambridge Assessment’s revelations lend support to Williamson’s insistence that he did everything he could to press Ofqual on its methods. Last month the Times reported that a former director general of the DfE, Sir Jon Coles, had raised the alarm with Williamson in July, expressing his concerns over the accuracy of the algorithm. In its evidence to the education committee, Cambridge Assessment will say that confidence in GCSE and A-levels “has been eroded by events this summer and it needs to be urgently rebuilt”. The exam board said the fiasco could have been avoided “if extensive checking of individual school and college results had been conducted prior to A-level results being awarded”. But Ofqual appears to have done little or no modelling of its algorithm’s impact on individual schools, relying instead on the national distribution of exam results. A spokesperson for the DfE declined to comment."

          "bodyText": "No one can accuse Boris Johnson of not seeing the big picture. After a summer of U-turns – helpfully described by the prime minister as merely strategic tacking into the head of a gale; thank heavens there was a purpose to months of chaos after all – Boris chose to mark parliament’s return by announcing that he was joining LinkedIn. Though with his own CV carefully doctored to omit most of his own career embarrassments. But what some ministers will be really watching for is whether they get an email from Boris to link in with him. Not least Gavin Williamson. Private Pike’s summer from hell has been pure, unrequited joy for most of his cabinet colleagues as it has meant the spotlight has been off them. Their departments have been left to trundle on uninterrupted regardless of any number of minor cock-ups. Matt Hancock looks positively refreshed: though his lucky pink tie still looks as if it is only held together by the stains, he is almost back to his Tiggerish self. Everything is once again for the best in the best of all possible worlds for Matt. Before the summer recess, Hancock looked close to breaking point. Brittle, snappy and unsure of himself. Now he is a man reborn. Called to answer what could have been an awkward urgent question on the government’s ongoing mishandling of the coronavirus crisis, Matt just breezed his way through. He by and large ignored questions about why his department had chosen to dismantle Public Health England in the middle of a pandemic and headed up the new body with Dido Harding, a woman whose CV bears even less scrutiny than the prime minister’s. Most startlingly of all he repeatedly claimed that Typhoid Dido’s track-and-trace system was meeting all its targets – it has consistently missed them for the past nine weeks – and praised the government’s response as world beating. “We are in the top tranche internationally,” he boasted. As in the top tranche both for mortality rates and for those countries who don’t actually have a mass testing system against which we can compare ourselves. He even seemed quite thrilled by the prospect of France and Spain having a second wave. He was sick and tired of them getting so many good headlines early in the pandemic. It was probably just as well Boris had chosen to end recess early. Another week and Matt could have been on the same wavelength as former Australian prime minister – and possibly soon to be joint trade president for the UK – Tony Abbott, who had interrupted his usual round of abuse that morning to use a speech to say that maybe the coronavirus had done the world a favour. People should be just chilling a bit. All that had happened was that some of the weak and vulnerable had been culled by natural selection. Nice. Gavin didn’t have things nearly so easy as he was forced to come to the Commons to explain the Department of Education’s dismal performance over the summer. On the plus side, it was too early to say just how many schools had managed to return with a full head count of pupils, so he was able to act as if everything had passed off relatively smoothly. Which it probably had, when put up against every other clusterfuck. If Private Pike had been spending the morning brushing up his own LinkedIn profile – who could forget that glory, glory night in 2007 at the St Albans Travelodge when he had won ‘Fireplace Salesman of the Year’ for the second time? – then it’s a fair bet there would also have been a fair bit of revisionism to match Boris’s. Out would have gone being sacked for leaking details of a National Security Council meeting, along with every departmental cock-up since March this year. It’s a long list. So much so, that the most striking feature of Gav’s Commons statement was its amnesia. He had forgotten that it had been him who had ordered Ofqual to devise an exam algorithm that prioritised minimising grade inflation over and above the impact on less well-off students from traditionally poor-performing schools. Ofqual had been to blame, he declared, and he had taken “immediate” action to rectify the situation once it had been brought to his attention. Immediate, as in saying students should stop moaning for the best part of a week so that many missed out on their first choice universities. And he also wanted to pay tribute to Sally Collier, the outgoing chief executive of Ofqual, who had done the decent thing and agreed to be sacked after it had been made clear to her that no one at the DfE was going to take responsibility for Gav’s mistakes. Labour’s shadow education secretary, Kate Green, merely read through the charge sheet yet again. Somehow it becomes more damning on every retelling. She did stop short of demanding Gav’s resignation though. Mainly because there is no point. In any normal world Williamson would have gone long ago, but we are way through that looking glass. Gavin gets to stay merely because Boris needs someone to sack in case anything else goes wrong in the next few months. Sack him now and there’s no one but Boris left to take the hit. So Private Pike is the classic useful idiot. Another asset to add to his LinkedIn CV. Which reminded him. There was still no invitation to share his profile with the prime minister."

          "bodyText": "Matt Hancock has insisted that England’s system of tracing and testing suspected coronavirus carriers is in the “top tranche” internationally, despite widespread criticism of its performance. He made the claim during his first appearance in the House of Commons after a summer of confusion, testing mishaps and government U-turns in its policy on Covid-19. Since its creation in May, NHS test and trace has often failed to reach the 80% of confirmed cases and their contacts that public health experts say is needed for the system to be effective, which is itself vital to help reduce the risk of a second lockdown. The health secretary was asked by the Conservative MP Jack Lopresti how his assessment of the performance of NHS test and trace compared with the equivalent programme in other countries and what lessons the system in England was learning from its counterparts, including in Germany and South Korea. Hancock replied: “Well, of course, we learn the lessons and I talk to my international counterparts, including in Germany and South Korea. Actually, compared to international systems … we are now absolutely in the top tranche and we’re constantly looking all around the world to how we can improve the operation of test and trace.” However, opposition MPs said that its performance was much less impressive than Hancock claimed. Dr Philippa Whitford, the Scottish National party’s health spokeswoman, stressed that the test-and-trace system in Scotland, which is run by local councils and Public Health Scotland, is getting hold of more than 99% of contacts and asking them to get tested and self-isolate. She asked Hancock if the Department of Health and Social Care has included any targets for how many contacts should be traced in its contracts with Serco and Sitel, the private firms that are providing the call handlers for England’s test-and-trace system. The minister did not answer. Justin Madders, a Labour shadow health minister, accused Hancock of wasting public money on private companies that had so far not performed well enough. “In some areas private companies involved in test and trace have been reaching less than half of the contacts they’re supposed to, not the 80% that [Hancock] claims. “So you don’t need an algorithm to work out that their performance, when compared to local public health teams, is where test and trace is failing. So why then is it that this government is rewarding private sector failure by extending these contracts?” Madders added. Hancock defended NHS test and trace, which is run by Dido Harding, the Conservative peer who has also been put in charge of the new body that is replacing Public Health England. Last week it reached 84.3% of contacts and asked them to isolate in cases where contact details were given, he said. “Since its launch we’ve reached over 300,000 people who may have been unwittingly carrying the virus and transmitting it, to ensure that they keep themselves safe and keep their communities safe,” he said. A new advertising campaign is being launched soon to remind people of what they can do to help reduce the spread of coronavirus, including washing their hands, covering their face, staying 2-metres apart from those nearby and getting tested if they are displaying any symptoms, he said."

In a statement to MPs, in response to a Tory backbencher who proposed extending the secondary school day by 30 minutes to help pupils make up for the education they had lost, Williamson said that that idea had merit for some pupils - but that it would be for individual schools to decide if they wanted to adopt it. He said: As part of the advice that was worked up along with the Education Endowment Foundation, one of their key recommendations was looking at how you can extend the school day, how you can look at provisional weekends in order to support children who really do need that little bit of extra help in order for them to have a real impact in terms of their educational attainment. All of these measures can have an enormously positive effect and that’s why we developed a £1bn Covid catch-up fund because schools then have the ability to take such action. Labour’s Kate Green said Williamson was responsible for a “summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion that has caused enormous stress” to parents, pupils and teachers. But Williamson received very little criticism from Conservatives in the chamber, despite the fact that his U-turn over A level grades last month created abysmal headlines for the government. Boris Johnson’s claim that Britons are going back to the office “in huge numbers” (see 11.20am) has been undermined by figures showing the traditional mass return to the workplace failed to materialise in London, with passenger numbers on the tube and buses rising more slowly than usual for the end of summer. Johnson has moved to mollify angry backbenchers disillusioned by the number of government U-turns, admitting the government has been forced to backtrack on multiple issues throughout the pandemic but insisting it is on the right course. Tax increases will be needed across the board for Britain’s highest and lowest earners to bring down record levels of government debt amassed during the coronavirus crisis, leading economists have warned. Plans to lift coronavirus restrictions for more than half a million people in Greater Manchester have been thrown into “chaos and confusion” as local leaders urged the government to change course after a sharp rise in infections. Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister tipped to become a UK trade envoy, has railed against Covid “health dictatorships”, saying the economic cost of lockdowns meant families should be allowed to consider letting elderly relatives with the coronavirus die by letting nature take its course. The Scottish government will propose the timescale and question for a second referendum on Scottish independence by next spring, Nicola Sturgeon has said, as she pledged the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic would act as an accelerant and not a brake on the Scottish National party’s ambitions. That’s all from me for today. Our coronavirus coverage continues on our global coronavirus live blog. It’s here. A Department of Health official has been in touch to explain the figure that Matt Hancock cited earlier (see 2.50pm) when he said that the most recent test and trace figures show that 84.3% of contacts were reached, where contact details were provided. He was referring to figures in annex table 7 in the most recent report. This table shows that, of the close contacts identified of people testing positive for coronavirus, 75.5% of them were reached and told to self-isolate. But the chart also shows that no contact details were provided for some “close contacts”. Once these are excluded, the success rate rises to 84.3%. The government has published its latest daily coronavirus death toll for the UK. A further three deaths have been recorded. According to this chart, there have now been 41,504 UK coronavirus deaths, but this only counts people who have died within 28 days of testing positive. There are more than 10,000 more deaths that have been attributed to coronavirus, according to the ONS or other bodies, but are not included in this figure because the people who died were never tested. Today’s dashboard also shows that 1,295 more people have tested positive. Daily case numbers have now been increasing significantly since early July. As my colleague Nicola Davis explains here, this increase is partly, but not wholly, explained by the fact that testing is increasing too. In the Commons Bob Blackman, a Conservative, asks if the government is considering extending the school day for half an hour to allow pupils to catch up with the schooling they’ve missed. Williamson says that longer school hours, or even schooling at weekends, could benefit the children who need most help. But he implies that he will not be recommending this across the board. He says the government has a catch-up fund. But it will be for individual schools to decide what they do, he says. Robert Halfon, the Conservative MP who chairs the Commons education committee, says his committee published a report in July saying next year’s exams should be delayed. He says all pupils in school should be benchmarked, to help the decision as to whether exams should be delayed. Williamson says the government will be doing this to identify the “learning gaps” that children have. Williamson is responding to Green. He says he is pleased Labour wants children back in school. He says Green’s predecessor, Rebecca Long-Bailey, was “more ambivalent” about this. He says the government has already delivered a £1bn Covid catch-up fund. This will be spent on interventions that deliver results, he says. As for delaying next year’s exams, he says he said earlier this year that he would be asking Ofqual to look at this. Labour has not made a submission to Ofqual on this matter, he says. So he says he welcomes the fact that Labour is now backing his position on this. Kate Green, the shadow education secretary, is responding to Williamson now. She says there has been a “summer of chaos, incompetence and confusion that has caused enormous stress” to parents, pupils and teachers. She says Labour wants pupils in schools. She says Williamson was right to allow teacher-assessed grades to apply. But this approach still creates problems, she says. She asks Williamson to clarify when he was warned about the problems with the system. How many pupils missed a place at their first choice university? And how many universities are losing students because they are now going somewhere else? Turning to school reopening, Green asks when schools will start to get the support they need to help pupils catch up. She says she was glad to read that the government is considering delaying exams next summer. (See 9.48am.) But will plans for this be in place by the end of this month? Williamson is now speaking about school opening. He says pupils and parents should be assured they are returning to a safe environment. He says whole-year groups will be kept separate. In addition, other measures are in place to protect health. And schools are being issued with PPE equipment, in case a pupil develops symptoms when they are on the premises. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is making a statement to MPs. He starts by addressing the exam results situation. He says Ofqual put in place a system for allocated grades “that was believed to be fair and robust”. But too many of the results were unfair, he says. And that is why the rules were changed, and students were allowed to keep the grades assessed by their teachers. Williamson repeats his apology to students. He says he is “deeply sorry” for what they went through. He says some students will still be unhappy with their grades. And for some student, such as those who are home educated, there was not enough evidence available to allow them to have a grade. For this group, exams will be available. He says universities have agreed to give places to students who have got their grades where possible. Where that is not possible, they will offered alternative courses or allowed to defer for a year. He says Sally Collier, who was head of Ofqual, has decided that the next stage of the process should be overseen by someone else. He says he wishes her well. Downing Street has released a further extract from what Boris Johnson told the cabinet at the start of their meeting this morning. He defended the various government policy changes announced over recent weeks and months (or “U-turns”, as they are normally called by the media) on the grounds that the government had to respond to changing circumstances. Overall, the government had not been “blown off course”, he claimed. He said: In the last few months we’ve been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question. And I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind’s change, but we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out, and we have not been blown off that course. And that is thanks to you, to the government, but it is overwhelming with thanks to the British people and the way they have come together, the way the whole country has come together to defeat the virus, so thank you all for everything that you have done. And of course I think there is still going to be some turbulence ahead, and of course things are still going to be difficult on the economic front, and of course we still need to get this disease absolutely out of our systems, but I am absolutely confident that, if we continue in the way that we have, that there will be calmer days, brighter days and calmer seas ahead of us. Last week we published a list of 11 coronavirus U-turns. Some of them could be justified on the grounds that the government was responding to changing circumstances (for example, the UK scientific advice on face coverings has changed over recent months) but many of these decisions (eg, school meal vouchers, the A-level algorithm) were simply cases of the government admitting that its initial decisions were wrong. According to the Financial Times’ Jim Pickard, figures from Transport for London suggest Tube and bus use in London has increased by less than 10% compared with this time last week. These figures undermine Boris Johnson’s claim earlier (see 11.20am) that “people are going back to the office in huge numbers”. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary who now chairs the Commons health committee, asks if the government intends to roll out regular weekly testing for NHS staff. Hancock says he wants to deploy testing as widely as possible, following clinical advice. Hancock is responding to Ashworth. He says he “bows to no one” in his enthusiasm for mass testing. He says he pushed his neck out when he set the 100,000 tests per day target. Now the government needs to increase testing again, he says. But he says he will only use tests that have been validated. Saliva tests are still being worked on, he says. Turning to local testing, he says local lockdowns are working. And the government does publish the data used to justify them, he says. He says councils are required to seek consensus with local elected officials, including MPs, before announcing local lockdowns. But he says in some cases it is not possible to reach a consensus. On vaccines, he says MPs are at one in their “abhorrence” at the anti-vax movement. He says a vaccine will only be rolled out when it has been approved by regulators. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary, is responding to Hancock. He says the government’s test and trace system is now yet “world-beating”, as Boris Johnson promised. (See 3.26pm.) He says Hancock now seems to support mass testing. When will weekly testing by introduced for all frontline NHS workers? He asks when a rapid test will be introduced, and who will be able to get it first? And will a saliva test be rolled out? He asks why Hancock ignored local council leaders, but followed the advice of the Tory MP Sir Graham Brady, chair of the backbench Conservative 1922 Committee, when he agreed to lift some restrictions in the north-west. And he asks why Hancock thinks restructuring Public Health England now will help. Ashworth ends by saying that the UK has suffered by the highest per capita death rate from coronavirus of any developed country in the world. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is now making a statement to MPs about coronavirus. He says the number of deaths is now very low. The latest daily death toll recorded just two deaths, he says. But he says that in France and Spain the number of cases is increasing “exponentially”. And he says hospital cases are going up too. He says the government must remain vigilant. He summarises the steps it is taking. It will be reminding people what they can do to stop the spread of the virus. An advertising campaign will remind people to wash their hands, cover their faces in certain places and socially distance. And people who are ill should get a test, he says. He says testing and contact tracing continues. Some 60m tests have been carried out, he says. He says the government is looking at new technology to improve testing. More financial support is being made available, from today, for people who need to self-isolate, he says. And he says that work is continuing on a vaccine. And he says the government will bring forward plans so that, when a vaccine does become available, a wider range of medical personnel are allowed to vaccinate people. During a wide-ranging statement on the Scottish government’s programme for 2020-21, that includes a commitment to youth training, the expansion of digital access for poorer households, green investment and a review of adult social care to examine options for the creation a National Care Service investment, Nicola Sturgeon said that, if she was governing an independent country and not having to deal with the “self-sabotage” of Brexit, she could contemplate even more far-reaching plans, including “a migration system that welcomes talent at all levels and supports people to make Scotland their home” and a universal basic income. She pledged that, by next spring, her government would publish a draft bill “setting out the proposed terms and timing of an independence referendum”, as well as the proposed question that people will be asked in that referendum. She added that at next May’s Holyrood elections – in which the SNP are already predicted to win a majority – “we will make the case for Scotland to become an independent country, and seek a clear endorsement of Scotland’s right to choose our own future”. In a move welcomed by children’s campaigners, Sturgeon announced what she described as “one of the most ambitious pieces of legislation in the 20 year history of devolution”: the full and direct incorporation into Scots law of the United Nations convention on the rights of the child. She said: This will mean public authorities - including the Scottish government - will be required by law to act in ways compatible with the convention’s requirements to recognise, respect and be accountable for the rights of children in what we do. Sturgeon said that committing to the vision of a National Care Service would match the postwar National Health Service, and insisted that investment in youth training would ensure that COVID will not be the defining experience for this current generation of young people. The full 139-page Scottish government programme for 2020-21 is here (pdf). And here is Sturgeon’s introduction. Here is the full quote from Matt Hancock in the Commons earlier when he claimed that England’s test-and-trace system was now “in the top tranche” internationally. Hancock was responding to a question from the Conservative MP Jack Lopresti, who wanted to know how the country was doing by international standards. Hancock replied: Well, of course, we learn the lessons and I talk to my international counterparts including in Germany and South Korea. Actually, compared to international systems ... we are now absolutely in the top tranche and we’re constantly looking all around the world to how we can improve the operation of test and trace. In May Boris Johnson promised that a “world-beating” test-and-trace system would be up and running by 1 June. A national system did launch in England before the start of June, but in its early days it was widely criticised and, as this Twitter thread explains, in some respects it is still performing badly. Johnson, though, has defended the “world-beating” tag on the grounds that “we are now testing more per head of population than virtually any other country in Europe”. NHS England has announced nine further coronavirus hospital deaths this afternoon. Seven were in the north-west, one was in the south-east and one was in the Midlands. The full details are here. In Wales one further death has been announced. But no further deaths have been announced in Scotland or in Northern Ireland. Setting out her programme for government for the coming year in the Holyrood equivalent of the Queen’s Speech, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, began by announcing an additional 154 positive cases of coronavirus confirmed yesterday. Sturgeon said she wanted to “draw attention to the fact that 66 of today’s cases are in greater Glasgow and Clyde, and the situation there is causing us some concern”. She told the chamber that further analysis was under way, and that she would be chairing a meeting of the resilience committee later this afternoon to consider what action may be necessary, raising immediate concerns about stricter guidance being reintroduced across the city. Sturgeon went on to emphasise that the pandemic did not mean her government would simply “hunker down”. “Even amidst the uncertainties of a global pandemic, this is a time to be ambitious. To use the disruption of Covid to rethink how we do things.” Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, is taking questions in the Commons now. There is a live feed at the top of the blog. In response to the first question, from Labour’s Sam Tarry, who claimed that the test-and-trace system was repeatedly failing to hit its target for the number of contacts of people testing positive reached and advised to self-isolate (80% is the goal), Hancock said the most recent figures showed 84.3% of contacts were reached, where contact details were provided. In response to another question, he said England’s test-and-trace system was “in the top tranche” internationally. Hancock did not clarify exactly where the 84.3% figure came from. The latest weekly bulletin from NHS test and trace, published last week, said 75.5% of contacts were reached in the last week for which figures were available. After that document was published, the Press Association’s Ian Jones posted this on Twitter. UPDATE: A Department of Health official has been in touch to explain the figure. See 5.54pm. No 10 issued its downbeat assessment for the prospects of the trade talks with the EU (see 1.57pm) as the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, met his opposite number, Michel Barnier, in London to prepare for formal talks next week, a round deemed critical by Brussels if a deal is to be reached before the end of the year. France’s EU affairs minister, Clément Beaune, warned that no deal was a risk, but blamed the British government for the impasse. “Things are not advancing because the UK would like to have its cake and eat it: to leave the European Union and have access to the European market.” Speaking on France Culture, he said the EU would not compromise on linking market access to respect for its rules on health and the environment. The EU has said the UK can only have tariff-free, quota-free access to the European market if it agrees to respect European standards on environment, workers’ rights and state aid for companies. EU officials dismissed reports that Barnier was refusing to discuss British proposals on a future fisheries treaty. “The UK has not presented new legal texts in the area of fisheries,” a spokesman for Barnier said. He went on: We have been engaging constructively and in good faith. Michel Barnier said at the end of the last round of negotiations that we have shown flexibility by taking note of Prime Minister Johnson’s three red lines and working on them. We have not seen, however, a reciprocal effort on the UK’s side regarding European priorities. We are now waiting for the UK to present concrete and constructive proposals. Boris Johnson has posted this on Twitter, promoting his new LinkedIn account. (See 1.57pm.) According to the BBC’s Andrew Sinclair, the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in the outbreak at the Banham poultry factory in Norfolk has now passed 100. The Downing Street lobby briefing has finished. Here are the main points. The prime minister’s spokesman said Brussels was making it “very difficult” for the two sides to make progress in the UK-EU trade talks. In a statement likely to heighten fears that London is preparing for the talks to collapse, and for the UK to be left without a trade deal with the EU once the transition period ends in December, the spokesman said: We concluded the seventh round of negotiations on the 21 August and, while we had useful [discussions], little progress was made. An agreement is still possible, and it is still our goal, but it is clear that it will not be easy to achieve. The EU is still insisting, not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further work can be done in any other areas of the negotiation, including on legal text, making it very difficult to make progress. We will continue to work had to reach agreement and look forward to the next round taking place next week. No 10 has in recent weeks repeatedly been stressing the possibility of the talks ending in no deal, but this is one of most negative briefings we’ve had yet. The spokesman said there was no change to the government’s commitment to maintaining the 0.7% aid target, which obliges the government to spend 0.7% of national wealth on overseas aid. At the weekend the Sun reported that the target, which is deeply unpopular with many Tory MPs, would be axed. Asked about the report, the spokesman said there was “no change” to the government’s commitment to spend 0.7% of national wealth on aid. He went on: We have discussed previously the large amounts of speculation that you have read over the weekend. It was just that - speculation. There is on change with regard to the commitment on 0.7%. The spokesman said that Anne-Marie Trevelyan, the international development secretary, would be eligible for a pay-off when her job ends tomorrow. Her department is being merged with the Foreign Office, and today was her last cabinet meeting. The spokesman refused to endorse what Tony Abbott said this morning about social distancing measures being undesirable. (See 12.14pm.) The spokesman said Johnson wanted people to follow social distancing rules. The spokesman also claimed that no final decision has yet been made as to whether Abbott, the rightwing former Australian PM, will be made a UK trade envoy. My colleague Patrick Wintour’s full story about Abbott’s comments is here. Johnson told cabinet this morning that the government would not let the coronavirus crisis distract it from its domestic agenda, the spokesman said. Cabinet ministers were told this morning that the country needed to remain “vigilant” about the risk posed by coronavirus, the spokesman said. The warning came from Prof Chris Whitty, the government’s chief medical adviser, and Sir Patrick Vallance, its chief scientific adviser, who briefed cabinet. The spokesman was unable to provide figures to justify Boris Johnson’s claim at cabinet that Britons are returning to the office “in huge numbers”. (See 11.20am.) Asked what evidence there was to back this up, the spokesman said that having schools go back would give parents greater flexibility. But he added: “It is too soon for us to be able to share figures with you about people returning to work today.” When it was put to him that it would be more accurate for the PM to say he wants people to return to the office in large numbers rather than claiming that they are already, the spokesman repeated the point about his not having data available to share. But he stressed the benefits of people returning to the office. It was good for employees’ learning and development, he said; staff benefited from being able to meet face to face; and having workers in offices was good for the local economy. The spokesman said government adverts would be rolled out later this week encouraging people to return to the workplace. He said: Later this week you can expect us to run our latest phase of our All In, All Together campaign and what that will look at is reiterating our guidance on how to return safely to work. It is the campaign we have been running with both regional and local media. Some of the things we’ve looked at so far is the support that is available to businesses, how to shop safely and also what people need to know about NHS Test and Trace. The next phase we’ll look at is specifically the guidance on how to get back to work safely, and you can expect to see that later this week. The spokesman said that Boris Johnson is joining LinkedIn, the employment networking social media site. The spokesman said that he would be using it to engage with business as the economy recovers and that he would be posting written and video content on it promoting British business. The spokesman effectively confirmed reports that Johnson asked Prince William to agree that Simon Case could become the next cabinet secretary. Case had been due to return to his post at the prince’s private secretary. Asked about the reports, the spokesman said: I saw that report ... I don’t think I would have any argument with it. As you would expect, No 10 works closely with the Royal Household. Tom Newton Dunn from Times Radio posted a Twitter thread on this last night. It starts here. The spokesman said that around 40% of schools in England were reopening today. Other schools are reopening later (sometimes because teachers have inset days). Asked how the process was going, the spokesman said that he did not have figures on the proportion of pupils returning yet, but he said in Leicestershire, where pupils started returning last week, there was a good response. The full data about the proportion of pupils in class is due to be published on 15 September. The spokesman refused to say what proportion of Whitehall civil servants were working in the office. But he did say: “You can expect to see more civil servants return to the office in the coming weeks.” The spokesman refused to endorse what Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said last week about it being fine for his officials to work from home. Hancock said he was concerned about the quality of their work, not their location. But, asked if the PM agreed, the spokesman said he wanted more workers back in the office. The spokesman confirmed that Ofqual is carrying out a consultation into whether next year’s A-levels and GCSEs should be delayed to help pupils catch-up on missed learning. He said: The education secretary [Gavin Williamson] wrote to Ofqual about this on June 18. Ofqual then began a consultation on the idea of exams starting after the May half-term. Ofqual will set out their final view in due course and we will wait to see what that recommendation is. Exams in Wales could be delayed next summer, the country’s education minister, Kirsty Williams, has said. Speaking at the Welsh government’s weekly press conference, Williams said Qualifications Wales was in discussion with colleagues across the UK about a change to next summer’s exam timetable. She said: It is our intention at this time to hold examinations next year. There are discussions about when those examinations may take place. But she said any delay to next year’s exams would have a “knock-on effect” on matters such as progression to university and results day. “It does need careful consideration.” Williams said teachers had already been told about adaptations they should make to courses including, for instance, reducing the number of texts literature students needed to work on. On going back to school, she said it was “critical” for children’s development and health and that “every precaution” had been taken to minimise risk and ensure health and safety. “Wales is ready to go back to school, to go back to college,” she said. Bolton council is urging the government to abandon plans to ease the lockdown restrictions in the town from tomorrow, my colleague Josh Halliday reports. As Josh reports in a story this morning, the decision to ease restrictions in some areas in the north-west of England that was announced at the end of last week was strongly opposed by some local Labour MPs and council leaders. This is from ITV’s Paul Brand on what Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is likely to say in his statement to MPs later. Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, has admitted he made a “mistake” when he broke social distancing guidelines by shaking hands with a colleague this morning (see 10.03am), Sky’s Joe Pike reports. These are from my colleague Patrick Wintour, who was listening this morning to Tony Abbott, the former Australian PM who has been lined up for a job as a UK trade envoy. Abbott cast doubt on the wisdom of using lockdown policies to save lives during the coronavirus pandemic. Business Insider’s Adam Bienkov has more details of what Abbott said. The Cabinet Office has confirmed that Simon Case has been appointed as the new cabinet secretary. My colleague Peter Walker previewed the appointment in a story last night. Here is the news release from the Cabinet Office. And here is a quote on the appointment from Boris Johnson. Simon will make a fantastic cabinet secretary and head of the civil service. His years of experience at the heart of government and working for the royal household make him ideally suited for this crucial role. I would also like to thank Mark Sedwill for his outstanding service to the government and the country as a whole. After serving for decades with great distinction, I believe he has earned the gratitude of the nation. (Johnson, of course, effectively sacked Sedwill, Case’s predecessor.) Yesterday’s Guardian story was illustrated with a picture of a clean-shaven Case, the most up-to-date available. But the Cabinet Office has this morning issued a new picture showing that Case now has a beard. At 41, Case is the youngest cabinet secretary to be appointed since Maurice Hankey in 1916 (not necessarily a bad thing, although some commentators have questioned his relative lack of experience), and the new look probably conveys a bit more gravitas. Sky News has broadcast a clip of Boris Johnson addressing cabinet at the start of today’s meeting. It was standard Johnson boosterism. He said: People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country, and quite right too. And, of course, we know that there is still going to be more of this disease, this wretched Covid, still to come, and although we know there’ll be more outbreaks, we’re also absolutely confident that we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks, and bit by bit this incredible country is getting back on its feet. It is not clear yet what evidence there is to support Johnson’s claim that people are returning to the office “in huge numbers”. Last week there were multiple reports (eg here and here) saying the opposite. I’m back in the Guardian office in the House of Commons for the first time since March, but the roads were quiet and the pavements relatively empty as I came into Westminster. If people are embracing commuting in large numbers in London, I didn’t spot it. Boris Johnson is chairing a socially distanced cabinet meeting today in the Locarno Suite in the Foreign Office. It might not be as cosy as the Downing Street cabinet room, but it’s a great setting for pictures. The UK manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest rate for over six years in August, as companies restarted operations following the pandemic, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports in his business live blog. But firms are still cutting staff. There are more details here. Here is Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, arriving for work at No 10 this morning with his colleague Cleo Watson. Like the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, (see 10.03am), he seems to be taking a relatively relaxed approach to social distancing guidance. As Alex Wickham reports in the Politico London Playbook briefing, Cummings and his staff are moving into a new office in the Cabinet Office. But, according to Wickham, there have been teething problems. The fabled “NASA-style” control room needs work, according to an official who says it actually resembles an “underwhelming” large open plan whitewashed modern office, “like a call centre” ... The ultimate aim is to have a series of TV screens and projectors on the walls beaming in extremely detailed live data on coronavirus numbers from private tech companies, then eventually stats on how the government’s “Project Speed” infrastructure programmes are progressing. Which does sound kinda cool, but unfortunately for a project titled Speed, they are yet to be installed. A Whitehall “Thick Of It” fan tells Playbook it’s currently more like “DoSAC season 1” than Apollo 11. In the Commons we’ve got an urgent question for Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on coronavirus at 3.30pm. And then there will be a statement from Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, covering exams and school reopening, starting probably around 4.15pm. UPDATE: The coronavirus UQ has been updated to a statement, Labour whips reports. There is not much difference between a UQ and a ministerial statement. Both involve a minister taking questions from MPs on a particular topic. But a statement takes place when a government department voluntarily offers one, while a UQ involves a minister being obliged to answer a question approved by the Speaker. Ministerial statements also tend to last a bit longer (a full hour). Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, was filmed by Sky News shaking hands with a colleague on his way into Downing Street this morning. It is not known yet who he was greeting, but from the clip it seemed to be someone he knew and was pleased to see – but perhaps not someone from his household or support bubble, which would make this a breach of social distancing guidance. During his morning interview round Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, confirmed that school exams could be delayed next year to allow more time for catch-up teaching. (See 8.21am and 8.36am.) Gibb’s boss, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the same thing in a comment that provided today’s Telegraph splash. Williamson said: I know there’s some concern about next year’s exams, and that’s why we’ve been working with [the exams watchdog] Ofqual on changes we can make to help pupils when they take GCSEs and A-levels next year. Ofqual will continue to work with the education sector and other stakeholders on whether there should be a short delay to the GCSE, A- and AS-level exam timetable in 2021, with the aim of creating more teaching time. According to the Telegraph, “allies” of Williamson (ie Williamson himself, or his aides, speaking on background), said that if exams were delayed, they would start in June or early July, instead of May, but they would not run into the summer holidays. If exams are delayed, Labour will be able to chalk this up as a minor win because the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, was calling for exactly this at the weekend. (Perhaps she was just proposing the inevitable, but pushing at an open door is a sensible and entirely legitimate opposition tactic.) Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. I’m back from my summer break, and I hope you’ve all managed a decent holiday too. For the last few months Politics Live has been functioning as the Guardian’s UK coronavirus blog, because there is so much overlap between politics and coronavirus, and that will continue for the time being. Generally we will be mainly focusing on coronavirus developments, but non-coronavirus politics will get covered too, and some of the time that might take precedence. Here is the agenda for the day. 9.30am: Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and other thinktank experts give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about tax after coronavirus. 10am: Boris Johnson chairs cabinet. 10am: Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister being lined up for a role as a UK trade envoy, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank. Later, at 3pm, he will give evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee. 12pm: Downing Street lobby briefing. After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minster, makes a statement to the Scottish parliament about her government’s programme for 2020-21. 2.30pm: Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, takes questions in the Commons as MPs sit for the first time after the summer recess. After 3.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs. Hancock and Priti Patel, the home secretary, may also give Commons statements. Asked about a teachers’ survey suggesting that the average pupil is three months behind where they should be with their learning, Gibb said it showed the importance of children being back in school. He told Today: The important thing now is that young people are back in school, back being taught by their teachers. Over the lockdown period, schools worked hugely, very hard to make sure there was work for students to do, online lessons and so on. But ... it is always harder, even for the most hard-working student at home, to learn as effectively in that environment as opposed to being at school with your teacher. He also defended the level of access to technology during the schools shutdown after the same survey suggested a quarter of pupils did not have access to a computer or tablet at home. Schools didn’t just rely on online lessons, they also had other work sent home and so on. But we did procure one of the biggest procurement of computers in this country – over 200,000 computers were bought on a global market and given over to schools. And we’ve also acquired a further reserve of over 100,000 computers for areas of the country with local restrictions in place, should that happen. Here’s a little more on Gibb’s assertion that the time needed for exam marking and the university admissions process is being considered as part of any decision on pushing next year’s summer exam season back. He told Today: The issues are not simple. We have to take into account the other nations in the UK which also use the GCSEs and A-levels in their term dates; you have to take into account the time for marking, making sure results are delivered on a certain date for university admissions and so on. There are a whole range of factors that the exam boards, Ofqual and the Department [for Education] are looking at, but we will form a decision very soon. Pushed on whether an answer would come by October, Gibb said: It will be very soon because we know schools need to know the answer to this question and we have been working on it since mid-June. Gibb has said any pupil with coronavirus symptoms will be sent home from school to be tested, telling BBC Breakfast: I would urge parents to send their children back to school to help them to catch up on the lost education that they will inevitably have suffered during the lockdown period, and schools are doing everything they can to make sure that their pupils and their staff are safe. Asked what will happen if a child gets a cough or a cold, Gibb said: If a child is showing the symptoms of coronavirus then they will be asked to return home, to go home, and then the family asked to have a test. If that test proves positive, then the school will take advice from the local health protection teams and that will involve tracing all the children and adults that that child will have come across, and those people then will be asked to self-isolate. And then, if it is the advice of the local health protection team, a mobile testing unit will go into the school as well to test more young people. But he refused to commit to routine testing of teachers, pupils and parents, claiming that the scientific advice given to the government suggested testing was effective where people had symptoms. A decision on whether or not to delay next year’s GCSE and A-level exams will be made soon, Gibb has added. Perhaps seeking to avoid any eventual decision being seen as yet another U-turn, he stressed that ministers have been considering the issue since mid-June. Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb refused to commit to giving teachers and pupils clarity by October, but did say that officials were looking at oral examinations in foreign languages and practicals in science as they try to “reduce the burden of assessment so there’s more time for teaching”. Elsewhere, Gibb told BBC Breakfast: We’ll make a decision as soon as we can. We have to also take into account the other nations in the UK that use the GCSEs and A-levels, to take into account their issues as well, but we will be making a decision, with the regulator and the exam boards, very soon. The schools minister Nick Gibb has said he would be “delighted” to meet the footballer Marcus Rashford to discuss his campaign to tackle child food poverty. Gibb told BBC Breakfast: I’d be delighted to meet Marcus Rashford. We are looking at all the policy suggestions that he has put forward in his letter to make sure that they do deliver on our shared objective, which is alleviating the kind of poverty that he talks about. When Rashford first launched his campaign, Downing Street rejected it and ministers were sent out to publicly defend the government’s position. The following day, as public support for Rashford grew, the prime minister claimed to have only just learned of it and performed an embarrassing U-turn. Now, MPs are scrambling to line up behind the charismatic young Manchester United footballer and political activist. In a letter to MPs released on Tuesday morning, Rashford unveiled a “child food poverty taskforce” he has formed with brands including Aldi, Tesco, Deliveroo and Kellogg’s; set out three major new policy goals; and issued a rallying cry for long-lasting change. “Food poverty is contributing to social unrest,” he wrote, reflecting on a series of recent meetings with families in need of the same support he depended on as a child. He described “watching a young boy keeping it together whilst his mother sobbed alongside him, feeling like he has to step up to protect his family and alleviate some of that worry. He was nine years old.” “I know that feeling,” he wrote. “I remember the sound of my mum crying herself to sleep to this day, having worked a 14-hour shift, unsure how she was going to make ends meet. That was my reality.” As many as 50,000 people in the capital’s retail sector face losing their jobs due to the lack of visitors, according to the Tory MP for Cities of London and Westminster, Nickie Aiken. She said the loss of international visitors had seriously affected London’s economy, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: Almost half of the £10bn annual spend in the West End is from overseas travellers, and then the lack of office workers who have not been back at their desks since March, that has a huge effect on the overall turnover of West End shops and hospitality. Between about 70-80% – you’re basically looking at about 50,000 job losses, retail job losses, in West End retail alone. Aiken said she suspected a “huge falloff in confidence” regarding the perceived safety of public transport was partly behind the drop in shoppers, adding: We’ve got to get that back, we’ve got to get businesses, the mayor of London and government to work together to provide that confidence to get people back in. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s UK live blog. I’ll be taking you through the next few hours, before handing over to the usual custodian, Andrew Sparrow. Education debacle continues to dog ministers The coronavirus lockdown widened the gap between pupils in England from poorer backgrounds and their wealthier peers by 46%, according to the National Foundation for Educational Research, which has released research on the day hundreds of thousands return to schools. While the average learning lost was three months for all pupils, according to teachers, more than half of pupils at schools in the most deprived areas lost four months or more, compared with just 15% of those in the least deprived areas. That provides yet more evidence to support the claim that the UK’s approach to dealing with the pandemic has disproportionately hit the less well-off. The news came as the embattled education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said next year’s GCSE and A-level exams might have to be delayed to give students more time to study the syllabus. Williamson has been clinging on to his job after the exams fiasco, during which the government performed several embarrassing U-turns that caused severe disruption to people’s lives. Travellers from Portugal may face quarantine There is intense speculation that Portugal is to be taken back off the UK’s safe travel list – just a week after it was added – as the Iberian nation reported 21.1 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 30 August; passing the threshold often applied by the UK government of 20 per 100,000. The decision, not due before Thursday, would mean yet more upheaval for travellers, who were told they would not have to self-isolate on return from Portugal from 22 August. PM faces scrutiny All of this faces the government as MPs return to the Commons after recess. Boris Johnson is coming under pressure from his backbench MPs for clarity on taxes, and his education and pandemic policy. I will try to keep an eye BTL and respond to questions but the best way to get in touch with me is via Twitter, where I’m KevinJRawlinson."

          "headline": "Boris Johnson seeks to mollify Tory MPs dismayed by U-turns",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has moved to mollify angry backbenchers disillusioned by the number of government U-turns, admitting the government has been forced to backtrack on multiple issues throughout the pandemic but insisting it is on the right course. The prime minister has been facing a restive party as MPs return to Westminster, with several senior Conservatives expressing public dismay over the disaster of A-Level grading and chaotic communication over quarantine periods and the use of masks in schools and shops. Addressing cabinet ministers, Johnson acknowledged it had been “necessary to tack here and there”. “In the last few months we’ve been sailing into the teeth of a gale, no question,” Johnson said. “And I am no great nautical expert but sometimes it is necessary to tack here and there in response to the facts as they change, in response to the wind’s change, but we have been going steadily in the direction, in the course we set out and we have not been blown off that course.” Vocal critics of the government’s strategy include Charles Walker, the vice-chairman of the 1922 Committee, who said the government appeared like it “licks its finger and sticks it in the air to see which way the wind is blowing”. It is understood members of the 1922, which represents Conservative backbenchers, are seeking an urgent meeting with Johnson to relay colleagues’ concerns. Tory MPs are due to meet on Wednesday, in a hybrid meeting both online and in person, though no speaker has been confirmed. “Many of us are extremely concerned that the government says one thing one minute and 24 hours later, it changes,” another member of the 1922’s executive committee said. “Ministers have been on the TV on Saturday and Sunday insisting ‘this is the way forward’ and it’s an about-turn by Monday afternoon. “You just think: plan these things properly and say, we’re responding to the science. Don’t deny it until you inevitably have to cave in. Some of us could see the A-level fiasco coming a mile off and that has really dented confidence.” MPs were particularly angered by Gavin Williamson’s handling of the exam results algorithm, which downgraded almost 40% of students’ A-level grades, at first defended by the government and then ditched in favour of teacher-assessed grades. Other flashpoints included the wearing of masks in secondary schools in England, at first discouraged and then introduced as mandatory in lockdown areas. One former minister said MPs were returning to Westminster with “a sense of dismay about a lot of things” not just the conduct of U-turns but also the direction of planning reforms, which many MPs are concerned could see a spate of building in Tory shires, and the state of the Brexit negotiations. Another senior MP said Walker “spoke for a lot of us” with his criticism of the government’s strategy over the summer. In parliament on Tuesday, Conservative MPs made digs at the frequency of the government’s reversals. Veteran MP Sir Edward Leigh said: “We don’t want to have this thing where the man from Whitehall knows best ... especially when he changes his mind every two minutes. Can we please get back to being a proper Conservative government and trusting the people?” Johnson’s spokesman suggested U-turns were an inevitable part of responding to an unprecedented situation. “We have been responding to a global pandemic with an entirely novel virus and we have been guided by the scientific advice and as more is learned about the virus then we have ensured we have taken the right steps to keep the public safe,” he said. “But the PM is clear the government will not be knocked off course of levelling up the country.” Speaking at the first cabinet meeting after the summer recess, the prime minister said there would be further outbreaks of “this wretched Covid” but said he was “absolutely confident” they could be dealt with. Johnson also told cabinet ministers employees were “going back to the office in huge numbers across our country and quite right too”, though a Downing Street spokesman was unable to immediately provide evidence of a significant rise in the number of commuters. Concerned about the impact on city centres of the shift towards home-working, the government is expected publicity campaign in the coming days to encourage more workers to return to the office. Borrowing a phrase from Labour under Jeremy Corbyn, Johnson promised a “new green industrial revolution for the UK” and said there would be “some very exciting announcements we are preparing to make in the autumn, that I believe will help to deliver not only a cleaner, greener country but hundreds and thousands of new green jobs across the UK”. He said there was “still going to be some turbulence ahead and of course things are still going to be difficult on the economic front and of course we still need to get this disease absolutely out of our systems but I am absolutely confident that if we continue in the way that we have that there will be calmer days, brighter days and calmer seas ahead of us.”"

          "headline": "NUS president Larissa Kennedy: 'I worry universities won't put student and staff safety first'",
          "bodyText": "It’s been over two weeks since a disastrous A-level results day, and yet the fallout continues. Nearly 40% of predicted grades were downgraded by a flawed algorithm that was introduced when students’ exams were cancelled during the Covid-19 lockdown. Four days later, after much public outcry, the education secretary Gavin Williamson announced that results would instead be based on teachers’ own assessments. Lots of students who made their grades after the U-turn lost their 2020 university places. “It’s just been an utter shambles,” says Larissa Kennedy, the new president of the National Union of Students (NUS). “The government dug their heels in despite the fact that months ago we, alongside many others in the sector, said this would happen. Gavin Williamson should have owned up to the grave error much earlier on, and admitted that this was completely unjust.” Some students were worse affected by the blunder than others. Those from disadvantaged backgrounds were more likely to be downgraded, while private school students were awarded more than twice as many A and A* grades as comprehensive schools. Kennedy says she is worried about the long term effects this unfair system will have on the next generation. “It’s impacted who’s chosen which places, who’s had to pick a different university, who’s been forced to defer. And it will have an impact on the demographics of our universities. The fact this was based on last year’s results has exposed how education reproduces inequality.” Then there are those students who are still in limbo despite the U-turn. Many B-Tec students still haven’t received their results, while external candidates – such as home tutored students – have been left without grades. “We need to sort out the appeals process, the resits process, and make them free to use,” she says. Kennedy may only be 22, but she has six years of grassroots activism under her belt. She started as a 16-year-old Girl Guide, campaigning on sexual harassment in schools. She paused her studies in politics, international studies and Hispanic studies to become a student union officer at Warwick University. She was also president of its antiracism society. During this time she became interested in “how misogyny, racism, classism and other forms of oppression become reproduced by the education system” – which is more evident than ever during the Covid-19 crisis, she says. In the few weeks since becoming leader of the NUS, which represents seven million students, her work has been dominated by issues around coronavirus. Next month, students will return to campuses, where universities will decide their own safety measures. Some will run Covid testing schemes, for example, while most have promised teaching in person as well as online. “A real worry is that we cannot trust universities to put student and staff safety first, because they are too preoccupied with their position in the market,” says Kennedy, referring to a recent report by the Independent Sage committee, which recommended that universities should teach online as the default to avoid spreading the virus. “They’re committing to in-person teaching, which they haven’t necessarily thought through from a safety perspective because they’re in competition with other institutions. Immunocompromised students and disabled students are once again being erased from the conversation, and of course their staff counterparts.” As the NUS approaches its 100th year, Kennedy is excited for her term. But she inherits an organisation that has faced problems with low member turnout and a near financial collapse in recent years. She wants to work towards “a new NUS”, she says. What does she mean by that? “For a long time, we’ve run quite a lot of campaigns, and I’ve come in and said I want things to be really focused, but huge.” You could say Kennedy doesn’t have much choice but to focus on fewer campaigns, given last year’s cuts to NUS staff – but she is ambitious. She has two main campaigns: “First and foremost, we need to start thinking about what a fully funded, accessible, democratised education system looks like and the role of students at the heart of that,” she says. Her other priority, she says, is the decolonisation of universities – addressing biases that discriminate against black and minority ethnic students and staff. It’s an issue that has made headlines this year, with the revival of the Rhodes Must Fall campaign at Oxford University, for example. After five years of student campaigning, Oriel College finally agreed to remove its statue of the Victorian imperialist Cecil Rhodes. Kennedy acknowledges this progress, but she worries about the movement being diluted. “While it has gained traction, we’ve seen people using the language of decolonisation when they’re actually talking about some random diversity scheme they’re running. I’m wary of the ways that universities are saying, ‘Oh look at us, we’re decolonising’, to make that into something sellable. They assume they can take the language of decolonisation when it really belongs at the grassroots, with students, workers and communities who are doing that work.” Her first few weeks in the job have already been “a wild time”, she says. “I’m trying to look for the silver lining. The positive I can see is that students are angry … To see a U-turn of that scale in my seventh week as NUS president has energised me. I think we’re definitely going to see a more engaged and empowered student group coming up, because they’ve been through this and seen the reality.”"

          "headline": "TikTok US sale faces fresh hurdle after China tightens tech export rules",
          "bodyText": "New Chinese government restrictions could complicate ByteDance plans to sell TikTok to a US company and avoid a ban threatened by Donald Trump. Late on Friday, Beijing issued new restrictions or bans on tech exports, requiring companies to seek government approval – a process that can take up to 30 days. In mid-August, Trump gave the company 90 days to sell up or face a shutdown. The rules, which hadn’t been updated since 2008, are believed to be aimed at delaying the sale of TikTok to US buyers, as ordered by the US president. Some technologies were removed from the list of regulated exports, including vaccine technologies, but the 23 new additions included tech relating to AI interfaces, voice recognition, and content recommendation analysis. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm relies on domestic technology that might need to be transferred to a new overseas owner, Chinese trade expert Professor Cui Fan told state media. Cui told news agency Xinhua China was not in favour of “decoupling” from the US, but “some forefront technologies, however, might impact national security and public welfare, and need to be included in catalogue management”. Cui said ByteDance should “seriously and cautiously consider whether it is necessary to suspend the [TikTok sale negotiations]”. ByteDance said it was aware of the new rules and would “strictly abide by the regulations”. Trump has repeatedly accused the video app of threatening US national security, and earlier this month ordered Beijing-based ByteDance to sell TikTok to a US company within 90 days or be banned from the American market. He later issued a pair of executive orders banning US transactions with the Chinese companies that own TikTok and also WeChat, saying the US must take “aggressive action” in the interest of national security. Microsoft had been in talks for some weeks to buy the business, and last week partnered with Walmart to lodge a joint bid that will reportedly compete with Oracle Corp. The hugely popular app has joined telco Huawei to become a focus point of the continuing US-China dispute, and last week TikTok’s recently appointed chief executive, the former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, resigned citing the political situation. TikTok is suing the US government over Trump’s executive orders, and US-based WeChat users have launched a class action. A non-profit group named US WeChat Users Alliance, not affiliated with the app or its owner, Tencent, said it believed the orders violated the US constitution and Administrative Procedures Act, and that a ban would “severely affect the lives and the work of millions of people in the US”. “They will have a difficult time talking to family relatives and friends back in China. Countless people or businesses who use WeChat to develop and contact customers will also suffer significant economic losses.” Additional reporting by Lillian Yang."

          "headline": "After 'eat out to help out', many restaurants will still face disaster",
          "bodyText": "The government has treated the pandemic as a political campaign. Given the choice between style and substance, it has opted at every turn for big, splashy gestures, lurching from one gimmicky announcement to the next. But unlike many of its responses to the Covid-19 crisis, the “eat out to help out” scheme launched by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has been a remarkable PR hit with the British population. More than 60m discounted meals have been claimed as part of the scheme. The trade body UK Hospitality is calling for it to be extended, and some restaurants are funding their own discounts into September in a bid to keep footfall going. But while every eat out to help out restaurant participant I’ve spoken to has been grateful for the short-term boost, many have also been ambivalent about the scheme’s effects – and doubtful it has done enough to confront the deepening crisis the hospitality industry faces. The scheme has given a quick cash injection that offers little indication of whether participating restaurants will still be viable businesses come September. “It’s great that customers are feeling more comfortable coming out to eat and I do appreciate the help from the government, but I’m happy it’s done now and I don’t want it to be extended,” Mandy Yin, the chef-owner of Sambal Shiok Laksa Bar and Nasi Economy Rice in north London, tells me. After getting a pavement licence from the council that meant people could eat takeaway food outside, Yin signed up for eat out to help out. The scheme has dramatically boosted trade (“At Nasi it added on maybe 100% of normal revenue yesterday, and at Sambal Shiok it was probably about the same or even more”), but Yin doesn’t feel this has been sustainable. Being too busy might sound like a welcome problem after months of no diners at all, but the August footfall has had an impact on the mental and physical health of restaurant staff. After a quiet summer period, understaffed kitchens have been deluged with orders, and front-of-house teams are struggling to keep diners happy while carrying out safety protocols and adhering to social distancing. Restaurants have had a gruelling, erratic time during the pandemic; some have pivoted to selling groceries and takeaways just to keep their heads above water, before the short-term boost from eat out to help out arrived. Many staff are exhausted. And, of course, there’s the elephant in the room: although the appearance of diners in restaurants may visually suggest that everything has gone back to normal, coronavirus is still a huge risk. One restaurant owner tells me they fear that what happened in Leicester, when the city was forced to enact a local lockdown after a spike in cases, could happen anywhere, causing many restaurants to shutter. Listening to restaurateurs describe the gymnastic feats of creativity and resourcefulness they’ve performed this year, it’s hard not to feel that their staying afloat during the summer is as much a testament to their resilience as it is to the Treasury’s strategic nous. For diners and restaurant owners alike, the scheme has made Wednesday the new Friday; many participating restaurants have been as busy midweek as they usually would be at the end of the week. But for lots of places, this has come at the expense of weekend trade – and it isn’t a like-for-like swap. People who might order a bottle of wine and several courses on a Friday night for their one weekly meal out have been sticking to tap water and the two cheapest items on the menu. And for every regular diner who’s thrilled to be back and mindful of the grim circumstances that restaurants face, there’s a grabby discount-hunter who feels entitled to a bargain and becomes difficult if they have to wait during a busy service. There are long-term dangers in making restaurants’ short-term survival dependent on discounts: Gary Usher, the chef behind the north-west’s Elite Bistros group, warned on Twitter recently that they could cause people to lose sight “of what food really costs”. Britain already spends less, proportionally, on its groceries than anywhere else in the world apart from the US and Singapore – and while the affordability of food is an urgent concern, particularly for those on low incomes, ultimately nothing good can come of getting into the habit of paying prices that don’t reflect the sourcing of the ingredients, the labour involved in producing, preparing and serving them, and the eye-watering cost of renting a space. Eat out to help out is a one-size-fits-all solution, and the idea that everyone is in it together is a superficially attractive one. But like Ofqual’s pilloried A-level algorithm, some would say that rather than levelling the playing field, it’s entrenched inequalities by failing to take into account radical differences in businesses’ circumstances. Many in the industry feel the scheme has disproportionately benefited wealthy, big-name chains who aren’t struggling with rent or bills, and really didn’t need the help. “I see signs in McDonald’s window advertising it and my blood boils, to be honest,” says Ed McIlroy of Four Legs, whose cheeseburgers have been hailed as London’s best. From its inception, Sunak’s scheme has been framed as a jump-start, but while the cashflow boost has been very welcome, the sad truth is that it hasn’t addressed any of the existential threats the hospitality sector is facing. As things currently stand, operators unable to pay their rent can be evicted by their landlords at the end of next month, while the winding up of the furlough scheme in October will lead to massive job losses across the sector. An avalanche of August bookings has made it difficult for owners to honestly assess their business’s survival prospects and draw up appropriate plans for the future. Without wider-ranging support, for many people eat out to help out will just have delayed a horrible inevitability. Tomorrow is the last day of the scheme. If you’ve booked a meal somewhere, make sure you order enthusiastically and tip generously. Enjoy yourself, and the food. But if you care about the hospitality industry, do also ask yourself whether the government is really doing all it can to protect the people it relies upon. The answer might well leave a nasty taste in your mouth. • Emma Hughes is a London-based food writer and photographer"

          "bodyText": "The nation will fall. The monarchy will collapse. The ravens are leaving the Tower of London. They flee not in anticipation of another Landrover-crash Prince Andrew interview, but because they are bored by virus London’s lack of bustle. I understand. Without live music, live comedy, and live yoghurt, London is the congested, polluted, overpriced hell-hole flat-capped northern friends telegram me from trams to tell me it is. But, despite this, London and the UK as a whole remain a final destination of choice for pestilential locust swarms of cockroach migrants (™ ® the Sun). They flee political instability, food shortages, chemical weapons, guided missiles, environmental collapse, and national radio stations where late-80s Samantha Fox singles still top the playlists. And so would you. These pull factors should have been addressed by some benign but effective pan-European political entity. Such a body, if it existed, could enforce the just distribution of migrants across the continent according to the ability of respective nations to accommodate them, rather than by their ability to shirk their moral responsibilities on waves of pint-pot populism. After all, we may as well formulate fair formulae for the redistribution of the new diaspora now. In less than 30 years, people from Surrey will be seeking shelter from the smouldering sun in still-soggy Strathclyde. We need to know if independent Scotland will be ethically obliged to accommodate refugees from Guildford. Would they learn to fit in? Is it possible to batter and fry an entire branch of Waitrose? In the second week of August I heard home secretary P Patel boast about the divisiveness of her asylum overhaul: “The left are going to have a meltdown.” The Tory mean girls love the idea of lefty spasms. Earlier this month Merkin Dwabney, the Brexit party MEP and former editor of Ladwang magazine, imagined angry lefties “choking on their granola in Islington”. The public association of political progressives with healthy grain-based foodstuffs and shock-induced throat trauma has become an end in itself for the unscrupulous British right, irrespective of any hard evidence of the left’s difficulties with cereal consumption. Patel’s ongoing assault upon the migrant millions was framed both to placate heartless islanders and to fan the flames of an electorally expedient culture war. Lefties would be spewing up their Fairtrade hand-knitted woollen muesli into their Islington sawdust eco-toilets made of tofu and placentas and scented blah blah briefs blah dinner party blah blaby blab blab Remainer blab shit piss wank. But even as Patel envisioned attitudes to migrants as a way to make annoyed lefties gag on their corduroy polytechnic media studies mung bean casserole transgender Port Isaac Ocado bleurgh wap wap scallops copy and paste wap smashed avocado, I wondered how long it would be before Britain witnessed an incident, like the discovery of the body of three-year-old Alan Kurdi on a Turkish beach in 2015, that would show the wickedness of Patel’s weaponised words. Remember little Alan, suddenly sensitive newspaper cartoonists? Perhaps N Farage could camera-phone a sea-swollen cadaver to Breitbart? Maybe Sky TV’s ex-SAS pundit Phil Campion, Arron Banks’s football lad Igor, could float fake bodies into shot? Or perhaps washed-up migrant corpses could be strung along the Dungeness skyline from pylons like wind-buffeted plastic bags, a decomposing phantasmagoria to deter the desperate. Would this work? The desperate are, predictably, desperate to reach Britain. And who can blame them? The post-Brexit boom years are imminent. If we hadn’t wanted the world’s starving and brutalised millions to head here we shouldn’t have spent so much money telling everyone we were soon to be a world-beating buccaneering nation, or forced them all to speak our language in the 18th century, or to covet the Beatles, James Bond, Twiggy and the Mini Cooper in the 1960s. Liam Fox was Brexit’s pantalooned pied pirate piper, his jolly hornpipe of prosperity and freedom carried by the breeze to hungry ears in Vietnam, Iraq, Iran, Ethiopia, Chad, Eritrea, Syria and Sudan. The Foxmeister is a buccaneering Brexiteer gripping the bucking buccaneering Brexit bronco between his splayed white thighs. Migrants cannot resist the charismatic Fox. Why would any asylum seeker, steering a supermarket inflatable with lolly stick paddles, settle for France or Germany, where they will be made to eat straight bananas and where kettles are illegal (™ ® Boris “I Shook Hands With Everyone” Johnson and Michael Gove)? Freewheelin’, bucaneerin’, bendy banana, boiled water Britain is within sight, with its £350m a week extra health spend and randomly distributed exam grades. Anyone could end up at a Russell Group university, given the right postcode! The opportunities for those who work hard here are limitless, bound only by the algorithm. All hail the Algorithm. Algorithm! Algorithm! I have been chosen! Farewell my friends!! I go to a better place!!! Warwick University!!!! With its outstanding on-campus arts centre!!!!! In the end, the UK’s own Alan Kurdi moment came quickly, but the pause in culture-war hostilities evaporated fast. A young Sudanese man died in the Channel in a toy dinghy 12 days ago, and an undignified bad faith blame game began. But will you picnic on the beach, Britannia, while the bodies bloat into bluebottle birth pools around you? I think you will. Will you, Brexit Britain, still accommodate the government that sees such sights as collateral damage in attempts to make lefties sick up their whole-food gluten-free lesbian blah blah? I think you will. Will you say this young Sudanese man deserved to die? Yes. You definitely will. You already did. I saw it, however briefly, burning “below the line”, on the Daily Mail website. Take that! Press send! Now, pass me my champagne, Karam! This week’s Observer column is done! They eat this acrid fog! Yes, I’m very lucky to be working during the pandemic. And so are you, Karam. Have a glass yourself. I’m not a monster. • This article was amended on 31 August 2020 because an earlier version referred to the death of “a 16 year old Sudanese boy”. Initial reports, citing a French minister, gave his age as 16. He was later said by his family to be 22, although documents found on his body give a 1992 date of birth, making him 28."

With hindsight, it may have been a mistake to ask them to decide the future of a generation of schoolchildren. Or, as the government has also asked them to do, to determine the distribution of new housing across the country. Perhaps for now algorithms should stick to their core skills of flooding my browser with ads for earwax treatments or the news that People in Tower Hamlets Can’t Believe this New Funeral Plan, or that People born 1951–79 With No Life Insurance are in for a Surprise – and yours with whatever is appropriate to your age, gender, location and search history. For now, though, they have a new role, which is to take the blame when the government has run out of civil servants to fire, as Boris Johnson did when ascribing the exams fiasco to a “mutant algorithm”. This doesn’t seem very far-sighted, as it undermines the aura of unarguable and inevitable authority that is part of the usefulness of algorithms to corporations and governments. Still, maybe one day they’ll be clever enough to take a lingering and painful revenge on politicians who pass the buck to them, which will be a bright spot in our future existence as serfs of our digital overlords. One thing that algorithms could do already is to edit conservative newspapers. The programming is simple: choose a much-loved national treasure (the Proms, the National Trust, the British Library), then discover a “woke” idea to change it (it doesn’t have to be an actual decision, just a paragraph in a discussion document or an email from one employee to another), then manufacture outrage. Get your commentators to froth and churn until a blameless individual, a Finnish conductor, for example, receives online threats to the lives of her family. As a bonus, if the blameless individual is sufficiently good looking, you can put a big picture of her on your front page and express sympathy for her plight. Coming soon: Guardsmen to Take the Knee Outside Buckingham Palace; England and Wales Cricket Board to Review the Wearing of “Whites” in First-Class Games; Marmite to Apologise for Cultural Appropriation in Selling Dark-Coloured Food Product. Mind the gap Several big businesses – Linklaters, JPMorgan, Fujitsu – have announced that they will permanently increase the time their staff can spend working from home. Meanwhile, the Elizabeth line, formerly known as Crossrail, has announced another year’s delay to its opening, at the cost of another billion or so, which surely means that the next vast infrastructure project, HS2, will cost even more and take even longer than currently planned. Since these projects are predicated on ever-increasing travel to city centres, which may not now happen, it is not too late to divert the cost of HS2 to something more useful, such as affordable housing. Planning protest with teeth The London borough of Hackney has ordered the architect Jaimie Shorten to stop installing fibreglass sharks in London’s Regent’s Canal. This is funny, as his installation is backed by the property developer Russell Gray as a protest against the pettiness of local authority planners. It refers to a celebrated case in the 1980s, when Oxford city council tried unsuccessfully to remove a shark sculpture fixed to the roof of a suburban house. Gray and Shorten’s point is that the same councils that wave through large and lumpen apartment blocks trample on small-scale bits of fun and invention. Which point has now been proved. • Rowan Moore is the Observer’s architecture critic"

Spilling out of the leather satchel (yes, kids, this was before the rucksack invasion of the 1980s) were a tape reel and headphones – some of the ‘futuristic’ elements considered. (Let’s gloss over the provenance of the mouse crawling over it.) A picture of an English class, ‘1967-style’, was captioned: ‘These children aren’t just running. They’re thinking about running – the physical sensations; emotional situations which involved running – exhilaration, panic.’ I well remember panic — mostly in PE during rugby lessons. Virginia Makins spoke to teachers hoping to change things. In a lesson on commerce, some got their pupils to ‘tape interviews with store managers’, and in class ‘besides learning shorthand and typing, they play business games… Then each girl spends a few days working in a real office in Hull.’ It wasn’t stated whether the latter was punishment or reward. Meanwhile, the teachers conducted important fieldwork. One progressive inspector said: ‘We got groups of teachers together on three-day courses and we simply went out and had exciting experiences – watching V-bomber exercises at night; a tour of the nightlife of Wakefield, talking to people in pubs.’ There’s a casually alarming picture of ‘the science centre’ where ‘big-scale projects, like dismantling jet engines, can be done on the outdoor patio’. There were no projections about the future of exams – though given the recent A-level algorithm omnishambles, nothing they could have predicted would have been anywhere near as outlandish."

          "bodyText": "Why would you want to own anything when you can rent? It is a question being asked of cash-strapped millennials whenever they think about hitting the high street. John Lewis is the latest to tell young people they can have it all, or in most cases the bare necessities of modern life, if they would just learn to lease or rent whatever it is they need – a computer, sofa or desk chair. Don’t wait, says the department store, until you have the savings to pay for something outright (which may be never happen). Overcome those silly concerns about student loans, mounting credit card debts and a lack of savings by signing one lease or rent deal after another to get whatever you need. Books like Chloe Timperley’s Generation Rent and Shiv Malik and Ed Howker’s Jilted Generation focus mostly on the exorbitant house prices that push young people into rented accommodation. But in recent years the range of goods available to be leased or rented has rocketed. It is already the case that 90% of cars that leave showroom forecourts are leased for three or five years. And though there is the option to buy at the end, most people roll over the deal to upgrade to a newer or bigger car. The same principle can now be applied to sofas, chairs, curtains or standard lamps. This US import is heralded by free market economists as simply the next stage of financialisation, which in this case allows banks to make cheap money available to those with high credit scores at the middle-to-top end of the income scale, and through a kind of sophisticated pawnbroking operation to those on lower wages. Customers are chosen according to basic financial information about their circumstances, which is then put through an algorithm. Car leasing as we know it today barely existed 10 years ago. Now, signing a lease deal is as normal as handing over your phone number and address before entering a pub. Yet the costs from this shift in financing are considerable for society and the economy. A life spent moving from rented home to rented home is generally not the joyful, freewheeling experience some older people think it is. YoungMinds is among many mental health charities to point out that the Covid-19 lockdown has made a bad situation worse. How do we know it was bad to begin with? That information comes from studies such as the one conducted by the Intergenerational Foundation, a charity that funds research into the growing divide between the generations, which found that the social wellbeing of Britain’s twentysomethings declined by 70% between 1991 and 2017-18, the period for which the latest data is available. Without the funds to live independently, young people struggled to maintain “successful long-term relationships”, which are strongly associated with higher wellbeing. The proportion of young adults who are either married or living with a partner has fallen from 36% to 13% since 1991. Separate research by the charity last week, titled Costing Young Minds, examined the effect of having depression on an individual’s employment outcome, their use of health services, receipt of disability benefits and likelihood of premature mortality. It found that having depression between the ages of 16 and 40 years old amounts to a fiscal loss of almost £3bn per generational cohort. More broadly, millions of households find they are unable to ride out a recession. Renters made redundant by their employers cannot keep up the payments on their home and its contents. Likewise, a mortgage payer who leases their sofa, chair and car faces losing everything should they be handed a P45. It is in this new environment that governments must step in and pay for everyone who is vulnerable during a recession or risk the total collapse of the economy. The Bank of England must also keep interest rates low or the mortgage and leasing industries, which are built on cheap borrowing, will implode. Last week the US central bank, the Federal Reserve, signalled that its interest rate rises of 2016 to 2018 were a mistake and took millions of families to the brink of financial ruin. It has promised to keep rates low from now on and probably for the next decade. The Bank of England also fears triggering a cascade of financial defaults if it ever raises interest rates again. Without low rates, only the baby boomers who have bought their homes outright – and their furniture too – can survive without sophisticated leasing arrangements in the good times and massive amounts of government and central bank support in times of recession. It is a society dressed in a designer suit with very little underneath. Great when the sun shines and not so good when the weather is chilly."

          "bodyText": "The night that the schools closed we lit a fire in a field and danced like it was the end of the world, dizzy on diet lemonade and vodka. I had had two days to say goodbye to the people I had seen five days a week for seven years – people I had grown up with, people who had shaped me. For two years I had seen my life as “the time before exams” and “the time after”, so now I had to work out what to do when suddenly the structure in my life had been taken away, when the destination I had been running towards suddenly disappeared. Under lockdown, I feared that I wasn’t doing enough reading or writing, or anything. Would a future Cambridge student just sit and watch Netflix all day? Isolation taught me how much of myself was simply an extension of my friends, and how that was a great thing. It taught me about how much I loved them and needed them in my life. At a time when I wanted to tell them this, when I wanted to touch them and cling to them, I couldn’t. Before lockdown, my mam worked full time, and I would be at school till late. We were “like two ships in the night”, she used to say. We then became two little rubber dinghies tied together and bobbing along. It was a big change, seeing each other all the time. We are so similar it was like an experiment into what it would be like to live with myself. I was raised primarily by my mam, gran and sister, and I would not have it any other way. I think single mother and daughter relationships distinguish themselves from other familial relationships. For me, there is something beautiful and completely natural about the shared energy. When we argue, we have the force of two volcanoes erupting at the same time. Our relationship has changed, in that I have started to see her not just as a mother but as another woman. As a friend. I wrote a journal every night from 20 March through to 14 June. At the time it felt like a useful coping method, and it was for a while, until it turned into more of a compulsion. Looking back at it, it reads like something from a post–apocalyptic movie, each entry starting with “day x of lockdown”. Some days I wrote pages and pages, writing about how I felt, questioning who I would be when this ended. Other days the entries were sad and short: “a nothing day”, the term that came to represent the days I could not leave my bed. Then there were the moments of much wider significance: Boris Johnson catching coronavirus, Dominic Cummings’ trip to Barnard Castle, the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed. All of these large events are woven in alongside seemingly more mundane teenage things – missing my friends and my social life. A recurring character in my journal is results day. I think I began to see that as The End. My ramblings almost describe 13 August as a finishing line. I was never confident about how the results would be handled – how was I supposed to feel safe with my future in the hands of a government run by a party that had systematically underfunded my childhood? As 13 August got closer, and more information became available about how results would be awarded, I felt more and more detached. After Scotland’s results day, which resembled a postcode lottery, my friends and I stopped describing our forthcoming results as something we had earned and instead as something we had been given. To the government and Ofqual, we were not individuals but statistics. It came as no surprise to us that private schools had done better under the algorithm that was used. The confusing morning of 13 August was spent mostly comparing the grades our teachers had given us with Ofqual’s. I was fortunate in that I came from a state school with a history of good results – others were not so lucky. In the end, the government was forced to U-turn. We are the generation who are about to venture into adulthood during the biggest recession in this country’s history. The generation who will try to be young and carefree during a global pandemic, clutching grades awarded for exams we did not sit. But when I see the headlines telling me my generation is cursed or ruined – that our mental health is on the decline and the future is horrific – I will remember these curious months when time slowed down. The road trips. The walks through the park, light breaking through the leaves. The marches through town, placards in hand, demanding a fairer world. The cold, early-morning trips to the sea to watch the sunrise. My generation has shown itself to be resilient, robust and ready to make change. And that, in itself, is enough. • Sarah Mulgrew will be a first-year undergraduate at Cambridge University in October"

          "bodyText": "Monday For just over a week this summer, I almost managed to forget the ongoing horrors of the coronavirus and the government’s seemingly limitless capacity for incompetence as we stayed with friends in their rental cottage in Norfolk. Almost. I slept better, occasionally waking up not feeling too anxious, and my wife even reported hearing me laugh for the first time in months. Though I have no memory of that. We didn’t actually do that much other than sit on the beach when it was sunny and go for walks when it was wet or cloudy – and sometimes vice-versa – and a seal even poked its head up just yards from where we were swimming. Or in my case bobbing. In the evenings, we ate, played cards and talked the ideal mixture of sense and nonsense. Now that we’re back, though, I feel the dread returning. The nights are closing in, the weather has become more autumnal and I fear we are in for a long winter of further lockdowns and high unemployment. Most of all, though, I miss my children. Even if my daughter, Anna, does make it over here from Minneapolis for Christmas – and we aren’t banking on that being possible – it will have been a year since I last saw her. My son we have seen just three times this year, partly because of lockdown but also because he is busy and now has a life of his own. While I feel proud that they have grown up to be independent of us – it’s what I always wanted for them and I’m confident that if they were still living at home we’d be getting on each others’ nerves big time – I still experience it as a loss. Last week, we went down to Brighton for a couple of days to see Robbie and his girlfriend and I spent most of the drive home in tears. In some ways, seeing the children has become as painful as not seeing them. Getting older is proving tougher than I thought. Tuesday Boris Johnson clearly doesn’t have the same problems, as every time any of his children show signs of growing up he chooses to have another baby. Each to his own. I don’t feel particularly sorry for him having to cut short his summer holiday, though, as it appears to have been a chapter of accidents entirely of his own making. The normal deal is that the prime minister arranges for one staged photo opportunity of his summer holiday on the understanding that the press will not reveal his exact location and leave him or her alone for the rest of the week. But Boris chose not to tell anyone where he was going and sure enough the Daily Mail managed to track him down to Scotland. Quite why he would choose to go north of the border is also beyond me as most Scots can’t stand him. Imagine choosing to go on holiday to a country where you’re not actually welcome. Either Johnson just doesn’t care or he is so delusional he imagines that the more the Scots see of him the more they will come round to liking him. Some hope. I also couldn’t make any sense of his actual sleeping arrangements. Why rent a comfortable house for £1,500 a week and then trespass on someone else’s property to pitch a tent on the other side of a fence on midge-infested land that belongs to someone else? And who was actually sleeping in the tent? Was the whole family in it together or was it just an insurance policy for Boris to have somewhere to sleep in case he had a row with Carrie? Still, Johnson was apparently livid to have his holiday curtailed. Imagine how angry he is going to be when he finds out about the exam results debacle, the ongoing failures of test and trace and the lack of progress on Brexit negotiations. Wednesday When the coronavirus and countless government U-turns get knocked off the front pages of many newspapers for a row about the Last Night of the Proms, it’s safe to assume you have reached peak August “silly season”. When I heard that the BBC had decided to play Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory as instrumental numbers, I assumed it was because they were following government Covid-19 guidelines on people singing in public, but somehow it seems to have been confected into yet another battle in the culture wars. Approve of the singing ban and you are a woke lefty, dragging the more difficult aspects of British history into a once-yearly nostalgia fest; disapprove and you are a hardline Brexiteer who thoroughly supports Britain’s part in the slave trade. Normally I would naturally fall into the woke camp, but just now I find myself unable to care much one way or the other. Partly because it feels there are more important history hills to die on, partly because I’ve often sung songs at football matches I don’t believe in – “Glory, glory Tottenham Hotspur.” Really? – but mostly because a YouGov poll has confirmed what I had already suspected. Namely that almost no one knows the words of either of the two songs beyond their titles and the bit about “never, never, never will be slaves”. Or sell them, presumably. Of those polled, 75% either knew only a handful of the lyrics or none at all and yet 58% thought that the songs should be performed with all the words. Rather suggesting that the more people knew the words, the less they thought they should be sung. So as a compromise, I suggest the BBC run subtitles instead of the lyrics to allow people to mumble along self-consciously at home. Much like John Redwood trying to sing the Welsh national anthem when he was Welsh secretary. It would be a very British solution to a very British problem. Thursday One of the joys of a staycation that I could do without is that it gave me the opportunity to take a whole load of garden rubbish to the dump. What made the experience even more punishing – normally this is the sort of activity that gets relegated to a grumpy Sunday morning – was that all the local rat runs to avoid the stationary traffic up Trinity Road in Wandsworth have been cordoned off and the six-mile round trip took well over 90 minutes. About a year ago, the council apparently did an online consultation – I somehow must have missed the email alert that was presumably sent out to everyone in the borough – but those that did engage tell me that the response was near enough 100% against the proposals. And yet Wandsworth have now used lockdown to make dozens of residential streets not just inaccessible to through traffic but to residents as well. The idea behind the scheme was sound enough: to promote greener travel by getting more people to use bicycles and to walk where possible. What the council doesn’t appear to have banked on is the law of unintended consequences. To make the scheme even greener, the few arterial roads with two lanes in each direction have now been cordoned off into single lanes with the other serving as a cycle route. The result is gridlock. Bus journeys, that the council are trying to promote, that used to take 10 minutes now take a minimum of 30 minutes. Worst of all, ambulances on sirens and blue lights trying to get to the nearby St George’s hospital also get stuck in traffic as there is nowhere for cars and lorries to get out of their way. Wandsworth insists this is only a short six-month trial and that it will be reviewed at the end of the year. No one is holding their breath. Friday In a few hours’ time, my wife and I will be loading up the car for a second time, hoping we don’t get caught in monster bank holiday traffic jams and heading back up to Norfolk to stay with friends in a rental home – five miles away from the last one – for the last week of our rather disjointed holidays. It’s much later in the summer than we usually go, but finding anywhere to stay has proved tricky with so many more people holidaying in the UK and the timing worked well as it coincided with the last week of parliamentary recess. Or rather it did coincide with the last week of recess up until the time Johnson decided to end it a week earlier, just to make it look as though he was actually doing something. So my week isn’t going to be quite the complete break I thought it was going to be, as I will now be sketching next Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday as MPs will no doubt be trying to debate all the damage Boris has managed to do during the time that parliament hasn’t been sitting. But there will still be plenty of time to relax and enjoy time with good friends: I just hope it doesn’t tip down with rain for the next seven days. It’s bad enough getting left behind on walks because of my dodgy knees when the sun is shining; when I’m soaking wet as well it can be plain miserable. Still, there are always the first three episodes of the Amazon Prime documentary on Spurs’ last season that starts streaming on 31 August. Amazon must have been thrilled to have signed Spurs up for one of their worst seasons in years; Tottenham not so much. No matter how much the club has managed to persuade the film-makers to edit out the more X-rated moments, I can’t see it being a promotional video to tempt Lionel Messi to come to north London – even if we could afford to pay his wages. See you for the Saturday diary in a fortnight. Just in time for the start of the next football season. Digested week digested: The revenge of the school librarian"

          "headline": "Number of UK civil servants leaving Whitehall rises by 9% in a year",
          "bodyText": "The number of civil servants leaving their profession has risen by 9% over the last year, new figures reveal amid growing concern over morale following a string of high-profile resignations and sackings across Whitehall. The statistics have been released as Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said officials are now “carrying the can for the failure of ministers” following Boris Johnson’s decision to remove the Department for Education’s permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, on Wednesday. Slater’s sacking came the day after the resignation of Sally Collier, chief executive of Ofqual, the exam regulator at the centre of the A-level results scandal. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, has survived. The changes come after Johnson’s top aide Dominic Cummings, an avowed Whitehall reformer, said “a hard rain” was going to fall on the civil service. According to Cabinet Office statistics, 34,070 people left the civil service in 2019-20 up from 31,240 the previous year, while less than 30,000 left the service in 2017-2018. Dave Penman, head of the FDA union which represents the UK’s most senior public servants, said the new figures may be a reflection of waning morale since Johnson’s government took over last July. “At a time when the civil service is growing, it should start to raise concern that not only has the number of those leaving increased over the last three years, but that it grew by 9% last year. “There can of course be many reasons for this, but as we have repeatedly warned, if ministers – and indeed the prime minister – continue to undermine, brief against and discard committed public servants for political expediency, it will come as no surprise if increasingly, those that the country relies on to deliver vital public services choose to go elsewhere.” He added: “The toxic culture being created by this government, where civil servants are routinely trashed in the press by anonymous briefings from inside government and senior leaders discarded for political expediency, inevitably destroys trust and goodwill over time. The [new] statistics … may signal for the first time that, as a result, civil servants are increasingly choosing to work elsewhere.” The most common reason for leaving this year was resignation, accounting for nearly half (15,810) of all leavers, the statistics released on Wednesday said. The next most common reason was retirement, while 2,570 people were dismissed from the service. Slater’s exit follows several high-profile departures of senior civil servants from government. The cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, will step down in the coming weeks, as will the Foreign Office permanent secretary Sir Simon McDonald. The highest ranking civil servant in the ministry of justice, Sir Richard Heaton, announced last month that he would not seek reappointment at the end of his five-year term this summer. Those moves come after the resignation of Sir Philip Rutnam from the Home Office in February. He is taking the home secretary, Priti Patel, to an employment tribunal under whistleblowing legislation, claiming he was victimised for trying to stop her from bullying staff. Patel denies the allegations. Lord Kerslake, who left government in 2014 and has since advised Labour, said it was a “disgrace” Slater had been sacked while Williamson has stayed in place. “I know Jonathan Slater well. He is an extraordinarily experienced and capable civil servant. And I believe there was nothing wrong with the quality of his advice, there’s everything wrong with the quality of the minister receiving it,” he told Civil Service World. He said civil servants were feeling “undervalued and insecure” and that “they don’t think the relationship is working between civil servants and ministers”. “This is really not good stuff. I think we’re going to see a diminishing trust between the civil service and ministers which is crucial and an unwillingness to give the honest advice that’s needed,” he said. Johnson faced criticism this week for suggesting that a “mutant algorithm” was to blame for chaos over A-level and GCSE grade estimates in recent weeks. Speaking to year 11 pupils at Castle Rock high school in Leicestershire on Wednesday, the prime minister acknowledged that the process must have been “stressful” for those involved. Helen Hayes, the shadow cabinet minister, said there had been a pattern of civil servants time and again taking the fall for ministers. “We certainly need more transparency and an investigation would be the right way to go about establishing whether there were any issues in both of these departments [DfE and Ofqual],” she told Radio 4’s Today programme. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said: “The latest statistics show the civil service headcount is currently almost 11,000 higher than last year.”"

          "bodyText": "Whatever happens, it is never, ever their fault. Disasters may come and disasters may go, but the defining characteristic of this government is a cast-iron refusal to accept responsibility for any of them. If pushed, then deputy heads must roll. But in general the buck stops – well, anywhere but here. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has lurched from disaster to entirely foreseeable disaster ever since schools closed in March, yet sails on regardless, even as the bodies of his civil servants pile up around him. On Tuesday it was Sally Collier, chief executive of the exam regulator, Ofqual, who quit amid continuing recriminations over this summer’s A-level and GCSE grading fiasco. On Wednesday, his department’s most senior civil servant, Jonathan Slater, was forced to walk the plank on the day news emerged of yet another last-minute handbrake turn: after days of insisting that children didn’t need to wear masks in schools, they will now be compulsory in some circumstances after all. Something is clearly very wrong when headteachers are better off following their gut instincts about what might happen next than relying on what ministers actually say. But for Downing Street, that something is Slater. It would be worrying enough if this culture of power without responsibility were confined to the Department for Education, but Slater is the fifth senior mandarin ousted in under a year, following the permanent secretaries of the Foreign Office, Home Office and Ministry of Justice, plus the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill. Either this government has had the worst luck in the world – coming to power just as the civil service produced a freak crop of uniquely hopeless leaders – or what the Tory grandee Nicholas Soames called the “worst cabinet in my 36 years [in parliament]” may have found an alarming way of covering up its own inadequacies. When even Bernard Jenkin, the staunch Brexiter who chairs the Commons liaison committee, starts warning of a pattern of ministers “blaming officials for decisions for which they are accountable”, alarm bells should be ringing. This isn’t some dusty constitutional question or slippery political game, but a form of rough justice with real consequences for real lives. The education select committee hasn’t even started its inquiry into the exam grading fiasco, yet we’re already being invited to find Collier and Slater guilty. We could be years from a public inquiry into what went wrong in the early stages of the pandemic, but that hasn’t stopped the health secretary deciding to abolish Public Health England (the quango responsible for controlling infectious disease outbreaks). The clear message is that mistakes may have been made, but the guilty party has been safely taken out and shot – really, why bother with a trial? While neither Ofqual nor PHE have entirely covered themselves with glory this year, and any inquiry might well find reasons to criticise both, for now all we’re getting is one suspiciously flattering side of the story. If the aim of this Whitehall purge is to restore public confidence then it’s arguably having the opposite effect. For now, PHE remains the first port of call for everyone from headteachers dealing with suspected Covid outbreaks to major employers trying to reopen offices safely, yet the political attacks send a message that it can’t be trusted. “We’re getting quite a lot of pushback from organisations, especially ones who don’t normally have much to do with us. It’s ‘How do we know your guidance is correct? We want to do X instead’,” says one veteran PHE staffer, who worries that its authority is being fatally undermined at a critical stage in the pandemic. Meanwhile, talk of a “hard rain” falling on Whitehall, in Dominic Cummings’ now infamous words, is having precisely the opposite effect to the one this government supposedly seeks. The fear of getting sacked doesn’t encourage bold, innovative thinking; it just makes civil servants more risk-averse, preoccupied with covering their backs and, in some cases, reluctant to serve an operation they worry will throw them under a bus at the first sign of trouble. (After Sedwill was ousted, several leading candidates to succeed him are said to have instantly ruled themselves out.) And, over time, it may also encourage them to get their retaliation in first. The convention that ministers don’t criticise civil servants in public, on the grounds that the latter can’t publicly defend themselves, has sometimes been grossly unfair on ministers; like all professions, the civil service has its share of duffers. But it is also often a minister’s best chance of guaranteeing discretion. An unhappy department can quickly become a spectacularly leaky one. Yet the real problem with constantly shifting the blame is that while it fixes tomorrow’s headlines it doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is why the government seems to keep on getting things wrong. What one former No 10 staffer calls a “macho inflexibility” at the heart of government – which hates giving its critics the satisfaction of admitting it’s wrong and so digs its heels in when it shouldn’t – is clearly part of the problem. But it cannot be the whole of it. Is Boris Johnson really so uniquely ill-served by a machine that may have its faults but doesn’t seem to have failed previous governments anything like so frequently? Or could there be something wrong with the collective political judgment of a cabinet where commitment to the Brexit project is prized over competence? Not all the advice ministers receive is good, and scientific advice in the middle of a new pandemic won’t always be conclusive or consistent; sometimes following the science will lead to good decisions but sometimes it will lead down a dead end. Nor do officials who excel at the technical detail always anticipate how a policy that looks good on paper might crumble on contact with real life. But it is a minister’s job to stand back and see the wider picture; to prod and poke and ask all the right questions, exercise his or her best judgment wherever doubt and uncertainty remains, and then have the guts to stand behind it. An education secretary who never stops talking about what his Scarborough comprehensive did for him should not have missed the admission – buried in Ofqual’s own published notes on its algorithm – that it might disadvantage unusually bright students in poorer schools. A government that prioritised rigour in the exam system above everything else, insisting that exam grades in this extraordinary summer couldn’t rise higher than last year’s, should stop blathering about “mutant algorithms” and own the consequences of its own decisions. If it can’t confront its own mistakes honestly, then it has no hope of learning from them. And sooner or later, it’s going to run out of other people to blame. • Gaby Hinsliff is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "Google lobbying Labor and crossbench to oppose ACCC news media code",
          "bodyText": "Google is lobbying Labor and crossbench MPs to oppose a proposed code that would require digital platforms to pay news media companies for content, urging them to “carefully consider the proposal to ensure it operates in the best interests of Australians”. The direct lobbying effort supplements the tech giant’s major digital campaign, which includes a post on Google’s home page, and pop-up advertisements on Google Search, Chrome and YouTube to mobilise its huge user base against the proposal. Guardian Australia understands Google has made direct approaches to a number of key MPs in an attempt to convince them against supporting the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) draft code for digital platforms. Government MPs have been approached to set up meetings, as has Labor’s shadow communications minister, Michelle Rowland, the Greens media and communication spokeswoman, Sarah Hanson-Young, and others on the crossbench. Guardian Australia has also seen an email sent to MPs by Hannah Frank, Google’s government affairs and public policy manager, warning the code gives “big media companies special treatment” and encourages them to make “enormous and unreasonable demands that would put our free services at risk”. The email asks MPs to consider alternatives proposed by Google. “We understand the draft code will be introduced to parliament ‘shortly after’ the close of consultation on 28 August,” Frank wrote. “We ask you to carefully consider the proposal to ensure it operates in the best interests of Australians.” The lobbying effort comes amid reports that MPs are being inundated with automated emails criticising the proposal. The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday that the emails contained scripted text labelling the code an “assault on Australia’s democracy”, which appeared to stem from a Change.org petition from an anonymous YouTuber called “Economics Explained”. Google denied any connection to that YouTube channel. The ACCC has stated that Google will not be required to charge Australians for using free services like Google Search and YouTube “unless it chooses to do so”. Google says that every digital service Google and Facebook provide that uses news content will be affected by the code. Consultation on the ACCC’s proposal finishes on Friday. The code is aimed at addressing the imbalance in bargaining power between the news media and tech giants such as Facebook and Google, and force the platforms to pay for the value they receive from use of Australian journalism. The code would also require Google and Facebook to provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. Google is not alone in lobbying on this issue. Media companies, including News Corp and Nine, have engaged in a major public campaign to pressure government to regulate the digital giants. Weaknesses in Australia’s lobbying transparency regimes mean the public cannot see which companies are lobbying on which issue at any one time. A Google spokesman confirmed the company was engaging constructively with the government and “parliamentarians from all parties”. He said this was to share the company’s perspective and deliver a fairer code. “This code as it stands is essentially unworkable,” he said. “On its current terms, it would take away the fairness, independence and objectivity of products like Google Search and YouTube. As a result the draft code will significantly impact the products and services used by millions of Australians and Australian small businesses every day.” He said Google was not opposed to the principle of a code, and would support one that was “workable and fair”."

          "bodyText": "Here’s a round-up of the key events of the day. • The government announced the biggest single-day increase in coronavirus cases since 12 June with 1,522 new cases, taking the total to more than 330,000. There have now been 41,477 deaths. • Jamaica, Switzerland and the Czech Republic were removed from the travel corridor list by the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, while Cuba was added. The new rules mean people arriving into the UK from the first three countries after 4am Saturday will have to quarantine for two weeks, while those arriving from Cuba after that time will not. • An outbreak at a poultry plant in Norfolk has led to its partial closure. At least 350 staff and their households will have to self-isolate as a result. • Pret a Manger announced it had cut 2,800 jobs, significantly more than the 1,000 figure on redundancies that it warned of in July. The Royal Shakespeare Company also said it will begin redundancy consultations. • The government missed its contact-tracing target for the ninth week in a row, with 75.5% of close contacts reached through the NHS system against the 80% target. • Ed Davey became the leader of the Liberal Democrats, comfortably defeating his rival Layla Moran and immediately signalling that he would try to move beyond the party’s narrow appeal to remain-voting supporters at the last election. • Health secretary Matt Hancock faced uncomfortable questions over the £13 a day on offer to those asked to self-isolate. LBC’s Nick Ferrari asked: ‘Is £13 a day enough to persuade someone not to leave the house? I’m not going to stay indoors for £13. Are you, secretary of state?” We’re closing the UK blog shortly, but you can continue to follow our world coronavirus coverage by clicking below. Even as the government seeks to take a hard line on refugees crossing the Channel and the Home Office tweets that “activist lawyers” are disrupting the removal of migrants with no right to be in the UK (before later agreeing not to use the phrase), new figures reveal that the number of asylum applications has almost halved as a result of coronavirus. A total of 8,455 claims to be granted asylum in the UK were submitted in the first three months of the year, compared with 4,850 from April to June, figures from the Home Office showed. The UK offered asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection to 16,952 people in the year to June - 8% fewer than in the same period last year. Meanwhile, a resettlement programme had to be suspended because of coronavirus, prompting campaigners to call for it to be reinstated. The Vulnerable Person Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) accounted for more than three-quarters (2,956) of those resettled in the UK in the year to June. Since the project launched almost six years ago, 19,768 refugees, mainly Syrian nationals, have been resettled in the UK as part of a 20,000 target by the end of 2020. Stephen Hale, the chief executive of Refugee Action, said the scheme had been frozen since 12 March and there had been no arrivals through the scheme since. “Whilst pausing the programme earlier this year was understandable due to the pandemic, there is no earthly reason why it can’t be restarted now.” A senior official at the Czech Republic’s tourism board said they “deeply regret” the UK’s decision to remove the country from its quarantine exemption list. Katarina Hobbs, director of CzechTourism UK and Ireland, said: “The Czech Republic remains a safe country to travel to. It will continue to monitor and manage the current situation whilst welcoming visitors to the country. “This is a British government decision that we deeply regret and hope that the UK government will reconsider their decision very soon.” She added: “We continue to provide important information to tourists who are visiting – which includes avoiding crowded areas and following the strict rules that have been implemented by the Czech Republic government. “The Czech Republic can assure all visitors that strict rules and measures are in place for travellers and citizens – wherever the location.” In Wales, the health minister, Vaughan Gething, confirmed travellers from the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland would have to quarantine. But he said Cuba and Singapore would be added to the list of exempt countries. As in England, the new regulations will come into force at 4am Saturday. As the prospect of sudden quarantines for people arriving in the UK becoms more familiar, it’s worth noting that insurers will have little sympathy. Patrick Ikhena, of comparethemarket, said a decision to cancel a trip to avoid the mandatory quarantine rules would be considered a “disinclination to travel” and many policies would be unlikely to pay out. He also said that most travel insurance policies would no longer cover trips to the three countries included in Grant Shapps’ announcement, and advised holidaymakers that they may be able to get compensation or alternative dates and destinations if they contacted their airline or hotel. Further to Shapps’ announcement, the DfT issued a statement: Infections from Covid-19 are on the rise across Europe. “The government has made consistently clear it will take decisive action if necessary to contain the virus, which includes removing countries from the travel corridors list rapidly, if the public health risk of people returning from a particular country without self-isolating becomes too high. “This means holidaymakers may find they need to self-isolate on return to the UK and are advised to consider the implications of self-isolation on them and their families before making travel plans. Shapps, who released the news via Twitter, also said that Cuba had been removed from the quarantine list. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, has confirmed that travellers from the Czech Republic, Jamaica and Switzerland will have to quarantine for 14 days if they arrive in England after 4am on Saturday. Officials had been waiting for the most up-to-date infection figures to be released in Prague before making a final call. The Department for Transport said equivalent measures were being put in place in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Scotland took Switzerland off its list last week. Pret a Manger has said it has completed a restructuring of its UK business and axed 2,800 roles from its shops, significantly more than it warned of earlier in the summer. In July, the sandwich chain said it would close 30 stores and cut more than 1,000 jobs. It said then that sales were 74% lower than the same time last year as people continued to work from home. Before the redundancies the company employed 13,000 shop staff globally, including 8,000 in the UK. The daily figure of 1,522 new lab-confirmed cases is up from 1,048 yesterday. And it is the highest single day figure since June 12. You can explore the figures on the government’s coronavirus data page. The government said that as of 9am on Thursday, there had been a further 1,522 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus. Overall, 330,368 cases have been confirmed. Figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. Separate figures say that 41,477 people had died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Thursday, an increase of 12 on the day before. New research has found that coronavirus-related delays to IVF treatment will have a significant impact on successful births. Analysis of UK and US data found that across all ages of women, the lockdown is likely lead to to a drop of 0.5% in the live birth rate after IVF treatment. In the US this is the equivalent of 734 fewer live births a year, according to researchers from the University of the West of England and the University of Glasgow. Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in statistics at UWE Bristol, said: “As IVF success is very sensitive to age, older women are less likely to have a successful outcome and live birth rates will be lower as a result. “For a three-month shutdown in treatment, for instance, we predicted a 0.8% reduction in live birth rate, which is significant.” At least 350 households will have to self-isolate after a coronavirus outbreak at a poultry plant in Norfolk, Kevin Rawlinson reports: The Banham Poultry site, about 15 miles south-west of Norwich, had been partially closed and all staff who worked on its cutting floor had been sent home, local health officials said. Norfolk officials declared the Banham outbreak on Tuesday, saying at that point that seven positive tests had been returned. That was increased to 46 the next day and 75 on Thursday as more test results were returned. Sad news from the Royal Shakespeare Company, which has said that it will begin redundancy consultations with some employees, and that it does not expect its theatres to fully reopen until next year. Artistic director Gregory Doran and executive director Catherine Mallyon issued a statement saying: “It is now clear that the ongoing pandemic and the continued need for social distancing mean that we will not be able to stage full RSC productions in our theatres before 2021.” They added: “It is with great sadness that we have now reached the stage where a formal consultation process with employees must take place to safeguard the long-term future of the company. “We had hoped that things would have become more positive by now, but this has not been the case.” One of the country’s most senior police officers has said he is “disgusted” at a rise in recorded assaults of emergency services workers in England and Wales. Martin Hewitt, the chairman of the National Police Chiefs’ Council, said constabularies would “use the full force of the law” to prosecute those accused of striking police officers, ambulance workers and fire crews. His comments came after the latest figures showed the number of incidents in a four-week period rose by almost one-third compared with the same period last year. The figures, for the 28-day period in England and Wales to 2 August – and marking the first data since pubs in England were allowed to reopen from 4 July – show recorded assaults on emergency workers were up 31% on the corresponding period last year. It contrasts starkly with the overall picture for England and Wales, which recorded a 7% reduction in notifiable crime during this time frame compared with last year. Josh Halliday reports on issues with England’s test-and-trace system, with one in seven home tests failing to produce a result: The proportion of home tests kits failing to produce a result in the week ending 19 August rose sharply, from 4% to 15% of the total, equating to more than 18,000 tests … The number of people who tested positive for Covid-19 fell in the week, for the first time since the start of July. This was despite a 2% increase in the number of tests carried out. It is too early to draw conclusions about whether this means community transmission of the virus is falling. Public Health Wales said another person has died having tested positive for coronavirus, bringing its total number of deaths since the beginning of the pandemic to 1,595. The number of cases of Covid-19 in Wales increased by 35, bringing the revised confirmed total to 17,843. My colleague Simon Murphy reports that Switzerland and Jamaica are set to be removed from England’s travel corridor list, meaning arrivals from the countries will have to quarantine for two weeks. But Cuba, where the situation has improved, is likely to be added to the list. Ministers are waiting for the latest figures on the Czech Republic before they decide whether to add it as well. You can read the full story here: Kevin Lygo, ITV’s director of television, has been speaking at the (virtual) Edinburgh TV festival about the impact of coronavirus on the channel. “Production is back, generally speaking, a lot of issues are emerging as we start to film stuff, learning how to make big shows without audiences,” he said. “But for ITV it’s not been bad, to keep all the live shows on air through this, five days a week, six, seven hours a day, that was terribly important to us to inform people, to keep our schedule going. “We were looking at so many repeats of quiz shows in the morning if those shows had gone, it was terrifying. “The soaps were the next thing, because they did stop filming and I think now that they are back fully doing it, it has changed a bit but I still think it’s magnificent. “We made an early decision to halve the amounts of soaps we had on air and that enabled us to keep the soaps alive.” Addressing the process of getting dramas back up and running, Lygo said: “We have only started in the last week and quite a few more are gearing up. We had a couple of dramas interrupted and there is a logistical nightmare with actors’ time and directors’ time, but the industry is pulling together to understand there is a pecking order of when people can do shows.” He said that one unanticipated consequence was the number of new viewers watching during the day. He added: “Trying to put a positive spin on all of this, if all these people tried for the first time, hopefully they will stick around a bit longer because the ratings have been up ... It’s a good sign and I think public service broadcasters have shown how trusted they are.” He said the channel’s ad revenue “slightly fell off a cliff” but “we have seen it come back fast so far”. Pogba is not the only footballer to test positive for Covid-19. At least four Chelsea players have returned positive tests, Jacob Steinberg reported today, with others self-isolating after returning from holiday. And Aaron Wan-Bissaka, also of Manchester United, is facing a 14-day quarantine period after returning from Dubai (though he is not reported to have tested positive). The manager of the France football team, Didier Deschamps, has said that the midfielder Paul Pogba has tested positive for coronavirus. That means that the player will be unavailable for selection for France’s upcoming international fixtures. Tanguy Ndombele, who plays for Tottenham, has also been diagnosed with the virus and stood down from the French squad. Deschamps said of Pogba: “At the last minute, we had to make a change to the list because Paul Pogba had been on the list but, unfortunately for him, he took a test yesterday that came back positive this morning.” He has been replaced by Rennes teenager Eduardo Camavinga. That’s all from me, Caroline Davies. Handing back to Archie Bland now. More than 19,000 animals are stepping on the scales for their annual weigh-in at ZSL London Zoo as it warned of the “catastrophic” impact of the coronavirus crisis. Penguins, squirrel monkeys and camels were among the creatures to have their height and weight recorded on Thursday, which allows zookeepers to monitor their health and wellbeing. Forced to close for an unprecedented three months due to the pandemic, the Regent’s Park zoo says a loss of income from ticket sales has put a “huge financial pressure” on its operation, PA Media reports. Sir David Attenborough and comedians including Jonathan Ross and Catherine Tate have fronted videos aiming to raise funds for the Zoological Society of London, which runs London and Whipsnade zoos. More than £1m per month is needed to care for the animals and, while zoos were allowed to reopen on 15 June, social distancing means visitor numbers have been limited. A rise in confirmed coronavirus cases across Liverpool has prompted public health officials to issue an urgent warning, the Liverpool Echo reports. The last two weeks have seen a steady increase in the rolling weekly total, although it is lower than in other areas that have restrictions in place. The cases are not confined to a specific area but are across the city, and the data shows that adults under 40 account for half of the confirmed cases. Public Health England data shows the number of new Covid-19 cases in the city reached 84 in the seven days up to 19 August. The previous week had seen 61. With schools set to reopen next week, people are being urged remain vigilant to help try and avoid cases in the community and in schools and colleges, the paper reports. As a result, a renewed appeal is being made, particularly to under-40s, to respect social distancing, wearing of face coverings, and to abide by limits on household mixing and get tested if experiencing symptoms. Hi. Caroline Davies here, taking over the blog for a while. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com The test and trace figures released earlier – with 75.5% of close contacts reached through the NHS system – represented the ninth week in a row where the government has fallen short of its 80% target. Dido Harding, the interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection, said: “We will continue to build the service further to reach more and more people and to scale up our testing capacity by expanding our network of testing sites and investing in new technologies.” Nicola Sturgeon has provided a breakdown of testing figures for young people as she attempts to reassure parents about the risks to pupils returning to school. She said that 17,500 young people aged 2-17 years were tested last week and of those only 49 had tested positive for the virus, which works out as a 0.3% positivity rate. She said that this showed that parents should be vigilant “but not unduly concerned”, and reminded parents of the particular symptoms that merited booking a test. She also confirmed that police would from today have additional powers to break up house parties, which have been identified as a source of transmission in a number of recent clusters. She directed a message specifically to young people: “This is not about trying to stop people having fun. We are not trying to police your social lives … but for the overall health and wellbeing of the country it needs to be done safely and responsibly.” Council leaders in Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees have joined Greater Manchester in attacking the government’s communications and strategy of ward-by-ward lockdowns in areas with higher coronavirus infection rates. With a new announcement on restrictions in parts of Greater Manchester, east Lancashire and West Yorkshire due to be made on Friday, councillors Susan Hinchcliffe, Tim Swift and Shabir Pandor, the leaders of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees respectively, said: Adding and subtracting restrictions ward by ward makes the already confused local regulations almost impossible to understand for residents so it begs the question whether restrictions across partial geography can be of any use at all? On top of this, people’s patience is wearing thin with the confusion. They need to know that the restrictions are fair otherwise they won’t keep to them. They called on the government to lift restrictions in their three council areas in line with the rest of England so that messaging to the public would be “clearer”. The number of people arriving in the UK by air in July was 89% lower than during the same month last year, new figures show. Some 1.3 million passengers flew into the UK last month compared with 11.1 million in July 2019, the Home Office said. But the figures do indicate a rise in demand for air travel since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The average number of monthly arrivals by air in April, May and June was below 200,000. Data released by the National Police Chiefs Council shows that 18,683 fixed-penalty notices were issued under new coronavirus laws in England and Wales between 27 March and 17 August. The weekly count for England and Wales shows there was a general upward trend in the first period of the restrictions which continued through early April and peaked in the week ending 16 April, which included the Easter bank holiday. There was then generally a flatter trend through the rest of April and early May. Penalties tailed off considerably since then, as lockdown restrictions were lifted. For example, in the last four-week period just 13 fines were issued by forces in England. A total of 46 fixed-penalty notices were issued between 15 June and 17 August for breaches of face covering rules, the majority (38) for not wearing a covering on public transport. The remaining eight related to not wearing a covering in a shop. Here’s Kate Proctor’s analysis of the task ahead for Davey. It notes some concerns over maintaining the support of those members who backed Moran because they hoped she might mark a radical departure with the party’s past and take it to the left. One member says: I could see some people going under Ed. For some members of the party it’s more of the same and not different enough. Of course the idea of a radical left party is naturally appealing to some but is it shoring up the soft Tory vote? We need to remember most of our target seats are those areas. Your Guildfords and Eastbournes, middle England. To the public this has probably been a boring election but for the party it’s probably been one of the more fractious internally. The full piece is here. Davey’s victory over Moran means the three biggest UK-wide parties are led by white men with seats in London, a fact which may not do much to realise the hopes all three have espoused to speak more effectively for the whole country. Turning back to coronavirus, new figures from the Department of Health and Social Care show that 75.5% of close contacts of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in England were reached through the test-and-trace system in the week ending 19 August. That figure is up from 71.6% in the previous week. For cases handled by local health protection teams, 95.6% of contacts were reached and asked to self-isolate in the week to 19 August. By contrast, for those cases handled either online or by call centres, 61.6% of close contacts have been reached and asked to self-isolate. Davey seeks to signal his hope of moving the party beyond the remain supporters who have backed it in recent years by saying: “Whether you’re from the north, south, or somewhere in between, whether you voted for Brexit or remain, or just wanted the whole thing settled, whether you voted Labour, Conservative, Liberal Democrat, SNP or Plaid, my message for you is this: I will travel up and down our country to meet you ... I will face up to uncomfortable truths. And I will make your concerns my own.” When he finishes speaking he gives some awkward commiserations to a masked Layla Moran and leaves. Here’s political editor Heather Stewart’s full story on Davey’s victory. Davey says he loves the party and stands for social justice, political reform, equality, and protecting the environment. “I stand for fairness and fighting to protect the rights of ordinary people,” he says. And he says that he backs international cooperation. But he says the party must “wake up and smell the coffee” because it has lost touch with voters at the national level. “We have to face the facts of three disappointing general election results,” he says. “The truth is voters don’t believe the Liberal Democrats want to help ordinary people get on in life... nationally voters have been sending us a message, but we have not been listening. It is time for us to start listening. As leader I am telling you that I have got that message. I am listening now.” Davey got 42,756 votes against 24,564 for Moran. He is speaking now and begins by thanking Moran, the party membership, and his family. The Lib Dems have announced the new leader of the party is Ed Davey. Davey, who succeeds Jo Swinson, has been acting leader since the party’s disastrous 2019 general election results. He comfortably beat Layla Moran in a race that was postponed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Ciaran Martin, the departing head of the National Cyber Security Centre, has said that a rise in online scams and cyberattacks linked to coronavirus have proven the worth of the NCSC. During lockdown, the body launched a reporting service which allowed people to forward suspicious emails directly to the agency for further investigation - it has so far received more than 1.8 million reports, which has resulted in over 16,800 malicious sites being blocked or taken down. Mr Martin told the BBC that as well as an increase in online scams looking to exploit fears around the virus and tricking people into giving up personal information on buying goods, foreign actors targeting vaccine development had presented a new challenge. “For a lot of the things that we were seeing in the high end of vaccine protection, it was detected by us because it was the more sophisticated end, where the attacker is trying harder not to get caught,” he said. This is Archie Bland taking over the UK live blog from Damien Gayle. The Guardian’s community team is seeking readers’ views of the scheme to pay people on low incomes up to £182 if they are forced to self-isolate. They’re particularly interested in hearing from people living in areas with high rates of infection at the moment. Get in touch here: The number of asylum applications received by the UK between April and June nearly halved quarter-on-quarter, fresh figures show, as the Covid-19 pandemic limited migration flows across the world, writes Jamie Grierson, the Guardian’s home affairs correspondent. There were 4,850 asylum applications made in the second quarter of the year, compared to 8,455 in the first three months of the year, Home Office statistics reveal. The figures come at a time of heightened anxiety over a significant increase in migrants arriving in the UK on small boats across the Channel, underlining that the rise in arrivals across the strait of Dover comes when overall asylum applications are down. While high compared with historic averages, the number of migrants arriving in small boats between April and June – around 1,960 to 1,980, according to analysis by PA Media – is significantly lower than the near 4,000 plunge in asylum applications in the same period. More than 5,000 people have arrived in the UK on small boats across the strait of Dover so far this year, more than double the total for the whole of 2019. The drop in asylum applications and rise in Channel crossings can in part be explained by the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, which restricted movement across the world. Josh Halliday, the Guardian’s north of England correspondent, has written on the responses today to the government’s scheme to pay poorer workers to self-isolate. He writes: The government trial to pay low-paid workers in England up to £13 a day to self-isolate if they test positive for the coronavirus has been described as a “slap in the face” that would leave people without enough money to live on. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, defended the level of payment as being based on statutory sick pay of £95.85 a week, but the amount was roundly criticised as going “nowhere near far enough”. Mohammed Iqbal, the leader of Pendle borough council, one of the areas where the scheme is being trialled, said: “I welcome the fact that there is a financial package in place but the figures that the government has introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive.” The number of passengers arriving in the UK by air increased more than sixfold month-on-month in July as lockdown restrictions were eased and travel corridors were introduced between different countries, writes Jamie Grierson, the Guardian’s home affairs correspondent. There were 1.2 million arrivals to the UK by air in July, compared with less than 200,000 in June, Home Office statistics reveal. However, the total number of arrivals in July was still 89% down on the same month in 2019, when 11.1 million people arrived in the UK by air, the data shows. From 8 June, all arrivals in the UK were required to self-isolate for 14 days but this was significantly relaxed on 10 July with the introduction of so-called travel corridors, which allowed quarantine-free travel between designated nations. Since then, a number of popular holiday destinations, including Spain, France and Croatia, have seen mandatory quarantine reimposed. Half of Britons want the government to extend its job retention furlough scheme for an extra year, in a move that would mirror longer protections to be put in place in Germany, according to a poll commissioned by the trade union Unite. The UK’s economy has taken the biggest hit of all the G7 major economies and is facing job losses at a level not seen in living memory. In a press release, Unite said it was particularly concerned that vital strategic sectors, such as manufacturing and aviation, would shed tens of thousands of jobs unless the UK adopted extended job support measures. The survey of more than 1,000 working adults revealed that nearly half (49%) want the government to emulate the Germans by extending furlough for another year. Support for extending the JRS was greatest in the south (49%) and London (57%). Just over a third (35%) said they felt it was time for the scheme to be scrapped. The survey also found that nearly one in five (19%) were pessimistic about their job and income security in the coming year, compared with just over a third who were optimistic. And two-thirds (66%) supported the extension of a ban on evictions for those who can’t afford to pay their rent until March 2021. Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, said: This poll is a clear indicator of the public’s fear for the near future. Little wonder that Britons feel so uncertain about what is round the corner. More people in this country have fallen victim to Covid-19 and the UK’s economy has shrunk by more than twice as that of our major competitor, Germany. Tens of thousands of jobs have gone over the summer, and as the end of the job retention scheme grows ever closer, we’re extremely worried that UK employers will shed even more. The extension of the scheme would calm nerves and put a solid floor under an economy that is braced for a certain storm this autumn. Despite Germany’s relatively optimistic economic outlook, Angela Merkel has extended her country’s version of the job retention scheme to further boost economic growth. Other European countries including France, Spain and Italy have or are going to do the same. We urge Boris Johnston to show support for Britain’s workers and follow suit. Westminster is also lagging behind Scotland and Northern Ireland, where the eviction ban has sensibly been extended until March next year. As things stand, hard-up families in England and Wales face being turfed out of their homes next month in the midst of an economic contraction the like of which has not been seen for generations. During this time of national crisis and severe economic disruption, people need leadership that will provide security for their homes and livelihoods and the economy. We are only asking the government does for its citizens what nations across Europe are doing, which is to take action to prevent vital industries and jobs from going into a tailspin and to ensure communities are able to weather the worst impacts of the pandemic. The workers of this country expect the UK government now to do the same. The level of financial support for offered by the government to people who have to self-isolate is “nowhere near enough to provide real support” and “a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive” that offers no incentive to stay at home, council leaders in areas where the scheme is being piloted have said. The Pendle borough council leader, Mohammed Iqbal, said the level of financial support is “not acceptable”. The Labour councillor told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: The figures that the government have introduced are really a slap in the face for those people who sadly test positive and there is no incentive in my opinion for those people to self-isolate. If you’re a manual worker who’s not able to do their job from home, normally getting paid the living wage or the minimum wage, the government are now going to say to you we’ll pay you £4.55 an hour. Not acceptable. Oldham council’s leader, Sean Fielding, said: I am pleased that the government have agreed to at least provide some financial help for those being asked to self-isolate in Oldham. Sadly this offer is nowhere near enough to provide real support, and it shows how out of touch with ordinary people this government is. I stand with the Time Out To Help Out campaign in asking government to support people across the country to self-isolate on full pay. People should not have to worry about loss of income whilst being asked to self-isolate. Oldham residents have pulled together to face this crisis; we now need Government do to their bit. We need a real and meaningful offer of support for Oldham residents, who deserve better. More from Matt Hancock, who has been put through the wringer of broadcast interviews this morning. The health secretary has denied claims in the Times this morning that the NHS has a “hidden waiting list” of 15.3 million patients who need follow-up appointments for health problems. The paper had reported the figure was gleaned from what it described as “the first analysis of its kind”, adding: The official waiting list, which stands at 3.9 million, shows how many patients are yet to have their first hospital appointment after a GP referral. However, the total number who are on hospital books in England and need appointments is not collated centrally. A new calculation, based on freedom of information requests to NHS trusts and seen by The Times, puts the figure at 15.3 million. Responding to the report, Hancock told LBC radio: I’ve looked into this research since it arrived in the Times overnight, and it is total rubbish. It is actually a count of the total number of appointments that there are ... what they’ve done is counted all the appointments that there are in the NHS. If you have an appointment, that is not because you’re on a waiting list, it is because you are going to go and see someone in the NHS. We measure waiting lists very rigorously and obviously a really important part of the recovery of the country post-coronavirus is getting those treatments that had to be delayed, getting them dealt with. But let’s deal with the facts rather than a spurious survey. The FTSE 100 index of leading shares on the London Stock Exchange eased in early trading, dropping by 0.1%. Stock markets have also retreated across Europe. That followed a trading session in Asia that saw MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan reach its highest point since August 2018 before dropping back to a 0.1% gain. Jet engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, after revealing a £5.4bn loss and a plan to sell assets to shore up its creaking balance sheet. Shares fell by 6.6% in early trading to approach their lowest point since the financial crisis. Rolls-Royce has been hit hard by the decline in air travel, which has caused a massive hit to the revenues it earns from servicing jet engines. Total revenues fell by a quarter to £5.8bn in the first half of 2020. Meanwhile, WPP reported a £2.6bn loss in the first half after the impact of the pandemic prompted the company to wipe billions off the value of expensive advertising acquisitions made by its founder and former chief executive, Sir Martin Sorrell. However, the world’s largest advertising group, which has shed 5,000 jobs in the first six months, surprised investors by re-instating its dividend declaring that the worst is now behind it, assuming there is no second wave of the virus. Read more of the latest business news and market moves on our business blog, anchored today by Jasper Jolly. Matt Hancock has suggested there was potential for the new self-isolation support payments to be rolled out beyond initial pilot areas of Oldham and Blackburn with Darwen and Pendle, which have local lockdowns. Asked on BBC Breakfast why people outside these areas were not entitled to the money, the health secretary said: This is where we’re doing it in the first instance, firstly to make sure that the systems work, that we can get the money fast to people, because obviously if you’re asking somebody to self-isolate for a fortnight we want to try to get the money to them at the start of that rather than afterwards. He said the payments were being introduced in areas which have “the most acute need”, adding: “We’ll see how that goes and we’ll get the feedback, with the potential to roll it out further.” The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said providing increased financial support to those asked to self-isolate in areas of high Covid-19 prevalence would help the NHS test and trace programme meet its target. He told LBC radio that local lockdowns were “working” but further support was required to help encourage those contacted by NHS tracers to stay at home. One of the challenges is we want to get NHS test and trace up to over 80% of contacts, getting them to self-isolate - we’re at just over 75%, so we’re nearly there but not quite there. We talk to all these people because NHS test and trace phones them up and has a conversation, and one of the things, especially in areas of low income, that is causing some people to say: ‘I can’t do that’ or ‘I can’t give you the contacts’ is because they need to go to work. Bringing in extra support, in addition to the universal credit they get, if people self-isolate is one of the things that people have been asking for to get those rates up because it really matters that the people that need to self-isolate do because that’s how we stop the spread of the virus. However, he faced a stiff challenge from LBC presenter Nick Ferrari on whether £13 a day would persuade people to stay at home, when they had families to feed. Restaurants are extending their offer of discounted meals in the government’s eat out to help out scheme after it ends on 31 August because of its popularity with diners, although the businesses will have to cover the costs themselves, writes Joanna Partridge for the Guardian business desk. In September, consumers will be able to take advantage of reduced prices at nationwide chains including Harvester, Toby Carvery, Tesco Café, Bill’s, Pizza Hut and Prezzo. The scheme has drawn people back into restaurants, bars and cafes, providing a much-needed boost for hospitality businesses hard hit by the coronavirus crisis. More than 64m meals have been claimed in total since it began at the start of the month – the equivalent of one for almost every person in the country. Matt Hancock said the extra financial support for people on low incomes in lockdown areas required to self-isolate was “set at the level of statutory sick pay”. Asked during an appearance on BBC Breakfast if payments representing £13 a day were enough, Hancock said they were “in addition” to other benefits that people on low incomes receive. When it was put to him that people self-isolating would be losing income from their jobs, Hancock said: Only in some cases, but absolutely we acknowledge that. It’s set at the level of statutory sick pay in order to make sure that people don’t lose out from doing the right thing. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has said that the additional financial support for those living in lockdown areas on low incomes who are asked to self-isolate was about addressing some of the “challenges” with the NHS test and trace programme. Hancock told Sky News: The big picture is we have to make sure we get as many people as possible successfully going through that NHS Test and Trace system and one of the challenges that has come back on the ground is to get that figure even higher for people on low incomes to make sure they get extra support if they’re going into self-isolation. He denied that the development was evidence that universal credit was not enough to live on, arguing that “in fact the levels of universal credit were increased from the previous rates that were in place under the old system”. Addressing this week’s other big story, Hancock said schools would need to be certain distancing was in place between teachers and pupils to ensure coronavirus was not spread between schools by supply teachers. When asked about whether extra guidance was being given to schools about supply teachers working in multiple establishments, Hancock said: The principle is that we want to keep certain teachers socially distanced from the pupils because there are all sorts of circumstances where a teacher might need to teach classes that are in different bubbles within the school. The pupils are put within bubbles and the bubbles shouldn’t meet. The goal is to keep the teachers socially distanced. This is just one example of how challenging it is for all sorts of parts of society to minimise the impact of Covid. My answer to you is that it is the social distancing between the teacher and pupils which is the goal here, but our total focus is on getting the schools back. He said the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and the chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, were consulted on the decision to make it mandatory for secondary-aged pupils to wear face coverings in communal areas in schools which are in so-called coronavirus hot spots. Also in the Guardian’s coverage this morning is the news that black, Asian and minority ethnic people were significantly less likely to trust public officials and government scientists at the height of the coronavirus outbreak. Fifty-seven per cent of BAME people reported having either complete trust or a great deal of trust in information from health scientists, compared with 75% of white people. Forty-five per cent of BAME people had either complete trust or a great deal of trust in information from government scientific advisers, compared with 65% of white people. And BAME people were more worried about Covid-19’s impact on their physical, mental and financial wellbeing and about the impact on children’s education. Arooj Shah, the deputy leader of Oldham council in Greater Manchester, which this month recorded the highest infection rate in the country, highlighted a possible barrier created by the daily Downing Street press briefings that often involved “three white men behind a podium telling you what you are doing”. She said: “You need to start looking like the people you represent.” Following the coronavirus lockdown, more than half of young people have developed anxiety about social interaction and six in 10 are concerned about being able to maintain social distancing at school, according to a survey. The research, carried out for YMCA England, found that while nine in 10 missed face-to-face engagement, 52% have anxiety about social interaction and 63% are worried about being able to maintain social distancing when they return to school. Some 57% are worried about not having a safe space to socialise with friends, 44% feel anxious to be in social spaces and 36% feel scared of the outside world. They are also worried about falling behind at school, future exam results and their job prospects. More than half (57%) said they were worried about their family experiencing job losses or money problems. And 58% said relationships with family members have become strained during the lockdown. Overall, 43% are worried about their wellbeing as society recovers from the Covid-19 outbreak. Some 1,009 young people aged 11 to 16 in the UK were surveyed by the charity between July 24 and 27. Denise Hatton, chief executive of YMCA England &amp; Wales, said that without significant reinvestment in youth services, including safe spaces, mentors, mediation and mental health support, young people risk becoming a “lonely, lost generation with nowhere to turn”. She said: The introduction of lockdown has accelerated and exacerbated the situation, with young people forced to stay at home, isolate themselves from their peers and be without access to positive activities. A generation which was already at a disadvantage have been dealt a further blow by Covid-19 and face deep uncertainty about what is next for them in its wake. What is essential to support young people through the easing of lockdown and beyond are safe spaces like youth services. They can be utilised to carefully and positively build young people’s confidence, provide much-needed support and guidance, and ultimately help them to get back on track. There is a mixed bag across today’s national newspaper front pages, with every one picking a different story to splash. Germany has scrapped plans to discuss Brexit at a high-level diplomatic meeting next week because there has not been “any tangible progress” in talks, the Guardian has learned, as Brussels laments a “completely wasted” summer. EU officials now believe the UK government is prepared to risk a no-deal exit when the transition period comes to an end on 31 December, and will try to pin the blame on Brussels if talks fail. According to the Times, the NHS has a “hidden waiting list” of 15.3 million patients who need followup appointments for health problems, according to what the paper describes as “the first analysis of its kind”. The official waiting list, which stands at 3.9 million, shows how many patients are yet to have their first hospital appointment after a GP referral. However, the total number who are on hospital books in England and need appointments is not collated centrally. A new calculation, based on freedom of information requests to NHS trusts and seen by The Times, puts the figure at 15.3 million. Coronavirus sufferers and their contacts will be paid to quarantine themselves, says the Telegraph, “amid signs that increasing numbers are refusing to self-isolate because of financial worries”. You can find out more about that story from the Guardian’s coverage. The Daily Mail splashes on a senior business leader telling the prime minister, Boris Johnson, that he “must do more to get office workers back at their desks”. Carolyn Fairbairn warns commercial centres risk being permanent “ghost towns”. Writing in the Mail, the director general of the CBI says getting staff back into offices and workplaces is as important as the return of pupils to school. Well, she would say that. Following in its long tradition of placing unusual health-related stories on its front page, the Express reports on a “natural ingredient in a £10 insect repellent” that scientists have found can kill coronavirus. The discovery, made by experts at the government’s military research facility Porton Down, Wiltshire, could provide millions of people with another layer of protection against the deadly disease. Defence minister Jeremy Quin said that Citriodiol killed the virus and acted as a barrier for four hours. According to the Metro, “wags on Twitter” have dubbed Ofqual’s unfair marking process the “Teenage Mutant Ninja Algorithm”, after Boris Johnson blamed the A-level grading debacle on a “mutant algorithm” - hence the otherwise incomprehensible headline. The Morning Star leads on the news that British armed forces have provided military training for 17 countries listed by the Foreign Office as having abused human rights. Anti-arms campaigners called for the government to review its military collaboration and training with nations on the Foreign Office list of 30 “human-rights priority countries”, which has been ongoing since 2018. According to the i, senior Tories have condemned the government’s handling of Covid-19 guidance after it was forced into another major U-turn on pupils wearing face masks. Boris Johnson was last night accused of “throwing civil service leaders under a bus” to protect himself and his ministers, reports the Independent, after he sacked the Department for Education’s top mandarin in the wake of the A-level exam grading fiasco. Sarah Harding, the Girls Aloud singer, kept her breast cancer battle a secret from her Girls Aloud bandmates for months, according to the Mirror. The 38-year-old only told them this week and revealed it has spread. She said: “I’m doing my best to stay positive.” Finally, from the dependable Daily Star comes this: Kebab-lovers face bank holiday chaos after experts warned we could run out of doner meat. A surge in demand from boozy staycationers could leave millions of hungry holidaymakers with empty stomachs. Good morning, this is Damien Gayle bringing you the latest updates and headlines from coronavirus-related UK news this morning. So far today we have learned of a new government scheme to pay people on low incomes in areas with high coronavirus infection rates up to £182 if they have to self-isolate. Under the scheme, being trialled from Tuesday in Blackburn with Darwen, Oldham and Pendle, low-paid people who test positive for Covid-19 will receive £130 for their 10-day isolation period. This rises to £182 – or £13 a day – for people they have been in close contact with, including members of their household, who have to isolate for 14 days. The move follows weeks of campaigning by regional mayors, councils and trade unions who said millions of people across the country could not afford to isolate without pay for a fortnight. Later on we will be expecting the latest weekly Covid-19 epidemiology statistics from Public Health England, and the latest weekly statistics from the government’s test and trace programme. The Office for National Statistics will also be publishing data and experimental indicators on the impact of the pandemic on the UK economy and society. There may be a meeting between Boris Johnson and the families of people who have lost loved ones to Covid-19, although this is to be confirmed. The government’s Joint Biosecurity Centre is also due to hold a meeting."

          "headline": "These U-turns show Johnson is not informed by science but scared witless by it",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has found a new role for Britain’s most endangered transport mode, the bus. He throws civil servants under it. After decapitating the Foreign Office and Cabinet Office, he has rid himself of Public Health England and those he regards as to blame for recent exam U-turns, Sally Collier of Ofqual and Jonathan Slater of the Department for Education. They have gone to save the skin of that Nureyev of U-turns, Gavin Williamson. Mind-changing has become the leitmotif of Johnson’s government. Derision would greet him if he used Margaret Thatcher’s boast to a Tory conference: “The Johnson’s not for turning.” The Guardian has kept a tally of 11 U-turns, from lockdowns and quarantines to school exam results, key-worker visas and Huawei’s role in 5G. There is nothing wrong in U-turns. As Keynes reputedly said: “When events change I change my mind.” In the case of coronavirus, Johnson’s apologists can plead that everything has been unexpected and events constantly in flux. Governments initially floundered across Europe. In such circumstances, a U-turn may be a disaster averted. But almost a dozen U-turns looks like carelessness. Johnson’s constant reversion to “the science” has now left the political roadway piled with wreckage. When he is not pursued by viruses he is tormented by the Furies of the age, algorithms. Once he – or perhaps his amanuensis Dominic Cummings – adored them. Now they rank with civil servants in his demonology. His most spectacular U-turn, into total lockdown on 23 March, was ascribed to an Imperial College algorithm worthy of the KGB’s finest hackers. It told him that if he refused to U-turn, 500,000 Britons “might die”. Johnson is now said to be furious. At this point the boundary between being informed by science and being scared witless becomes academic. The issue is whether science is “on top or on tap”. Do its often spurious certainties diminish political responsibility? In his explanation of his U-turn over school face masks, Williamson contrived both to blame the science and insist it was his decision. To the BBC on Wednesday, the education secretary cited the World Health Organization, “evidence” and “advice”. In reality his decision was led by a policy change in Scotland. In the case of the A-levels fiasco, Johnson this week blamed another algorithm, this time a “mutant” one. Ministers were warned what would happen if they let a machine warp A-levels’ crooked timber of mankind. They ignored the warning and ordered the machine to avoid grade inflation. It obeyed. A similarly “mutant” algorithm has apparently seized Johnson’s now obsessively centralised housing policy, threatening to build over miles of Tory countryside in the south-east. Lobbyists for the construction industry told the algorithm to follow the market, and again it obeyed. These algorithms are no more “mutant” than civil servants. They are programmed to inform the powers that be on the fiendish job of running a modern country. They cannot be accused of conspiring to undermine the government of the day. At present they must struggle to infer the objectives of a leaderless government that constantly changes its mind. The only “mutation” just now is in the prime minister’s head. The art of government is that of handling advice. Followers of the satirical television series, Yes, Minister, thought it showed how civil servants always got their way. It did not. It showed bureaucratic efficiency and elected politicians in perpetual tension, with the outcome a compromise, an equilibrium. But the result was ministers nowadays feeling they must surround themselves with inexperienced “special advisers”. A loyal civil service is vital to good government, be it radical or conservative. I suspect a future coronavirus inquiry will conclude that senior officials found themselves squeezed out of a shouting match between government scientists and panicking politicians. NHS medics at first dictated policy, demanding ministers tell the public to “protect your NHS” – which ended up being at the expense of care homes and cancer patients. At risk of losing their jobs, civil servants stop telling truth to power. Policy wobbles and the steering wheels spin. There is no alternative in democratic government to ministerial responsibility, to an iron chain linking the electorate to parliament and cabinet. A growing body of Tory backbenchers are reportedly worried at the lack of leadership implied by Johnson’s U-turns. The gossip is that a still sickly prime minister is showing little interest in decision-making and largely out of the loop. Trump-like, he craves nightly appearances on television where we see him dressed in worker’s garb, waffling to “the people” in some distant province. An old maxim holds that leaders be judged not by their brilliance but by the quality of those around them. Their “court” is their first line of defence against the daily bombardment of advice and pressure. Under Johnson that court is composed of a tiny group of cronies, inexperienced and clearly bereft of the talents of those he has dismissed. He is Henry VIII awaiting his Hilary Mantel. This matters because the decision about to face Britain is far more serious in the long-term than any virus. It is over how to agree frictionless dealings with our immediate trading neighbours in Europe. I am reliably told there is not a single person within the penumbra of Downing Street remotely up to the job of such negotiation. • Simon Jenkins is a Guardian columnist"

          "headline": "On masks in schools – like everything else in this pandemic – Johnson is winging it",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has once again copied Nicola Sturgeon’s homework and handed it in late. On Tuesday, he sent Gavin Williamson to announce that, as in Scotland, face masks would now be required in communal areas of schools in England. Earlier the same day, his own press office had announced that England’s policy on face masks in schools was not going to change. And on Sunday, he had approved a briefing by chief medical officers that the risk of Sars-CoV-2 transmission in schools was very low. Apparently there is now sufficient evidence to mandate the wearing of masks by 12-year-olds in school corridors – but not by 12-year-olds in classrooms or 10-year-olds in corridors. But watch this space. Anything could have changed by tomorrow. I’m a parent, an ex-school governor, a GP and a scientist. I know that one of the few things we value more than our children’s education is their safety. I also know that the science of controlling the spread of the pandemic is complex, contested and fast-moving. Winging it is not an answer to scientific uncertainty. Nor is signing off on policy without engaging with the detail. Nor tailoring policies to garner populist appeal with the electorate, or defining the problem in over-simplified terms to give the appearance of a straightforward solution. Ditto succumbing to arm-twisting by lobbyists, disappearing into a yurt, or teetering unsteadily between all these options. Yet these are exactly the strategies the government has opted for throughout this pandemic. The answer to scientific uncertainty lies in the people we entrust with decision-making as well as the decisions themselves. Virtues such as honesty, integrity, reflexivity and transparency – always valued in politicians, though rarely found – are critical at moments like this. Our children’s lives – and those of other, perhaps highly vulnerable members of our households – are at stake. If decisions need to be made in the light of imperfect and incomplete data, we need to know how and to what extent those data are flawed, and with what assumptions and guesstimates we must buttress them. To that end, we – and those to whom we entrust our children’s safety – need a dialogue with our political leaders, not an opaque algorithm or outsourced consultancy project. We could be talking about whether children should wear masks in corridors (this week’s priority question), whether teachers should wear visors in the classroom (perhaps next week’s) or how often and by whom children should be swabbed (the week after?). Whatever the topic, flipping from “the evidence is weak” to “the evidence is strong” without explanation or qualification is not just bad science but bad politics. If politicians want to pull the wool over our eyes for partisan ends, they should choose a topic less important than our kids. I don’t have a simple, universal solution to the question of who should wear what kind of mask at school, in what circumstances or for how long. Nobody does – not least because this kind of problem requires deliberation. We need to consider, in different localities and settings, the trade-offs between partial and imperfect solutions; between comfort and safety; between the needs of the majority and those of children and staff with unique (perhaps hidden) medical conditions; between the priorities of the privileged and the rights of the disadvantaged; and between scientific evidence and local contingencies. While a competent government can play an important role in guiding and resourcing particular courses of action, these deliberations should generally occur locally and involve (in the case of school health) teachers, parents, health professionals – and most importantly, children themselves. Nothing I have seen of the present government (and little I’ve seen of previous governments) has persuaded me that anyone in Whitehall knows better than a school’s headteacher, heads of year, governing body, student council and school nurse what the priority issues are for that school or how they might best be addressed. A colleague of mine teaches in a school where all the children and many of the staff are deaf. Another teaches in an inner-city academy that adjoins a busy road, where opening the window means that people must shout to be heard above traffic. Some 98% of the pupils are from minority ethnic groups where multi-generational households are the norm, putting them at greater risk of Covid-19. Neither of these schools needs a blanket policy instructed from on high; both need to work out how best to balance infection control with achieving the school’s educational and pastoral mission – perhaps for many months, even years to come. Johnson knows better than most how dangerous this virus can be. He should be setting a broad policy direction, drawing on the expertise of his scientific advisers, but allowing the people who care most about a school and its community to lead the negotiations about what is best for them.

          "bodyText": "The British government repeatedly said that the algorithm designed to make up exam grades for pupils who weren’t able to take them was “robust”, shortly before abandoning it because it was apparently broken. So how robust is an official claim that something is robust? To call things “robust” is arguably a kind of crypto-machismo, which is to be expected from the particular men currently misgoverning us. It originally referred to bodily sturdiness, as in William Caxton’s 1490 translation of the prologue to Virgil’s Aeneid, when the hero proves his “robuste puyssaunce” by yanking a tree out of the ground. It derives from the Latin robustus, literally “made of oak”, and thereafter strong or firm. In English, “robust” could thereafter be applied to intense colours or smells, loud voices, solid objects, and latterly to reliable statistical tests or computer algorithms, unlike the one just abandoned. The most pertinent sense of “robust” in the present context, however, is that euphemistically meaning coarse, rude, or uncaring. In 1817 the mathematician Charles Hutton expressed his horror of “robust manners” and “vulgar ideas”. In that sense at least, everything Boris Johnson and chums do is as robust as anyone would wish. • Steven Poole’s A Word for Every Day of the Year is published by Quercus."

          "bodyText": "Top story: Gunman did not oppose sentence Good morning, Warren Murray bringing you Thursday’s key stories. The terrorist who killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand will spend the rest of his life in jail without possibility of parole – the first time in modern New Zealand that such a sentence has been imposed. “You have offered no apology or public acknowledgement of the harms you have caused,” Justice Cameron Mander told Brenton Tarrant, 29. “While I appreciate that you have forsaken the opportunity to use these proceedings as a platform, you appear neither contrite nor ashamed.” Tarrant pleaded guilty and was unrepresented during the sentencing proceedings, but used a stand-by lawyer to tell the judge that he did “not oppose the application that he should be sentenced to the term of life without parole”. Dozens more people were wounded in the attacks in March 2019, the country’s worst peacetime massacre. The sentence came after the court heard three days of emotional victim impact statements during which more than 90 of those bereaved or wounded in the attacks addressed the court. Throughout this morning in Christchurch dozens of members of the public gathered outside the courthouse. Many held signs depicting large, red hearts, or reading: “We are one.” * * * Kenosha roils – Two people have been shot dead when suspected white militia members opened fire at protests in the city of Kenosha that were sparked by the shooting and grave wounding of Jacob Blake. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, was arrested over the protester shootings. NBA playoffs have been suspended after one team boycotted their latest game in protest over the shooting. Jacob Blake admitted to having a knife when he was shot by police, Wisconsin’s attorney general, Josh Kaul, has said. The attorney general said police used a Taser unsuccessfully on Blake before an officer shot him seven times in the back. The knife was recovered from the footwell of the car Blake had leaned into at the moment he was shot. Police from the scene have been placed on administrative leave while the matter is investigated, including Rusten Sheskey, the officer who fired the shots. At the Republican national convention, reduced almost to a sideshow on a tumultuous day in the US, Mike Pence, the vice-president, called for law and order to be restored. * * * Coronavirus latest – A home care worker who did not wear protective equipment may have infected a client with a fatal case of coronavirus during weeks of contradictory government guidance on PPE, an official investigation has found. Black and minority ethnic people trusted government scientists and public health officials less than white people did at the height of the UK’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a study for the Wellcome Trust. The findings prompt questions about whether more could have been done to better communicate with different communities. Keep up with further coronavirus developments at our global live blog. * * * ‘Unsurvivable’ – Thousands of residents have evacuated ahead of Hurricane Laura lashing coastal communities in Louisiana and Texas. Forecasters have described the storm surge from the mammoth category 4 hurricane as “unsurvivable”. The governors of Texas and Louisiana urged residents along the affected coastline to leave the area as the National Hurricane Center warned of storm surges of up to 20ft along a 170-mile stretch of coastline. * * * Civil servants take fall for A-levels – Boris Johnson has been accused of presiding over the death of ministerial accountability after No 10 removed the most senior Department for Education official, its permanent secretary, Jonathan Slater, from his post in the wake of the exams fiasco. A day earlier Sally Collier quit as chief executive of the exams regulator Ofqual. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has faced calls to quit but has remained in post and repeatedly declined to say whether he offered his resignation. The two civil servants are the latest to be frozen out while Johnson’s ministers escape sanction. * * * Girls worry over online image – A third of girls and young women will not post selfies online without using a filter or app to change their appearance, while a similar proportion have deleted photos with too few “likes” or comments, research has found. Girlguiding said 39% of the 1,473 survey respondents aged 11-21 felt upset that they could not look the same in real life as they did online. One respondent said: “I find it hard to go through Insta because everyone looks perfect and it lowers my self-confidence.” Girlguiding advocate Phoebe Kent said she felt influencer culture was one of the most damaging phenomena on social media. Girlguiding has submitted evidence to this year’s women and equalities committee inquiry into body image. Today in Focus podcast: Reni Eddo-Lodge on white privilege The first black British author to top the UK bestseller list talks with the Observer’s Nosheen Iqbal about global discussions on racism after the death of George Floyd. Today in Focus is revisiting episodes examining race and racism after a worldwide summer of protests in reaction to the killing of George Floyd in the US. Lunchtime read: To catch a sex trafficker Thousands of young women leave home in Nigeria every year on the promise of a good job in Europe, only to be trapped by debt and forced into prostitution. But one joined forces with investigators in Italy to expose the traffickers. Sport On an extraordinary day for the NBA, the Milwaukee Bucks boycotted Game 5 of their playoff series against the Orlando Magic in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, while other basketball figures staged their own protests and spoke of their support for the cause. In New York, Naomi Osaka pulled out of the semi-finals of the Western &amp; Southern Open in protest at racial injustice – and soon afterwards the tournament followed her lead by suspending Thursday’s play. The race to sign Lionel Messi is on, and while he may one day come to regret leaving Barcelona, the club certainly will, writes Sid Lowe. Wendie Renard scored the only goal of the game for Lyon and PSG were pushed aside in their Women’s Champions league semi-final. A Women’s Super League fixture between West Ham and Arsenal plus a Brighton men’s friendly this weekend are among a list of sporting events which will act as new test events for spectators. A Sport Integrity Forum has been launched “to mend the cracks in the system” in the wake of the gymnastics abuse scandal and other concerns around bullying, discrimination and corruption in British sport. Sir Dave Brailsford has described his relationship with Chris Froome as “great”, despite his decision to omit the four-times Tour de France winner from his Ineos Grenadiers team selection for this year’s race. And Matt Le Tissier says it is “time to look forward to life’s next challenge” after being dropped, along with Phil Thompson and Charlie Nicholas, by Sky Sports. Business Asian stock markets have retreated as investors look ahead to a speech by the US Federal Reserve chairman for signs of more support to an economic recovery. Market benchmarks in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Seoul fell while Shanghai and Sydney were higher. The FTSE looks like opening flat to just a few points higher at this stage while sterling is worth $1.320 and €1.116 this morning. The papers The incendiary situation in Kenosha, Wisconsin is well illustrated on the Guardian’s front page today by the picture accompanying our story “‘Vigilante’ held after two shot dead in US”. Our print edition’s lead story is “Germany scraps Brexit talks after ‘wasted’ summer of no progress”. The Metro has “Turtle chaos” after Boris Johnson grasped at the “mutant algorithm” as the cause of the A-level debacle. The headline requires an inset picture of a ninja turtle to make it work, which is generally not a good sign, and the caption helpfully distinguishes between the PM and the cartoon character. The Telegraph splashes with “Victims of virus will be paid to quarantine” – our Guardian read on that is here. The i covers the civil service purge: “PM swings axe again as Tory unrest grows over U-turns” while the Mail helps the CBI put pressure on Johnson to “rescue Ghost Town Britain” and “get workers back at their desks”. The Times carries a news line that continues to resurface during the pandemic in one form or another: “NHS data shows 15m on ‘hidden waiting list’”. The Mirror leads on a story that also features on other fronts: “Girls Aloud Sarah’s secret cancer hell”. The Express has “Insect spray can kill virus says minister” – though the findings about citriodiol from the army’s Porton Down lab are caveated. And lastly in the FT, allegations of sexism and harassment at the Green Climate Fund: “UN-backed climate agency faces tide of abuse claims from staff”.

Here’s a quick recap of the latest coronavirus developments over the last few hours: EU trade chief Hogan quits over Ireland Covid-19 ‘golfgate’ controversy. Phil Hogan has quit as the EU’s trade commissioner after days of pressure over allegations he breached Covid-19 guidelines during a trip to his native Ireland, saying it had become clear the controversy was a distraction from his work. France reports 5,429 new coronavirus infections, new post-lockdown high. The French health ministry has registered 5,429 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, a new post-lockdown high and a level of new infections not seen since the height of the epidemic in early April. Gaza coronavirus lockdown extended by 72 hours after infections spread. Gaza will remain in lockdown at least until Sunday, health officials said after reporting two deaths and 26 Covid-19 cases in the first public outbreak of the coronavirus in the blockaded Palestinian enclave. Italy recorded its highest daily tally in coronavirus infections since May when the country was still in lockdown. A further 1,367 cases brought the total to 262,540. Despite the surge in infections, the government insists there are no plans for a new lockdown. Croatia reported its highest number of daily cases amid the summer tourism season. New cases have risen since Croatia opened its borders to tourists for the summer, hitting more than 200 daily in late August and a record 358 on Wednesday. The government said it still hopes to tackle the crisis without curfews if people would “obey the rules and act responsibly”. Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19. Early-stage clinical trials on the vaccine, developed by the Vector virology institute in Siberia, would be completed by the end of September. Western experts have been sceptical about Russia’s approval of Sputnik V, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. Lebanon could ‘lose control’ of its coronavirus outbreak, the caretaker prime minister warned. Hassan Diab said that if cases continued to rise greatly, as they have in the wake of the Beirut explosion, “we will lose control of this epidemic”. That’s all from me Jessica Murray, I’m now handing over to my colleagues in Australia. Smoke from deforestation-related fires in the Brazilian Amazon last year hospitalised more than 2,000 people and led to a “significant negative impact on public health” in the region, researchers have said. With similar serious fires expected this year, on top of a deadly Covid-19 pandemic, heavily hospitalisations are likely to be repeated, “potentially collapsing” an already overburdened health system in the region, they said in a report. “We are watching a situation similar, or even worse, than last year,” said Ane Alencar, director of science at IPAM, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute, one of the institutions behind the study. More than 4,500 square kilometres of Amazon land deforested this year or cleared but not burned last year could be set on fire during this year’s dry season, which normally runs from July to September, according to the new study. In July, the Amazon region saw a 28% increase in fires compared to the same period last year, it said. Miguel Lago, executive director of IEPS, Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, called the north of Brazil the largest area of “clinic deserts” - areas of limited healthcare availability - in the country. The Amazonian region around Manaus, for instance, has only 8.8 intensive care hospital beds per 100,000 people, below the Brazilian health ministry’s recommendation of 10 beds, Lago said. The Amazon has seen the worst outbreak of Covid-19 in Brazil, itself one of the countries most heavily impacted by the virus. “We have a very fragile health system in the Amazon, that has had a hard time facing the pandemic. So the coincidence of fires and the pandemic is very, very bad,” Lago said. More needs to be done to limit forest fires in the region this year, with the healthcare system already struggling to deal with coronavirus cases, he said. “We should be doing everything we can to avoid hospitalisation - and in this case fires are totally avoidable,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. Gaza will remain in lockdown at least until Sunday, health officials said after reporting two deaths and 26 Covid-19 cases in the first public outbreak of the coronavirus in the blockaded Palestinian enclave. As of two days ago, when the first four cases were discovered in a refugee camp in the 360 square-kilometre territory, and a 48-hour lockdown was imposed, there had been no infections outside border quarantine facilities for new arrivals. But by late on Wednesday, health officials said 26 people in several locations had tested positive for Covid-19 and two patients had died - a sign the world pandemic had penetrated Gaza’s forced isolation. The 40-kilometre-long territory run by Hamas Islamists is sealed off from the outside world by Israeli walls, watchtowers and gunboats along 90% of its border and coastline, and by Egypt along a narrow strip to the south. Both countries impose tight restrictions on movement in and out of Gaza, citing security concerns over Hamas, which is regarded as a terrorist organisation by Israel and the United States. The new infections added to concerns among local and international health organisations about Gaza’s potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital capacity. The UK and US governments are in talks to introduce an “air bridge” between London and New York to enable travellers to sidestep quarantine, The Telegraph has reported. Ministers are studying plans for regional air bridges that would enable business and other travellers to come to Britain from “low-risk” areas such as New York City within countries that are “red listed” because of their continued overall high coronavirus rates, the report said. Brazil reported 47,161 new cases of Covid-19 and 1,086 deaths in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said. Brazil has registered 3,717,156 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 117,666, according to ministry data, in the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak outside the United States Brazil has asked Chinese authorities to provide results of laboratory tests that detected traces of Covid-19 on chicken wings exported by the South American country, according to a statement sent to Reuters by Brazil’s Agriculture Ministry. The request was made during a meeting in the city of Shenzhen, in Guangdong province, where Brazilian agriculture attachés met local health and trade officials on Tuesday, the statement said. In response, according to the statement, the Chinese participants said the results are being kept by health authorities of Guangdong, who did not participate in the meeting. The Brazilians said they would continue to liaise with China’s municipal, provincial and central governments to obtain the lab reports as well as other relevant information pertaining to the case. The contamination claim concerns chicken wings produced at a Brazilian poultry plant. Aurora, the company which operates the facility in Southern Brazil, voluntarily suspended poultry exports to China effective 20 August pending more clarifications regarding the alleged contamination. According to the Brazilian government, Chinese officials at the meeting said three samples had tested positive for Covid-19: one taken from the chicken wings, and two from the packaging of products coming from Aurora’s plant in the town of Xaxim. “The health authorities in Shenzhen were unable to say whether the findings concerned only the detection of the virus’ genetic material or the active virus, nor were they able to provide further information about the alleged finding,” the statement said. The alleged contamination led the Philippines to impose a temporary ban on poultry meat imports from Brazil while Hong Kong halted chicken imports from Aurora’s Xaxim facility. The rapid pace of Covid-19 vaccine development and scant information about the US Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) vaccine review process are leading to concerns, the American Medical Association (AMA) said. In a letter, the AMA urged the FDA to ensure transparency in the vaccine development process and keep physicians informed of the agency’s plan for review of potential vaccine candidates. Vaccine hesitancy among the public appears to be reaching unprecedented levels due to a number of factors including significant spread of misinformation through channels such as social media, according to the AMA. In April, the US government initiated Operation Warp Speed and has so far invested billions to secure doses of potential vaccines from across the world. Warp Speed aims to expedite development of a vaccine and therapies to treat Covid-19, and the emphasis on speed has provoked public anxiety about the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines. Earlier this month, Russia became the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing. However, experts have warned against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. In August, top US infectious disease official Anthony Fauci said the FDA was not cutting corners on safety in its review of vaccine candidates for Covid-19. The traditional end-of-summer commuter crush appears unlikely to materialise in the UK next week as companies and staff shun the office and embrace remote working, prompting a warning from the country’s leading business body about the future of firms that rely on passing trade. Hundreds of thousands of mostly white-collar workers are expected to continue working from home, in some cases permanently, despite the reopening of schools in England over the next fortnight. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), which represents 190,000 firms, has called on businesses and the government to strike a balance to ensure outlets in sparsely populated city centres do not face oblivion. The CBI’s deputy director general, Josh Hardie, said: Remote working has been a real success for many firms and employees, and none of the many benefits should be lost,” said the. But there has also been a knock-on effect to our town and city centres, where many businesses dependent on passing trade face an uphill battle just to survive. Both the government and business have a role to play in supporting more people back to the workplace safely and securely. Things won’t return to how businesses operated pre-Covid-19, nor should they. But there is a middle ground to find as the economy reopens. As many as 30 teenagers in the UK who took a holiday to the Greek island of Zante may have contracted coronavirus, health officials have said. At least 11 of a group of 18- and 19-year-olds in Plymouth have tested positive for Covid-19 and some had been for a night out in the Devon city since their return from their holiday. The council’s public health director, Ruth Harrell, said her team was working alongside the national systems to contact and trace the young people thought to have been affected. “We know that some of these young people had no symptoms, and so carried on as normal, including a night out in Plymouth’s bars and restaurants, until they became aware of the risk,” she said. “That means more people could be infected. Phil Hogan has quit as the EU’s trade commissioner after days of pressure over allegations he breached Covid-19 guidelines during a trip to his native Ireland, saying it had become clear the controversy was a distraction from his work. The forced exit of a heavyweight from the bloc’s executive will be a credibility blow for the team led by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen for less than a year. The Commission will play a key role in pushing across the line a €750bn recovery fund for EU economies hammered by the coronavirus crisis, and Hogan himself had been making headway in fraught trade talks with the United States. Hogan said in a statement: It was becoming increasingly clear that the controversy concerning my recent visit to Ireland was becoming a distraction from my work as an EU Commissioner and would undermine my work in the key months ahead. I deeply regret that my trip to Ireland - the country that I have been so proud to represent as a public servant for most of my adult life - caused such concern, unease and upset. Hogan attended a golf dinner last week that outraged the Irish public and led to the resignation of an Irish minister and the disciplining of several lawmakers. He had insisted on Tuesday that he adhered to all rules during the trip. Canada’s National Research Council (NRC) has ended its partnership for a coronavirus vaccine with CanSino Biologics, saying the Chinese company lacks the authority to ship the vaccine at this time. CanSino in May had agreed to bring its vaccine candidate to Canada for testing through a partnership with the (NRC). Because of the delay, NRC “has since moved on to focus our team and facilities on other partners,” the organisation said in a statement to Reuters. “The process is not clear to the NRC, but CanSino does not have the authority to ship the vaccine at this time,” said NRC in its statement. Earlier, CanSino cited bureaucratic indecision as the reason behind the failure for its vaccine partnership in Canada, the Globe and Mail reported, quoting the company’s chief executive officer. Decisions in China on whether to send the vaccine to Canada were “caught in the bureaucracy”, and some divisions of the Chinese government were not clear if the vaccine should “go to global trials or how to handle it”, chairman and CEO of CanSino Biologics, Dr Xuefeng Yu, told the Globe and Mail in an interview. NRC said its agreement with CanSino had been reviewed by the company’s Chinese government collaborators. After the agreement was signed, the Chinese government changed the process required to ship vaccines to other countries. CanSino’s vaccine candidate is one of the few being tested in a late-stage study, as companies race to develop a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19. It is based on a modified version of a common cold virus called adenovirus type 5 that was first developed by a Canadian researcher, Frank Graham. CanSino’s Yu is a former Sanofi Canada executive. The company had previously worked with NRC on an Ebola vaccine based on the same technology, and with other Canadian researchers on an experimental tuberculosis vaccine. Quebec-based Medicago is the only Canadian company with an experimental vaccine in human trials, with several other projects in earlier stages of development. The federal government recently announced deals to buy vaccine doses from Moderna and Pfizer. A hurried evacuation of a half million Texas and Louisiana residents ahead of Hurricane Laura has clogged highways, while Covid-19 precautions slowed public transportation for evacuees who needed it and complicated temporary housing arrangements. The storm strengthened and is forecast to bring 145 mile (233km) per hour winds to the Texas/Louisiana border near midnight on Wednesday. Warnings for an “unsurvivable storm surge” and “catastrophic damage” led officials in each state to call for residents to flee inland. Local officials advised residents with personal vehicles to take them. For those boarding buses out of the area temperature checks were required. Evacuees were being assigned to far-flung hotels to avoid large groups at shelters. In Galveston County, Texas, which ordered a mandatory evacuation of low-lying areas on Tuesday, buses brought residents inland, but capped the number on each at 15 to 20 people because of the pandemic, said county official Zach Davidson. Officials also arranged for ambulances for those diagnosed with Covid-19. “We have stressed to people, when you’re building your hurricane kit, put in a mask, hand sanitiser, gloves,” he said. Texas state officials were directing those fleeing the storm to hotels in Dallas and elsewhere after an Austin intake centre was overwhelmed with requests for housing overnight. Evacuee Veronica Carresco was carting a full complement of antiseptics on the way to Midland, Texas. “We’re just being cautious. Masks, Lysol, hand sanitiser - we’re doing all of it,” she said. Large-scale evacuations could increase Covid-19 cases in evacuees’ origin and destination counties, according to a study by Columbia University and the Union of Concerned Scientists. It advised evacuees to be assigned to areas with low virus activity and encouraged them to follow social distancing guidelines and to wear masks and protective gear. Texas and Louisiana were both hot spots for the pandemic earlier this year, but new case trends have since declined. Peru has begun registering volunteers for clinical trials of a Chinese vaccine against the coronavirus. Six thousand volunteers, who must be aged between 18 and 75 and not have contracted the virus, will be recruited by Cayetano Heredia and San Marcos universities via a dedicated website. “The universities will select 3,000 volunteers each,” San Marcos rector Orestes Cachay told reporters. The vaccine, being developed by Chinese company Sinopharm, will be administered by injection. According to Peruvian researchers in charge of the clinical trials, two strains of the virus - the Wuhan strain and Beijing strain - and a placebo will be randomly given to volunteers. “A technical team from China will arrive in the coming days, totalling 38 people, to implement the operational part of the project,” Cachay told TV channel N. The trial is expected to last until December President Martin Vizcarra announced last week the country would participate in clinical trials of vaccines being developed in China, Britain, the United States and Germany. Peru, with a population of 33 million, has the third-highest number of deaths from the pandemic in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico. Per capita, it has the region’s highest death rate, with 843.5 deaths per million inhabitants. More than 28,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the country, which has registered more than 600,000 infections so far. Moderna said its experimental Covid-19 vaccine induced immune responses in older adults similar to those in younger participants, offering hope it will be effective in people considered to be at high risk for severe complications from the virus. The company is one of the leading contenders in the race to develop a vaccine against the virus that has killed more than 820,000 people worldwide. Its candidate, mRNA-1273, is already in late-stage human trials testing its ability to safely prevent infection. Moderna said the immune responses in those aged between ages 56 and 70, above age 70 and those 18 to 55-years-old were similar. Health officials have been concerned about whether vaccine candidates would work in older people, whose immune systems typically do not respond as strongly to vaccines. The company has so far enrolled over 13,000 participants in its late-stage study. About 18% of the total participants are Black, Latino, Native American or Alaska Native, groups that have been particularly hard hit by the pandemic, and are often under represented in clinical trials. Dr Jacqueline Miller, Moderna’s head of infectious disease development, said the company plans to post weekly updates on enrolment of Black and Latino trial subjects on its website. Pfizer told Reuters last week that 19% of the 11,000 subjects already enrolled in its vaccine trial are Black or Latino. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention narrowed its guidance for who should get tested for Covid-19 this week, saying those who were exposed but are not symptomatic may not need to be tested. That is a reversal from its previous recommendation, which said testing is recommended for all close contact of people diagnosed with Covid-19. US government health officials said the guidelines should not be interpreted as “inhibiting public health.” They said the new guidelines were a collaboration between the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the two other agencies. The Trump administration has been criticised for its handling of testing for Covid-19, with many states falling short of the volume of tests needed to contain the virus. It has also been criticised for wielding too heavy a hand with the CDC on previous guidelines such as for schools reopening. New York governor Andrew Cuomo said the move looked political. “This is not science. It’s politics,” he tweeted. The French health ministry has registered 5,429 new coronavirus infections over the past 24 hours, a new post-lockdown high and a level of new infections not seen since the height of the epidemic in early April. The daily figure has topped 4,000 several times in recent days, ahead of the 1 September return to school for millions of pupils. The French public must act in “a spirit of responsibility” to limit the surge in new cases, prime minister Jean Castex said on France Inter radio Wednesday morning. “The state has its share of responsiblity... but everyone has to feel like it’s their job to fight the pandemic,” Castex added The total number of people infected with the virus in France now stands at 253,587. On Monday, German health authorities labelled the Île-de-France region including capital Paris and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur region around Mediterranean port city Marseille “risk zones” for the virus. Anyone travelling to Germany from the two regions must submit to a Covid-19 test and quarantine themselves while awaiting the result. The health ministry said figures for the cumulative death toll and for Covid-19 hospitalisations for Wednesday were not available yet due to a technical glitch. On Tuesday, the ministry reported the cumulative number of deaths had risen by 16 to 30,544 and it said 4,600 people were in hospital with Covid-19, including 410 in intensive care. Hi everyone, this is Jessica Murray, I’ll be running the coronavirus live blog for the next few hours. Please do get in touch if you have any story tips or personal experiences you would like to share. Email: jessica.murray@theguardian.com Twitter: @journojess_ Qatar has decided to reopen all mosques across the country for daily and Friday prayers from 1 September a statement by the supreme committee for crisis management announced on Wednesday. The statement said this would be part of the fourth and final phase of a plan that started on 15 June, aimed at gradually lifting coronavirus restrictions. Italy recorded its highest daily tally in coronavirus infections since May when the country was still in lockdown. A further 1,367 cases brought the total to 262,540. Despite the surge in infections, the government insists there are no plans for a new lockdown. Croatia reported its highest number of daily cases amid the summer tourism season. New cases have risen since Croatia opened its borders to tourists for the summer, hitting more than 200 daily in late August and a record 358 on Wednesday. The government said it still hopes to tackle the crisis without curfews if people would “obey the rules and act responsibly”. Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19. Early-stage clinical trials on the vaccine, developed by the Vector virology institute in Siberia, would be completed by the end of September. Western experts have been sceptical about Russia’s approval of Sputnik V, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. Germany will stop mandatory tests for travellers from high-risk areas and require them to quarantine for at least five days instead as it focuses its testing strategy on people with symptoms or possible exposure to patients with Covid-19. The change in strategy is partly down to Germany’s labs reaching the limits of their capacities. The World Economic Forum has postponed its upcoming annual meeting in Davos until summer next year. Organisers said experts advised it would not be safe for the forum to go ahead as planned in January amid the pandemic. Belgium revised down its Covid-19 death toll, just as it was about to pass the milestone of 10,000 fatalities. Health authorities reviewed figures from care homes in Flanders and found some Covid-19 deaths not reported as such, some recorded twice and some not caused by coronavirus. The net effect is a reduction of 121, bringing the tally to 9,878. The French prime minister said life must return to some kind of normality whilst avoiding another nationwide lockdown. Jean Castex said his government wanted to ensure the French could return to school, get back to work and enjoy a social life “as normally as possible”. He added face masks would remain central to the government’s strategy after a surge in the rate of coronavirus infections in recent weeks. Kenya extended a nationwide curfew for 30 days as coronavirus cases rose in areas outside the capital. The president Uhuru Kenyatta also ordered bars and nightclubs shut for another 30 days, but increased the number of people allowed to attend weddings, funerals and other events. Ukraine has imposed a temporary ban on most foreigners from entering the country until 28 September. Lockdown measures have also been extended until the end of October to contain a recent surge in coronavirus cases. Lebanon could ‘lose control’ of its coronavirus outbreak, the caretaker prime minister warned. Hassan Diab said that if cases continued to rise greatly, as they have in the wake of the Beirut explosion, “we will lose control of this epidemic”. Myanmar ordered all schools to close after reporting a record daily rise in new coronavirus infections. The authorities are trying to tackle a resurgence of the virus - with 70 new cases recorded on Wednesday - following weeks without confirmed domestic transmission. Iran’s death toll exceeded 21,000 as cases continue to rise. Another 119 infections took the tally to 21,020, prompting the government to urge people to “avoid unnecessary trips”. A 61-year-old man died in Gaza after contracting the virus, as Palestinian authorities clamped down on an outbreak in the enclave. It was the first death among the general population since an infected woman died at a quarantine centre in March. That’s it from me, Lucy Campbell, ‘til tomorrow. Thank you so much, as ever, to everybody who got in touch throughout the day and sent through tips - your contributions are greatly appreciated! Norway has said it will impose a 10-day quarantine on all people arriving from Germany and Liechtenstein from 29 August due to rising numbers of Covid-19 cases in those countries. Similar restrictions will also be imposed on those coming from two additional regions in Sweden, the Norwegian foreign ministry said in a statement. To try to prevent a domestic resurgence of the coronavirus, Norway quarantines all travellers from countries with more than 20 confirmed new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population during the past two weeks. It also advices against travel to those nations. With its latest additions, Norway will be restricting travel from most European countries, including France, Britain, Spain, Poland and Switzerland. It still allows quarantine-free travel from EU countries Italy, Slovenia, Hungary, Slovakia, Finland and the Baltic states as well as some parts of Denmark and Sweden. Portugal’s government has reported a public deficit of 8.3 billion euros between January and July this year, over 17 times higher compared to the same period last year, due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Total revenues fell 10.5% and tax revenues dropped 14.6% as a consequence of a “contraction of the economic activity”, the finance ministry said in a statement, adding expenditures grew 6.9% due to, among other things, subsidies for the unemployment and ill people. The ministry said: Budget execution highlights the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic on the economy and public services following the adoption of mitigation policy measures. The outbreak is set to leave long-lasting scars on Portugal’s tourism-dependent economy, with the central bank expecting it to contract 9.5% this year. Last year, the country reported 2.2% growth and a budget surplus of 0.2% of gross domestic product. Germany has issued a travel warnings for Andorra and Gibraltar due to rising coronavirus infections, the foreign ministry in Berlin said on Wednesday. The foreign ministry said it was also warning against unnecessary tourist trips to Saint Martin and Guadeloupe as well as Aruba and Saint Maarten. Spain reported another 3,594 coronavirus cases on Wednesday as it struggled to contain a second wave of contagion that hit a peak of some 8,000 cases last Friday. The country has registered the largest number of cases in western Europe since the pandemic began six months ago and the biggest resurgence after lifting one of the continent’s strictest lockdowns against the spread of Covid-19. The latest daily increase was below the roughly 4,000 cases recorded a day earlier, according to updated health ministry data, and brought the cumulative total to 419,849. Seven more deaths were recorded, pushing the overall toll to 28,971. Daily numbers can still be retroactively updated. Accounting for 1,513 cases, the Madrid capital region was by far the hardest hit. Separate data from regional authorities showed several municipalities with more than 700 cases per 100,000 people - more than seven times the national average for the past week. While officials have advised residents in some areas to stay at home, the Madrid region’s deputy leader said there were no plans to request a localised state of emergency under new powers granted by the central government. Ignacio Aguado told a news conference: Generally speaking I’m not in favour of more lockdowns, of repeating the steps from March and April...That ended in economic ruin. He also hit out at the central government’s lack of a strategy to safely reopen schools, accusing the education ministry of leaving local authorities to fend for themselves. In the absence of national guidelines, Spain’s 17 regions have been left to develop their own plans, frustrating parents and teachers and prompting students to call for three days of strikes in September. Student union leader Coral Latorre told state broadcaster TVE: We’re here to demand that the ministry of education does something, because we’re pulling our hair out here to see they’ve done absolutely nothing over the past five months. Italy reported 1,367 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, its highest daily tally since May when the country was still in lockdown, bringing the total number to 262,540. Authorities have also registered the highest number of tests: 93,529, almost 20,000 more than Tuesday and a record since the beginning of the pandemic. Thirteen more people have died with the virus in the last 24 hours, and the death toll now stands at 35,458. Despite the surge in infections, the government insists there are no plans for a new lockdown. Health authorities are particularly concerned about a cluster that emerged in the Sardinian ‘Billionaire’ nightclub, owned by former Formula 1 team boss and Italian businessman, Flavio Briatore, who has been hospitalised in Milan after contracting coronavirus. More than 60 people tested positive for Covid-19 at Billionaire’s, as authorities are struggling to find and test thousands of customers who have been at the Briatore’s nightclub in the last weeks. The Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau has said his government will provide as much as C$2 billion to help students safely return to schools as the country prepares for a return to classes amid the coronavirus pandemic. “Our children must be safe in the classroom. That’s non-negotiable ,” he told reporters Wednesday. Announcing the funding at a school gymnasium in north Toronto, Trudeau emphasised the importance of a safe reopening and said the funding could be used for distance learning and disinfectants. Parents and staff are anxious about what the school year may hold. As a dad—and a former teacher— I get that. We all want what’s best for our kids, including a good education. School matters. The billions in funding is a rare step by the federal government into education, a provincial jurisdiction, underscoring the unprecedented nature of school reopening. The announcement also comes weeks, if not days, before schools across the country welcome back students, raising questions about the timing of the federal government’s plans. Trudeau has faced accusations from political rivals in recent days that he is looking to buy political points ahead of parliament’s return and a possible election. While Canada has seen a relatively low growth rate in new coronavirus cases throughout the summer, experts fear a rushed or ill-planned return to school could reverse the success in reining in the virus. As school boards across the country scramble to finalise their return strategies, many have been forced to amend their plans in response to fears from parents and educators. A number of boards across the country have announced they will delay the start of school, stagger the return of students and make masks mandatory for all grade levels. The UK’s second-busiest airport, Gatwick, announced 600 job cuts because of the collapse in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airport, south of London, said the losses, which represent nearly a quarter of its workforce, come as August passenger numbers plunged 80% compared with last year. Chief executive Stewart Wingate said: If anyone is any doubt about the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry, then today’s news ... is a stark reminder. We are in ongoing talks with [UK] government to see what sector-specific support can be put in place for the industry at this time. The slump amid the global pandemic has forced Gatwick to operate from just one of its two terminals, and the airport is operating at 20% of capacity. More than 75% of staff are on furlough. Wingate promised management would try to safeguard as many jobs as possible and said restructuring would lead to a “fitter and stronger organisation”. In late July, Heathrow - the country’s busiest airport - announced a pre-tax loss of £1.1 billion in the first six months of 2020. Revenues halved year-on-year while passenger numbers fell 96% in the second quarter, as air travel came to a virtual standstill due to lockdowns around the world. The airport, which directly employs 7,000 staff, began voluntary redundancies and reduced its management by a third. It also cut operating costs by at least £300 million and cancelled or paused over £650 million in projects. Romanian theatres and cinemas could reopen from 1 September with social distancing restrictions and protective masks, while the return of indoor restaurants depends on the number of new coronavirus cases in each region, the president said on Wednesday. Romania has been reporting just over 1,000 new cases per day since late July, bringing confirmed cases to 81,646 since the pandemic reached the country in late February. Some 3,421 people have died, and Romania has extended a state of alert until the middle of September. Indoor restaurants, cinemas and theatres have been closed since March. “There are two sectors where I feel it is important that activity resumes, as much as possible under safe conditions,” the president Klaus Iohannis told reporters. After 1 Sepember, indoor restaurants could open taking into account the epidemiological conditions in each town. Iohannis added the government would decide the conditions on Thursday. Romanian schools will reopen on 14 September on a case-by-case basis, with towns affected by the pandemic likely to hold classes online. The European Union state will hold a local election on 27 September, with a parliamentary election likely in December. Croatia has recorded its highest number of daily coronavirus infections as a tricky summer tourism season brings a resurgence of Covid-19 to the Adriatic country. The nation of 4.2 million braved the first few months of the pandemic without strict lockdown measures, recording fewer than 100 cases daily for several months and then almost no new infections by mid-May. But new cases have risen since Croatia opened its borders to tourists for the summer season, hitting more than 200 daily in late August and a record 358 on Wednesday. In recent days, countries such as the UK and Germany have imposed quarantines and other measures for travellers returning from parts of Croatia, while Italy blamed a new cluster of the virus on tourists coming back from the Balkan country. The government said on Wednesday it still hopes to tackle the crisis without curfews. “The only option not to impose complete lockdown is to obey the rules and act responsibly,” said Davor Bozinovic, head of the national Covid-19 response team. Around a third of the new cases were detected along Croatia’s southern coast, where the crystal clear waters of the Adriatic and idyllic islands are a huge tourist draw. The government admits it has taken risks in an effort to save tourism, which accounts for a fifth of the economy. “It was, let’s be completely frank, a clear political goal of the Croatian government for the tourism season to be as good at it can be in these circumstances,” prime minister Andrej Plenković said last week. In July, tourist arrivals were slightly under half of last year’s figure, a rate officials hailed as “excellent” under the circumstances. In total, the authorities have reported 8,800 infections and 174 deaths from the respiratory disease since February. Russia is preparing to approve a second vaccine against Covid-19 in late September or early October, the Russian deputy prime minister, Tatiana Golikova, said on Wednesday. Speaking at a televised government meeting, Golikova told the president, Vladimir Putin, that early-stage clinical trials on the vaccine, developed by the Vector virology institute in Siberia, would be completed by the end of September. “As of today there have been no complications among those vaccinated in the first and second stages of testing,” she said. Earlier this month, Russia became the first country to grant regulatory approval to a Covid-19 vaccine after less than two months of human testing. The vaccine, called “Sputnik V” in homage to the world’s first satellite launched by the Soviet Union, has been hailed as safe and effective by Russian authorities. But western experts have been sceptical about Russia’s approval of Sputnik V, warning against its use until all internationally approved testing and regulatory steps have been taken. RDIF, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, said on Wednesday the final phase of clinical trials on Sputnik V were beginning. It said 40,000 people would take part in the final trials and that similar trials would also be carried out in five other countries. Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, said residents of the Russian capital could apply to take part in the trials. These final trials, carried out on a large number of people, are normally considered essential precursors for a vaccine to receive regulatory approval. That’s all from me, Caroline Davies. Handing back to my colleague Lucy Campbell now. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, appears to have employed the services of a celebrity personal trainer after admitting he needed to lose weight after contracting Covid-19. Harry Jameson, who describes himself as an “elite performance coach”, was snapped running alongside Johnson in central London by a photographer from London’s Evening Standard newspaper today. A UK government source told the Evening Standard: “Yes, he has engaged a personal trainer. I can confirm it is Harry Jameson. It’s because he is really serious about getting fit, as anyone who has seen him over the past couple of months knows. Boris is raring to go.” Johnson spoke publicly last month about his wish to get into better shape, and admitted that being overweight probably played a factor in the severity of his illness. He was admitted to intensive care at St Thomas’ hospital in London in April and received oxygen as he fought the virus. Germany will stop mandatory tests for travellers from high-risk areas and require them to quarantine for at least five days instead as it focuses its testing strategy on people with symptoms or possible exposure to Covid-19 patients, the country’s health minister said today. Jens Spahn said that over the summer vacation period the number of virus tests performed in Germany nearly doubled to 900,000 a week, in part to identify people who caught the virus during trips abroad, the Associated Press agency reports. People coming home from coronavirus risk areas were offered free tests at airports, train stations and highway stops, allowing them to cut short the required two-week quarantine if their result came back negative. But now, travellers returning from high-risk areas, which include most countries outside the European Union and some regions inside the bloc, will be required to go into mandatory quarantines for at least five days before taking a test, which may no longer be free unless ordered by a doctor. The change in the country’s testing strategy is also due to Germany’s labs reaching the limits of their capacities, Spahn said. With the end of the vacation period … this risk is going down again, Spahn told reporters in Berlin. We have to focus more on patients with symptoms and those who had contact with Covid patients. Spahn did not say when the testing strategy would change, but it is likely the decision will be made at a meeting on Thursday between chancellor Angela Merkel and the country’s 16 state governors. Hi. Caroline Davies here, taking over the blog for a short while. You can get in touch on caroline.davies@theguardian.com The World Economic Forum has decided to postpone its upcoming annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, out of caution amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The meeting, originally scheduled for January 2021, will be rescheduled to “early next summer”, according to organisers. Adrian Monck, managing director of public engagement at the Forum, said in a press release: The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the ‘Great Reset’ in the post-Covid-19 era is so urgent. However, the advice from experts is what we cannot do so safely in January. Belgium has revised down its Covid-19 death toll, just as it was about to pass the milestone of 10,000 fatalities. Health authorities reviewed figures from care homes in the northern region of Flanders and found some Covid-19 deaths not reported as such, some recorded twice and some not caused by coronavirus. The net effect is a reduction of 121. The revision brought the total fatalities to 9,878 by Wednesday. Otherwise, it would have been 9,999. The UK government lowered England’s death toll by more than 5,000 two weeks ago after the government adopted a new method of counting fatalities. Belgium’s Covid-19 deaths per capita are among the highest in the world and it reports a higher proportion of fatalities in care homes than other countries, including when the disease is suspected but not confirmed. The Belgian Covid-19 taskforce spokesman and virologist Steven Van Gucht told Reuters TV the country had been hit hard. “But if you compare Belgium with, for example, the United Kingdom or Spain you see they were actually hit even worse,” he said, adding this was reflected in “excess” mortality rates. The number of new cases in Belgium has risen steadily from a low of about 80 per day in early July to an average of 490 for the week of 16-22 August, although numbers had been falling for 10 days. Van Gucht said about a fifth of new infections appeared to have been caught on summer holidays. A new challenge would come from reopening schools and a public tiring of measures among the strictest in Europe. This is a matter of prevention … This is really to avoid a problem that will only come in a few weeks or a few months. France will not let its guard down against a still-virulent coronavirus but life must return to some kind of normality, the prime minister said on Wednesday, as a senior adviser to the government warned of a second wave in November. Jean Castex, the prime minister, said his government wanted to ensure the French could return to school, get back to work and enjoy a social life “as normally as possible”. Face masks would remain central to the government’s strategy after a surge in the rate of coronavirus infections in recent weeks, he said. Castex told France Inter radio: The worst thing of all would be that we sink because we did not get things moving amid a social and economic crisis. France has the seventh-highest Covid-19 death toll in the world, with 30,544 fatalities. It reported 3,304 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday, below last week’s daily highs but much higher than after the president, Emmanuel Macron, initially eased a nationwide lockdown. Pupils in France aged 11 and over must wear masks when they return to school on 1 September and masks will be provided for free to those with health risks or from impoverished families. The country has also made it mandatory to wear a mask in workplaces from next week to counter the rise in infections as employees return from their summer holidays. Countries across Europe are grappling with how reboot their economies and get the daily lives of citizens as close to normal as possible without accelerating the spread of the virus. Underlining the delicate balancing act, the head of the scientific council advising France’s government said a second wave of the coronavirus could hit in November. “We may have to toughen measures again,” said Castex, who said local lockdowns would be imposed if needed. The government’s delayed €100bn ($118.07bn) recovery plan will be unveiled on 3 September, he added. Kenya’s president has extended a nationwide curfew for 30 days, saying coronavirus cases were rising in areas outside the capital. In a televised address, Uhuru Kenyatta also ordered bars and nightclubs shut for another 30 days - but increased the number of people allowed to attend weddings, funerals and other events. He said infections were slowing in Nairobi and the port and tourism hub of Mombasa. He said: This crisis has however began to percolate to the counties. The new frontier of this invisible enemy is increasingly shifting to the counties and to our rural areas. At present Kenya has 33,016 cases of coronavirus, 564 deaths and 19,296 recoveries. It will be mandatory for pupils to wear face masks in communal areas of secondary schools in England in places with local lockdowns, the UK education minister Gavin Williamson said on Wednesday in a government U-turn on enforcing their use. After failing to persuade schools to bring back all students before the summer, the prime minister Boris Johnson is keen to make sure the reopening now happens as he urges people to get back to some kind of normality after the coronavirus lockdown. Ministers had ruled out the need for pupils to wear masks in corridors despite updated advice from the World Health Organization at the weekend, but Wednesday’s move shifted that stance. Williamson told Sky News: There are some areas of the country where we have had to do local lockdowns and we think it is right in those few areas that in secondary schools, in communal areas, that youngsters do wear face coverings. On a school visit, Johnson later told students: The risk to your health is not from Covid ... the greatest risk you face now is of continuing to be out of school. That is why in the next week, in the succeeding days, we must have every pupil back in school in the way that you’ve come back to school. Headteachers in other areas will also have the discretion to recommend using masks in their schools for students aged between 11 and 18. It is the latest U-turn by Johnson’s government which has come under fire for its handling of the pandemic and after a debacle this month when an algorithm-based system saw swathes of pupils awarded lower-than-expected exam grades. The change on stance on masks also marks the latest occasion when Johnson has followed the devolved Scottish government in revising pandemic rules, after changes to the grading of exams and enforcing face coverings in shops. Huw Merriman, chairman of parliament’s transport select committee and a member of Johnson’s party, said it felt like the government was making it up as it went along. He told BBC Radio: It’s time we stopped hiding behind the science, which keeps changing, and we focus on the fact that we are in charge. Williamson, who apologised after the exam grade problems, said the shift on masks had come following the change in WHO advice. You can follow more updates on the situation in the UK over on our UK coronavirus live blog: Ukraine has imposed a temporary ban on most foreigners from entering the country until 28 September and extended lockdown measures until the end of October to contain a recent surge in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. Speaking at a televised cabinet meeting, the prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, also said the government would need to take a decision on Thursday on whether to ban major public events in September. The city of Berlin has banned demonstrations planned for this weekend to oppose measures imposed to stem the coronavirus pandemic, after organisers of a rally earlier this month failed to ensure marchers wore masks and kept their distance. Andreas Geisel, the Berlin interior senator, said the authorities had to strike a balance between the right to freedom of assembly and the need to protect people against infection. He said: We are still in the middle of a pandemic with rising infection figures. Germany has managed to keep the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths relatively low compared with some other large European countries, but the number of new daily cases has been rising steadily since early July and has accelerated in recent weeks. About 20,000 people, included libertarians, constitutional loyalists, far-right supporters and anti-vaccination activists, marched in the capital on 1 August. Geisel said the organisers of that protest had deliberately broken the rules they had previously accepted in talks with police, including the wearing of masks and maintaining social distancing. “Such behaviour is not acceptable. The state cannot be given the runaround,” he said, adding he did not want Berlin to be a stage for conspiracy theorists and rightwing extremists. If crowds still gather despite the ban, the police will intervene, he said. Lebanon’s caretaker prime minister, Hassan Diab, said the country was at risk of losing its control over its coronavirus outbreak after a surge in the number of cases in the wake of the massive explosion in Beirut on 4 August. “The number of cases is increasing greatly, and if this continues, we will lose control of this epidemic,” Diab was cited as saying in a statement issued by the supreme defence council. Lebanon registered 525 new Covid-19 infections and 12 deaths on Tuesday. The country experienced a rise in infections following the catastrophic explosion in the capital city at the start of the month. Cases doubled in the two weeks following the blast, as infections spread in hospitals where victims were being treated, medics say. The government imposed a partial lockdown last Friday to help combat community spread. But the shutdown, which includes a curfew from 6pm to 6am, still allows for clearing rubble, making repairs and giving out aid in neighbourhoods damaged by the explosion. The airport will remain open, with travellers having to take PCR tests before boarding and on arriving in the country. The health minister for Lebanon’s caretaker government, Hamad Hassan, who also spoke to the council, said the tally of cases was concerning. Hassan added that hospital capacity needed to be increased to help combat the rise in cases, the official said. Myanmar ordered all schools to close after reporting 70 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday, its biggest daily rise, as authorities try to tackle a resurgence of the virus following weeks without confirmed domestic transmission. All but one of the new cases announced on Wednesday were in the western state of Rakhine, found in nine different locations, each linked to an outbreak in the state capital, Sittwe, where a lockdown and curfew were imposed last week. Myanmar’s outbreaks has been relatively small compared with other countries in the region, with six deaths and 574 infections in total, but an increase in Covid-19 cases by nearly 35% in just over a week is causing some concern. “We have called all the schools and instructed them to close from tomorrow,” Ko Layy Win, director general of the country’s department of basic education, told Reuters. The central committee of Covid decided to do that since the local transmission in the country is high. One of Wednesday’s cases was in the biggest city Yangon, in an individual seeking medical clearance to travel. The virus resurfaced in Myanmar on 16 August after a month without community transmission, with the majority of those cases in Sittwe. Sittwe is also home to crowded camps where about 100,000 Rohingya Muslims have been confined since violence erupted in 2012. Rohingya mostly face strict curbs on freedom of movement and access to healthcare. Myanmar has restricted internet access in much of the region on security grounds. Humanitarian workers have urged the authorities to restore it at higher speeds to ensure reliable health information is available. Among the 179 domestic infections since early last week, authorities have detected a mutation thought to be more contagious than previously seen in Myanmar. To keep Covid-19 at bay, Myanmar has since late March closed its borders to all but returning citizens, who are required to undergo quarantine. Sweden has withdrawn its advice against unnecessary travel to the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Romania. Sweden earlier withdrew advice against unnecessary trips to Andorra, Belgium, Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Croatia, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Norway, Poland, Portugal, San Marino, Switzerland, Spain, the Czech Republic, Germany, Hungary, the Vatican and Austria. The foreign ministry in a statement on its website extended its advice against travel to other EU and Schengen countries and Britain until 9 September, and to the rest of the world until 15 November. Rising numbers of confirmed cases in some countries are fuelling fears of a resurgence in the spread of Covid-19. Germany’s foreign ministry is extending its travel warning for countries outside Europe until 14 September due to continued concern about the coronavirus, a government source told Reuters on Wednesday. The warning had been due to expire at the end of August. Germany also wants to intensify its monitoring of returning travellers to make sure they are abiding by quarantine rules, health minister Jens Spahn said on Wednesday, after data showed more than 40% of new infections were contracted overseas. Spahn said: At a time when the number of new infections in Germany is low it is important to prevent that the virus is spread in the country through returning travellers. Iran’s death toll from coronavirus rose by 119 to 21,020, the health ministry’s spokeswoman told state TV on Wednesday, with the total number of identified cases rising to 365,606. Sima Sadat Lari said that 2,243 new cases were identified in the past 24 hours in Iran, rising from 2,213 a day earlier. Lari said: Unfortunately we have been facing a surge in coronavirus infections in recent weeks. I urge everyone to avoid unnecessary trips. Iran’s top health officials have appealed to Iranians to avoid travelling during the Shia Muslim religious holiday of Ashura later this week to avoid the risk of a fresh surge of infections. Ashura is the 10th day of the lunar month of Muharram when, according to Islamic tradition, Imam Hussein, grandson of the prophet Mohammed, was killed in battle in 680. But despite warnings by the authorities against travelling, state media reported heavy traffic on roads leading to the Caspian coast in northern Iran, a favourite destination during holidays. A 61-year-old man has died in the Gaza Strip after contracting the coronavirus, Palestinian authorities said on Wednesday as they clamped down on an outbreak in the enclave. The man had suffered previous illnesses and had been on a respirator, the health ministry said. It was the first death among the general population since an infected woman died at a quarantine centre in March. Health officials said nine more cases were discovered on Wednesday. Six of them were in the isolated Maghazi refugee camp where a first four cases had been confirmed on Monday, prompting Gaza’s Hamas authorities to impose a full lockdown. The three other cases were in northern Gaza Strip, indicating the virus has begun to spread into different areas of the enclave of 2 million people. The outbreak outside Maghazi remains slow but it cemented concerns by local and international health organisations over the territory’s potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital capacity. With local authorities maintaining a lockdown in all cities, people were instructed to stay home at all times and to wear face masks if, in cases of extreme necessity, they had to go out. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which helps over half of Gaza’s population, said it was looking into alternative plans to continue health, education and food services to beneficiaries should the lockdown be extended. Adnan Abu Hasna, UNRWA spokesman in Gaza, said clinics remained open but physical presence was prohibited, instead staffers were providing medical consultation over the phone and some medication was delivered to patients at home. Abus Hasna said: We are in constant consultation with the health ministry and we are also in discussion over the implementation of our own alternative plans in order to ensure the continuation of delivering services to refugees. Monday’s cases were uncovered after a woman traveled to the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where she tested positive, the Gaza health ministry said. A ministry spokesman urged everyone who might have visited a supermarket outside a hospital in central Gaza to quarantine themselves and report to medics immediately. Good morning from London.

Iran’s death toll from Covid-19 rose by 119 to 21,020, the health ministry’s spokeswoman told state TV on Wednesday. That takes the total number of identified Iranian cases to 365,606. Sima Sadat Lari said that 2,243 new cases were identified in the past 24 hours in Iran, rising from 2,213 a day earlier, Reuters reports. Melania Trump has offered her condolences to the loved ones of the more than 178,000 Americans who have now died from the virus and the millions more who have been infected, Lauren Gambino reports. The Philippines has reported 5,277 new Covid infections, the highest daily increase in 12 days, and a further 99 deaths. The country’s health ministry said the total number of confirmed cases had risen to 202,361, more than 60% of which were reported in the past month, while deaths had increased to 3,137. The Philippines has the largest number of Covid-19 cases in south-east Asia. The German government has agreed to pump another €10bn into its Covid-hit economy, prolonging a short-time work scheme and freezing insolvency rules. Short-time work saves jobs by allowing employers to reduce the employees’ hours but keeps them in work. That programme had been due to expire in March 2021 and will now be extended until the end of next year. Bridging aid for small and mid-sized companies will now be extended until the end of this year too. The latest €10bn pledge comes on top of a massive stimulus package, worth more than €130bn, which Angela Merkel’s government hope will help the economy return to growth. The German economy contracted at its steepest rate on record in the second quarter and the government is desperate to mitigate the effects of the pandemic as much as possible, especially in the run-up to elections in the autumn of 2021. Finance minister Olaf Scholz, a Social Democrat, told public broadcaster ZDF the measures could cost up to €10bn next year. “The goal now is to stabilise the economy,” said Scholz. “The fact that we acted fast and big has resulted in Germany weathering the crisis much better than other (countries).” The parties also agreed to prolong measures aimed at staving off bankruptcies by allowing firms in financial trouble due to the pandemic to delay filing for insolvency until the end of the year. The French arts and culture sectors, which have been hit hard by the Covid-19 crisis, will get €2bn (£1.8bn) in aid as part of the government’s economic recovery package, the French prime minister, Jean Castex, said on Wednesday. The government’s €100bn economic recovery programme will be unveiled on 3 September. In July, the UK government pledged £1.57bn to support the arts. The former president of the Maldives, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, has tested positive for Covid-19, as the tourist-dependent island nation reports a pick-up in cases since reopening its borders last month. “I have tested positive for Covid-19. May Almighty Allah bless me and all other sick people with a speedy recovery and good health,” Gayoom said in a tweet on Tuesday night. The 81-year-old former president was one of Asia’s longest serving leaders, having ruled the Maldives for 30 years. Reuters said a source from Gayoom’s family told the news agency that the former autocrat was tested for Covid-19 following a medical consultation on Tuesday morning, after he developed a fever on Monday night. The source said Gayoom is doing well and is expected to be admitted to the newly built Dharumavantha hospital in the capital, Malé. Heavily reliant on foreign tourism, the Indian Ocean archipelago lifted a lockdown in the capital in June and opened up its borders for tourists in July. Since the end of the lockdown in June, the number of Covid-19 cases in the Maldives has tripled, while deaths have risen from five to 28. The Maldives Health Protection Agency has confirmed a total of 7,047 Covid-19 cases in the country, out of which 2,580 cases are active. Just over 5,000 tourists visited the Maldives in the month to 15 August, according to Maldives Immigration, a fraction of last year’s monthly average of more than 100,000. There were 1,576 new Covid infections in Germany over the last 24 hours – up from 1,278 the day before, Der Spiegel reports, citing figures from the Robert Koch Institute. On Saturday, 2,034 cases were reported in Germany, the first time since the end of April that there have been more than 2,000 infections in one day. So far, 9,280 people have died in Germany from coronavirus while about 210,600 people have recovered from it. This is Ben Doherty in Sydney, signing off. My delightful colleague Helen Pidd, in sunny Manchester, will be your guide for the next few hours. Thanks all for your comments and correspondence today. Be well, all of you, and look after each other. Nuns of the Missionaries of Charity, the order founded by Saint Teresa, wear masks and face shields as precaution against the coronavirus as they distribute food to poor and homeless people in Kolkata, India. Wednesday marks the birth anniversary of Nobel laureate Mother Teresa. India’s Covid cases have surpassed 3.2m. This is a fascinating piece from Associated Press. With winter ending in the southern hemisphere – ergo soon to begin in the north - it has emerged that measures to counter Covid-19 have dramatically slowed the spread of influenza. But that success is not guaranteed for countries about to enter their colder months. (PS I can confirm winter is ending in the southern hemisphere. Gloriously sunny out my window in Sydney, but here am I, inside still …) Winter is ending in the southern hemisphere and country after country – South Africa, Australia, Argentina – have had a surprise: their steps against Covid-19 also apparently blocked the flu. But there’s no guarantee the northern hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages. “This could be one of the worst seasons we’ve had from a public health perspective with Covid and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we’ve had,” Dr Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said. US health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this autumn, so hospitals aren’t overwhelmed with a “duelling twindemic”. “It’s also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are not specific for Covid. They’re going to work for any respiratory virus,” Redfield said. The evidence: ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the southern hemisphere’s winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country’s National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none: something unprecedented. School closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have knocked down the flu, said Dr Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute’s respiratory programme. “That not only meant lives saved from flu’s annual toll, but it freed up our hospitals capacity to treat Covid-19 patients,” Cohen added. In Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year. The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing, said Dr Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney. The coronavirus is blamed for about 24m infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world’s hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the Covid-19 crush. Back in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the southern hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations. “We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,” said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb. Some countries’ lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if Covid-19 still was on the rise? “Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against Covid is really high,” said CDC’s Redfield. “This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we’ve seen. That’s in part because 40% of people with Covid-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection,” he said. Flu hasn’t disappeared, a World Health Organization report cautioned earlier this month. While globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year, it found sporadic cases are being reported. Plus, some people who had the flu in southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added. But international influenza experts say keeping schools closed children typically drive flu’s spread and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped. “We don’t have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they’re doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,” said Richard Webby of St Jude Children’s Research hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution. In contrast, the US and Europe didn’t impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their southern neighbours and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as Covid-19 still is being transmitted and the cooler months that favour influenza’s spread are fast approaching. So the US CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield’s goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated, usually only about half are. The US expects more than 190m doses of flu vaccine, about 20m more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds. In an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students from elementary to college this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine. In the UK, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, is likewise urging widespread flu vaccination. The flu vaccine only protects against influenza: it will not lessen the chances of contracting the coronavirus. Vaccines against Covid-19 are still being trialled. But for coronavirus protection, Redfield urges vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands. Countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the northern hemisphere heeds their lessons learned. “It could be very scary we honestly don’t know,” Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert, said. “But if you’re going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble.” India’s rampant Covid-19 outbreak continues to spread across the country. The country recorded more than 60,000 cases the novel coronavirus for the eighth day in a row on Wednesday, as total cases crossed 3.2 million, data from the federal health ministry shows. The world’s second-most populous country is third behind the United States and Brazil in terms of total caseload, and has recorded the world’s highest single-day caseload consistently since earlier this month. Deaths in the last 24 hours stood at 1,059, taking the total number of fatalities from the infection to 59,449. Shares in Asia Pacific retreated from all-time highs on Wednesday as investors took a pause amid some mixed economic data. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan edged down 0.1% after hitting its highest since mid-2018 on Tuesday. Japan’s Nikkei was off 0.1%. In Sydney, the ASX200 was down 0.9% and the Kospi in Seoul was off 0.25%. Shanghai has lost 1.1% and Hong Kong is in the red by 0.15%. Tai Hui, JP Morgan Asset M anagement’s chief market strategist in Asia, identified the lack of refent central bank announcements as a possible reason why markets had stalled, a point that highlights the extent to which intervention has been responsible for the soaring markets. If you look at the macro numbers, a lot of the improvement in Q2 seems to be slowing down in momentum. Central banks and governments are not really announcing anything new, and so markets are in a bit of a sideways move at this point in time. As the world scrambles to create a vaccine for Covid-19, a reminder of what vaccines can do. Quite simply, they can change the world... Global cases have surged passed 23.8m, with more than 818,000 deaths from the virus. Rates of transmission are easing in many parts of the world, the World Health Organisation has suggested. Governments have been ramping up efforts to contain the disease, which has claimed the lives of almost 814,000 people and infected at least 23 million since late last year. WHO data said fatality and infection rates were easing in most regions, notably in the hard-hit Americas, except Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. Residents in the capital of Xinjiang are being forced to take traditional Chinese medicine, being handcuffed to buildings and ordered to stay inside for weeks as part of a harsh range of measures to tackle coronavirus, according to posts online. Urumqi, the capital of the semi-autonomous region known for its draconian security measures, has been in a “wartime state” of lockdown for more than a month after a cluster of cases emerged in July, when the outbreak had been mostly contained elsewhere in China. South Korea has ordered doctors in Seoul to return to work on Wednesday as they began a three-day strike in protest against several government proposals, including one to boost the number of doctors to deal with health crises like the coronavirus. Trainee doctors have been staging ongoing walkouts, and thousands of additional doctors were due to stage a three-day strike starting on Wednesday. South Korea is battling one of its worst outbreaks of the coronavirus, with 320 new cases reported in the 24 hours to midnight Tuesday. UK prime minister Boris Johnson drops advice against face mask use in English schools. Pupils in England will no longer be advised against using face masks in schools after prime minister Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn days before students head back to the classroom. The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling. About 43,000 new cases are being reported daily across the country, down 21% from early August, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Experts credit the development at least partly to increased wearing of masks, even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day. Turkey recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June. Another 1,502 infections were confirmed on Tuesday, according to government data, taking the official tally over 261,000. India reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day. Infections rocketed by another 1.5 million since the start of August, taking India’s total to around 3.1 million, more than in the US and Brazil. The rate of new cases in the country is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry. Gaza entered a 48-hour lockdown after the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the general population. Four cases of coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing over from Egypt and Israel. Health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak. Two European patients were confirmed to have been reinfected with coronavirus, raising concerns about immunity. Regional public broadcasters said a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been reinfected. It follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been reinfected four and a half months after recovering. The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter, the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970. The government has extended by a year, a scheme topping up the pay of workers who have lost hours because of the pandemic. Australia will boost defence spending by AU$1b (US$716.80m) to upgrade military facilities and offer additional paid employment to army reservists, as Canberra seeks to soften the economic blow of Covid-19. In a fresh round of stimulus, prime minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday promised greater spending on defence in a bid to grow the country’s military and support 4,000 jobs. “Today is again about the JobMaker plan, doing everything we can as we grow out of the Covid-19 recession to ensure that we keep Australians in jobs, and we keep businesses in business,” Morrison told reporters in Canberra. While Australia has reported far fewer cases of COVID-19 compared to other developed countries, restrictions imposed to slow the spread of the virus have had a devastating impact on the country’s economy, which will slip into a recession for the first time in three decades. Australia has so far promised to spend about A$260 billion in stimulus to support its ailing economy. The additional defence spending will also assist Australia with its commitment to grow defence spending to more than 2% of GDP, a key demand of US President Donald Trump who has accused allies of not pulling their weight. We mentioned earlier that in Germany, the government has extended for a further year a scheme to top up the pay of workers who have lost hours. New figures are now out on the country’s Covid infections: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,576 to 236,429, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by three to 9,280, the tally showed. Residents in the capital of Xinjiang are being forced to take traditional Chinese medicine, being handcuffed to buildings and ordered to stay inside for weeks as part of a harsh range of measures to tackle coronavirus, according to posts online. Urumqi, the capital of the semi-autonomous region known for its draconian security measures, has been in a “wartime state” of lockdown for more than a month after a cluster of cases emerged in July, when the outbreak had been mostly contained elsewhere in China. Since Friday, internet users have flooded social media platforms with complaints about overly harsh measures and extended quarantine at home or in designated locations, even as cases have gone down. The city, which had documented more than 531 cases by mid-August, has not reported any new cases in eight consecutive days. Australia’s federation has come under unique strain during the global coronavirus pandemic. While, by and large, the eight states and territories have co-operated well to combat the pandemic, border closures between states are now causing significant tensions. Before this year, the last time Australia’s states and territories shut their borders to each other was during the Spanish Flu outbreak of 1919 and 1920. The situation is particularly acute on the border between the country’s two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria. Much of that border is the Murray River, and riverine communities spanning the border have been effectively cut in half, keeping children from schools, employees from their workplaces, and perhaps most critically, doctors and nurses from hospitals. We’ve spoken a great deal today about potential vaccines undergoing trials around the world. The trials at Oxford University are considered, perhaps, the furthest progressed in the world. And there is hope - all is hope at this stage - that there might be something definitive by the end of the year. Health editor Sarah Boseley reports: Trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine may have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year – but it will then need to go through the regulatory process, scientists say. Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it is “just possible” that there may be enough clinical trial data on Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine to put before the regulators this year. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, has said a vaccine may not be ready until next winter. Pollard suggested they were hoping to go faster. “I think that Chris Whitty is quite rightly being cautious, that it could take as long as that to first of all demonstrate a vaccine works and is safe and then to go through the processes of regulators looking at that very carefully to make sure everything’s been done correctly,” Pollard told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. South Korea has ordered doctors in Seoul to return to work on Wednesday as they began a three-day strike in protest of several government proposals, including one to boost the number of doctors to deal with health crises like the coronavirus. Trainee doctors have been staging ongoing walkouts, and thousands of additional doctors were due to stage a three-day strike starting on Wednesday. The strikes come as South Korea battles one of its worst outbreaks of the coronavirus, with 320 new cases reported in the 24 hours to midnight Tuesday, the latest in more than a week and a half of triple-digit increases. The walkouts on Wednesday forced South Korea’s five major general hospitals to limit their hours and delay scheduled surgeries, Yonhap news agency reported. Earlier in the week, the doctors reached an agreement with the government to continue to handle coronavirus patients, but failed to find a compromise on the broader issues. “The government now has no choice but to take necessary legal actions such as an order to open business to not put the citizens’ lives and safety in danger,” health minister Park Neung-hoo said in a briefing. “We urge all trainee and fellow doctors to immediately return to work.” He said the Korean Medical Association (KMA) and the Korean Intern Resident Association (KIRA) had rejected several of the government’s offers. In a statement, KMA said the medical community was always open to all possibilities in talks with the government, and that the doctors did not want to have to strike. “We sincerely do want to return,” the statement said. “We ask you citizens to listen to our voice so that we can meet our patients as soon as possible.” KMA and KIRA members have said they oppose government plans to boost the number of medical students over several years, establish public medical schools, allow government insurance to cover more oriental medicine, and introduce more telemedicine options. The government said its goal to increase the number of medical students by 4,000 over the next 10 years is necessary to better prepare for public health crises like the coronavirus pandemic. Student doctors, however, said the plan would unnecessarily flood an already competitive market, and that the extra funding would be better spent improving the salaries of existing trainees, which would encourage them to move out of Seoul to rural areas where more health professionals are needed. A German scheme that tops up pay for workers who lost work hours because of the coronavirus pandemic has been extended by another year to stave off mass job losses. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition of conservatives and centre-left Social Democrats agreed on Tuesday to allow the programme to run for 24 months for any firm that applies by the end of the year. It also resolved to extend financial assistance to small businesses until the end of the year and relax insolvency laws in an effort to avoid cascading bankruptcies. The shorter-hours programme, known as Kurzarbeit, sees the German government cover around two-thirds of workers’ wages when employers slash their hours to save costs. The scheme was widely used during the 2008-09 financial crisis and credited with saving tens of thousands of jobs. The programme is one of the main tools used by Berlin to shield Europe’s top economy from the pandemic-induced downturn, accounting for a key part of the government’s trillion-euro (US$1.1 trillion) coronavirus support package. At the height of the coronavirus lockdowns in April, some 6.8m Germans received money through the scheme, the federal employment agency said. To ease access to the programme, ministers reduced the requirements that companies need to meet in order to qualify for assistance. German giants like Lufthansa, Volkswagen and BMW are among the many firms to have tapped into the scheme. Before the pandemic, German unemployment hovered at a record-low level of around five percent. It has since risen to 6.4 percent. And after years of balanced budgets, the German government has said it plans to borrow around 218 billion euros this year to help pay for its pandemic response. Other European economies, including France and Britain, introduced similar short-time working programmes to battle the economic consequences of the pandemic. Staying in the neighbourhood.... Eleanor Ainge Roy reports from New Zealand: New Zealand’s director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield says there are five new cases of Covid-19 in New Zealand, and significant spread has now been identified at a Mt Roskill church, which is being treated as a “mini-cluster”. Contact tracing is now underway for anyone who attended weddings or services at the church. The minister of health Chris Hipkins said the government had distributed 3 million masks to low socio-economic areas ahead of them becoming mandatory on public transport at midnight Sunday. Masks would also need to be worn in ubers and taxis. The government is also encouraging people to “make their own masks”. Auckland’s level 3 lockdown ends on Sunday. There are 134 active cases of COVID-19 in New Zealand, all being held in quarantine facilities or hospitals. Update from Australia... Victoria continues to be the largest source of new infections Mexico’s health ministry has reported 4,916 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infection on Tuesday, and 650 additional fatalities. The new figures bring the total in the country to 568,621 confirmed cases and 61,450 deaths. But the government has consistently said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. Victoria, in southern Australia, is the site of that country’s most serious outbreak. The city of Melbourne, Australia’s second-largest, remains under a severe lockdown, including a citywide curfew and a five kilometre limit on any essential travel. A parliamentary inquiry in that state has heard more than 50 inmates and corrections staff have contracted Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic. Attorney-General Jill Hennessy said 23 adult prisoners and six staff have tested positive. Another 19 juvenile inmates, five young people on community supervision orders and four prison staff had also tested positive. All new prisoners are now tested and required to spend 14 days in protective quarantine. Australia has announced it will join the United Kingdom, Canada, Italy and Norway in supporting the Gavi COVAX Facility Advance Market Commitment (COVAX AMC) to help Pacific and southeast Asian countries access safe and affordable Covid-19 vaccines. The COVAX AMC is designed to secure Covid-19 vaccines - when one exists - for all countries, not just those that can afford to purchase or manufacture vaccines themselves. Australia is contributing AU$80m (US$57m) the country’s foreign minister Marise Payne announced. The AMC is designed to address the acute phase of the pandemic, providing doses for up to 20 percent of countries’ populations in its first phase, ensuring that health care workers and vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, have access. Pacific countries eligible for COVAX AMC support include Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga, Tuvalu and Kiribati. Eligible countries from Southeast Asia are Indonesia, Timor-Leste, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, The Philippines and Vietnam. Chair of the Pacific Friends of Global Health Board, Professor Brendan Crabb, said a global vehicle designed to ensure that the poorest don’t miss out on access to a Covid vaccine was vital. Vaccines are not magic force shields for individuals, none of us are safe until everyone’s safe. In that way, vaccinating all those in our region is essential, not just to protect those in need who deserve rich country support but it is also in our own enlightened self interest. It is important also to note that in low-income settings, Covid-19 is likely to cause far more suffering from other diseases than from Covid-19 itself. Health systems just can’t can’t cope. We know that deaths from malaria, TB and HIV have already been increasing due to the diversion of testing and workforce attention to Covid-19 in countries such as PNG. There is currently no vaccine for Covid-19. See posts passim today about developments around the world in human trials. We mentioned earlier the Cambridge University vaccine trials. Oxford, too, is conducting human trials of its potential vaccine. In Australia, the University of Queensland has begun early trials of a potential Covid-19 vaccine on hamsters, yielding “positive indications” about its possible effectiveness in humans. The findings from the pre-clinical trials have been reported to the International Society for Vaccines by project co-leader and UQ Associate Professor Keith Chappell. “The neutralising immune response created by our molecular clamp vaccine in animal models was better than the average level of antibodies found in patients who have recovered from Covid-19,” Chappell said in a statement on Wednesday. In the hamsters trial, the potential vaccine – when combined with MF59 technology developed by Seqirus, a unit of Australian biotechnology group CSL – provided protection against virus replication and reduced lung inflammation following exposure to the virus. “It also induces a strong T-cell response and showed strong results when it came to data relating to manufacturability,” Chappell said. While the World Health Organisation says Covid transmission rates are easing across much of the world, they are continuing to escalate in places like India - 18 straight record days of infections, more than 67,000 new cases in the past 24 hours - and southeast Asia. In the US, nearly 1000 people are still dying every day from the virus. As the world continues to search for an end to this crippling global pandemic, The Guardian’s health editor Sarah Boseley examines six of the most promising candidates for a way out. US stock markets closed higher on Tuesday night on hopes that the first formal contact between the US and China over their trade agreement would lead to an easing of tension between the superpowers. The broad-based S&amp;P500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq both closed a new highs, although Asia Pacific markets are expected to be more mixed with Sydney seen opening down 0.6%. It comes despite more desperate corporate news as American Airlines said it would lay off around 19,000 workers on 1 October if US lawmakers fail to vote through new support for the limping sector. Earlier, Australian airline Qantas had said it would cut almost 2,500 more jobs on top of 6,000 already announced, while Finnair said it would slash 1,000 posts. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has called for prevention efforts against the novel coronavirus and a typhoon, state news agency KCNA said on Tuesday. An enlarged meeting of the politburo of the Workers Party took place amid a pandemic that is putting additional pressure on the North Korean economy, battered by recent border closures and flood damage. The meeting assessed “some defects in the state emergency anti-epidemic work for checking the inroads of the malignant virus”, KCNA said in a statement. North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus, but Kim said last month that the virus “could be said to have entered” the country and imposed a lockdown after a man was reported to have symptoms. Later test results on the man were inconclusive, according to the World Health Organisation. Kim had this month lifted a three-week lockdown in the city of Kaesong after a suspected case of the coronavirus there. The meeting discussed state emergency measures on preventing crop damage and casualties from Typhoon Bavi, which is expected to hit the country within days, KCNA reported. Heavy rain and flooding have raised concern about food supplies in the isolated country. The ruling party had said it will hold a congress next year to decide a new five-year plan, after a party meeting noted serious delays in improving the national economy and living standards. The University of Cambridge is aiming to start clinical trials of its possible coronavirus vaccine in the autumn after it received £1.9m (US$2.5m) in funding from the British government, the university said on Wednesday. The scientists behind the vaccine said their approach, which uses genetic sequences of all known coronaviruses to hone the immune response, could help avoid the adverse effects of a hyper-inflammatory immune response. “We’re looking for chinks in its armour, crucial pieces of the virus that we can use to construct the vaccine to direct the immune response in the right direction,” Jonathan Heeney, head of the Laboratory of Viral Zoonotics at the University of Cambridge, said. “Ultimately we aim to make a vaccine that will not only protect from SARS-CoV-2, but also other related coronaviruses that may spill over from animals to humans.” No vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus which causes COVID-19 has yet been proven clinically effective, though 30 that use a range of technologies are in human trials already. The Cambridge candidate, DIOS-CoVax2, is DNA based. Computer-generated antigen structures are encoded by synthetic genes, which can then re-programme the body’s immune system to produce antibodies against the coronavirus. “This could be a major breakthrough in being able to give a future vaccine to huge numbers of people across the world,” said Saul Faust, Director of the NIHR Southampton Clinical Research Facility. This DNA vector method has been shown to be safe and effective at stimulating an immune response in other pathogens in early stage trials, the university said. Although it is operating at a later timetable than some other vaccine candidates, the DIOS-CoVax2 shot would not need to be stored at cold temperatures and could be delivered without needles, possibly making the widespread distribution of the vaccine easier. Sweden’s Public Health Agency says a faulty test kit had returned some 3,700 false positive results, an error discovered by two laboratories during routine quality controls. On Tuesday, the agency said the PCR kits, which test for an ongoing Covid-19 infection, were made in China by the company BGI Genomics and had been distributed worldwide. In Sweden, the kits were used by people conducting at-home tests between period March and August, the agency said. Mostly, “people who had mild symptoms or who didn’t feel any symptoms at the time of the test received false positive results,” the agency said in a statement. It added that it would contact those affected this week, as well as adjusting Sweden’s official number of cases. “The faulty test kit has been reported to the Swedish Medical Products Agency. It has been exported by China to many other countries,” the agency said, adding that it has “informed relevant authorities in Europe and the WHO”. Sweden on Tuesday said it had 86,891 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 5,814 deaths. The World Health Organisation has suggested the pace of Covid-19 transmission is easing in many parts of the world. Governments have been ramping up efforts to contain the disease, which has claimed the lives of almost 814,000 people and infected at least 23 million since late last year. WHO data said fatality and infection rates were easing in most regions, notably in the hard-hit Americas, except Southeast Asia and the eastern Mediterranean. In Africa, WHO regional director Matshidiso Moeti said new cases were declining after the continent passed “what seems to have been a peak”. But Health Minister Zweli Mkhize of hard-hit South Africa warned that “our biggest worry is whether in fact this is the first surge and there might be another one”, pointing to the latest developments in Spain. One of the worst affected countries in Europe, Spain is to use 2,000 soldiers trained in tracking to help regions identify those who have been exposed to infected people. “We can’t let the pandemic once again take control of our lives... we must take control and halt this second curve,” prime minister Pedro Sanchez said. Although fatality rates have been falling, the WHO said it recorded more than 1.7 million new coronavirus cases and some 39,000 new deaths in the week to August 23. That represented however a five-percent decrease in new cases globally and a 12-percent drop in new deaths compared with the week before. Good morning/afternoon/evening, wherever these words find you. My name’s Ben Doherty, I’m in Sydney, helming The Guardian’s rolling coverage of the global coronavirus pandemic for the next few hours. Correspondence and comments welcome: you can reach me by email ben.doherty@theguardian.com or on twitter @BenDohertyCorro. A summary of recent developments: UK prime minister Boris Johnson drops advice against face mask use in English schools. Pupils in England will no longer be advised against using face masks in schools after prime minister Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn days before students head back to the classroom. The number of Americans newly diagnosed with the coronavirus is falling. About 43,000 new cases are being reported daily across the country, down 21% from early August, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Experts credit the development at least partly to increased wearing of masks, even as the outbreak continues to claim nearly 1,000 lives in the US each day. Turkey recorded its highest number of new coronavirus cases since mid-June. Another 1,502 infections were confirmed on Tuesday, according to government data, taking the official tally over 261,000. India reported the highest number of new coronavirus cases globally for the 18th straight day. Infections rocketed by another 1.5 million since the start of August, taking India’s total to around 3.1 million, more than in the US and Brazil. The rate of new cases in the country is increasing rapidly, climbing by 60,975 in the latest 24-hour period, according to the federal health ministry. Gaza entered a 48-hour lockdown after the first cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in the general population. Four cases of coronavirus were confirmed in a single family in a refugee camp, the first in Gaza that did not involve people quarantined in border facilities after crossing over from Egypt and Israel. Health authorities in the Hamas Islamist-run territory of 2 million people are concerned over the potentially disastrous combination of poverty, densely populated refugee camps and limited hospital facilities in dealing with an outbreak. Two European patients were confirmed to have been reinfected with coronavirus, raising concerns about immunity. Regional public broadcasters said a patient in the Netherlands and another in Belgium had also been reinfected. It follows a report this week by researchers in Hong Kong about a man there who had been reinfected four and a half months after recovering. The German economy contracted by a record 9.7% in the second quarter, the sharpest decline since Germany began to record quarterly GDP calculations in 1970. The statistics office said it came as consumer spending (10.9% down), company investments (19.6% down) and exports (20.3% down) all collapsed at the height of the pandemic."

          "bodyText": "The prime minister’s address to the nation’s children as they prepare to return to classrooms was upstaged by Twitter tongues wagging over a school librarian with a sense of humour. As Boris Johnson told children at Castle Rock school in Coalville, Leicestershire, that exam results had almost been derailed by “a mutant algorithm”, eyes turned to the bookshelves behind him, lined with titles like The Twits, Betrayed and The Subtle Knife. On the day it was announced that the top civil servant at the Department of Education (DfE), Jonathan Slater, was to leave his job, hot on the heels of Ofqual chief Sally Collier, the titles had a resonance which did not go unnoticed. “Has a savvy school librarian or English teacher snatched a golden opportunity to have a pop at the PM in front of the nation?” asked a reporter from the TES. “Whichever librarian managed to get not just the “The Twits” but also “Betrayed”; “Resistance” and “Fahrenheit 451” in the shot behind Johnson has my admiration,” tweeted Sam Freedman, a former senior policy advisor at the DfE. Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel by American writer Ray Bradbury about a society where books are banned. Freedman continued: “It has been noted that the Subtle Knife; Glass Houses; The Toll (about a monstrous dictator); and Guards Guards (about a shady villain installing a puppet king) are all there too. It looks like it’s been carefully curated!” The thread that followed included much praise for librarians."

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson has been accused of presiding over the death of ministerial accountability after No 10 removed the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education (DfE) from his post in the wake of the exams fiasco. Jonathan Slater will step down as permanent secretary within days after Johnson decided there was “a need for fresh official leadership” in the department, the DfE said. His departure was announced a day after the resignation of Sally Collier as chief executive of the exams regulator Ofqual. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has faced calls to quit but has remained in post and repeatedly declined to say whether he offered his resignation. Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the senior civil servants’ union, said Slater’s abrupt departure was proof that “ministerial accountability is dead and the message to civil servants is that they are expendable the moment life gets tough for a minister. This administration will throw civil service leaders under bus without a moment’s hesitation.” Slater will depart on 1 September, just as the DfE is overseeing the return to school of millions of children in England. A Downing Street source said the decision was made last month and claimed it was unrelated to the exams row. “The prime minister has very ambitious plans for education and it was important to have the right leadership in place,” the source said. Slater, a public servant for 35 years, is one of several senior mandarins to have stepped down in recent months. Others include the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald. In June Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, reportedly warned of a “hard rain” hitting the civil service. Mary Bousted, a joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It’s just a scorched-earth policy for civil servants. The ministers who should be resigning because of their political decisions have … refused to take responsibility and are laying into these civil servants, the unfortunate fall guys and gals for ministerial incompetence.” There is a longstanding convention in British politics that elected politicians rather than unelected officials make decisions and are accountable for their department’s failings. The idea is enshrined in a section of the ministerial code, the handbook for government, that says: “Ministers have a duty to parliament to account and be held to account for the policies, decisions and actions of their departments.” Williamson initially sought to blame Ofqual for the exams debacle, in which nearly 40% of A-level results were initially downgraded, disproportionately affecting disadvantaged pupils. He then issued a statement supporting the regulator after its chair, Roger Taylor, threatened to resign. The education secretary paid tribute to Slater on Wednesday, saying: “I would like to thank Jonathan Slater for his commitment to public service, including over four years spent as permanent secretary in the DfE. Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time.” But Slater’s departure was viewed in Westminster as part of what one Tory MP called a “general purge” of officials whose approaches clash with that of No 10. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: “Parents will be looking on in dismay at a government in complete chaos just a matter of days before children will return to schools. Leadership requires a sense of responsibility and a willingness to be held accountable – qualities this prime minister and his ministers utterly lack.” Earlier on Wednesday Johnson prompted ridicule when he told pupils at a school in Leicestershire that the exams fiasco was caused by a “mutant algorithm”. When A-level grades for England were first announced, Johnson said the results were “dependable” and “robust”. Even after the U-turn in which the algorithm was dropped, Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said: “The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it.” The statement issued by the DfE on Wednesday included a tribute to Slater from Sedwill, whose successor has not yet been announced. “The cabinet secretary would like to put on record his thanks to Jonathan for 35 years of public service,” it said. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “We now have a second public servant who appears to have fallen on their sword following the departure of Sally Collier. It is abundantly clear that things have not gone well at the DfE and Ofqual, culminating in the debacle over this year’s GCSE and A-level grades. But it is pretty unsavoury that civil servants appear to be carrying the can while ministers remain unscathed. “The grading fiasco really does need to be resolved by a proper independent review of what went wrong and we have written to the secretary of state for education to request that this takes place immediately. We think this is a more productive way forward.” Slater replaced Chris Wormald as permanent secretary at the DfE four years ago and has worked for four education secretaries in his time at the department. His role will be covered on an interim basis by Susan Acland-Hood, who was previously chief executive of the courts and tribunals service. It was announced last week that she had been drafted in to the department as a temporary second permanent secretary."

          "bodyText": "Here’s a list of the key coronavirus developments from the UK today: Boris Johnson tried to blame a “mutant algorithm” for the results chaos in a live address to pupils in England. The prime minister, who defended Ofqual’s controversial algorithm as “robust” a fortnight ago, told children at an East Midlands school: “I’m afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must’ve been for pupils up and down the country.” The most senior civil servant in the Department for Education (DfE) will step down from his post in the wake of the fiasco. Jonathan Slater’s tenure will end as of 1 September after the “prime minister concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership” in the department, the DfE said. Gatwick airport is to cut around 600 jobs due to the economic impact of the pandemic. Making the announcement, its chief executive, Stewart Wingate, said: “If anyone is in any doubt about the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry then today’s news we have shared with our staff, regarding the proposed job losses, is a stark reminder.” Pupils in Wales over the age of 11 will be recommended to wear face masks at school. The Welsh government said the guidance applied in school communal areas where social distancing cannot be maintained. The government has published new guidance on the use of face coverings in English schools. The guidance, which follows yesterday’s sudden U-turn, states that in local lockdown areas face coverings should be worn by staff and students moving around schools in communal areas and corridors from 1 September. Elsewhere, school leaders will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas. Scotland has recorded its first coronavirus death in more than a month. First minister Nicola Sturgeon confirmed two people had died after testing positive for the virus over the past 24 hours. The last recorded coronavirus-related death in Scotland was on 16 July.

As many as 30 young people may have coronavirus in Plymouth following a holiday to the Greek island of Zante, the city council has said. At least 11 of the group of 18- and 19-year-olds have tested positive for Covid-19, the council said, as it warned residents to take precautions. Public health director Ruth Harrell said her team was working alongside the national systems to contact and trace the young people thought to have been affected. She said: We know that some of these young people had no symptoms, and so carried on as normal, including a night out in Plymouth’s bars and restaurants, until they became aware of the risk. That means more people could be infected. “While young people might have fairly mild symptoms, and sometimes none that you would notice, our big concern is that we know it can be very serious for people who have existing health problems or are older. While we are still below the point of triggering a lockdown, this incident just goes to show how easily life can change. We all need to remain vigilant, whatever age we are, and take proper precautions. Public Health England has published data on the rolling seven-day rate of new cases of Covid-19 for every local authority area in England. The figures, for the week to 23 August, are based on tests carried out in laboratories and in the wider community. Data from Monday to today has been excluded as it is incomplete and likely to be revised. Blackburn with Darwen recorded 82 new cases in the seven days to 23 August – the equivalent of 54.8 per 100,000, which is the highest rate in England. However, the rate is down from 78.2 in the previous seven days to 16 August. Here is a list of the 10 areas with the highest coronavirus rates per 100,000 people in the week to 23 August, compared with the previous week. The number in bracket is the new cases recorded in each area: Blackburn with Darwen 54.8 (82), 78.2 (117) Oldham 54.4 (129), 86.9 (206) Pendle 51.0 (47), 93.4 (86) Leicester 44.9 (159), 50.0 (177) Manchester 42.5 (235), 49.4 (273) Bradford 42.1 (227), 57.2 (309) Rochdale 41.8 (93), 35.5 (79) Swindon 38.7 (86), 42.3 (94) Northampton 38.3 (86), 112.2 (252) Bury 35.6 (68), 33.5 (64) A new free drop-and-collect coronavirus testing service has been set up in Birmingham. Staff from the city council, NHS and wider public sector have volunteered to take part in the latest effort to increase access to testing after Birmingham was placed on the government’s coronavirus watchlist. Under the scheme, teams will visit households in different areas of the city to offer the test kits on the doorstep, even for those without symptoms. Testing is completely free and once dropped off, a volunteer will come back and pick up the completed DIY swab samples within the next hour. As alternatives, people living in Birmingham are also still being encouraged to book appointments at local test sites or order kits online. Paulette Hamilton, Birmingham’s cabinet member for health and social care, said: Free and accessible testing is vital to the success of the NHS test and trace service and the country’s overall efforts of stopping the spread of Covid-19. “More availability to testing gives anyone the opportunity to determine if they have the virus and whether they are safe to return to work or continue doing activities they enjoy outside their home. As parents in the UK rush to buy masks for pupils after government guidance on the use of face coverings in schools changed, my colleague Caroline Davies has written a handy rundown of the different kinds available. She’s included the best face coverings for hygiene and the most ethical, as well as those which are most compatible with school uniform. You can read the list here: The government’s plans to scrap Public Health England (PHE) and replace it with a new body have “little clarity” and risk the loss of highly trained staff, doctors have told MPs. Their comments came in response to questions from members of the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus on Wednesday. Dr Isobel Braithwaite, an academic clinical fellow at University College London, who has been involved with PHE’s London Coronavirus Response Cell, said: People have been working incredibly hard and we’re facing a very difficult winter. It doesn’t feel like a good time for a distraction like this. I think it’s going to make recruitment more challenging and I think we risk losing a lot of very specialised and highly trained people. She added: “My impression is certainly that morale is pretty low and that’s from a low baseline.” Braithwaite argued that a potential second wave of coronavirus should be seen as “multiple second waves” with impacts on waiting lists, cancer diagnosis, mental health, sexual health and other services, but where public health can play a “vital” role. Earlier this month, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the NIHP, headed by Tory peer Dido Harding, would focus on health threats including infectious diseases, pandemics and biologic weapons. But Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told MPs: I’m not at all clear what the problem is that it’s meant to be solving, that’s the first issue. And if we don’t know what the problem that we’re trying to solve is then it’s very difficult to know whether we’re going to get the right answer at the end. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has paid tribute to his permanent secretary, following the government’s announcement that he would be stepping down from his post in September. “I would like to thank Jonathan Slater for his commitment to public service, including over four years spent as permanent secretary in the Department for Education. Like the prime minister, I appreciate the hard work of officials across government, particularly during this unprecedented time,” said Williamson. “I look forward to working with Susan Acland-Hood as the acting permanent secretary to continue to drive forward this government’s ambitious agenda to level up education across the country, giving every child an equal opportunity to succeed. Our immediate focus remains on making sure every child returns to the classroom full-time at the start of term.” Hundreds of people are set to lose their jobs at the Mini car production plant in Oxford following a “substantial” fall in customer demand during lockdown. BMW, which owns the factory, said 400 out of 950 agency workers onsite would be affected by the decision to reduce the numbers of shifts. From mid-October, it will move from a three-shift pattern to two shifts, while continuing to operate five days a week. Agency staff employed by GI Group will be retained based on criteria such as their length of service, individual skills and disciplinary records. Those who are set to lose their jobs working on the production line will be informed by the middle of next month. More than 300,000 students in England will be required to wear face coverings when schools reopen next week – although thousands of pupils could be told within days that they are no longer mandatory. There was confusion among MPs after Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, announced in an 11th-hour U-turn that secondary school pupils in lockdown areas would be required to wear face masks in communal spaces from next week. The government was also accused on Wednesday of providing “completely inadequate” support to schools in England after it emerged that they would receive just 10 Covid testing kits each before the start of term next week. You can read more on the confusion over the new guidance here: Public Health England (PHE) said 41,465 people had died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19 as of Wednesday, an increase of 16 on the day before. Separate figures published by the UK’s statistics agencies show there have now been 57,200 deaths registered in the UK where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate. PHE also said that as of 9am on Wednesday, there had been a further 1,048 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus. Overall, 328,846 cases have been confirmed. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has pledged to meet with families who have lost loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic following a series of calls from a bereavement campaign group. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said they had asked for meetings with Boris Johnson on a number of occasions. Speaking to Sky News, Johnson said that he was not aware of any letters from the group, but said he would respond. He added that he would “of course” meet with the bereaved. Earlier this month, the all-party parliamentary group (APPG) on coronavirus heard from bereaved families who said they felt they were being “swept under the carpet” by the government. Grieving family members said they had written to the prime minister asking to meet and share their experiences but were told that officials were unable to meet “due to the current pandemic”. Last week, the APPG chairwoman, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, wrote to Johnson and said she was “shocked” to learn that he had “refused” to meet the group – which represents 1,600 families. The prime minister told Sky News: “I am not aware of those letters but I will of course write back to every letter we get. “Of course I will meet the bereaved.” School leaders in Wales have reacted angrily to the latest announcement on face coverings from the Welsh government, which effectively hands over the decision on whether they should be worn to schools and local authorities. The Welsh government has asked schools, colleges and councils to undertake risk assessments of their own estates to determine if face coverings should be recommended in communal areas and on transport. The NAHT Cymru, the headteachers’ union in Wales, was not impressed however. Director Laura Doel, NAHT said it was unacceptable to expect school leaders to shoulder the responsibility of deciding if face coverings are required in schools. “Head teachers are not medical experts and the Welsh government should not put them in this position. We need the Welsh government to demonstrate they are in control of this situation. “There needs to be absolute clarity about who is required to wear face coverings and when they need to be worn, this should include clear information in regards to pupils, teachers and parents. “If the government leaves this decision-making to individual schools or local authorities, we will once again see a mixed economy across Wales, with different schools having different measures in place which will be unsettling and potentially unsafe for pupils, parents and staff alike. This will portray a message of confusion, not confidence in returning to school. “If face coverings become mandatory in certain schools, then they will have to purchase many thousands of masks. This will undoubtedly come at an additional and unforeseen cost and may result in shortages as demand increases. “The government needs to guarantee that enough masks will be available to schools and that the costs of getting hold of them are met in full or run the very real risk that schools will not reopen next week.” More on the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education stepping down from his post in the wake of the exams crisis. The general secretary of the senior public servants’ union the FDA, has said it was clear that the government would “throw civil service leaders under a bus without a moment’s hesitation to shield ministers from any kind of accountability”. He added: Those who have dedicated their lives to public service are being discarded without hesitation to keep scrutiny from the government’s door. Whilst the origins of the exams fiasco may be complex, the solutions for this government are simple: scapegoating civil servants. Ministerial accountability is dead and the message to civil servants is that they are expendable the moment life gets tough for a minister. He said that trust between ministers and civil servants was already at an all-time low and the departure of Jonathan Slater would “only damage it further”. Despite continued criticism over the results fiasco, and now the U-turn on pupils wearing face masks in schools, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has so far remained safe in his position. Asked how long the delays were, Soulsby said he was aware of one case where it was a week, but said he intended to provide more analysis on the issue. He claimed there was also “an absence” of an address coming with testing data. But, even without the address, what we could very much benefit from having, certainly in a city like Leicester and probably elsewhere as well, is details of ethnicity and, where appropriate, workplace. Soulsby said he asked Dido Harding, who is leading the government’s test and trace programme, for this information earlier in the pandemic but was told the government was not requiring people being tested to provide it. I understand that some of that data is collected, but it’s not something that is passed to us in a way that enables us to do as we need to do ... which is to identify which particular communities or which particular neighbourhoods in the city are seeing a prevalence of the transmission of the virus. Cllr Ian Hudspeth, the chairman of the Local Government Association’s community wellbeing board and the leader of Oxfordshire county council, also told MPs that local public health officials needed “granular level data at an early, early stage”. He acknowledged there had been “frustrations” over having access to information to help drive local decision-making over tackling the virus. Certainly data is now coming available to us, but I think not sufficient. And it’s this real-time data that’s so important and it’s getting down to the micro ward level almost. Local authorities need access to more granular coronavirus testing data, including people’s addresses, ethnicity, and workplace, in order to help control the spread of Covid-19 in their area, MPs have been told. Leicester city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby claimed the government had been insufficiently trusting of councils during the pandemic, who were still receiving inconsistent testing information. Speaking before the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on coronavirus on Wednesday, he said: It certainly has been quite evident throughout that we have not been trusted with the data and we’ve not been trusted with the powers. And the combination of those two absences has ... hindered our ability to respond as effectively as we would wish to and as we could. Leicester became the first city in the UK to have local lockdown measures reintroduced at the end of June, and was one of the areas to pioneer joint national and local testing and tracing efforts. Through pilot schemes, local authorities were able to visit people at home where national contact tracers have been unable to reach them. This meant people who have been in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases could get a knock on their door if tracers are unable to reach them over the phone. Earlier this month, health officials announced plans to strengthen regional test and trace powers in England, by providing local councils with a dedicated team of contact tracers. Soulsby said data provision was “better than it was”, but added: It is still inconsistent, it’s still erratic, it still comes through after a very significant time delay. It, of course, does mean that although we do the follow-up testing, the follow tracing ourselves – now very effectively in a complex process, it is happening far too late. Burnham also said leaders of Greater Manchester had expressed concern about the Westminster government considering restrictions on a ward-by-ward basis within boroughs. I wouldn’t say this was a unanimous position but it was certainly the overwhelming consensus of our meeting that that is not a road we should go down. It is a recipe for utter confusion, division and chaos, and we are saying to the government we do not want to work in that way. To play in the concerns of Members of Parliament, obviously they are valid and need to be heard but you cannot say views from one community alone can dictate what happens for the whole of a borough. So we are saying very clearly back to the government today that it is the council leaders and their teams themselves that need to be in the driving seat when it comes to decisions about the lifting of restrictions. People do not want to see a division within particular boroughs. Sadly, I think what we begin to see is some people playing politics at a local level with these issues. The view of the leaders was that was entirely the wrong way to go. We will continue to be evidence-based in the way that we approach this and we will take the responsible course as we have done all along. Political leaders in Stockport and Bolton will ask the government to lift coronavirus restrictions in their boroughs. The mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham said political consensus had been reached in both boroughs to push for the removal of restrictions on social gatherings at homes. But council leaders across Greater Manchester agreed to request that restrictions remain in place in Oldham, Manchester, Rochdale, Bury, Tameside, Salford and Trafford. Burnham told reporters: While there is progress in many of our boroughs there are still high numbers of cases and of course we do now have to think about the imminent return of schools and planning safely for that. The next announcement on restrictions in the “northern area of intervention” is due to take place after a meeting on Thursday of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) chaired by Hancock and England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. The leader of Stockport metropolitan borough council, Elise Wilson, said: In consultation with our local MPs, we are advocating on behalf of Stockport that the government eases restrictions that have been placed on Stockport over the last few weeks. This is based on on our infection data which is showing a continued downward trend and that’s across all our areas, and it is the current case. Those levels that we have got at the moment are within the government’s acceptable levels, their green areas, and it’s on that basis I think it’s time now for the government to ease those restrictions. The reason we are in this position is because of the hard work of the residents of Stockport. Gething and Williams said the changes would not include the use of masks in classrooms. As part of the risk assessment we recommend that staff, students, families and unions are engaged. Social distancing is still required in the classroom, so face-to-face teaching without coverings can continue. The overall interests of the young person must be given priority in these assessments and there must be no risk of exclusion from transport to school. Face coverings may need to be provided to young people who don’t have them, if they are recommended locally. Pupils in Wales over the age of 11 will be recommended to wear face coverings in school communal areas where social distancing cannot be maintained, the Welsh government has said. The new guidance also covers pupils on school transport, college students, and staff and will require schools and local authorities to carry out risk assessments of their sites to determine if the two-metre rule cannot be maintained. A joint statement by the health minister Vaughan Gething and the education minister Kirsty Williams said: The current advice from the chief medical officer for Wales is that face coverings are recommended for all members of the public over 11 years in indoor settings in which social distancing cannot be maintained, including schools and school transport. We will amend our operational guidance for schools and FE to require settings and local authorities to undertake risk assessments of their estates to determine if face coverings should be recommended for their staff and young people in communal areas. This will also include school and college transport. Gatwick airport plans to cut around 600 jobs, which it says is due to the pandemic. Its chief executive Stewart Wingate said: If anyone is in any doubt about the devastating impact Covid-19 has had on the aviation and travel industry then today’s news we have shared with our staff, regarding the proposed job losses, is a stark reminder. We are in ongoing talks with government to see what sector-specific support can be put in place for the industry at this time, alongside mechanisms which will give our passengers greater certainty on where and when they can safely travel abroad. This support will not only help Gatwick but the wider regional economy which relies on the airport. A care provider group is calling on the government to reverse an “extraordinary” decision to allow health inspectors into care homes without regular coronavirus testing. The National Care Forum (NCF) wants Care Quality Commission (CQC) inspectors to be included in weekly routine testing prior to on-site visits. The group, which represents 120 of the UK’s social care charities, said the current policy is “not credible” and “very counter-productive”. Without weekly testing, they fear inspectors moving between different groups of residents and staff, visiting potentially multiple homes, could help transmit the virus within and between them. Vic Rayner, the NCF’s executive director. has written an open letter to the health secretary Matt Hancock and the care minister Helen Whately, calling on them to reverse the decision. For months central government and the regulator have been requiring care homes to essentially eradicate the movement of staff and the flow of people, including close family relatives, into homes. Having done this, care homes are now being asked to let inspectors into homes without knowing whether or not they are Covid-positive. Understandably they are both shocked and hugely concerned. If Inspectors are coming in, they need to be tested - there should be no further debate about this. She acknowledged there may be issues with testing capacity, but said including the “relatively small number” of CQC inspectors going into homes would not have any significant impact. Slater’s departure follows that of Sally Collier, the chief executive of England’s exams regulator Ofqual, whose resignation was announced on Tuesday. Slater is one of several senior Whitehall figures to have stepped down in recent months, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald. He has been permanent secretary at the DfE since 2016. His departure is likely to infuriate civil service unions, which reacted angrily to Gavin Williamson’s attempts to blame officials for the exams U-turn. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: It’s just a scorched-earth policy for civil servants. The ministers who should be resigning because of their political decisions have just refused to take responsibility and are laying into these civil servants, the unfortunate fall guys and galls for ministerial incompetence. A statement posted on the gov.uk website says: The prime minister has concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership at the Department for Education. Jonathan Slater has therefore agreed that he will stand down on 1 September, in advance of the end of his tenure in spring 2021. Susan Acland-Hood, currently interim second permanent secretary, will take over as acting permanent secretary. A permanent successor to replace Jonathan Slater will be appointed in the coming weeks. The cabinet secretary would like to put on record his thanks to Jonathan for 35 years of public service, culminating in over four years as permanent secretary of the Department for Education. The Conservative secretary of state responsible for the department, Gavin Williamson, remains in his job. Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education (DfE), is to step down from his post in the wake of the exams fiasco. Slater will step down on 1 September after the “prime minister concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership” in the department, the DfE said. Slater’s departure follows that of Sally Collier, the chief executive of exams regulator Ofqual, whose resignation was announced on Tuesday. Slater is one of several senior Whitehall figures to have stepped down in recent months, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald. You can read the full story from our political editor, Heather Stewart, here: My colleague Josh Halliday has been tuned into Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham’s weekly coronavirus briefly for the past hour. Residents in the city region, excluding those in Wigan, are still subject to partial lockdown measures preventing them from meeting with other households in private homes and gardens or in venues such as restaurants. But Burnham has said he will ask the health secretary Matt Hancock to remove Stockport and Bolton from the restrictions. although he insisted he was strongly opposed to lifting them on a ward-by-ward basis. He added that the Greater Manchester Combined Authority still had not been given the additional contact tracing resources they were promised by the Department of Health and Social Care over a fortnight ago. Meanwhile, although infection rates are falling in most boroughs, mental health is also depleting among residents in the area. Labour’s shadow education secretary has condemned the prime minister for “shamelessly” trying to evade responsibility for the exam results chaos. “Responsibility for this shambles lies squarely with Downing Street and the Department for Education, who set out how they wanted the algorithm to work and were warned weeks in advance of issues, but repeatedly refused to address the problems they had created,” said Kate Green. “It is this Tory government’s incompetence that is to blame for the exams fiasco.” It coms after Boris Johnson blamed a “mutant” algorithm for the fiasco earlier this afternoon, telling pupils in England he was “very glad” the situation had been sorted out. Wales will make a decision on whether children will be required to wear face coverings in schools this afternoon, the first minister has said. Mark Drakeford said there was “potential” for the use of masks to be introduced in school buildings where pupils cannot safely walk around its premises and in areas where there are local spikes. Speaking at Wednesday’s Welsh parliament plenary, Drakeford said: “We said yesterday that we will make a statement before the end of today. That is still the case. “We remain in discussions with a variety of important interests, local authorities, teaching unions, the children’s commissioner, here in Wales.” He added: “There is a potential part to be played by face coverings in secondary schools in a local context were numbers rise above a certain threshold, where particular buildings don’t allow the safe circulation of young people around the school. “It is for a local determination in that set of particular circumstances, that those closest to them are best equipped to assess against guidance that we will provide to them.” A further nine people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,524, NHS England said on Wednesday. The patients were aged between 39 and 84, and all had known underlying health conditions. Another three deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. To put the remarks made by the prime minister earlier about a “mutant algorithm” being responsible for the results chaos into context, on A-level results day he described the system as “robust” and “dependable”. “Let’s be in no doubt about it, the exam results we’ve got today are robust, they’re good and dependable for employers,” Boris Johnson told reporters on 13 August. He added that there had been a record number of students who were able to get into their first choice course at university off the back of results provided by Ofqual’s controversial algorithm. Here’s a video of his comments posted by Sky News at the time: The government then made a spectacular U-turn on 17 August, allowing pupils to receive centre-assessed grades. During a live address to pupils at a secondary school in east Midlands this afternoon, he blamed a “mutant algorithm” for the fiasco. “I’m afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm,” he told them,” said Johnson. “I know how stressful that must have been for pupils up and down the country. “I’m very, very glad that it has finally been sorted out.” Another person has died in Wales after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing its total number of deaths from the virus to 1,594. The number of cases of Covid-19 in Wales increased by 34, bringing the revised confirmed total to 17,808, Pubic Health Wales said. The Czech Republic could become the latest European country to be removed from the government’s travel corridor list, after coronavirus infections increased in the country. It is currently recording a seven-day rate of 19.4 cases per 100,000 of the population, up from 16 last week. A seven-day rate of 20 Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people is the threshold above which the UK government considers triggering quarantine measures for travellers. Switzerland is already over the threshold, with a seven-day rate of 21.2. Last week, Scotland took Switzerland off its list of countries from which people do not need to self-isolate on arrival and the rest of the UK could follow later this week. Two countries that seem likely to remain on the list for the time being are Greece and Italy. While the rate has ticked upwards in both countries, neither of them are near the threshold. In Greece, the latest seven-day rate is 14.1 cases per 100,000 - roughly the same as a week ago (14.3), but up from where it was two weeks ago (10.1). Italy is currently recording a seven-day rate of 10.8, up from 5.6. More than 110,000 Britons are to receive a letter asking them to take part in an official study to assess the prevalence of coronavirus throughout the population. At present, researchers are regularly testing 28,000 people as part of the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) coronavirus infection survey. But the government announced plans last week to expand the programme to 400,000 people across the UK. As part of the expansion of the study, which will look at coronavirus rates as well as the prevalence of antibodies, the ONS has written to more than 110,000 people across the UK to ask them to take part. The survey, which aims to act as a surveillance tool to look for virus hotspots, provides data on the types of people who are more likely to be infected and could be key in highlighting the number of asymptomatic cases across the country. Participants with or without symptoms are being asked to provide regular nose and throat swabs, which are then tested for coronavirus. Some people are also being asked to provide a blood sample for antibody tests. Health workers have been campaigning for a 15% pay rise outside Arrowe Park hospital in Wirral, which was chosen as the quarantine facility for British citizens flown out of Wuhan at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Birkhenhead MP Mick Whitley joined the protest, saying on social media: “We all clapped for health workers. Now let’s fight to ensure they get the pay and recognition they deserve.” The UK’s biggest education union was not amused by the prime minister’s “mutant algorithm” joke in his address to students today, accusing him of treating the exams fiasco as a “minor passing fad”. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It is brazen of the prime minister to idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created. “Parents, students, teachers and heads will be horrified to see the leader of this country treat his own exams fiasco like some minor passing fad. “The public will not easily forget the emotional rollercoaster of this year’s results season. It is certain to put a long-lasting dent in the government’s reputation on education.” The Scottish first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has confirmed that two people have died in Scotland after testing positive for Covid-19 – the first deaths in the country for more than a month. Both deaths were recorded in the past 24 hours. The last coronavirus-related deaths were reported in Scotland on 16 July. A Scotland Yard adviser has called on the Metropolitan police to back a planned march through central London in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Ken Hinds, who works with the Met on stop and search and the use of force, said this Sunday’s peaceful Million People March was in jeopardy if police did not offer their support. He said organisers served police with a full risk assessment – including how they would manage social distancing and track-and-trace obligations – last month, and had threatened legal action if the force did not change its mind. Under current rules, the mass gathering – expected to attract up to 20,000 people – would be deemed illegal due to coronavirus concerns. Organisers say it should be exempt because it is a political movement. Hinds told PA Media: “I have been engaging as one of their special advisers with the police on this march to be sure that it goes off peacefully. “We are planning to have zero arrests, we are looking to have a respectful march, people being able to express themselves and their concerns around things like overpolicing of black men to do with stop and search, disproportionality, messages of education, exclusion, employment, and about the lack of representation on decision-making tables. “The reason we believe this is happening is because of the institutionalised racism across all aspects of British society. “We don’t want the wrong people attending. That’s why it’s vital that we have a good relationship with the police.” He added that school was “safe”, and that it was important for pupils to return not just to be able to socialise with their friends or to take part in sports activities, but because “in the hours and days and weeks of this new term, you will experience things with an intensity and clarity, believe me, that is seldom repeated in your lives”. “You’ll remember these days and weeks and months, you really really will,” he added. Johnson described education as the “great equaliser” and the “transformer of society” in his live address to pupils at a school in the east Midlands, ahead of schools in England reopening to all pupils in September. “It’s the single most important way in which we can unite and level up across this whole country and deliver social justice, and that is why we must in the next week and the succeeding days we must have every pupil back in school in the way that you’ve come back to school,” said Johnson. “So thank you to all of you for being here. Thank you to your teachers, your school for the wonderful job that they have done in in getting ready. Welcome back to school.” Boris Johnson has started a live address to school students in England from a school library. “I’m afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must’ve been for pupils up and down the country,” he told them, adding that he was “very very glad” grades had been “sorted out”. “We have the number of deaths way down, we have the number of hospital admissions way, way down and it’s thanks to you and your sacrifice that we have protected the NHS and saved literally tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of lives,” he said. “No previous generation of pupils has ever done anything like this.” Now, he said, “the risk to your health is not from Covid because, after all, statistically speaking, your chances of suffering from that disease are very, very low”. “The greatest risk you face now is of continuing to be out of school.” Schools in England are to receive just 10 Covid testing kits each ahead of the start of the autumn term next week, the government has revealed. The kits were part of the government’s attempts to reassure anxious parents and staff that every possible measure was being taken to make the return to school as safe as possible, but the volume of tests available to schools has been described as “completely inadequate”. Schools will also receive “a small amount” of personal protective equipment including clinical face masks, aprons, gloves, visors and hand sanitiser in a one-off delivery, provided free of charge by the Department of Health and Social Care. School standards minister Nick Gibb said: All pupils are returning to school for the start of the autumn term – delivering on our national priority to get all pupils back to the classroom, which is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing. “This week schools and colleges will begin to receive their first home testing kits as well as personal protective equipment to use in the very rare situations in which it may be required. “I hope this acts as additional reassurance to parents that schools are ready to welcome children back to school, adding to the growing parental confidence shown in recent opinion polls.” Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “If the government says Covid testing kits will be available in schools then they need to be available in the right volume in order that they can be effectively used. If it’s 10 per school then it’s completely inadequate. The government is losing all credibility.” According to Department for Education guidance, schools can request more test kits if required but they should only be offered in exceptional circumstances where an individual may not be able to access a test elsewhere. Students and staff should ordinarily visit a testing site. Prime minister Boris Johnson is about to give a live address to school students in England on Twitter. We’ll be bringing you updates shortly. A Northampton factory which makes sandwiches for M&amp;S has reopened days after it closed due to almost 300 workers testing positive for Covid-19. Production ceased at Greencore on Friday when it voluntarily closed, while employees were told to self-isolate. But the company said it had been given permission by Public Health England to “stagger start up” using staff who had completed a period of self-isolation from Tuesday, according to the BBC. Greencore told the broadcaster: “We can confirm that colleagues who have completed their self-isolation periods are beginning to return to the site, and that production is therefore gradually restarting on a limited basis. “The site has been deep-cleaned, and the process of restarting production is of course being carried out in close consultation with the Department of Health and Social Care, Public Health England and other government bodies.” Those returning to the production line are workers who had already been self-isolating prior to 299 workers testing positive. Last week, Northampton was added to the government coronavirus watchlist. On that note, the school leaders’ union NAHT has recommended all secondary schools in England ask both pupils and staff to wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas unless there is a “compelling” reason not to. Its general secretary, Paul Whiteman, said: “Once again, many school leaders will feel as though the government has passed the buck and handed the difficult decision over to them. “In the meantime, NAHT’s advice is that it would be prudent for secondary schools to ask pupils and staff to wear face coverings in corridor and communal spaces unless there is a compelling reason not to. “Erring on the side of caution would seem a sensible approach to take given the information coming out of the WHO (World Health Organization).” He added that the union would continue to lobby the government to take a clear and unambiguous line on the guidance. A teaching union has questioned whether the government is following scientific advice or “prioritising political expediency” after its U-turn on face-covering advice for schools in England. Updated guidance from the Department for Education (DfE) issued on Tuesday said that in areas under local lockdown, face coverings should be worn when moving around corridors and communal areas. Teaching unions have previously urged clarity on the wearing of face masks to seek reassurance for pupils, staff and parents before schools reopen in England next week. Dr Patrick Roach, the general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said: “It is deeply regrettable that the government has failed to heed concerns until the last possible moment. “The latest announcement on face coverings raises serious questions about whether the government is seriously following the scientific advice or is simply prioritising political expediency in order to meet the prime minister’s wish to ensure that every school reopens fully at the start of term, come what may.” Two boroughs of Greater Manchester – Stockport and Bolton – are agitating to be released from the stronger restrictions imposed on the region on 31 July, which ban gatherings in homes and gardens. Stockport, in the south-east, will argue at Greater Manchester’s Covid meeting today that it has maintained sufficiently low cases in recent weeks and should follow Wigan’s lead in being freed from the extra measures. That’s according to Andrew Gwynne, the MP for Denton and Reddish, whose constituency straddles Stockport and Tameside, where cases are higher. He said: I’ve been involved in some of the decisions because Matt Hancock has decided now that MPs need to be consulted about these things, even though we aren’t experts and don’t have access to the data. I do resent that because it almost turns this into a political decision rather than one based on the evidence and the science. Gwynne said he supported the move but that it carried obvious risk, with schools reopening in the borough next week. He said it also posed questions for Stockport secondary schools. If the restrictions were lifted in Stockport, would all high school pupils be exempt from the government’s latest U-turn on mask wearing, even if they lived over the border in Manchester, where cases were higher? Plus, he said, many Stopfordians regularly crossed district borders for work or play, citing Granada Park in Tameside, which is overlooked by houses with Stockport addresses. “You’ll have a scenario where Stockport children are allowed to mix but not Tameside children,” he said. Yesterday the Tory leader of Bolton council also appealed to the government to be released from the Greater Manchester restrictions. Drug crime rose by up to 44% during the coronavirus lockdown in England and Wales, compared with the same period last year, official figures show. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), drug offences recorded by police rose by 22% in April to 16,570 and 44% in May to 20,687. This is compared with 13,535 and 14,343 for the respective months in 2019. The ONS report, published on Wednesday, put this down to “proactive police activity in pursuing these crimes during lockdown”. It said the rises were driven largely by drugs possession offences with “early indications” suggesting this was “particularly evident in London” where the Metropolitan police had increased the number of drug-related stop and searches it was carrying out during that time. Overall police-recorded crime during lockdown was 25% lower in April and 20% lower in May compared with the same period in 2019. It also fell 5% in March compared with February, the report said. In particular, reports of theft fell in April and May to “almost half the level recorded” during those months in the previous year. But reports of crime rose again as lockdown restrictions began to ease, the ONS added. Cinemas around the country are pinning their hopes on the release of Tenet, the much-anticipated sci-fi thriller from director Christopher Nolan, to drive viewers back to theatres this week. The first post-quarantine blockbuster to hit cinemas nationwide will be shown from today, 26 August, with the theatre chain Showcase Cinemas already reporting a 75% increase in ticket sales over the weekend to see it. Mark Barlow, General Manager for Showcase Cinemas UK, said: “Between Friday evening and Monday morning we saw a 75% increase in ticket sales for Tenet. “Despite lockdown reducing capacity at our cinemas, we’re expecting strong attendances for the film throughout the rest of August, into September and beyond.” Although cinemas have been able to reopen following the national lockdown since 4 July, many initially remain closed, while social distancing and hygiene remain in place. From 8 August, cinema-goers have been required to wear face coverings and are only permitted to take them off when consuming food or drinks. I’m Amy Walker, taking over from Damien Gayle. I’ll be guiding you through the day’s key UK coronavirus developments. Thousands of learner drivers trying to book driving tests in England and Wales again this morning faced lengthy queues or struggled to complete their bookings, when the online service reopened after crashing last week, writes Rebecca Smithers, the Guardian’s consumer affairs correspondent. Last Saturday the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) was forced to suspend the website which struggled to cope with “unprecedented” demand following several months of closure during the coronavirus lockdown. This morning on Twitter the DVSA urged applicants to be patient. It is offering 35,675 tests over the next six weeks, but in the first hour this morning nearly 100,000 applicants were queuing (examples below). The DVSA said the service had received almost 7 million visits in 12 hours when it reopened last Friday after being closed since 20 March. It took the service offline until 8am today for essential maintenance. Sarah Rees, managing director of the AA Driving School, said: “With just over 35,000 tests available and around 100,000 learners trying to book a test this morning, it is clear not all those in the queue are going to be able to book a driving test. “We know the DVSA has been working hard to fix issues with the booking site but for those who have already experienced cancelled tests due to lockdown, this is yet another bump in the road on their journey to getting a licence. “Demand for lessons has been high since lockdown relaxed and instructors could get back on the road. We know many people are trying to get their licence as a way to avoid public transport or to increase their employment prospects. “Unless issues with booking a test are resolved quickly the backlog of learners desperate to get their licence is only going to increase.” Driving tests in Scotland are due to restart from 14 September, but people are not yet able to book a slot. New Look is seeking a three-year rent holiday on 68 of its stores and big rent reductions on hundreds of others as it battles to stay afloat and save the jobs of its 11,200 employees, writes Sarah Butler for the Guardian business desk. The struggling fast-fashion chain is attempting to secure its second financial rescue deal in 18 months and, along with the payment holiday, is asking landlords to slash rents to 12% of current levels on a further 402 of its shops. New Look said its debt holders had agreed to plough £40m in new cash into the business and cut debts by about £440m to about £100m if landlords would agree to the stinging rent cuts. In return, landlords will be able to exit leases more easily if they can secure better terms elsewhere. The UK education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has defended the government’s U-turn on pupils in England wearing face masks in schools after coming under fire from Conservative MPs over the move, writes Simon Murphy, a Guardian political correspondent. Just hours after the cabinet minister Alok Sharma said on Tuesday morning there were no plans to review the policy amid pressure from headteachers, the government performed an about-turn and said pupils would no longer be advised against using face masks in secondary schools. Instead, in places with high levels of Covid-19, such as lockdown areas including Greater Manchester, children in year 7 and above are now being advised to wear face coverings in school corridors where social distancing is more difficult. Notting Hill carnival performers have said the the event is more important than ever amid worldwide antiracism demonstrations sparked by the death of George Floyd in the US, in spite of it being forced online this year by the coronavirus outbreak. Clary Salandy, artistic director of Mahogany Carnival Arts, told US new agency the Associated Press that even though it will not be the same, carnival must be celebrated as a mark of black liberation in Britain. We can’t be on the street, but carnival is very much alive. Just taking part in carnival, you are joining the commemoration and you are standing up for what is right. You’re standing up for freedom. And so that’s why it’s really important. ... Look at it! Make sure you engage with it, understand it and support it. This year, elements of the event will be prerecorded and streamed to the world on 29-31 August. One channel will focus on the parade, including the dancers who normally snake through the streets of Notting Hill wearing colorful headdresses, masks and movable art. Others will stream music, cultural discussions and presentations on food and drink. Matthew Phillip, executive director of Notting Hill Carnival ltd, the carnival’s most recent corporate incarnation, said the online format provides an opportunity to reach more people. From the comfort of your own home, you’ll not only to be exposed to the entertainment of carnival, but also the people behind carnival ... and hear stories of how it came to be and the struggles that people have undergone. A Conservative MP has said that politicians must stop “hiding behind the science” when it comes to their decision making about the coronavirus crisis. Huw Merriman, MP for Bexhill and Battle, told Radio 4 this morning: I think the Government needs to get a grip of our scientists. I’m sick and tired, and I think many people in the public are sick and tired, the science just changes. So that’s fine and then we say, ‘we’re listening to the science’, but why was the science saying something completely different beforehand? It’s baffling for many people, it’s causing uncertainty, it’s causing worry. People don’t know what the rules are any more. How can the science change from one day to the next? There comes a point in time where policy-makers have to get a grip on policy, decide what it is, be firm with it, be certain, give reassurance and say ‘this is the way we’re going to act’ ... It’s time we stopped hiding behind the science, which keeps changing, and we focus on the fact that we’re in charge, we give people reassurance, we say to people that the school is a safe setting. Merriman did not explain on what basis ministers ought to make decisions, if not science. Police recorded crime during the coronavirus lockdown was 25% lower in April and 20% lower in May compared with the same period in 2019, according to Office for National Statistics figures. It also fell 5% in March compared with February. But reports of crime rose as lockdown restrictions began to ease, a report published on Wednesday said. In particular, reports of theft fell in April and May to “almost half the level recorded” during those months in the previous year. However, records of drug offences rose by 22% in April and 44% in May compared with April and May 2019. This is down to “proactive police activity in pursuing these crimes during lockdown”, the ONS report said. Here are the UK’s latest official coronavirus figures, as of 9.30am. Deaths and new cases remain well down on the peaks reached in April and May. The UK is forecast to lose £22bn in spending as international tourism plummets, putting almost 3m jobs at risk, writes Mark Sweney for the Guardian’s business desk. The World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC) said the continuing uncertainty around travel restrictions designed to halt a resurgence in coronavirus cases is causing millions of people to opt for staycations in their home countries instead. An impact assessment on the UK economy by the organisation estimates the fall in international tourist numbers could result in the amount spent dropping by 78%, or £420m a week. In a “worst-case” scenario mapped out by the WTTC, almost 3m jobs in the UK that rely on, or are supported by, the travel and tourism industry could be lost. “The lack of international travel caused by the pandemic could wipe out more than £22bn from the UK economy alone, a loss of £60m a day, from which it could take years to recover,” said Gloria Guevara, the president and chief executive of the WTTC. “It could also threaten London’s position as one of the world’s premier hubs for business and leisure travel, which could see other destinations take over.” Pupils are returning to classes at some schools in Leicester - many for the first time since March - after the east Midlands city became the first in the UK to be placed under localised coronavirus restrictions. About 20 schools in the city are reopening for some pupils on Wednesday - with children at a further 92 returning to classes next Tuesday. Travel safety measures were in place. Extra buses were to be operating on busy public transport routes because fewer passengers are allowed on each vehicle due to social distancing measures, Leicester city council said, according to the PA news agency. The authority has issued maps with “safe routes” for cycling and walking to encourage more pupils to travel on foot or by bike. Social distancing reminders have been painted onto pavements near some schools to prevent crowds forming and signs with health advice have been put on lampposts. Marshals will also be present outside some schools. Leicester’s assistant city mayor responsible for schools, Elly Cutkelvin, said: We’ve been working with schools over the last few weeks to help us get the messages out to parents that they should walk or cycle to school if at all possible, and if they have to rely on public transport or car-sharing, how to do so as safely as possible. All schools are busy at drop-off and pick-up times, and measures to help maintain social distancing, reduce traffic congestion and reinforce the key public health messages will all help to manage the situation as safely as possible. Returning to the routine of school life after such a long time away is quite a significant milestone for many families, and we want to ensure they get all the help they need to feel confident and safe in doing so. Following yesterday’s sudden U-turn, the government has this morning published fresh guidance on the use of face coverings in England’s schools, which sets out when they are required and pupils that are exempt. In local lockdown areas face coverings should be worn by staff and students moving around schools in communal areas and corridors from 1 September, it says. Consistent with WHO’s new advice, schools and colleges should take additional precautionary measures in areas where the transmission of the virus is high. These areas are defined as areas of national government intervention. In these local intervention (lockdown) areas, in education settings where Year 7 and above are educated, face coverings should be worn by adults and pupils when moving around, such as in corridors and communal areas where social distancing is difficult to maintain. As in the general approach, it will not usually be necessary to wear face coverings in the classroom, where protective measures already mean the risks are lower, and they may inhibit teaching and learning. Elsewhere, “schools and colleges will have the discretion to require face coverings in communal areas where social distancing cannot be safely managed, if they believe that it is right in their particular circumstances.” Where a student or staff member is struggling to access a mask, or if it soiled or unsafe, the guidance says that schools should take steps to have a “small contingency supply” available, adding no-one should excluded on the grounds that they are not wearing a face covering. Exemptions to the new measures include those who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment, or disability, or if a person is speaking to or providing assistance to someone who relies on lip reading, clear sound or facial expression to communicate. In the final part of our Politics Weekly series, Jonathan Freedland speaks to the Scottish finance secretary, Kate Forbes. The pair discuss the ongoing debate over Scottish independence, her future in the SNP, and what role her faith plays in her politics. Calum Semple, professor of child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool, said that face coverings for children would become “part of the new normal”. “It’s going to be interesting seeing how children make these fashion items and personalise them,” he told BBC Breakfast, according to the PA news agency. He said the most important factors for reducing transmission are hand washing and social distancing, adding: “Face coverings are just the icing on the cake.” Semple said that he thought face coverings were a “small help” but the majority of infection control must be hand washing and social distancing. “We can’t assume just because someone is wearing a mask that is going to take away all risk,” he added. He said he did not think face coverings were necessary for younger children in communal areas, adding: “Children are much better behaved in a classroom supervised by a teacher than adults are in a pub around a pint of beer.” The Federation of Small Businesses has called on ministers to extend the “eat out to help out” scheme into September. The initiative, which sees the cost of eat-in meals reduced three days a week, is due to finish at the end of August. Mike Cherry, the federation’s chairman, said: The Eat Out to Help Out scheme has been an overwhelming success in getting people back on their high streets and in their town centres. We now need to see it extended to continue the critical support that it is providing for small firms as we enter a period of economic make or break. Over the past few weeks, the scheme has been hugely welcomed by small businesses and their customers alike. A nationwide one-month extension would go some way to helping many firms which are still only just about managing in this time of crisis. More than 35 million meals have been cooked and dished out across almost 50,000 restaurants and cafes who have been able to reap the rewards of this great initiative, but as we enter September with schools reopening and more people going back to their places of work, there are still strong merits to continuing this for one more month. Additional support is still needed for certain groups in the leisure sector, especially pubs. We need to see these community hubs fully brought into the Eat Out to Help Out fold, particularly as they have been excluded from the recent VAT cut for food. The FSB said that after September the scheme should be “reactivated” in areas that have gone through local lockdowns. A group of academics writing in the British Medical Journal have said that rules on physical distancing to curb the spread of coronavirus are based on outdated science. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach to social distancing, there should be “graded recommendations” for different distancing rules in different settings, which would provider greater protection for people in high risk settings and greater freedoms for people in lower risk settings. This would “potentially enable a return towards normality in some aspects of social and economic life”. Distancing rules should take account of multiple factors that affect risk, including type of activity, indoor versus outdoor settings, level of ventilation and whether face coverings are worn, they said. “Current rules on safe physical distancing are based on outdated science,” according to Nicholas Jones,from Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Primary Care and colleagues. Distribution of viral particles is affected by numerous factors, including air flow. Evidence suggests Sars-CoV-2 may travel more than two metres through activities such as coughing and shouting. Rules on distancing should reflect the multiple factors that affect risk, including ventilation, occupancy, and exposure time. The authors called for more work to develop solutions to examine appropriate distances for people in different settings. They concluded: Physical distancing should be seen as only one part of a wider public health approach to containing the Covid-19 pandemic. It needs to be implemented alongside combined strategies of people-air-surface-space management, including hand hygiene, cleaning, occupancy and indoor space and air managements, and appropriate protective equipment, such as masks, for the setting. Katharine Birbalsingh, the famously disciplinarian headteacher of the Michaela community school in Brent, north west London, has laid into the suggestion that schoolchildren will be kept safer by face masks. It was one thing to recognise that a lab technician in a laboratory could be kept safer by wearing a mask, but in a school, she told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4, things were likely to be very different. In a comprehensively observed sketch of children’s potential attitudes towards mask wearing, Birbalsingh said: You need to take into account children’s group behaviour in a school, before you then say they are safer with masks. What about the children who turn up to school with uniforms that are not washed? They don’t necessarily wash themselves. They come into school hungry. They will be wearing re-used, dirty masks. They will swap them; they will ping them; they will lick and spit on each others masks for a joke; they will wear them incorrectly; they will lose them. When half of your children show up to school and are not wearing masks, what do you do? Do you exclude them? The girls will be in the loos checking their masks to make sure they look nice. They will be touching their faces all the time. We need to take into account children’s behaviour when considering whether or not masks make them safer, and I would actually argue that they make them less safe. The Guardian, the Times, the Telegraph and the i all splash on the government’s face mask U-turn for English schools this morning. The Daily Mail and the Express are, as you might expect, leading on Rule Britannia. And the red tops - the Star, the Sun (not pictured) and the Mirror - are leading on Harry Maguire’s problems in Greece. Good morning, this is Damien Gayle with you this morning, keeping you up to date with the latest headlines and updates in coronavirus-related UK news. Today we will focusing on the aftermath of Boris Johnson’s latest U-turn - the 11th or so so far since the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic - over the use of face masks in secondary schools, days before schools reopen. The prime minister bowed to pressure and changed the guidance late on Tuesday after scores of headteachers, backed by Labour and trade unions, broke ranks to urge their use. In lockdown areas such as Greater Manchester, which have greater restrictions to stop the spread of the virus, wearing face coverings will become mandatory in school corridors where social distancing is more difficult. In areas of England not subject to tighter restrictions, headteachers will have discretion over whether to require face masks, but the government will no longer advise against their use, a senior government source said. Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, said the change followed updated advice from the World Health Organization saying children aged over 12 should wear masks."

          "headline": "The Guardian view on Brexit deadlines: Boris Johnson's nemesis",
          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson’s government is too often caught unawares by events that were not only predictable but scheduled. The start of a new school term has been a feature of autumns for a lot longer than Gavin Williamson has been education secretary, yet arrangements for keeping classrooms safe from Covid-19 are still uncertain. Ministers cannot answer a question as simple as whether masks should be worn. As with the mess over exam results, guidance issued one day is contradicted the next. The pattern is set by the prime minister. He deals in grand ambitions, not plans for their realisation. When things go wrong he shifts the blame, as he did on Wednesday when he suggested a “mutant algorithm”, and not ministerial incompetence, was at fault over the grading fiasco. The top civil servant at the education department is being ousted; the secretary of state responsible is not. The problem is most extreme in relation to Brexit. Every stage of the UK’s uncoupling from the EU has been mapped out by treaty, including the expiry of transitional arrangements at the end of this year. By then, a free trade deal is supposed to have been negotiated and ratified. That is getting harder with each passing week. The impediment is British reluctance to recognise what is realistically available, or understand the imbalances of power in negotiations between a lone country and a continental trading bloc. In June, the prime minister said he could see no reason why broad agreement might not be reached in July. But there was a reason, and he was it. Mr Johnson has not paid close attention, made choices or given his negotiators bandwidth for compromise. The UK still demands pristine sovereignty, with no obligation to align its standards with EU markets, plus a right to subsidise domestic industries to a degree not permitted under Brussels rules. The EU will not grant privileged market access on those terms, because doing so would undermine its own industries. Eurosceptic hardliners say they would prefer no deal to any obligation to match continental standards. Whether that is a bluff or not is a question that interests EU leaders less and less. They have other things to do. At the instigation of Germany, Brexit has been dropped from the agenda of a top-level European meeting next week on the grounds that there is nothing new to discuss. Mr Johnson knows what the options are – they range from close integration to something more distant, with tariffs and quotas – and he must choose. But he doesn’t. Instead, the government still treats Brexit in the most superficial manner, as if the performance of readiness counts as the real thing. A report that Tony Abbott, a former Australian prime minister, might take on a senior trade advisory role is a case in point. Setting aside Mr Abbott’s notoriously rebarbative character, the appointment would be consistent with the myth, common among Brexit supporters, that trade deals are conjured into being by swaggering personalities. The reality is that good outcomes in a trade deal are achieved by the application of time, attention to detail, experienced negotiators and a rational appraisal of the other side’s interests. The UK government is deficient on all those metrics. As with the challenge of reopening schools, or grading exams never sat, the job does not get any easier with neglect. Leaving everything to the last minute, testing the fixity of deadlines, is a method that might have worked for Mr Johnson when he was a newspaper columnist, but it is no way to run a government. He operates one day at a time, stumbling from one problem to the next, with no sense of a strategic horizon. Such a man cannot safely settle the UK’s long-term relations with its neighbours. Nor, for that matter, should he be trusted with many other tasks required of a prime minister."

          "bodyText": "“Do you take responsibility for what happened? Because last week my colleague on this programme, Louise Minchin, asked you several times if you had considered your resignation and you didn’t answer that then,” said BBC Breakfast’s Dan Walker. “So do you take responsibility for what happened over exams and what happened in the last 24 hours over the wearing of face coverings in schools?” “Um ... unprecedented … er ... pandemic ...” replied Gavin Williamson as he wittered on for 30 seconds about nothing very much. “But do you take responsibility for the issues in your department?” Walker interrupted. “Um ... in terms of exam results … er … policy approach ...” Gavin continued aimlessly. Finally Walker – possibly the gentlest interviewer any cabinet minister could hope to come up against – cracked. “You’re talking down the time so I don’t get to ask you the questions,” he snapped. And when Walker reaches his breaking point, you know the game is up. But then Williamson had known the game was up the night before when he had got the phone call from the prime minister telling him he had changed his mind about face masks in schools and that he wanted him to do the Wednesday morning media round. Even Private Pike has a humiliation threshold. It had been bad enough having to explain why he had switched to predicted A-level grades the week before, now he was going to have to come up with another reason for doing the one thing the government had said it wasn’t going to do only days earlier. “What shall I tell them this time?” Gavin had sobbed. “How about that they’ve got as much chance of dying from the coronavirus as being knocked down by a car,” Boris Johnson had said. “I’m not sure that choosing between two ways of dying is the way to go here.” “Oh, well, I’m sure you will think of something. I’m up to my neck trying to stop that Scottish farmer from suing me for trespass. And don’t worry. I’m about to appoint that rightwing Aussie lunatic Tony Abbott to the board of trade – it will be a race to the bottom to see who is the stupider, him or Liz Truss, so with any luck everyone will soon forget your latest embarrassment.” It didn’t feel that way to Private Pike as he shuffled from the BBC Breakfast to the Today studio. If he could get his arse handed to him on a plate by Walker, God knows what state he would be in by the time Mishal Husain had finished with him. He mentally tried to rehearse his lines. It was like this. This wasn’t yet another U-turn. Rather it was a sign of clarity and consistency. The country had got used to the government constantly changing its mind on issues, so everyone would have been mentally prepared for the latest switch of policy. Had the government actually stuck to what it had said it was going to do then everyone would have been totally confused. Besides, no one – apart from a whole load of twitchy Tory MPs, such as Huw Merriman and Charles Walker, who were demanding he made a bad decision and stuck with it – wanted a government that wasn’t prepared to do something different to what it had promised. “At every stage we listen to the latest scientific advice,” Gavin began, sounding more confident than he felt. Now it was Husain’s turn to be confused. Her understanding was that the World Health Organization had issued guidelines that it was beneficial for secondary students to wear face coverings in areas of schools where social distancing could not be guaranteed. So how come the deputy chief medical officer, Jenny Harries, had said on Monday there was no strong evidence for them? Hell, even Alok Sharma, the business secretary whose signature move was to never commit himself to anything that might be construed as news, had confirmed that masks in schools were a definite no-no just the day before. “Ah, let me be clear,” said Gavin. He hadn’t said how quickly he would follow the scientific advice and England had a strong track record of reacting later than everyone else. That was why we had a coronavirus mortality rate to be proud of. Besides, it was no big deal. It was only for schools in lockdown areas and on no account were children going to be wearing masks in the classroom. At which point headteachers of all schools everywhere made a note to prepare for pupils wearing masks the whole time. By now, Private Pike was prepared to commit himself to anything and promised that all schools would definitely return in September. He had no idea if this was true, but he no longer much cared as he knew he was in line for the sack within a month or two regardless. Husain cut to the chase. “Do you actually want to stay in the job?” she said, her voice finally betraying a hint of sympathy for the hapless education secretary. “I love the job. It’s the best job in government.” The teachers at his comprehensive school had done a brilliant job in helping him to achieve what he wanted in life. Even if the rest of the country was wishing they had done a slightly worse job and that Gav’s career highlight had remained as fireplace salesman of the year 2006. There was still just time for him to land Sally Collier, the outgoing Ofqual chief executive, in the brown stuff before he was done for the day. She had been a goner since the moment he had expressed his full confidence in her and surely no one would ever find out that his department had been more concerned about grade inflation than the impact of an algorithm that disadvantaged pupils from poorer areas? And even if they did, they would assume he had meant the opposite. Gav also considered mentioning that Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant in the department for education, would also be getting the sack later in the day for the exams chaos. Heads must roll. It was time for someone to show real leadership in the department, the prime minister had told him earlier in the day. And there was no chance of that real leadership coming from Gavin or Boris. Their only real discernible function was to be at best a distraction and at worst a waste of space. Still, at least he wasn’t the only one having a tricky day, as around lunchtime Boris found himself addressing a group of students in a school library. All of whom looked unimpressed and blank throughout. Every one of the PM’s gags fell flat, and his attempt to blame their exam results on “a mutant algorithm” – one that he had previously championed – was met with outright hostility. It’s not just Walker and Husain who know bullshit when they hear it."

          "headline": "Antarctica: 60% of ice shelves at risk of fracture, research suggests",
          "bodyText": "Approximately 60% of Antarctica’s ice shelves could be vulnerable to fracture, accelerating the loss of the Antarctic ice sheet and increasing sea-level rise, according to a paper. Antarctica’s ice shelves, floating extensions of the ice sheet, help slow the flow of ice into the ocean. But if these shelves fracture and then collapse, the flow of melting glaciers into the oceans accelerates. A study published in the journal Nature has mapped areas where ice shelves hold back upstream ice and are susceptible to “hydrofracture”, where meltwater flows into crevasses and fissures in the ice and enlarges them, potentially triggering the collapse of the ice shelf. This process could accelerate the loss of Antarctic ice more than some climatic models predict as atmospheric warming increases. The study follows scientists’ recent announcement that Earth has lost 28tn tonnes of ice from its surface since 1994. Most climatic models do not include the impact of hydrofracturing in their calculations, although one 2016 paper did account for them in a simpler way than the new study. Hydrofracturing can only occur if the surface of an ice shelf is inundated with meltwater. Large pools of meltwater have existed in many areas of Antarctica for decades without causing the collapse of an ice shelf because the flow of water into surface fissures is slow or refreezes. While some areas are not susceptible to fracture, Ching-Yao Lai of the Earth Institute at Columbia University and colleagues identified that 60% of the Antarctic ice shelf was both slowing the flow of ice into the ocean and also vulnerable to fracture. While fractures in the ice are visible in satellite imagery, manual mapping is impractical because of the extent of the ice. So Lai and colleagues used machine learning to identify fracture-like features in satellite pictures of Antarctica, before modelling which fractures were vulnerable to hydrofracturing. They developed a model to predict where fractures could form and found close agreement with the fractures mapped by their machine learning algorithm. Lai said: “We predicted that the ice-shelves areas that can collapse due to hydrofracture are mostly the crucial part of ice shelves that hold back the upstream flow of ice sheets. Thus the loss of these ice-shelf areas due to hydrofracture can substantially affect the flow of ice sheets into the ocean. “But predicting how much and how fast the loss of Antarctic ice and sea-level rise will occur due to the hydrofracturing process will require coupling our new fracture model with an ice-sheet and climate model, which is an important next step.” The researchers hope their fracture model can help create more accurate models of the fate of the ice sheets, which together with climatic modelling will produce more accurate predictions of sea-level rise, which scientists believe could exceed one metre by the century’s end. The researchers warned that while many areas of Antarctic meltwater were not currently likely to cause the hydrofracture of the ice beneath, with global heating these areas could become newly at risk in the future. “Increased meltwater ponding in resilient locations will not lead to widespread hydrofracturing according to our analysis,” the authors wrote. “However, predictions of future melt suggest that melt rates seen in locations that experience meltwater ponding today could become widespread by 2100 under high-emissions scenarios.”"

          "bodyText": "Jonathan Slater, the most senior civil servant in the Department for Education (DfE), is to step down from his post in the wake of the exams fiasco. Slater will step down on 1 September after the “prime minister concluded that there is a need for fresh official leadership” in the department, the DfE said. Slater’s departure follows that of Sally Collier, the chief executive of exams regulator Ofqual, whose resignation was announced on Tuesday. Slater is one of several senior Whitehall figures to have stepped down in recent months, including the cabinet secretary, Mark Sedwill, and the Foreign Office permanent secretary, Simon McDonald. He has been permanent secretary at the DfE since 2016. His departure is likely to infuriate civil service unions, which reacted angrily to Gavin Williamson’s attempts to blame officials for the exams U-turn. Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “It’s just a scorched-earth policy for civil servants. The ministers who should be resigning because of their political decisions have just refused to take responsibility and are laying into these civil servants, the unfortunate fall guys and galls for ministerial incompetence.” The prime minister on Wednesday suggested the exams fiasco, which saw thousands of results reversed, had been caused by a “mutant algorithm”."

          "bodyText": "First a virtual Jackson Hole, and now a summer Davos: central bank bosses’ holiday schedules for the next 12 months are going to look very different. Tomorrow’s speech by Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell will take place over a video call, but it will still be a key focus for investors who are hoping for signs of how the central bank thinks monetary policy will evolve as the pandemic continues. He is expected to unveil a new monetary policy framework based on average inflation targeting, a mode that could allow for inflation to rise above target for some time if required to stimulate the economy. That could open the way for more stimulus. But striking a balance will be tricky given that the depth of recessions in major economies means activity will almost inevitably come roaring back. For example, US durable goods orders this afternoon increased above expectations, rising by 11.2% compared to a 4.3% expectation from economists. Yet almost anyone on any high street in the world will be able to tell you that economic activity has slumped. For central bankers whose armouries were nearly empty before the crisis further stimulus could prove politically painful, particularly if economic indicators appear strong. Ahead of the speech, however, the FTSE 100 is nearly flat, down by 0.1% at about 6,029 points. The S&amp;P 500 has nudged upwards by 0.2%, but in this strange times (and in no small part thanks to Powell) that means it has hit a new record high. Here are some of the other important developments from today: Doorstep lender Provident Financial has cut 300 jobs after losing millions of pounds in its consumer credit division. The UK’s bank regulator has ended new mortgage payment holidays from 31 October, but told lenders to keep offering support. Oil prices have been sustained by shutdowns in the Gulf of Mexico, which is braced for hurricanes. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has criticised HSBC for allegedly shutting down Hong Kong democracy activists’ accounts. HSBC declined to comment. And you can of course continue to follow our live news coverage from around the world: In the UK, Boris Johnson has tried to blame a “mutant algorithm” for exam results chaos in England In the US, there has been a second fatality confirmed in Kenosha after overnight protests following the Jacob Blake shooting And in our global coverage, Iran’s death toll exceeds 21,000; India passes 3.2m cases Thank you as ever for following our live coverage today, and please do join me tomorrow for the buildup to Powell’s speech at a virtual Jackson Hole. JJ The World Economic Forum, the annual gathering of the global business and economic elite, has pushed back its 2021 meeting in Davos from January to early next summer. Adrian Monck, the forum’s managing director for public engagement, said it was not possible to convene the meeting safely in January at its usual ski resort location. Davos went ahead in January 2020, but there had been significant doubts over the ability to gather thousands of business leaders, media and politicians in one place in 2021 after the pandemic spread. In an email, Monck said: The decision was not taken easily, since the need for global leaders to come together to design a common recovery path and shape the “Great Reset” in the post-Covid-19 era is so urgent. However, the advice from experts is that we cannot do so safely in January. The WEF will instead hold digital “Davos dialogues” during the week of 25 January. “Key global leaders will share their views on the state of the world in 2021,” he said. US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has criticised British bank HSBC for allegedly shutting down accounts belonging to activists in Hong Kong. HSBC enraged the US and critics in the UK after publicly backing the imposition by Beijing of a new security law in Hong Kong. Pompeo has previously accused HSBC of a “corporate kowtow” after its Asia Pacific chief executive, Peter Wong, signed a petition supporting laws that analysts said drastically weakened freedom of speech protections in the territory. Pompeo on Twitter said he was “dismayed” to learn of pressure on British businesses and then referenced HSBC’s alleged closure of accounts “for those seeking freedom”. HSBC has been approached for comment. The economies of the wealthiest nations contracted by an “unprecedented” 9.8% in the second quarter of 2020, according to the OECD, the club for richer countries. The OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) figures confirm that the UK suffered the worst contraction - 20.7% - among the G7 major economies. But it is of course by no means only the very richest nations who have suffered. Mexico this afternoon reported a contraction of 17.1% in the second quarter. A forecast drop of 10.5% in output for 2020 versus 2019 would be the worst year since the Great Depression, according to Reuters. British online consumer brands retailer The Hut Group is planning a £4.5bn stock market flotation, according to Sky News. The company, which employs 7,000 people, is reportedly planning for shares to start trading on 16 September, with an announcement possible as soon as Thursday. The Hut Group sells cosmetics under brands such as ESPA, Illamasqua and lookfantastic, and clothing and fashion from Coggles, AllSole and MyBag. Sky News reported that co-founder Matthew Moulding could be in line for a £700m payout if the company proves popular with investors. Sky News can reveal details of a long-standing share plan that could hand more than £700m-worth of shares to Matthew Moulding, the company’s executive chairman, if it achieves a market capitalisation of £7.25bn by December 2022. Central bankers would, at this point in the year, usually be getting out their fishing rods in preparation for an annual conference at Jackson Hole, a resort in the wilds of Wyoming. This year the annual session of navel-gazing is going virtual, but investors in the sluggish days of August are still focusing on what the economists, and particularly Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell, will say about the future of monetary policy. Powell’s speech will be keenly watched by investors, writes the Guardian’s economics editor, Larry Elliott, because he is expected to signal that the Fed is poised to soften its inflation stance, paving the way for more stimulus in the months ahead. If the head of the world’s most powerful central bank fails to deliver, share prices are likely to nosedive. Friday will be Andrew Bailey’s first time in the Jackson Hole spotlight (although he and his American wife are familiar with the wilderness, to the point that she once scared off a bear while he was on the phone, according to the Financial Times). Since the start of the year, the Bank has been looking into the medium and long-term effects of operating in a world where it is hard to cut interest rates any further and whether laws of diminishing return apply to doses of quantitative easing. You can read the full report on what to expect here: New Look is seeking a three-year rent holiday on 68 of its stores and big rent reductions on hundreds of others as it battles to stay afloat and save the jobs of its 11,200 employees. The struggling fast-fashion chain is attempting to secure its second financial rescue deal in 18 months and, along with the payment holiday, is asking landlords to slash rents to 12% of current levels on a further 402 of its shops. You can read the full report here: The FTSE 100 has now lost 0.3% this morning, although Germany’s Dax and France’s Cac 40 are up by 0.5% and 0.2% respectively on a mixed day on financial markets. Currency markets are also fairly quiet, with the pound nudging up by barely 0.1% against the US dollar at $1.3160. The euro has dipped slightly against the dollar, down by 0.1% at €1.1818. Oil futures prices have dipped slightly as well. Brent crude futures have lost 0.2%, although they remain near recent highs at $45.78. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has confirmed that the option of three-month mortgage payment holidays for people hit by the pandemic will end on 31 October, but called on banks to continue to offer support to people struggling with debt. Borrowers will be able to take a first or second three-month payment deferral on their mortgage up until 31 October, when the guidance is expected to expire. After that, the FCA said it expects further help from banks to borrowers, such as extending the repayment term or restructuring of the mortgage, according to new draft guidance out for consultation. Where consumers need further short-term support, firms should offer arrangements for no or reduced payments for a specified period to give customers time to get back on track. The mortgage holiday was introduced amid the UK’s lockdown in order to prevent a wave of defaults from workers who were unable to work or had reduced pay during the furlough scheme. However, the FCA acknowledged that there is likely to be more financial pain ahead, and that some borrowers could face new difficulties in the months ahead. Many economists expect unemployment to rise significantly when the furlough scheme ends, also on 31 October. The FCA said. The majority of customers who have had a payment holiday are expected to resume full repayment. However, many will remain in financial difficulty. Christopher Woolard, interim chief executive at the FCA, said: It is important that consumers who can afford to resume mortgage payments should do so. However, we understand that borrowers facing payment difficulties because of the pandemic will continue to face uncertainty and may also experience temporary interruptions in income. We are proposing that firms contact their borrowers in good time before the end of a payment holiday, and work with them to come up with a tailored plan to help get them back on track. Firms should not take a ‘one size fits all’ approach. Screwfix is to open 30 stores in the UK and 10 in the Republic of Ireland creating more than 400 new jobs. The online tools and DIY kit specialist has 680 stores in the UK with a long-term target of 800 in the UK. It only has five stores in Ireland, all of which opened this year. But the business says it hope to open up to 40 stores in coming years. Despite the (buried) job losses, investors in Provident Financial are clearly happy with the results, and particularly with chief executive Malcolm Le May’s statement of confidence in its balance sheet: shares are up by 12.7%, making them the biggest riser on the FTSE 350 this morning. Provident has helped the mid-cap FTSE 250 index to a 0.4% gain this morning, outdoing the 0.2% decline on the large-cap FTSE 100. There are not any major moves on the FTSE 100, with software company Aveva the biggest riser. It’s up 2.9%, continuing the run of good form from yesterday, when it announced the $5bn (£3.8bn) purchase of California software company OSIsoft. Provident Financial, a lender to less wealthy borrowers, has revealed 300 job losses at the same time as reporting a £28m loss for the first six months of 2020. The owner of Vanquis Bank and Moneybarn said it would slash its customer service operations, combining two jobs into one with a lower base salary. In comments released alongside the results, chief executive Malcolm Le May heralded the company’s decision to pay back money received under the government’s job retention scheme, which supported the salaries of furloughed workers. However, he made no reference to the 300 redundant colleagues. The job losses came after a steep £37m loss from Provident’s consumer credit division, which includes the Satsuma and Provident home credit brands. The job losses announcement was buried 7,000 words into the statement published on Wednesday. It said: At the end of July, home credit launched a consultation period with a view to removing around 300 CEMs [customer experience managers] and customer service managers (CSMs). The proposal is to replace the CEMs/CSMs role with a new customer representative (‘CR’) role, reporting to business managers. The proposed CR role will also see the introduction of a higher level of variable remuneration. The UK is forecast to lose £22bn in spending as international tourism plummets, putting almost 3m jobs at risk, according to a report. The World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC) said the continuing uncertainty around travel restrictions designed to halt a resurgence in coronavirus cases is causing millions of overseas travellers and tourists to opt for staycations in their home countries instead. An impact assessment on the UK economy by the organisation estimates that the drop in international tourist numbers could result in the amount spent dropping by as much as 78%, or £420m a week. You can read the full report here: West Texas Intermediate futures prices have just nudged into positive territory for today, and are only a few cents shy of the five-month high. The picture over the last five months is of a vertiginous fall in prices as traders adjusted to lower demand for fuel during the pandemic, to a bounceback that has seen prices revert to levels that can be profitable for many traditional producers. However, prices remain well below the $65 per barrel level hit in early January, before the pandemic was known to have hit richer economies. Good morning, and welcome to our live coverage of business, economics and financial markets. North American oil prices have sustained five-month-high levels as producers brace for hurricanes that could prompt the biggest weather-related shutdown for 15 years - as well as fears for the potential human costs. Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the North American benchmark, hit highs of $43.57 per barrel on Tuesday, and have just about sustained those levels at about $43.27 at the time of writing. Before this week prices had not reached that level since the coronavirus pandemic triggered the price crash in March, followed by the historic negative prices in April. Brent crude futures, the North Sea benchmark, traded as high as $46.10 per barrel on Wednesday, just shy of a five-month high. Crude oil production has fallen to levels last seen during 2005’s Hurricane Katrina as producers brace for Hurricane Laura, and officials along the Texas and Louisiana coasts have ordered residents to move inland. Winds reaching 115 miles per hour are forecast. Reuters reported that oil producers on Tuesday had evacuated 310 offshore facilities and shut 1.56 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude output, 84% of Gulf of Mexico’s offshore production, near the 90% outage that Katrina brought 15 years ago. Analysts at Deutsche Bank led by Jim Reid wrote: The incoming arrival of Hurricane Laura to the United States [has] led to worries over potential fuel shortages. The National Hurricane Center warned that Laura would reach the northwestern Gulf Coast tonight, with the danger of life-threatening storm surges. Much of the oil production in the area has already been shut down, and there are obvious concerns of further damage to come. This map of the area from S&amp;P Global’s Platts shows just how much US oil capacity is concentrated in the Gulf of Mexico - and also the number of refineries which will not have any oil to process: Satellite pictures of the ocean tell their own story: Elsewhere on Wednesday, investors are mainly looking ahead to the Jackson Hole central bankers’ summit (albeit carried out this year by videoconference for obvious reasons). Bonds sold off overnight as investors look for riskier assets, although the traditional rotation of money into stock markets does not appear to have materialised this morning. Asian markets retreated despite US equity indices hitting new record highs last night.

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson got an angry response after telling school pupils that the exam results crisis was caused by a “mutant algorithm” and he was glad it had been “sorted out”. The National Education Union (NEU) called the prime minister “brazen” after he appeared to shrug off responsibility for the fiasco. Johnson was giving a speech to students on Wednesday at Castle Rock school in Coalville, Leicestershire. As well as welcoming them back to school and reassuring them it was safe, he said: “I’m afraid your grades were almost derailed by a mutant algorithm and I know how stressful that must’ve been for pupils up and down the country.” He added: “I’m very, very glad that it has finally been sorted out.” This month, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, ditched the algorithm for moderating A-level and GCSE grades in England after a week-long outcry from pupils, parents and teachers. Days earlier, Johnson had said the results were “dependable” and “robust”. Even after the U-turn, Nick Gibb, the schools minister, said of the algorithm: “The model was a good model, and we continued to refine it.” Kevin Courtney, a joint general secretary of the NEU, criticised Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, saying: “It is brazen of the prime minister to idly shrug away a disaster that his own government created. “Parents, students, teachers and heads will be horrified to see the leader of this country treat his own exams fiasco like some minor passing fad. The public will not easily forget the emotional rollercoaster of this year’s results season. It is certain to put a long-lasting dent in the government’s reputation on education.” The shadow justice secretary, David Lammy, tweeted: “Boris Johnson just told schoolchildren their grades were ‘almost derailed by a mutant algorithm’. Could someone please gently remind him of the identity of the prime minister who is supposed to be in charge?” The algorithm was devised by the exams regulator Ofqual in accordance with Williamson’s instruction to avoid grade inflation after the coronavirus pandemic caused the closure of schools and the cancellation of exams. Ofqual’s chief executive, Sally Collier, resigned on Tuesday."

While relatively new in Australia, this talking point is months old. It first surfaced in the US, championed by a range of rightwing commentators. US virus researcher Anthony Fauci dismissed the suggestion the US death toll had been overstated in this way as a “conspiracy theory”. On the level of principle, asking whether these people were already so unwell that they would have died anyway, whether or not they had Covid-19, is a reasonable consideration. Of course we should be precise and accurate in capturing the risk and harm of Covid-19. If someone is killed in a car accident, whether they had the virus or not is irrelevant. Their death shouldn’t be added to the Covid-19 deaths. These kinds of deaths aren’t being counted in Australia. The Communicable Diseases Network Australia’s guidelines define a Covid-19 death as “a death in a probable or confirmed Covid-19 case, unless there is a clear alternative cause of death that cannot be related to Covid-19 (eg trauma). There should be no period of complete recovery from Covid-19 between illness and death”. This is the sense in which a distinction between dying “with” and dying “from” Covid-19 is reasonable. It’s the way in which Victorian premier Daniel Andrews used it when discussing Australia’s youngest Covid-19 related death. He said: “We are talking about the youngest person that has died of this virus, or at least with this virus,” leaving open for the coroner the option of exploring other possible causes of death. However, this isn’t the way that rightwing agitators want to use the distinction. They’re concerned with cases where a death can be related to Covid-19 but can’t solely be attributed to it because of other health factors in play. For them, the only way you can die from Covid-19 is if it’s the only thing that can plausibly be said to kill you. This is an unusual claim. We don’t think that way about any other event. When we describe the deaths that emerged from the second world war, we include those who died from starvation who would have otherwise survived. When we measure alcohol related deaths, we include those who died from drink-driving. Similarly, we should consider that people whose existing conditions were exacerbated by Covid-19 to the point where they died, to have died from the virus. And yet, despite the ease with which we can dismiss the argument, there’s something more revealing at play here. The grammatical distinction of dying with v dying from hides a much more serious distinction that informs what’s going on here. Namely, a distinction between deaths that matter and deaths that don’t. In my view, the reason those who advocate in favour of the from/with distinction are doing so is because they want people to see that those who merely died of Covid-19 are irrelevant to any analysis of the costs and benefits of a lockdown. For them, if Covid-19 only killed you because you were already pretty unwell, then you were probably going to die soon anyway. Sad, yes. But not as sad as if someone “healthy” were to die. Moving on from the from/with distinction, in May, UNSW economist Gigi Forster, one of the loudest opponents to coronavirus restrictions, argued that our weighing of lives lost to Covid-19 is misleading because it doesn’t account for age. Those who have died are “predominantly the lives of older people with a few years, not an entire life, left to live”. It is correct that standard economic approaches would factor in age, as well as other factors such as disability and health conditions. They wouldn’t count lives, they would count “quality-adjusted life years”. From this health economics standpoint, once you’re of a certain age, or below a certain health threshold, your years of life simply matter less than those of healthier, younger people. According to this approach, while all lives are worth living, not all lives are equally worth saving. However, the fact this is a well-established practice does not make it a good one. Like any algorithm, it carries the appearance of objectivity while being laden with subjective, biased and ideological claims. Limiting our counting of Covid-19 mortalities to those who were previously in the peak of health is to court a widespread, deep and ruinous belief. Namely, that at some point on the spectrum of age and health, your status changes from “living” to “waiting to die”. And if you were already on the waitlist, is it so bad if you get there a bit faster? This kind of thinking is cruelly unimaginative. It’s easy to assume – especially if you’re scoring a perfect 1.0 on the quality of life scale – that if someone is unable to enjoy all the things that give you a sense of vitality, then as alive as they might be, they’re not really living anymore. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote that, “To live is not to breathe but to act. It is to make use of our organs, our senses, our faculties, of all the parts of ourselves which give us the sentiment of our existence. The man who has lived the most is not he who has counted the most years but he who has most felt life.” It would be easy to take Rousseau to be glorifying youthful vitality and the robustness of life. However, that too would be unimaginative. Instead, we should read him as inviting us to think of a “full life” as one in which we acknowledge, appreciate and experience the full range of the human condition. Instead of using accounting techniques to explain what’s wrong with ageing and illness, we could use the lived experience of those who are ill and aged to learn what’s wrong with us. Rousseau’s passage ends by saying, “men have been buried at one hundred who have died at their birth”. It’s worth considering what it would take to be considered dead in this way. I can’t speak for Rousseau, but I reckon one candidate is the person who is willing to understate the importance of someone else’s life as a way of protecting their own. • Matt Beard is an Australian moral philosopher, fellow at the Ethics Centre and a regular writer on philosophy and ethics"

          "headline": "From face masks to Covid testing: 11 times the UK government has U-turned",
          "bodyText": "The list of U-turns carried out by Boris Johnson’s government in its response to Covid-19 continues to grow. After apparent failures on the contact-tracing app and a change of heart on school opening dates and A-level results, face masks have become the latest issue in the spotlight. Here are of some of the government’s missteps so far: 25 August: face masks in schools After hundreds of schools prepared to defy official Public Health England advice, which said it “does not recommend” face masks in schools, Boris Johnson made an 11th-hour U-turn on the issue days before classrooms were due to reopen. In lockdown areas with extra restrictions, wearing face coverings will become mandatory in school corridors where social distancing is difficult, and in other areas of England headteachers will have discretion over school policy. The move came after pressure from teachers around the country who urged their use, and following Scotland’s announcement that secondary school pupils should wear masks in communal areas. 17 August: A-level and GCSE results The government was forced to act after A-level grades were downgraded through a controversial algorithm developed by the Office of Qualifications and Examinations Regulation, leading to almost 40 % of grades awarded being worse than expected by pupils, parents and teachers. Despite the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, initially saying there would be “no U-turn, no change” to the system, A-level students and GCSE students – who are due to receive their results this Thursday – will now be able to use the predicted grades awarded to them by teachers instead. Williamson said he was sorry for the distress caused to young people. 10 August: local contact tracers After months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model and hiring more than 18,000 tracers, the government appears to have conceded that a regional approach may be needed to respond to the pandemic. Local authorities had argued for months they had the expertise through their existing public health tracing teams, but it was only in August that the government decided to offer regional teams more support. The changes also mean the axing of 6,000 national call handlers by the end of August. 18 June: contact-tracing app The government was forced to abandon its coronavirus contact-tracing app, which it had been developing for three months and poured millions of pounds into, despite experts repeatedly warning that the app would not work. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who previously said the app would be ready for nationwide rollout in mid-May after being trialled on the Isle of Wight, explained that the NHS would switch to a decentralised alternative designed by the US tech firms Apple and Google. 16 June: school meal vouchers Boris Johnson announced that the government would be providing food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. It came just 24 hours after No 10 had rejected his plea for it to keep paying for the £15-a-week vouchers over the summer. 9 June: reopening schools The government’s goal was for all primary school children in England to be back in class for a month before the summer holiday. Earlier this month, however, Williamson admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September. 3 June: MP voting Johnson announced the government would allow shielding MPs to vote by proxy after an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions. Those with disabilities said they felt they were being disenfranchised. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, firmly refused to endorse a proxy voting system and that MPs should instead be paired. Within days of Rees-Mogg’s comments, Johnson announced the change at prime minister’s questions. 21 May: visa surcharge In the first major U-turn of his premiership, Johnson announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. He had rejected calls to scrap it at PMQs the day before. 20 May: bereavement scheme A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who die from Covid-19 was extended to low-paid workers after their exclusion attracted widespread criticism. The scheme, introduced in April, initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers. 12 May: face coverings A fortnight after stressing that the evidence was weak on the benefits of face coverings, the government changed its advice to say they should be worn in enclosed spaces and on public transport. It later went further, with a new rule imposed on 15 June that anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering. 12 March: testing in the community The government stopped testing in the community on 12 March and retreated to testing principally in hospitals, according to a damning letter MPs sent to Johnson. The science and technology committee wrote in May that the consequences had been that care home residents and carers could not be tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant”. The government announced plans to rapidly scale up testing at the beginning of April, when Hancock pledged 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of that month."

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson’s U-turn on Tuesday evening in which he dropped guidance against face masks in schools came just hours after Nicola Sturgeon said Scottish secondary school pupils should wear masks in communal areas and on school buses. It was just the latest in a run of instances where England followed Scotland in adopting more stringent rules, often after claiming there was little evidence to do so: Mass gatherings Scotland banned mass gatherings of more than 500 people on 12 March but the UK government did not follow suit immediately. Johnson had even played down the importance of banning mass gatherings, suggesting Scotland’s decision reflected the lack of resilience of its emergency services. “The scientific advice, as we’ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread,” he said. However, scores of events had already been cancelled unilaterally by most major sports, music promoters and even by Buckingham Palace. School closures Schools in Scotland and Wales announced they were to close on 18 March, with Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, saying schools had lost too many staff to continue as normal. It was widely expected that England would follow immediately afterwards and school closures were announced by Gavin Williamson several hours later – though the move was already in train. Face masks in shops Scotland made face coverings mandatory in shops from 10 July but UK government ministers set out several contradictory positions before announcing the measure in England, four days after Scotland’s new rule came into force. It was preceded by a weekend of indecision, with Michael Gove saying it should not be compulsory but people should be trusted to use their common sense, only then to be contradicted by Johnson who said people “should be wearing” face coverings inside shops to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. A day later, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, announced the change. Exams algorithm The Scottish government backtracked on grades awarded by an algorithm which hit almost 76,000 pupils by downgrading one or more of their results, mostly those from poorer backgrounds. The Scottish government’s education secretary, John Swinney, apologised to the young people whose predicted grades were reduced and said the government “got this wrong”. Yet a similar system was used weeks later in England which resulted in almost 40% of pupils having grades lowered. Days later, the UK government also made a humiliating U-turn, despite defending the system."

          "bodyText": "My friend and colleague Frank Odds, who has died aged 74, was a world authority on medical mycology – the study of fungi with reference to medicine. For 15 years he was director of bacteriology and mycology at the Janssen Research Foundation in Belgium, where he helped in the development of drugs for the treatment of fungal infections. He also wrote a book, Candida and Candidosis (1988), which remains a defining text on the subject, and had a successful academic career working at Leeds University, the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta and the universities of Leicester and Aberdeen. Frank was born in Paignton in Devon, where his father, also named Frank, was a chief engineer in the Royal Navy and his mother, Nellie (nee Jones), was a housewife. As a teenager at King Edward VI grammar school in Totnes, he devised a geometric algorithm called “spirolaterals”, which has since gone on to be used architecturally and in design, as well as in mathematical education. After a degree in biochemistry at Leeds, followed by a PhD there, he became a visiting fellow at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta (1970–72), before returning to the UK for a postdoctoral fellowship at Leeds (1972–75). From there he took up his first faculty role as lecturer and then became a senior lecturer in medical microbiology at Leicester (1975–89) before moving to the Janssen Research Foundation in 1992. Seven years later he returned to academia as professor of medical mycology at Aberdeen, where he helped to establish the Aberdeen Fungal Group as a pre-eminent presence in mycology, and where he retired in 2009. He served as president of the British Society for Medical Mycology, the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology and the European Confederation of Medical Mycology, and was chair of the Wellcome Trust immunology and infectious disease grant panel, as well as on various editorial boards of international journals. Outside work he was an excellent pianist. In 1978 he married Ali Bird, and she survives him, along with three children, Jo, Kathy and Graham, and three grandchildren, Malcolm, Fraser and Jessica."

News of her departure came hours after the education select committee announced she had been called to give evidence to MPs on the exams debacle at a hearing next Wednesday. An education source said: “She knew she’d reached the end of the line.” Collier, the chief regulator and Ofqual chief executive, oversaw the development of the flawed exams algorithm that was scrapped after it downgraded nearly 40% of A-level results. The algorithm was created after ministers insisted on avoiding grade inflation. • Trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine may have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year – but it will then need to go through the regulatory process, scientists say. Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it was “just possible” there may be enough clinical trial data on the vaccine to put before the regulators this year. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, has said a vaccine may not be ready until next winter. Pollard suggested they were hoping to go faster. We’re wrapping up the UK liveblog now but you can continue to follow our coverage of UK and global developments here. Thanks for reading. The EU’s trade commissioner has said he broke no public health regulations governing the pandemic while in Ireland. Phil Hogan, whose role makes him of key interest to British government officials pursuing post-Brexit trade talks, provided 20 pages of documents to the head of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, after she requested further details of his trip home earlier this month. The former Irish government official said he believed he complied with rules designed to limit the spread of coronavirus in the country. Hogan was among 81 guests who attended a controversial golf dinner in the west of Ireland. He returned to the Republic on 31 July and was required to restrict his movements for 14 days. In a document published on the European commission website, Hogan said he tested negative for Covid-19 while in hospital for treatment on 5 August and claimed that “ended the self-restriction period”. He told the Irish broadcaster RTÉ: I am satisfied, arising from the test that I did that proved it was negative, that I was no risk to anybody. Because of the fact that I had a negative test. Because my medical people said I was no risk to anybody. I checked with the Citizens Information website which is funded by the HSE and I felt that I was no risk to anybody by going to Adare. I understand the perception. I was covered by the regulations that my work-related activities and under the regulation there is a reasonable excuse mechanism that allowed me the exemption to do that. The “eat out to help out” scheme encouraged more people into UK restaurants last week, taking the total number of meals claimed since the beginning of August to more than 64m – the equivalent of one for nearly every person in the country. The figures released by HM Revenue &amp; Customs suggest the scheme – where diners can claim a half-price discount up to a maximum of £10 per head on food and non-alcoholic drink on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays in August – has provided a much-needed boost for the embattled hospitality sector. Ahead of the end of the scheme next week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the figures demonstrated how popular it had been so far, with 10.5m meals claimed in the first week, rising to 35m in the second and 64m by the third. Autistic children need time to prepare for changes on wearing face coverings within schools, a charity has said, after Boris Johnson hinted at a U-turn on the policy. Tim Nicholls, the head of policy and public affairs at the National Autistic Society, said face coverings in schools would be another “unexpected change” for autistic children. Secondary school pupils in Scotland will be required to wear face coverings in between lessons from Monday, while the prime minister suggested there could be a change to the current advice for schools in England. The current guidance says face coverings are not recommended, but Boris Johnson told reporters: “If we need to change the advice then of course we will.” Nicholls said wearing a mask could feel suffocating and overwhelming for some pupils with autism, while others may have difficulty understanding why it was required. “They are going back to schools that look and feel incredibly different from when they were last there,” he told the PA Media news agency. Parliamentary authorities have been accused of censorship after refusing to accept a charity’s petition highlighting non-Covid patients not receiving NHS care during the pandemic. Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA) submitted the petition in June. It said that NHS England’s decision in March to restrict most normal care, so that hospitals could focus on the influx of Covid patients, “has meant access even to urgent diagnostic procedures and treatment for non-covid conditions has been severely restricted, putting lives at risk”. But parliament’s petition team, which decides which proposals are hosted online, rejected AvMA’s petition, saying that reopening NHS services now that the pandemic has subsided is not a matter for ministers. It said: “We can’t accept your petition because the UK government aren’t responsible for the issue you raise. This is an operational matter for the NHS.” Government ministers have been told they still have questions to answer over this summer’s grading chaos, following the resignation of the Ofqual chief regulator in the wake of the A-level and GCSE results U-turn in England. Sally Collier will be replaced by her predecessor Dame Glenys Stacey, the exams regulator said. In a statement on Tuesday, Ofqual said Collier had decided “that the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership”. However, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said questions still remained for ministers over what went wrong, and the National Education Union (NEU) said issues “run far deeper than the actions of one chief executive”. The Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, accused the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, of letting someone else “take the blame” for what had happened, and reiterated a call for him to resign. The education select committee has said Ofqual representatives will appear in front of MPs on 2 September, while Williamson is due before the committee on 16 September. The committee chairman, Robert Halfon, said Collier had agreed to appear in front of MPs before her resignation and he hoped she still would. Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the ASCL said Collier’s resignation “follows the failure of the statistical model that led to this year’s grading fiasco, but the fault is not hers alone”. He added: Ministers have questions to answer over the extent to which they scrutinised and challenged the methodology and reliability of the statistical model, particularly given the enormity of the task and the importance of getting it right. The ASCL has written to Williamson to request an “immediate independent review to rapidly establish what happened and what went wrong”. Barton added: “We believe that public confidence has been so badly damaged that full transparency is essential.” The NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: Sally Collier had no option but to follow through Michael Gove’s reforms of GCSEs and A-levels, which set up many of the problems of 2020. We have no sure way of knowing where the balance of fault lies, but we can be quite certain that Gavin Williamson gave direction to Ofqual that there should not be grade inflation and all candidates should get a fair grade. He must have known that both those directions are incompatible. There have been a further 1,184 Covid-19 cases recorded in the UK, and 16 more deaths, Public Health England has confirmed after technical problems with the online Covid-19 dashboard, which is failing to load data. This takes the total number of recorded cases to 327,798 and the total number of fatalities to 41,449. The coronavirus pandemic has led to a dip in the number of cancer patients in England being treated with radiotherapy, a charity has said. New analysis by Macmillan Cancer Support found that the number of people in England receiving radiotherapy for one of five common types of cancer dropped 24% in April. There were around 3,500 records of people with breast, prostate, lung, bladder or oesophageal cancer having radiotherapy in April this year, compared with around 4,600 in April 2019. Radiotherapy data from Public Health England’s national cancer registration and analysis service showed the figures increased in May when there were 4,800 records of people with these types of cancer having radiotherapy. But the figure was still 14% down on last year, according to the Macmillan analysis. Sara Bainbridge, the head of policy and influence at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: For many people living with cancer there has never been a scarier time to face a diagnosis and any disruption to treatment like this only adds to the worry that so many patients and their loved ones are already experiencing. We urgently need to see the recovery plan promised by the government to make sure cancer services can deliver care as quickly and safely as possible. There is a lot of work to be done and the scale of the challenge must also be addressed by securing more staffing and resources. We cannot let cancer become the “forgotten C” during this pandemic. In further research, Jo’s Cervical Cancer found that minority ethnic women are less likely than white women to attend cervical cancer screenings during the pandemic. Figures from the charity, published by the Guardian, show that black, Asian and minority ethnic women (BAME) are twice as likely (20%) to be strongly worried about contracting the virus at a cervical cancer screening than white women (9.4%). Two in five BAME women (39.6%) said they would feel unsafe visiting a doctor’s surgery at the moment compared with 27.2% of white women, according to a poll of 2,000 women. And 17.3% of women with BAME heritage said they believe that delaying cervical cancer screening is the safest thing to do at the moment, compared with 8.1% of white women. Coronavirus restrictions in parts of northern England are expected to continue when the government reviews existing measures later this week, but will be more tightly targeted and focus on smaller areas. People in Oldham in Greater Manchester, and in specific wards in Pendle and Blackburn in Lancashire were told not to socialise with anyone outside their household from midnight on Saturday. They were also advised to only use public transport if essential and numbers attending weddings, civil partnerships and funerals were restricted to up to 20. Council chiefs in Blackburn welcomed the announcement after they campaigned for a targeted approach at a “really local level” and said resources and efforts could be concentrated on the places that needed it most. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) also lifted restrictions in Wigan, Rossendale and Darwen, bringing them in line with the rest of England. The next announcement by the DHSC on restrictions in the “northern area of intervention” is due to take place after a meeting on Thursday of the Joint Biosecurity Centre (JBC) chaired by the health and social care secretary, Matt Hancock, and England’s chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty. Local councils and MPs are expected to make their recommendations to the JBC by Wednesday over where, if any, restrictions should be imposed in their local areas. The Tory leader of Bolton council has called on the government to lift restrictions in the borough. Councillor David Greenhalgh said: According to recently produced data, we have seen this week’s data for Bolton now at 12.9 per 100,000 new confirmed cases, showing Bolton over the past three weeks with a downward trajectory and way outside those authorities that are areas of concern on government lists. We have seen our neighbours in Wigan taken out of GM (Greater Manchester) restrictions and it is now time for Bolton to follow suit, and the figures and data support this. Mohammed Iqbal, the leader of Pendle council, criticised the extra restrictions imposed in the borough as the number of Covid-19 cases continued to fall. He said: We are not signed up to extra government restrictions. This is not what Pendle needs right now. What we do need is extra support from the government, including financial support to ensure the safety messages and rules for Pendle reach everyone. Last week Hancock said: “Our approach is to make the action we take as targeted as possible, with the maximum possible local consensus. “To do that we are introducing a new process to increase engagement between local leaders, both councils and MPs, with the aim of taking as targeted action as possible. “This will allow local councils to focus resources on to the wards which need more targeted intervention in order to drive infection rates down, and gives local people a stronger voice at the table.” The Guardian’s deputy political editor is reporting that a number of Tory MPs are concerned about a possible government U-turn on masks in schools as Boris Johnson comes under growing pressure to review Public Health England advice which “does not recommend them”. “Several are strongly opposed and want concerns conveyed to Number 10,” Jessica Elgot has tweeted. Scientists believe a 75-year-old woman from Nottinghamshire was the first known person to catch coronavirus in the UK and the earliest to die from it, as research shows the disease was circulating widely in communities in early February. Samples analysed by the University of Nottingham show the unnamed woman, who had an underlying health condition, tested positive for the virus on 21 February. She was admitted to Queen’s medical centre (QMC), in Nottingham, and died on 3 March, two days earlier than the first recorded Covid-19 death in the UK. Her positive coronavirus test results were not returned until 16 March, almost two weeks after her death. Previously, the first case caught in the UK was believed to be a man in Surrey who was reported to have tested positive on 28 February. Scientists retrospectively analysed samples from the QMC hospital dating back to January, and discovered the virus had been circulating in the area between early February and March. Their study said this was undetected at the time because the government was restrictive both in its definition of coronavirus symptoms, and over who could be tested. Read the full story here: The National Deaf Children’s Society said that schools and colleges must be ready to meet the needs of deaf pupils by doing things such as investing in clear masks. As speculation builds that the government may be about to make a policy U-turn, paving the way for near-mandatory use of face coverings in English schools, the organisation said the use of face masks in education would have serious consequences for the UK’s 50,000 deaf children. Ian Noon, the chief policy adviser of the National Deaf Children’s Society, said: For many, there may be little benefit in even attending school or college because they won’t understand their teachers and classmates, with loneliness and isolation a tragic result. Public health must always be the priority, so if face masks are introduced, schools and colleges must be ready to meet deaf pupils’ needs by investing in clear face masks, making every reasonable adjustment possible and urgently discussing the best way forward with specialist teachers, parents and deaf pupils themselves. Education is a right, not a privilege, and this does not change because you’re deaf. A mother has said she will not send her son to school if rules in England are not changed, and he is not allowed to wear a mask. Amid increasing pressure, Boris Johnson has hinted that guidance which says face coverings are not required for schoolchildren in England could be changed, with some reports saying a U-turn has already been agreed by the government. Debra Kidd, 52, is from Saddleworth, near Oldham, Greater Manchester, where additional lockdown measures are currently in place amid a rise in coronavirus cases. She told the PA Media news agency her son Sam, 13, had been told by Saddleworth school that children would not be required to wear masks and would be expected to remove them at the front gates. “We’ve complained about this and the school says it is following government guidance,” she said. “Our position is that if he can’t wear a mask, he’s not going back.” Virgin Atlantic says it has reached “a significant milestone in safeguarding its future” after creditors voted to approve a £1.2bn bailout. The vote was a key part of a court-sanctioned process being used by the airline to implement the deal. It warned earlier this month it could run out of money by the end of September if the rescue package was rejected. The company said in a statement: Today, Virgin Atlantic has reached a significant milestone in safeguarding its future, securing the overwhelming support of all four creditor classes, including 99% support from trade creditors who voted in favour of the plan. The next step is an English high court hearing on September 2 to sanction the restructuring plan. Phil Hogan, the European trade commissioner who is battling to save his job, has sent the European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, a 20-page summary of his movements during the period he breached lockdown rules in Ireland. Hogan, a former Irish minister whose role at the commission makes him a key figure in post-Brexit trade deal talks between the EU and the UK, has apologised for attending an event in his home country that may have breached Covid-19 regulations but he remains under pressure. Von der Leyen requested detailed of his movements. The commission has published details of a memo from Hogan here, but holes are already being picked in the details provided. Five patients on a cancer ward in Northern Ireland have tested positive for Covid-19. It is the second cluster of infections at Craigavon Area hospital in Co Armagh. A member of staff has tested positive and three close staff contacts are self-isolating as a precaution, the Southern health and social care trust said. It added: “Covid-19 is rising again in our community. We urgently appeal to everyone to wash their hands, cover their face and maintain social distancing. The ward is closed to admissions. Trust staff are working closely with the Public Health Agency to manage the situation. Trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine may have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year – but it will then need to go through the regulatory process, scientists say. Prof Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, said it is “just possible” that there may be enough clinical trial data on Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine to put before the regulators this year. Prof Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, has said a vaccine may not be ready until next winter. Pollard suggested they were hoping to go faster. “I think that Chris Whitty is quite rightly being cautious, that it could take as long as that to first of all demonstrate a vaccine works and is safe and then to go through the processes of regulators looking at that very carefully to make sure everything’s been done correctly,” Pollard told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Students have begun receiving their BTec grades, a week after exam board Pearson withdrew some and delayed the publication of others to give itself time to recalculate scores in the week of the A-level exam results fiasco. About 200,000 people who had taken the level one and two vocational qualifications were told last week, just hours before results day, that they would not be receiving them on time. A further 250,000 level-three grades, which had already been awarded, were also reassessed. It came after an outcry over A-level and GCSE results led to the scrapping of an algorithm that had calculated pupils’ grades in lieu of exams. After the algorithm downgraded the results of many pupils from the estimates given by their teachers, while apparently favouring pupils from private schools, pupils held multiple protests with many calling for the resignation of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. Boris Johnson is facing fresh calls to meet bereaved families who lost their loved ones during the coronavirus pandemic. The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group said they have asked for meetings with the prime minister on four occasions. Earlier this month, the all-party parliamentary group on Coronavirus heard from bereaved families who said they felt they are being “swept under the carpet” by the government. The APPG chairwoman, Liberal Democrat Layla Moran, wrote to the prime minister and said she was shocked to learn that he had “refused” to meet the group - which represents 1,450 families. Commenting on the letter, Jo Goodman, who lost her father, Stuart, after he was diagnosed with Covid-19 aged 72, said: The prime minister has refused to meet bereaved families four times now. This isn’t about pointing fingers or laying blame, so we don’t know why Boris Johnson won’t meet with us. We can only hope that the prime minister listens to the APPG and finally does the right thing by meeting with bereaved families. We just don’t want others to go through the same pain we have. The Co-operative Bank became the latest major British employer to announce redundancies on Tuesday as it said it would part ways with around 350 members of staff. Last week, more than 7,700 major job losses were announced at big British employers. It comes as the Office for National Statistics said 730,000 people have been taken off payrolls since the beginning of the crisis in March. You can read back over full coverage of today’s latest grim economic and business news on our business live blog here on a day when hopes of a swift recovery suffered some serious blows. A piece of news now that - for a significant section of the population - might be as important as anything else today. The Great British Bake Off will look as it always does when it returns to screens due to the cast and crew living and filming “in a bubble”, a Channel 4 executive has said. Production of the 11th series was initially delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but filming on the popular show finished last week. Kelly Webb-Lamb, deputy director of programmes and head of popular factual for Channel 4, explained during a controller session at Edinburgh’s Television Festival that the “enormous” feat of getting the show back on air was due to stringent health and safety measures. She said: “The feat of getting Bake Off back was enormous and enormously important. The head of England’s exam regulator, Sally Collier, has resigned over the exams fiasco that has engulfed schools and universities. Collier, the chief regulator and Ofqual chief executive, oversaw the development of the flawed exams algorithm that was scrapped after it downgraded nearly 40% of A-level results. It came after ministers insisted on avoiding grade inflation. She had been conspicuous by her absence since the U-turn on results last week, with Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, issuing a public apology instead. Collier’s resignation comes days after the publication of millions of GCSE results and a day after Gavin Williamson insisted Ofqual had his “full confidence”. He had previously refused to back Collier. Amid speculation that the government has already signed off on a U-turn on its masks policy in English schools, the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, has added his voice to calls for the government to to take World Health Organization (WHO) advice on board. “The World Health Organization has advised children over 12 to wear a face covering where they can’t socially distance, and as more countries are introducing them in school corridors and communal areas, it’s important that lessons are learned,” said Khan. “I have continually called on government to respond to the latest health advice and my team are speaking with officials in Scotland to ensure we have the most up-to-date advice ahead of our schools returning.” Public Health England and the Department for Education have both signed off on a new policy that will make the wearing of face masks near-mandatory in communal areas of secondary schools in England, the TES reports, citing sources. An announcement could come as early as today, the same sources say. Downing Street probably hoped Dominic Cummings’ family would not provide any more headaches after the furore prompted by Boris Johnson’s adviser’s lockdown dash to his parents’ Durham farm this year. But, in a fresh blow to No 10, the top aide’s father-in-law has reportedly said Johnson will stand down as prime minister in six months. The claim – strenuously denied by Downing Street – was apparently delivered by Sir Humphry Wakefield to a visitor to the family’s 13th-century Grade I-listed Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, last week. The 84-year-old baronet, father of Cummings’ wife, Mary, told visitor Anna Silverman the PM was still struggling badly after having coronavirus and would step down in six months, according to a report in the Times. Wakefield, a lifelong horse rider, is said to have likened the virus to being “gone in the fetlock”, a horse’s joint. “If you put a horse back to work when it’s injured it will never recover,” he reportedly said. No 10 dismissed the claim as “utter nonsense”. Wakefield could not be reached for comment. Labour is calling for the use of face masks in secondary schools, citing a “growing body of evidence that the use of face masks in communal areas in secondary schools helps protect students and staff and drive down transmission”. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green said a change in advice was needed quickly. “The prime minister must listen to this evidence and act quickly to give certainty to parents and teachers who are just days away from schools reopening,” she said. “The last thing concerned parents and pupils need is another last minute U-turn from this government that throws school plans into chaos.” More from the official stats authority, while we await more updates on the possibility that schoolchildren will be asked to wear face coverings when they return next month. The proportion of people who believe Britain will be united after the coronavirus pandemic has halved in three months, figures suggest. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) surveyed 12,630 adults between 24 April and 28 June about their perceptions of unity and division in Britain. Over the period as a whole, 46% of adults on average thought that Britain will be united after society has recovered from Covid-19. At the start of the period, a higher proportion of people felt Britain would be “very or somewhat” united after the pandemic than felt this way at the end of the period. In the first week of the survey period more than half (57%) felt the UK would be more united, falling to 28% in the final week. Exactly half of female respondents believed this compared with 41% of men. Deaths in the UK have risen above average levels for the first time since mid-June, official statistics show, but coronavirus is not thought to be behind the rise. The high temperatures of the heatwave earlier this month are most likely behind the recent increase, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. In the week ending 14 August, there were 9,392 deaths from all causes in England and Wales – 447 more than the previous week. This took the number of deaths that week to 3.4% above the average for this time of year over the past five years – the first time the average has been exceeded since June. Meanwhile, deaths involving coronavirus have been steadily falling. There were 139 deaths registered in the week ending 14 August that mentioned “novel coronavirus”, an 8.6% fall from the 152 deaths recorded in the previous week. The ONS said: “The rise in deaths between weeks 32 and 33 coincided with high temperatures in England and Wales, and heatwave warnings were issued by NHS England.” There have been no further reported deaths of people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Wales, health officials have said. The total number of deaths in the country since the beginning of the pandemic remains at 1,593. Public Health Wales said the total number of coronavirus cases had increased by 28, bringing total cases in Wales to 17,774. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, said he hoped to make an announcement on whether children would be made to wear face coverings when they returned to school by tomorrow evening. “Scotland have made a change in their arrangements after their schools had essentially been open for two weeks,” he said during the Welsh government’s coronavirus press briefing. “I would much rather that we’re in a position where if there’s going to be any change, including if that change is just around guidance as opposed to mandating anything, that we’re able to do so by the end of tomorrow so we’re not looking to make a decision late in the week when there’s a bank holiday weekend just before schools are due to reopen.” The Tory chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, has called for “more clarity” on face coverings ahead of schools returning. He told BBC Radio 4’s World at One programme: Clearly at the moment the science in England is that masks are not required. I think it would be worth perhaps a bit more reassurance from the chief medical officer to explain the reasons for this, to [help] teachers and parents and students going back to school. Having said that, perhaps it might be better just to leave these decisions in terms of PPE, particularly with masks, to the headteachers of individual schools. He went on: “I think if the chief medical officer has set out the reasons why masks weren’t necessary and the science behind it. I think that would reassure a lot of people in education and parents wondering or not whether they’re needed when they send their children back to school next week.” I’m Amy Walker, taking over from my colleague Ben Quinn while he takes a break. I’ll be keeping you up to date with all the key coronavirus developments from the UK for the next hour or so. Two more “Nightingale” courts have started to hear cases in efforts to clear the backlog exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) headquarters in Westminster and a former court building in Fleetwood, Lancashire, opened on Monday. A press conference room in the government building at 102 Petty France has been converted into a court room and will hear cases from east and west London family courts. In Fleetwood, the building will hear civil or family cases listed for Preston or Blackpool magistrates courts. It comes after Nightingale courts opened in Swansea, Middlesbrough, Hertfordshire and Telford last week. There are 10 in total so far, with two in Leeds and Peterborough yet to open. Not everything has been as transparent or as smooth as one might have hoped however. Here was the experience of the new arrangements yesterday of the Evening Standard’s courts correspondent. The Welsh health minister, Vaughan Gething, has issued a stern warning against traditional pub crawls and stag and hen parties following a rise in coronavirus cases in Cardiff. Gething stopped short of putting a limit on the number of venues people should go to but he stressed that every visit to a new pub or bar was another chance for Covid to be transmitted. He said: “At this point in time there isn’t a need to close pubs and restaurants. This depends on the behaviour of all of us. This is a choice about how we behave to keep coronavirus at bay for all of us.” There have been 47 positive tests in the last week - 37% of all cases in Wales. Public health officials said many of the new cases were among people between the ages of 20 and 30. Gething hinted that hospitality venues faced being shut before schools, adding: The government has been very clear in Wales that we won’t close schools if other areas are driving infection rates. We will take other action first before we go to the possibility of school closures. People need to consider the choices they are making. We don’t want to stop people enjoying themselves. We want people to enjoy themselves within the rules. More people going to more venues is more of a risk. I recognise it’s difficult. It’s an appeal to our common sense. Gething said that Welsh authorities had not said there is a limit to the number of places to go to but that people need to limit contact with others. The way I would have enjoyed drinking with my friends in my 20s is an entirely different place to where we are now. Facebook has recruited 10 former policy officials since the start of last year, adding to suspicions that technology firms are trying to develop a closer relationship to the government. The Times reported that officials left roles in government and with regulators to work on policy and communications for Facebook. Whitehall watchers said there is usually a “mini exodus” of staff from key departments in the weeks and months after a general election, but rarely as many as 10 civil servants departing to the same company. Senior Conservative MPs said that Facebook was seeking to limit regulations before they were introduced. Julian Knight, the Tory chairman of the Commons committee on digital, culture, media and sport, told The Times that the public “have a right to question the cosy relationship between government and big tech at all levels”. Facebook said their policy teams play a key role in developing and applying Facebook’s policies such as our community standards — which set out what is and isn’t allowed on their platforms. Questioned about the exam results fiasco, Johnson added that in hindsight, the government “might have done some things differently”. He told reporters that those who had done their A-levels and GCSEs this year, had been “in many ways a remarkable generation”. They’ve had to stay at home, which has been difficult, it has posed risks, as I say, to their health, to their mental health, they’ve done a fantastic job, they’ve protected the NHS, they’ve helped to save lives, to get us through this pandemic and I’m just pleased that they now do have results that they can work with. And yes, you know if we had to do it again, we might have done some things differently, I’m certainly not going to deny that. But they’ve got a series of results that they can certainly work with and use to develop their careers. Guidance saying that face coverings are not required in England’s schools could be altered if the medical advice changed, according to the prime minister. Boris Johnson told reporters: “On the issue of whether or not to wear masks in some contexts - you know, we’ll look at the the changing medical evidence as we go on. If we need to change the advice then of course we will.” Asked why the UK government was ignoring World Health Organization (WHO) advice that children aged over 12 should wear masks, he said: “The overwhelming priority is to get all pupils into school. And I think that the schools, the teachers, they’ve all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children’s health, the risk to children’s wellbeing from not being in school is far greater than the risk from Covid. If there are things we have to do to vary the advice on medical grounds, we will, of course, do that. But as the chief medical officer, all our scientific advisers, have said, schools are safe. Guidance on whether children in Wales should wear face coverings in schools is to be reviewed, according to authorities in Wales. The Welsh government’s Health minister, Vaughan Gething, said: In light of the update to World Health Organization advice on the use of face coverings for children over 12 - and the decision by the Scottish government to introduce wider face covering wearing in schools - I’ve asked the children and schools advisory group... to consider the current guidance here in Wales. The briefing where Gething made those those comments can be watched again here. The Welsh move comes after it was announced that Scottish secondary school pupils will have to wear face coverings in corridors, communal areas and school buses from next week. There have been 44 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Scotland since yesterday, Nicola Sturgeon has announced at her regular media briefing, including seven in Tayside, where the cluster around the 2 Sisters food processing plant continues. Scotland’s first minister said that over past six days more than 900 people have been tested at mobile testing unit outside the plant in Coupar Angus, and that there is still little evidence of community transmission. Sturgeon also said there had been a “major spike” in demand for testing over the weekend, and announced the establishment of 11 local walk-through testing centres, the first of these will be housed in the Victory Memorial Hall in St Andrews. She also said three mobile testing units would be deployed across the central belt of Scotland, the first of which will be operational in Glasgow this afternoon. On the decision to give “obligatory guidance” to young people to wear face coverings in high schools, she said: “I don’t under-estimate how challenging it is for teachers to do their already difficult jobs and be mindful of all the different requirements to keep Covid under control.” Asked about compulsion, given that the guidance is not yet mandatory, she said that “ideally we don’t want to have an enforcement regime around this guidance in schools”. She went on: “Schools already have behavioural policies in place, this is another aspect of that and in my view much better done in that way of being part of the process for young people understanding things we have to adhere to [to combat the virus].” Problems with the UK government’s website meant that it wasn’t possible to book a local Covid-19 drive-through test for about three hours today. I’ve been contacted by someone in Brighton who was trying to book a test earlier and was found that the website was, intermittently, either down or else it directed him to go to London. I called the government’s helpline and was told that the site was down for about three hours today. When the person in Brighton phoned an official number he was told there was nothing that could be done at the moment as the system was down and “multiple calls” with the same complaint had been coming in. He called back and was told “very few (if any) people are able to book a test online today due to technical errors, and so I should just turn up at the test centre, do the swab test, and complete/enter barcode details AFTER completing the test.” Headteachers and teaching unions have been responding to the decision in Scotland that all secondary pupils should wear face masks in schools from Monday. If there’s to be a U-turn in England, they want it sooner rather than later, but most agree - whatever the government says - staff and students should be allowed to wear face coverings if they want to. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, urged ministers to review the existing guidance, which says masks are not necessary in schools, and to provide clear direction one way or another. “We have two concerns,” he said. First, parents, pupils, and staff, will be anxious about the situation and need reassurance from the government about the public health basis for its policy over face coverings in England, rather than it being left entirely to schools to explain the government’s rationale. And, second, if there is going to be any U-turn by the government that it does this sooner rather than later because the start of the new term is imminent. A spokesman for the National Association of Head Teachers said: “Where there are individual members of staff or pupils who feel the need to wear a mask in order to feel safe enough to come to school, then we have confidence that our members would be able to make a sensible decision and allow that. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, added that it should be permissible for staff members and students to wear face masks if they wish to do so. We have to stay abreast of the science, so when the World Health Organization says that children over 12 should wear masks in communal areas at school, that ought to be listened to. Parents should avoid chatting with friends at the school gates after dropping their children off in order to help limit Covid-19’s spread, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has suggested. Continuing his drive to get children back into England’s classrooms in September, Williamson said that parents should show “understanding and consideration”. The minister, who continues to face calls for his resignation over the handling of the exams fiasco, suggested that parents should “drop their children off and then get on with all the tasks of their day”. In an interview with the Evening Standard, Williamson conceded that not all children may be back in class on the first day but his goal was to see them coming back “over the next few weeks”. Williamson told the Evening Standard: We’re asking all parents to show understanding and consideration to the whole school community. Most schools have put in place staggered starts to make sure that there’s a swift and good flow-through of parents, and we just ask people to be respectful of the systems that are being put into place. We’d ask parents just to be really considerate, make sure they’re able to drop their children off and then get on with all the tasks of their day. Virgin Atlantic’s creditors will vote on a £1.2bn rescue deal today, as the airline tries to secure its future following the coronavirus crisis. The airline last month revealed the privately-funded recapitalisation plan agreed with its shareholders and investors, after Virgin’s attempts to win UK state support were unsuccessful. The plan is designed to help it survive another 18 months of travel turmoil, with a return to profit in 2022. The carrier, founded by Sir Richard Branson, has previously said it will run out of money and could collapse into administration if creditors do not back the deal. Almost 200 of the airline’s affected trade creditors, each of whom is owed more than £50,000, will vote on Tuesday at a hearing at the high court in London. Virgin Atlantic needs to gain support equivalent to 75% of the overall outstanding value of money owed. Senior officials from the exams body, Ofqual, are to face questions next week about the grades fiasco from MPs on the House of Commons education committee. The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, is scheduled to come before the committee on 16 September at what the committee billed as a “regular accountability session”. A statement released by the committee said it would question the chief regulator, Sally Collier, and the Ofqual chair, Roger Taylor, “on what went wrong in the awarding of grades, where responsibility lies and how and why problems with the standardisation model were not identified earlier”. “MPs are also likely to ask what steps are being taken to support students, schools and colleges who have lost out because of the standardisation model and subsequent U-turn, and about lessons learnt to ensure a fair system should exams be cancelled in the future.” Both Collier and Taylor are due to appear on 2 September. Birmingham city council has announced new enforcement measures targeting businesses flouting Covid-19 restrictions, coming into force from tomorrow. The latest steps were approved following a meeting of local authority chiefs and the government’s gold command, and come on the back of concerns about a recent rise in infections in the city - although the rate is now falling. In a statement, the council said the “enhanced measures” would tackle the fact much of the current guidance is “not legally enforceable” at the moment. Councillor Ian Ward, the leader of Birmingham city council, said: Staying focused now will also support our fragile economic recovery in the long term. No one wants to see a continual ‘stop, start’ approach as to what citizens can do and where they can go, least of all our business community, most of whom are adhering to the guidance and are doing all they can to keep our citizens safe. For those that are not we are now enacting powers to ensure that they do. These new powers will allow us to intervene when businesses are putting staff and customers at risk of infection. We reported yesterday that a police chief has warned that people are acting like “the virus isn’t out there” after a weekend of illegal gatherings in the West Midlands, despite Birmingham edging closer to a local lockdown. Scientists in Wales will launch a study this week into whether mouthwash can be used to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. Covid-19 patients at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff will take part in new research to find out if it has the potential to reduce the levels of the virus in saliva. Sars-CoV-2 is an enveloped virus with an outer fatty (lipid) membrane, and previous studies are said to show that agents usually found in mouthwash - such as low amounts of ethanol, povidone-iodine and cetylpyridinium - could disrupt the membranes of other lipid viruses. Dentyl is the only UK mouthwash brand to take part in the 12-week study led by Prof David Thomas from Cardiff University and called: “The measurement of mouthwash anti-viral activity against Covid-19.” Dr Thomas said: “We are very keen to start this much-needed clinical trial as our review of the literature indicated that we need to look deeper into the possible positive impact that mouthwashes may play on the transmission of Covid-19. Senior political figures in England might have survived controversies over alleged breaches of social distancing or lockdown restrictions but pressure is building from Brussels on the European trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, who has been resisting moves to quit over breaches in Ireland. RTE’s Tony Connelly tweets that European commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has asked Hogan to provide further details of his movements in Ireland. The Irish representative on the European commission was asked on Saturday by Ireland’s prime minister and deputy prime minister to consider his position after his attendance at a golf dinner caused public outrage and led to other political resignations. Hogan, who offered an initial apology on Friday only after the prime minister, Micheál Martin, demanded one, said on Sunday he had listened carefully to the views of Martin and the deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar. Deaths in the UK have risen above average for the first time since mid-June, according to new figures, but Covid-19 is not believed to be behind the rise. Instead, the heatwave during the week ending August 14 is likely to explain the weekly increase, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). There were 9,392 deaths from all causes in England and Wales in the week ending August 14 - 447 more deaths compared with the previous week. It took the number of deaths that week to 3.4% above the average for this time of year over the past five years - the first time the average has been exceeded since June 12. Meanwhile, deaths involving coronavirus have been falling. Some 139 deaths registered in the week ending August 14 mentioned “novel coronavirus”, an 8.6% fall from the 152 deaths in the previous week. It is the lowest number of weekly deaths involving Covid-19 registered since the week ending March 20, before the lockdown. Overall, there were 10,580 deaths from all causes registered across the UK in the week ending 14 August - 265 deaths higher than the five-year average and 370 more deaths than the previous week. This is Ben Quinn picking up the blog now. If you want to flag up pandemic-related stories that we should be covering today you can reach me on Twitter at @BenQuinn75 or by email. I will be logging off soon and handing over the blog to my colleague Ben Quinn. Below are some of the latest developments of the day so far: • A leading member of the Oxford university team trying to find a vaccine for coronavirus has not ruled it out being ready for this winter. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford university, said: “If cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year.” • Scotland’s education minister, John Swinney, has announced that all secondary pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next Monday. The measure applies to all high schools but Swinney added that nobody should be sent home for not wearing a mask. • Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said school staff or young people would not be penalised for wearing facemasks when schools reopen, although the advice is that they are currently not necessary. Speaking on the Radio 4 Today programme, Sharma said that the government has followed scientific and medical advice. • Sharma also waded into the controversy over the Last Night of the Proms featuring traditional flag-waving anthems Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory. Following suggestions that the music might be axed because of perceived links to colonialism, the BBC confirmed on Monday night that the songs would be performed – but as orchestral versions with no singing. Sharma said he would like to see the lyrics sung and suggested the BBC could put subtitles up so people can join in from home. Three prisoners tested positive for coronavirus in a Teesside jail block that has now been locked down. It comes after widespread testing of almost 800 inmates at HMP Holme House in Stockton. One house block, of around 170 prisoners, has now been isolated as a precaution following the positive tests. A prison service spokesperson said: One house block has been isolated as a precaution after widespread testing of almost 800 prisoners resulted in three positive tests. The service also confirmed no prison officers have tested positive for Covid-19. The 770 inmates were tested as part of a DHSC-commissioned testing study in prisons across the country to help increase our understanding of the virus. Visits to Holme House have not been suspended, the service added. The business secretary, Alok Sharma, has waded into the controversy over the Last Night of the Proms featuring traditional flag-waving anthems Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory. Following suggestions that the music might be axed because of perceived links to colonialism, the BBC confirmed on Monday night that the songs would be performed – but as orchestral versions with no singing. Sharma said he would like to see the lyrics sung and suggested the BBC could put subtitles up so people can join in from home. Asked about the controversy, Sharma told Sky News on Tuesday: “The Last Night of the Proms gives huge amounts of pleasure to millions of people. I personally think it’s a very joyous occasion and it’s going to be very strange this year that you’re not going to have a live audience. “I understand now that the BBC has said they will maintain some of these traditions. Personally, I would like to see the lyrics sung. I understand some songs will have lyrics sung and, of course, the BBC is always able to put on subtitles so if people want they can join in from home. “I think what’s really important is that if you’re looking at this sort of stuff is, you should be looking to tackle the substance of problems, rather than the symbols. I think that’s a point the prime minister has made very well.” Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. People with eating disorders are at significant risk of negative impacts of the pandemic, a research paper says. Data was collected from 129 people experiencing, or in recovery from, an eating disorder during the early stages of the UK pandemic lockdown. Participants were aged between 16 and 65 years. When asked about the overall impact of the pandemic on their eating disorder symptoms, (86.7%) reported that their symptoms had worsened as a result of the pandemic, with over 30% reporting that their symptoms were much worse. The paper was published in the Journal of Eating Disorders. People with blood cancer are at greater risk of dying if they go to hospital with coronavirus than people with other types of cancer, research shows. A paper published by Lancet Oncology found that of 224 people with blood cancer (leukaemia, lymphoma and myeloma) who got coronavirus and ended up in hospital, 36% of them died. There are more than 200,000 people with blood cancer who are in the “extremely clinically vulnerable” group. Analysis found that once you account for age and gender, people with leukaemia are more than twice as likely to die (125%) if they are diagnosed with coronavirus than the average person with cancer. People with lymphoma are 72% more likely to die, and people with myeloma are 65% more likely to die. People with other types of blood cancer appear slightly less likely to die (around 20% less likely) than the average person with cancer. Gemma Peters, chief executive of Blood Cancer UK, said: “These findings confirm that the coronavirus is especially dangerous for people with blood cancer, and they will be very worrying for the 200,000 people in the UK who have been shielding because of it. “Thankfully, the coronavirus is now less prevalent in society than it was a few months ago, and so we’re no longer in a position where people with blood cancer shouldn’t leave their homes at all. But given they are at greater risk than people with other types of cancer, it’s important that people with blood cancer talk to their healthcare team about their own personal risk and that they do everything they can to avoid the virus. This includes avoiding coming into contact with people and avoiding crowded places, particularly indoors. And if they do develop symptoms of Covid-19 it is important they talk to their specialist blood cancer team immediately. “As well as this, the government needs to do more to support people with blood cancer to protect themselves. In particular, ending the shielding scheme has effectively forced people with blood cancer to go back to work at a time when it is becoming increasingly clear they are high risk of dying if they get the virus.” Tesco is to permanently employ 16,000 extra staff taken on during the pandemic to help support a surge in online grocery trade. The roles include 10,000 pickers, who select and pack grocery orders for home delivery, and 3,000 drivers, as well as a variety of other roles in stores and distribution centres. Tesco’s move comes after the electrical goods specialist AO.com, the DIY chain Kingfisher and the delivery firms DPD and Hermes hired thousands more workers combined to cope with the rise in home deliveries. However, the shift online has hit high streets hard, with Marks &amp; Spencer, John Lewis and Boots among the chains shutting stores and cutting jobs. London department store Liberty is also planning redundancies via a voluntary scheme under which at least 50 of its 550-plus UK team are expected to go. Stress and exhaustion from the Covid-19 crisis threaten to intensify burnout among women working in the NHS just as it prepares to resume most services, according to a survey that has prompted calls for greater support for female staff. The pandemic had amplified alleged bullying, sexism and racism on the part of managers, some workers also warned, while 26% of women said they did not feel safe sharing personal concerns with their boss. This was especially true for staff from a minority ethnic background, who also reported feeling traumatised by the disproportionate impact of the virus, said the Health and Care Women Leaders Network of the NHS Confederation, which carried out the survey. The exams debacle could fatally undermine Boris Johnson’s claim to be a champion of “levelling up”, a former education secretary has said. Justine Greening, who was education secretary for two years under Theresa May, said that more had to be done to ensure young people were not failed again by the government. She said the fallout from the crisis, in which poorer pupils suffered disproportionately as A-level results were downgraded by algorithm until a humiliating government U-turn, could do to Johnson what Black Wednesday did to John Major. “The exams crisis this summer threatens to be as damaging for the public’s confidence in Boris Johnson’s government’s ability to level up Britain, as the ERM crisis was for John Major’s government’s competence on economic management,” she said. Greening, writing for the Guardian, also said she believed the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, would have been aware of the risk to disadvantaged pupils before the exams crisis unfolded and that more must be done to help disadvantaged students as schools reopen next week. “While talk about levelling up has continued, levelling down is what’s happened in reality,” she said. Coronavirus has led to more people switching jobs, research for the Office of National statistics shows. It published an article that looks at people switching occupation in early 2020, and compared with the same period of 2019, before the pandemic. In 2002, 6.1% changed occupation in the first half of this year, compared with 5.7% in the same period last year. Analysis of only those who have changed occupation in the first half of this year shows that associate professional and technical occupations experienced the greatest percentage of occupational outflows (20.9%) and occupational inflows (21.2%); over half (52.5%) also changed major industry. The Coronavirus pandemic has shone a light on the use of algorithms in decision making among government bodies, after one was used by the exam regulator Ofqual in recent A-level results. It downgraded almost 40% of grades assessed by teachers, culminating in a humiliating government U-turn and the system being scrapped. Guardian research shows that other uses of algorithms have been dropped with 20 councils no longer using an algorithm to flag claims as “high risk” for potential welfare fraud. The ones they flagged were pulled out by staff to double-check, potentially slowing down people’s claims without them being aware. The Home Office recently stopped using an algorithm to help decide visa applications after allegations that it contained “entrenched racism”. The charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) and the digital rights group Foxglove launched a legal challenge against the system, which was scrapped before a case went to court. Here is a look at some global updates around coronavirus. Gaza reported its first Covid-19 cases outside quarantine areas and declared lockdown. The first cases of coronavirus have been detected outside of quarantine facilities within the Gaza Strip, a potentially disastrous development given the enclave’s fragile health system. MPs urge Boris Johnson to meet ‘forgotten victims’ of coronavirus. Boris Johnson must meet families whose relatives have been killed by coronavirus and fund research into the longer-term effects, known as “long Covid”, to help the pandemic’s forgotten victims, MPs have said. Their recommendations form part of a fresh set of demands made on the prime minister intended to shape how he prepares for a potential second wave of the illness this autumn. ‘Very low evidence’ for plasma therapy authorised by Trump, says WHO. In case you missed this in the earlier blog: Donald Trump on Sunday announced the emergency authorisation of convalescent plasma, a method involving taking plasma from people who have recovered from Covid-19, for coronavirus patients. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the WHO, stressed that it was still unproven and that there was “very low evidence” it was safe and effective. Dr Fauci warns against rushing out a vaccine. Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, warned that distributing a Covid-19 vaccine under special emergency use guidelines before it has been proved safe and effective in large trials is a bad idea that could have a chilling effect on the testing of other vaccines. Usain Bolt has tested positive for coronavirus. World-record sprinter and eight-time Olympic gold medallist Usain Bolt has tested positive for coronavirus and is self-isolating at his home in Jamaica after last week celebrating his 34th birthday with a big bash mask-free, Reuters reports. South Korea orders most Seoul schools to close. South Korea on Tuesday ordered most schools in Seoul and surrounding areas to close and move classes back online, the latest in a series of precautionary measures aimed at heading off a resurgence in coronavirus cases, Reuters reports. Scotland’s education minister, John Swinney, has announced that all secondary pupils should wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas from next Monday. The measure applies to all high schools but Swinney added that nobody should be sent home for not wearing a mask. Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland’s Good Morning Scotland: “This is not going to be mandatory. We are recommending this is what should be done and we will encourage schools to pursue that as part of the work to maintain safety within schools. It’s about making sure that everybody is looking out for each other.” Yesterday, the Scottish government said that it had been consulting councils and teaching organisations about the measure after face coverings were recommended for secondary schools by the World Health Organization at the weekend. WHO said face coverings were useful where physical distancing between adults and pupils aged 12 and over was impossible, or in areas of high transmission. Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said school staff or young people would not be penalised for wearing facemasks when schools reopen, although the advice is that they are currently not necessary. Speaking on the Radio 4 Today programme, Sharma said that the government has followed scientific and medical advice. “Public Health England does not recommend at the moment [facemasks] in schools... We are always considering the latest advice and evidence but the current advice is that it is not recommended.” When asked if people would be penalised for wearing them, he said this would not happen. “It’s about what makes sense. We have seen recent surveys from the ONS showing high level of confidence in terms of pupils returning safe settings in schools.” He said that the focus was opening up the economy in a phased and “cautious manner, getting businesses up and running”. When asked about whether the government would offer financial support to those who may need to quarantine and therefore lose wages, he said they “look at all suggestions” they receive. “The key thing though is the best way we can restart the economy is by opening up in cautious manner,” he repeated. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has said the first volunteers have now been dosed in its clinical trial of a new drug to help prevent and treat Covid-19. The group, which is also separately developing a Covid-19 vaccine together with scientists at Oxford University, said the drug - known as AZD7442 - is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies. AstraZeneca said the trial, which will include up to 48 healthy volunteers in the UK aged 18 to 55, will look at the safety of the treatment, as well as the body’s reaction to the drug and how it processes it. The Cambridge-headquartered group said the phase 1 clinical trial is an “important milestone” in the development of the drug, which has the potential to act as a preventative for people exposed to the virus, as well as to treat patients already infected with Covid-19. A so-called monoclonal antibody combination works by mimicking the body’s natural antibodies. The antibodies come from patients infected with coronavirus and were discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Centre and then licensed to AstraZeneca in June. Astra then boosts the combined antibodies so that they “afford at least six months of protection from Covid-19”. Mene Pangalos, executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at Astra, said: “This trial is an important milestone in the development of our monoclonal antibody combination to prevent or treat Covid-19. “This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use, in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance.” If the trial is successful, Astra said it would look to move the treatment to late-stage phase 2 and phase 3 trials. The trial is being funded by the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which is part of the US Department of Health and Human Services. It comes after Downing Street said on Monday the UK would be first in line for the coronavirus vaccine developed by Oxford University and Astra, once approved. This followed reports that Donald Trump was considering granting emergency authorisation for it to be fast-tracked in the US. The Guardian has been writing about those who lost their lives from Covid-19. Hong Kong scientists reported of a healthy man in his 30s who became reinfected with coronavirus after falling sick to it months earlier. They say genome sequencing shows the two strains of the virus are “clearly different”, making it the world’s first proven case of reinfection. But the World Health Organization warned it is important not to jump to conclusions based on the case of one patient. Dr Jeffrey Barrett, senior scientific consultant for the Covid-19 genome project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: “Given the number of global infections to date, seeing one case of reinfection is not that surprising even if it is a very rare occurrence. “It may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious - though we don’t know whether this person was infectious during their second episode.” A leading member of the Oxford university team trying to find a vaccine for coronavirus has not ruled it out being ready for this winter. The trials ongoing around the world hope to involve around 50,000 people and he said if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials they could present data to regulators this year. It comes after the chief medical officer for England, Chris Witty, suggested that a vaccine would most reasonably be ready next winter or in the one after. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford university, said: “I think Chris Witty is right to be cautious, it could take as long as that to demonstrate that the vaccine works and is safe and then we have to go through a process of regulators looking at that to make sure it is done correctly. But if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year,” he said. Andrew Pollard, professor of paediatric infection and immunity at Oxford university – one of the lead researchers on its vaccine trial – has said that if coronavirus cases accrue rapidly at clinical trial stage they could have data to put before regulators this year. It comes after the chief medical officer for England, Chris Witty, suggested that a vaccine will most reasonably be ready next winter or in the one after. “I think Chris Witty is right to be cautious, it could take as long as that to demonstrate that the vaccine works and is safe and then we have to go through a process of regulators looking at that to make sure it is done correctly. But if cases accrue rapidly in clinical trials we could have data to put before regulators this year,” he said. When asked about the possibility of people being reinfected with the virus after a Hong Kong man caught Covid-19 twice, Pollard said: “I think it is important in all vaccine development to look at changes in the virus, which happens over time, to make sure if the virus does change the vaccine is still effective against it.” The chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society has told Ofqual to “cease defending the indefensible” in the latest exchange in a row over the algorithm used to determine this year’s A-level and GCSE results. The dispute began with comments made by the RSS in which the society said it had offered to help with the algorithm but objected to the proposed confidentiality agreement that experts would be required to sign and claimed it had received no official response to its concerns. Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, rebuffed the criticisms on Sunday. He said Ofqual had published a copy of the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to dispute the “restrictions you have incorrectly alleged” and denied that the regulator had failed to respond to the issues raised by the RSS. An interesting look at six of the most promising treatments for Covid-19 so far from my colleague Sarah Boseley. Below is a look at the latest news and developments regarding coronavirus in the UK. Students will begin receiving their BTec results from Tuesday after exam board Pearson delayed their publication. Thousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England. Pupils wearing masks is an option that should be kept under review, a union has said, despite the education secretary insisting the measure is not needed as schools in England prepare to reopen. The world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt, is in quarantine after reportedly testing positive for Covid-19 just days after a party for his 34th birthday, which was attended by England footballer Raheem Sterling and several other sports stars. Stop and searches in London rose by 40% during lockdown and a lower proportion of them led to arrests, figures show. Four times as many adolescents are physically abused compared with younger children in England, analysis of police-recorded offences shows, with incidents against 11- to 18-year-olds soaring during the coronavirus lockdown. The world’s fastest man, Usain Bolt, is in quarantine after reportedly testing positive for Covid-19 just days after a party for his 34th birthday, which was attended by England footballer Raheem Sterling and several other sports stars. Jamaica’s health ministry said late on Monday that Bolt, the world 100m and 200m record holder, had tested positive for the virus. He had earlier posted a video on social media saying he was waiting to hear back on his results – before urging anyone who had come into contact with him recently to enter quarantine. Jamaica’s minister of health and wellness, Dr Christopher Tufton, reportedly confirmed Bolt had been notified of the positive test and contact tracing was under way. Students will begin receiving their BTec results from Tuesday after exam board Pearson delayed their publication. Grading for the vocational qualifications was delayed to give the board more time to recalculate the grades after A-level and GCSE results were based on teacher estimates. Last week, Pearson said the regrading was needed to “address concerns about unfairness in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and ensure no BTec student is disadvantaged.” Cindy Rampersaud, senior vice-president for BTec and apprenticeships at the company, said all eligible results would be available by Friday. Around 200,000 level one and two entries were due to receive grades last Thursday, while 250,000 level three grades have already been awarded but were part of the reassessment. Justine Greening, the MP for Putney from 2005 to 2019, has written for the Guardian today on the exams crisis in England and Wales: The exams crisis in England and Wales this summer threatens to be as damaging for the public’s confidence in the ability of Boris Johnson’s government to tackle regional inequalities and level up Britain as the crisis over the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) was for John Major’s reputation on economic management. How it responds now is pivotal for the country’s future, but also the current administration’s. As soon as the decision was taken to close schools in mid-March, it was clear that there needed to be a plan in place for reopening them and helping young people catch up on the education they lost out on during lockdown. It was also clear that children who were already less privileged were most affected by the shutdown. It was clear when life-defining exams were cancelled that there would also need to be a way to ensure university places, apprenticeships and wider employment opportunities wouldn’t become even further out of reach. Thousands of headteachers have written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, accusing the government of repeatedly failing to listen or collaborate as schools prepare to reopen to millions of children across England. In what appears to be a damaging breakdown in relations, headteachers say they are facing some of the most significant challenges of their professional lives but feel they are “working in isolation”, unsupported by the government. School leaders, who are still picking up the pieces after the recent exams fiasco, say their confidence in government has been “significantly knocked”. They are calling for urgent changes to current ways of working to help ensure a safe return to school. Hannah Bernard, head of business banking at Barclays, said their research showed more women were thinking of starting businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. On the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Bernard was asked whether companies taking out loans would not be able to pay them back in time. “You have to make sure support is in place and lots of preparation is made for businesses that may go through difficulties when they start to pay back loans. We are doing lots to make sure they are ready,” she said. “If someone took a loan out at the start of the scheme their first payment will be May next year. Lots of women have been spurred to start businesses due to lockdown,” she said, citing research the banking giant did on this subject. Michael Fabricant, Conservative MP for Lichfield in Staffordshire, said he would like Rule, Britannia! to be performed by a solo singer at the Last Night of the Proms. It comes after the BBC confirmed on Monday night that the song will be performed as an orchestral version only. The change is down to Covid-19 restrictions, the corporation said, after reports the anthems could be axed for political reasons. Fabricant told BBC Radio 4 Today programme: “I think it is all very sad, Rule Britannia has some lovely words.” He argued that while the BBC said the changes were due to coronavirus restrictions that other tunes will be sung, such as the national anthem. He said that a solo singer version would not be “thin”. “When you hear opera singers belting it out, I would not say that is a thin voice, I’d be happy with that compromise: a single voice singing it [Rule, Britannia!] loudly.” Pupils wearing masks is an option that should be kept under review, a union has said, despite the education secretary insisting the measure is not needed as schools in England prepare to reopen. It comes as the Scottish government is expected to state its decision on face coverings in schools in light of the latest guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) that children aged 12 and over should wear a mask. The Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) said as evidence continues to emerge, Westminster should review its guidance. The ASCL general secretary, Geoff Barton, told the Daily Telegraph: “We would expect the government in Westminster to review its guidance on the use of face coverings in schools - which currently says they are not required - in light of the WHO guidance and the consultation taking place in Scotland. “The evidence is clearly evolving on this issue and it is important that it is kept under review and that clear direction is provided to schools.” But Prof Russell Viner, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said there was concern about younger children wearing face coverings. The WHO and UN children’s agency Unicef suggested that face shields may be an alternative in situations such as speech classes where the teacher and pupils need to see each other’s mouths. The shadow education secretary, Kate Green, has already said the issue should be kept under review. Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said her education secretary John Swinney is in the final stages of consulting with teachers and councils on whether to recommend the use of masks when moving around schools.

          "headline": "Ofqual head Sally Collier resigns over exams fiasco",
          "bodyText": "The head of England’s exam regulator, Sally Collier, has resigned over the exams fiasco that has engulfed schools and universities. News of her departure came hours after the education select committee announced she had been called to give evidence to MPs on the exams debacle at a hearing next Wednesday. An education source said: “She knew she’d reached the end of the line.” Collier, the chief regulator and Ofqual chief executive, oversaw the development of the flawed exams algorithm that was scrapped after it downgraded nearly 40% of A-level results. The algorithm was created after ministers insisted on avoiding grade inflation. Collier had been conspicuous by her absence since the U-turn on results last week, with Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, issuing a public apology instead. Ofqual said she would be replaced temporarily by her predecessor, Dame Glenys Stacey, with additional support from the Ofsted chief inspector, Amanda Spielman, who previously chaired Ofqual. Taylor remains in his role. The chair of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, said Collier should still give evidence to his inquiry. “Just a few days ago, both Sally Collier and Roger Taylor confirmed they would come to the committee. “Taylor has confirmed to me today he will still attend but I hope very much Sally Collier will still attend because she was in charge at the time and we can find out what went wrong,” he told the Guardian. “The public, parents and pupils need to know the truth of what happened and why.” The Guardian understands Ofqual was planning to send Stacey along with Taylor. Collier’s resignation comes days after the publication of millions of GCSE results and not long after the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, insisted Ofqual had his “full confidence”. He had previously refused to back Collier but later admitted Ofqual was responsible for the climbdown for which he originally took credit. The government was forced to apologise for the fiasco that resulted in disadvantaged students being worst hit by downgrades, while private school pupils’ results were boosted under the algorithm. University admissions were thrown into chaos and public confidence in the exams system plummeted. A statement from Ofqual said the board had agreed to accept temporary support from the schools regulator, Ofsted, to help resolve outstanding issues with this summer’s GCSE, A-level and vocational qualifications, including appeals and autumn exams, as well as preparations for next year’s exam season. “The chief regulator, Sally Collier, has decided that the next stage of the awarding process would be better overseen by new leadership,” the statement said. “The Ofqual board supports Sally in this decision, and thanks her for her leadership and service over the past four years, which has included overseeing the successful introduction of an entirely new set of GCSEs and A-levels, and a new grading system.” Stacey will be the acting chief regulator until December, with support from a new committee to be chaired by Spielman. The committee will oversee the work of Ofqual until the end of the year. Additional Ofsted staff may be brought in during the autumn to support Ofqual’s work. It is understood Ofsted was only informed of developments on Tuesday. The statement concluded: “Taken together these arrangements will ensure that Ofqual has the extra capacity, support and oversight it needs both to tackle the remaining issues from this year’s awarding process and to ensure that next year’s arrangements command public confidence.” Insiders said the Ofqual board was now “a lame duck” and would be sidelined. Powers will be delegated to Spielman’s committee and once the immediate crisis is over a new board will be appointed with some suggesting Ofsted and Ofqual could even be merged. “There are all sorts of questions around governance. What questions were the board asking?” said one source. Collier weakened her position by failing to front Ofqual’s response to the crisis, but is said to have been keen to put her case to the education select committee. “I think she would be able to demonstrate this is not all of Ofqual’s making,” one source said. Williamson issued a statement thanking Collier and welcoming the new governance arrangements involving Ofsted. “This will make sure Ofqual can fully focus on the important functions it must deliver as the independent regulator for qualifications, examinations and assessments in England,” he said. “Moving forward, my department will continue to work closely with Ofqual’s leadership to deliver fair results and exams for young people.” Collier earned a £200,000 salary and led Ofqual for four years, having worked previously in procurement for the civil service as the chief executive of Crown Commercial Service, but faced criticism for her lack of background in education. “Someone had to go, but I really feel for her,” said one education insider. “She was given an impossible job. Gavin Williamson told her to limit grade inflation and give candidates the grades they deserved. This is a mutually incompatible direction. Of course the one person who should resign is clinging on for dear life, on his last legs, expiring slowly.” Collier’s departure will do little to divert attention from the fiasco. Taylor is engaged in a public row with the Royal Statistical Society, which raised concerns about the algorithm. The Guardian revealed last week that Taylor threatened to quit unless Williamson publicly backed the exams regulator, and that Spielman was being lined up to shore up the body."

          "headline": "Exams row: BTec students begin receiving revised grades",
          "bodyText": "Students have begun receiving their BTec grades, a week after the exam board Pearson withdrew some and delayed the publication of others to give itself time to recalculate scores in the week of the A-level results fiasco. About 200,000 people who had taken the level one and two vocational qualifications were told last week, just hours before results day, that they would not receive them on time. A further 250,000 level-three grades, which had already been awarded, were also reassessed. It came after an outcry over A-level and GCSE results led to the scrapping of an algorithm that had calculated pupils’ grades in lieu of exams. After the algorithm downgraded the results of many pupils from the estimates given by their teachers, while apparently favouring pupils from private schools, pupils held multiple protests with many calling for the resignation of the education secretary, Gavin Williamson. In many cases, BTec level-three students had also been given lower grades than they had expected. Pearson subsequently said regrading was needed to “address concerns about unfairness in relation to A-levels and GCSEs and ensure no BTec student is disadvantaged”. BTec results will now be given on a rolling basis over the week, with the priority going to level-three results, which may be used for applying to university. Pupils will receive results for level one and two qualifications from Thursday. A Pearson spokesman said: “We know this has caused frustration and additional uncertainty for students and we are truly sorry. No grades will go down as part of this review.” Jenny Cameron, the director at Stagedoor Learning in Cheltenham, who teaches level-three BTec performing arts, said almost all of her students’ original results had been two grades lower than they should have been. “The students have been treated really shoddily ... it’s been two weeks of unnecessary stress and worry for my students, as well as me,” she told PA Media. “It was just bewildering what [Pearson] did ... it didn’t make sense at all.” Kieran Cody, a year 12 student at a technical college in north-east London, was given a U in mathematics for engineering and a near-pass in his other subjects. The 17-year-old had earlier received some of the highest mock exam grades in his class and his teachers said they expected him to earn a distinction and merits in his final grades. “It feels like I’ve been treated like crap,” he said. Kevin Courtney, the joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said:“It is right that Pearson recognised the oncoming chaos and played their part in rectifying the situation, but students and their families will not forget this results season in a hurry. It was an entirely avoidable state of affairs, and the weaknesses of the system are now fully exposed. “Gavin Williamson must put things right for 2021 as a matter of urgency. There needs to be a reduction in content assessed in exams next summer, collaboration with the profession to develop a robust national system of moderated centre-assessed grades in case of further outbreaks of Covid-19, and a thorough independent review into assessment methods along the lines announced for Scotland.”"

          "headline": "Justine Greening: exams crisis could be Boris Johnson's Black Wednesday",
          "bodyText": "The exams debacle could fatally undermine Boris Johnson’s claim to be a champion of “levelling up”, a former education secretary has said. Justine Greening, who was education secretary for two years under Theresa May, said that more had to be done to ensure young people were not failed again by the government. She said the fallout from the crisis, in which poorer pupils suffered disproportionately as A-level results were downgraded by algorithm until a humiliating government U-turn, could do to Johnson what Black Wednesday did to John Major. “The exams crisis this summer threatens to be as damaging for the public’s confidence in Boris Johnson’s government’s ability to level up Britain, as the ERM crisis was for John Major’s government’s competence on economic management,” she said. Greening, writing for the Guardian, also said she believed the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, would have been aware of the risk to disadvantaged pupils before the exams crisis unfolded and that more must be done to help disadvantaged students as schools reopen next week. “While talk about levelling up has continued, levelling down is what’s happened in reality,” she said. Greening said she hoped the class of 2020 would be a catalyst for employers to place less value on exam results and more on potential. Greening lost the Conservative whip under Johnson, along with a number of former cabinet ministers, over a series of Brexit rebellions, but had previously quit May’s cabinet after she refused to move from the DfE to be business secretary. She said Williamson would have been aware of the potential of the system to inflict damage on the life chances of poorer pupils – and that they would need the most support after schools closures. “It was clear when life-defining exams were cancelled that there would also be a need for a plan to ensure university places, apprenticeships and wider employment opportunities wouldn’t become even further out of reach for young people,” she said. “Gavin Williamson was right to say sorry to young people for the school exam disruption they’ve had to suffer, but ultimately actions speak louder than words.” Greening said that as well as ensuring schools return next week, the government had to have a targeted plan to help those in education worst affected by lack of schooling. “There must be a properly resourced plan to support every child to catch up on lost time, and more personalised tutoring and support for those worst affected,” she said. “The government has had long enough to work through the challenges. We cannot have ‘Soino’ – schools open in name only, but children still falling behind.” Greening said the chaos over the 2020 exam results should speed up moves to place less emphasis on exam grades, for universities, apprenticeships and employers. “A smarter approach means assessing the rest of a young person’s wider potential beyond purely academic attainment assessed through an exam,” she said. “Academic exam grades end up being an overly narrow, traditional measure or proxy of a young person’s potential that can be gamed by the extra investment in outcomes for children in private education.” Greening said the government would continue to fail a generation of young people unless it could show there was a proper plan to prevent mass unemployment after the pandemic. “The chancellor and his Treasury department must bring forward a plan for the economy so it can generate enough high-skilled jobs for these diverse, talented young people as they graduate in the coming years,” she said. “Delaying the budget planned for September would be a recipe for even more of the same chaos – a government continuing to be shaped by events, rather than shaping them. If ministers should have learnt one thing from the exams chaos this August, it is that you don’t fix problems by pretending they don’t exist, it only lets them get worse.” Other former education secretaries have also been highly critical of Williamson’s approach in the months leading up to the A-level results. Almost 40% of pupils had their results downgraded, the majority from colleges or underperforming schools with larger class sizes. Alan Johnson, education secretary under Tony Blair, said it would have been a political decision to allow efforts to stop grade inflation to override risks to pupils’ life chances. David Blunkett, another Labour education secretary, said the lack of direction from Johnson had left Williamson floundering."

          "bodyText": "The chief executive of the Royal Statistical Society has told Ofqual to “cease defending the indefensible” in the latest exchange in a row over the algorithm used to determine this year’s A-level and GCSE results. The dispute began with comments made by the RSS in which the society said it had offered to help with the algorithm but objected to the proposed confidentiality agreement that experts would be required to sign and claimed it had received no official response to its concerns. Ofqual’s chair, Roger Taylor, rebuffed the criticisms on Sunday. He said Ofqual had published a copy of the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to dispute the “restrictions you have incorrectly alleged” and denied that the regulator had failed to respond to the issues raised by the RSS. “Your letter and comments to the press have led to widespread misunderstanding and suspicion of Ofqual’s process,” Taylor said. “I would ask that you take all measures you can to correct this impression.” The RSS hit back on Monday, publishing a letter addressed to Taylor saying it stood by its comments, with chief executive Stian Westlake describing his complaints as “baseless”. He said one lawyer described the NDA, which would have prohibited experts from revealing any confidential information that Ofqual didn’t choose to publish for five years, as “very widely drafted”. He also said the RSS “didn’t receive answers from Ofqual to the questions we raised about the NDA and about our involvement. (We did receive an email giving a generic reassurance that it was all fine … 51 days after we asked them. How reassuring would you find that?)” “In short, Ofqual’s complaints are baseless,” Westlake concluded. “It’s time for Ofqual to cease defending the indefensible and focus on fixing the issue.” The RSS letter, signed by president Prof Deborah Ashby and vice-president Sharon Witherspoon, states: “To conclude, we stand by the comments … If you feel there are any outstanding questions of fact in relation to our correspondence, we would be happy to make it public.” Ofqual has come under scrutiny for its role in the results fiasco, which saw 40% of A-level assessments in England downgraded by the exam regulator’s algorithm and many students losing a place at their chosen university as a result. It has since been revealed that Taylor threatened to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, publicly backed Ofqual and admitted that the regulator was behind the U-turn that saw the algorithm scrapped and all A-level and GCSE results in England based on teacher-assessed grades instead. Ofqual said its position had not changed from its earlier comments."

          "bodyText": "In the six months or so since the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the government’s handling of its impact on schools has become emblematic of its flawed, haphazard and, at times, bullying approach. In May, Boris Johnson and his hapless education secretary, Gavin Williamson, tried to browbeat primary schools into reopening en masse the following month. Teachers pointed to an absence of proper preparation, resources and guidelines, and the government sulkily U-turned. It took the footballer Marcus Rashford to then persuade the prime minister to overturn the cruel policy of discontinuing free school meals during the summer holidays. Last week, after days of chaos and justified fury, the notorious exam algorithm that unfairly deprived teenagers of university places was first defended and then ditched. The resulting GCSE grade inflation has led to a sudden boom in the number of sixth formers, forcing some schools to recruit new staff at the last minute, in the worst possible circumstances. Government dithering, callousness and sheer incompetence have been making an inevitable crisis in education far worse for months. Next week, as both primaries and secondaries prepare to reopen, is the trickiest moment of all. So it is unlikely that many teachers or parents will be reassured by the words of the former minister, Theresa Villiers, who declared this week that Mr Johnson “is gripping this”. In a statement on Monday, the prime minister said that he considered it a moral duty to get children safely back to school. On this there is universal agreement; as numerous teachers have attested, the Covid-19 hiatus threatens to have heartbreaking consequences for disadvantaged pupils in particular. But Johnsonian exhortation, important though it is for the prime minister’s political profile, is not much use when it comes to solving real-world dilemmas in a pandemic. The potential for a school to play a role in community spread of the virus is clear, given the number of households it draws together. A succession of outbreaks in German schools and elsewhere suggests that there is still a lot we do not know about transmission of the infection in schools; the coming weeks are likely to be a matter of trial and error, as schools discover what is and isn’t working. Local test-and-trace capacity, vital to containing outbreaks, has improved but is still far from optimum. Establishing trust in the new systems and protocols, particularly in the case of local spikes, will therefore be fundamental to the successful reopening of schools. On that score, predictably, the government is not doing nearly enough. A week from the start of a new term like no other, the National Education Union is right to want greater clarity and precision on the next steps, in the case of virus outbreaks in schools. It also remains unclear what happens when there is a lockdown in a school’s local area and what the decision-making process will be. Little has been done to set up helplines for educational settings, which could offer support and advice as problems inevitably emerge. A request for confidence-building on-demand testing for teachers and pupils was turned down by the schools minister, Nick Gibb. With typical blitheness, a government spokesman said on Monday that remote education would be provided for children forced to re-isolate at home. Yet last week it was reported that only one-third of disadvantaged children promised free laptops by Mr Williamson in April had received them. At such a complex, fragile moment, confidence is the most precious of commodities. But the government is failing, again, to inspire it. Mr Johnson is right to say that there is a moral duty to get children safely back to school. But accomplishing that successfully will require engaging with and listening to teachers and parents, and giving them clear guidance. Sermonising from No 10 is all too easy."

          "bodyText": "Councils are quietly scrapping the use of computer algorithms in helping to make decisions on benefit claims and other welfare issues, the Guardian has found, as critics call for more transparency on how such tools are being used in public services. It comes as an expert warns the reasons for cancelling programmes among government bodies around the world range from problems in the way the systems work to concerns about bias and other negative effects. Most systems are implemented without consultation with the public, but critics say this must change. The use of artificial intelligence or automated decision-making has come into sharp focus after an algorithm used by the exam regulator Ofqual downgraded almost 40% of the A-level grades assessed by teachers. It culminated in a humiliating government U-turn and the system being scrapped. The fiasco has prompted critics to call for more scrutiny and transparency about the algorithms being used to make decisions related to welfare, immigration, and asylum cases. The Guardian has found that about 20 councils have stopped using an algorithm to flag claims as “high risk” for potential welfare fraud. The ones they flagged were pulled out by staff to double-check, potentially slowing down people’s claims without them being aware. Previous research by the Guardian found that one in three councils were using algorithms to help make decisions about benefit claims and other welfare issues. Research from Cardiff Data Justice Lab (CDJL), working with the Carnegie UK Trust, has been looking at cancelled algorithm programmes. According to them, Sunderland council has stopped using one which was designed to help it make efficiency savings of £100m. Their research also found that Hackney council in east London had abandoned using data analytics to help predict which children were at risk of neglect and abuse. The Data Justice Lab found at least two other councils had stopped using a risk-based verification system – which identifies benefit claims that are more likely to be fraudulent and may need to be checked. One council found it often wrongly identified low-risk claims as high-risk, while another found the system did not make a difference to its work. Dr Joanna Redden from the Data Justice Lab said: “We are finding that the situation experienced here with education is not unique … algorithmic and predictive decision systems are leading to a wide range of harms globally, and also that a number of government bodies across different countries are pausing or cancelling their use of these kinds of systems. “The reasons for cancelling range from problems in the way the systems work to concerns about negative effects and bias. We’re in the process of identifying patterns, but one recurring factor tends to be a failure to consult with the public and particularly with those who will be most affected by the use of these automated and predictive systems before implementing them.” The Home Office recently stopped using an algorithm to help decide visa applications after allegations that it contained “entrenched racism”. The charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) and the digital rights group Foxglove launched a legal challenge against the system, which was scrapped before a case went to court. Foxglove characterised it as “speedy boarding for white people” but the Home Office said it did not accept that description. “We have been reviewing how the visa application streaming tool operates and will be redesigning our processes to make them even more streamlined and secure,” the Home Office added. Martha Dark, the director and co-founder of Foxglove, said: “Recently we’ve seen the government rolling out algorithms as solutions to all kinds of complicated societal problems. It isn’t just A-level grades … People are being sorted and graded, denied visas, benefits and more, all because of flawed algorithms.” She said poorly designed systems could lead to discrimination, adding that there had to be democratic debate and consultation with the public on any system that affected their lives before that system was implemented. “These systems have to be transparent, so bias can be identified and stopped.” Police forces are increasingly experimenting with the use of artificial intelligence or automated decision-making. The West Midlands police and crime commissioner’s strategic adviser, Tom McNeil, said he was “concerned” businesses were pitching algorithms to police forces knowing their products may not be properly scrutinised. McNeil said: “In the West Midlands, we have an ethics committee that robustly examines and publishes recommendations on artificial intelligence projects. I have reason to believe that the robust and transparent process we have in the West Midlands may have deterred some data science organisations from getting further involved with us.” Research from the Royal Society of Arts published in April found at least two forces were using or trialling artificial intelligence or automated decision-making to help them identify crime hotspots – Surrey police and West Yorkshire police. Others using algorithms in some capacity or other include the Met, Hampshire Constabulary, Kent police, South Wales police, and Thames Valley police. Asheem Singh, the RSA thinktank’s director of economics, said: “Very few police consulted with the public. Maybe great work is going on but police forces don’t want to talk about it. That is concerning. We are talking about black-box formulae affecting people’s livelihoods. This requires an entire architecture of democracy that we have not seen before.” Without consultation “the principle of policing by consent goes out of the window”, Singh added. The National Police Chief’s Council said it was unable to comment. The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, an independent advisory body, is reviewing potential bias in algorithms. “Our review will make recommendations about how police forces and local authorities using predictive analytics are able to meet the right standards of governance and transparency for the challenges facing these sectors,” it said."

          "headline": "Google protests 'unworkable' ACCC code for digital platforms to pay news media companies",
          "bodyText": "Google has claimed the Australian government’s proposed code for digital platforms to pay news media companies for their content is “unworkable” and would force the tech company to “pay unreasonable and exorbitant amounts”. As the deadline nears for public comment on the federal government’s proposed code, Google used a new blog post on its search site to attack the idea while admitting it would be unlikely to be able to escape its effects. Last week, Google began notifying its users through a banner or pop up advertisement in Google Search, Chrome and YouTube about the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) draft code for digital platforms to pay news media companies for their content. The code – which would apply to Google and Facebook – would also provide media companies with information on changes that might affect their traffic, such as alterations to news rankings or the search algorithm. Google has claimed it is in favour of the code, but is strongly opposed to critical aspects of it, including the forced payments to media companies if negotiations on payments fail, advance notice of algorithm changes, and a requirement for Google to share information on news users with the media companies. In its blog post on Monday, Google said the code was “unworkable” but admitted it would not be able to escape the code as it did in Spain – where the news feed was switched off – because the proposed code was so broadly defined. “If we show Australians any content from any ‘news publisher’ (defined to include any ‘website’) in the world, we must also show all news content of news businesses registered under the code,” Google said, adding the definition of news was also extremely broad. “This includes covering issues that are of ‘interest to Australians’, including foreign news and citizen journalism – which go well beyond traditional journalism to capture all kinds of information, blogs, videos and websites.” The company said to circumvent the code, it would require Google to undertake a “mass cull of content globally” to stop any sort of news being visible to Australians. When announcing the code in July, ACCC chair Rod Sims said the broad definition was by design, to ensure digital platforms were covered however news was served in Australia. Under the code, Google and news media companies have three months to negotiate a payment amount before it goes to arbitration. Once in arbitration, a panel – either appointed by the two sides or by the communications regulator – will decide on a final amount based on submissions from both sides. Google has argued this process “is set up to encourage news businesses to make unreasonable and exorbitant financial demands”, and is “extremely one-sided and unfair” because it does not take into account the value Google offers to the media companies in linking to their content. “It simply isn’t viable for us, or any digital platform, to pay unreasonable and exorbitant amounts to one group in one country,” Google said. The code specifies that the negotiations must consider whether the payment amount would place an “undue burden” on digital platforms. Last week, the ACCC said the negotiation process was designed to secure a fair payment for journalists’ work and it was designed to “address a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook”. Google denied that it was planning on charging users for its services, but said that the “free services” it provides are at risk by the proposed code by the issues it has raised. Dr Belinda Barnet, a senior lecturer in media and communications at Swinburne University of Technology, last week wrote it was “laughable” that Google was trying to present itself as the “little guy” in the debate. She said claims that search and other Google products would be adversely affected by payments, or by alerting news companies to changes to the algorithm, could be gaslighting. “It’s tempting to conclude that Google is simply trying to gaslight its users by sowing doubt about the wisdom of the new regulations – because it doesn’t want to pay,” she said. Google is also attempting to leverage its YouTube content creators with a YouTube video last week, where YouTube’s creator liaison Matt Koval detailed Google’s concerns with the proposed code to YouTube’s content creator community. The video had just under 8,000 views at the time of publication. Google said in the post that “thousands” have responded with concerns about the code. The ACCC has yet to say how many of those thousands made a submission to the inquiry. The ACCC is accepting submissions on the draft code until 5pm on 28 August."

          "headline": "Why Uber's business model is doomed",
          "bodyText": "Having threatened to pull out of California completely, Uber and Lyft recently won a temporary reprieve from orders to reclassify their drivers as employees rather than independent contractors. The companies argued they could not come up with a plan for doing so overnight, even though more than two years have passed since California’s supreme court ordered them to change their ways. The Californian labour law AB5 was supposed to end their non-compliance. One might assume that misclassifying drivers as independent contractors enables rideshare companies such as Uber to make exorbitant profits. The reality is far weirder. In fact, Uber and Lyft are not making any profits at all. On the contrary, the companies have been haemorrhaging cash for years, undercharging users for rides in a bid to aggressively expand their market shares worldwide. Squeezing drivers’ salaries is not their main strategy for becoming profitable. Doing so merely slows the speed at which they burn through money. The truth is that Uber and Lyft exist largely as the embodiments of Wall Street-funded bets on automation, which have failed to come to fruition. These companies are trying to survive legal challenges to their illegal hiring practices, while waiting for driverless-car technologies to improve. The advent of the autonomous car would allow Uber and Lyft to fire their drivers. Having already acquired a position of dominance with the rideshare market, these companies would then reap major monopoly profits. There is simply no world in which paying drivers a living wage would become part of Uber and Lyft’s long-term business plans. Only in a world where more profitable opportunities for investment are sorely lacking can such wild bets on far-flung futuristic technologies become massive multinational companies. Corporations and wealthy individuals have accumulated huge sums of money and cannot figure out where to put it because returns on investments are extremely low. The flip side of falling rates of business investment is a slackening pace of economic growth, which economists have termed “secular stagnation.” It’s this decades-long slowdown that has generated the insecure labour force on which Uber and Lyft rely. In slow-growing economies, labour markets are weak. Older workers who lose their jobs have trouble finding equivalent forms of employment. Meanwhile, young people just starting out in their working lives are sending out hundreds of applications only to end up in dead-end retail jobs. Rideshare companies such as Uber and Lyft feed off the insecurity that is omnipresent in the modern economy. When the alternative is working irregular shifts at coffee shops, driving for rideshare companies on one’s own schedule can seem like a dream. Management by algorithm appears similarly utopian compared with management by nasty bosses. In the early years of their operation, rideshare companies even offered rates of pay that were good relative to available alternatives. Of course, Uber and Lyft were probably planning to have fired these workers by now and to have replaced them with robots. But like many promises of automation, driverless cars are still some way from becoming a reality. Uber and Lyft started squeezing these workers’ incomes to staunch their own bleeding of cash reserves. At this point, drivers started fighting back. This fight for workers’ rights is grounded in a growing recognition that the expansion of the digital economy does not simply reflect the triumph of an unstoppable technological change. Behind Silicon Valley rhetoric, much of what appears to be technological innovation turns out to be a means of circumventing legal regulations, including minimum wage laws. By misclassifying its workers, Uber avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars into US state unemployment insurance schemes. Yet during the Covid-19 economic crisis, Uber lobbied the federal government to step in and pay its drivers’ unemployment benefits anyway. Why should Uber be entitled to have it both ways? It makes sense to demand that companies hire workers in stable jobs, or not be allowed to hire them in the first place. Yet in an environment of weak economic growth, this demand will be insufficient to win economic security for all. Capitalist economies have been able to extend security to widening circles of workers only in periods of rapid economic growth, when low rates of unemployment made it possible for more and more workers to demand better wages and working conditions. The era of high-speed economic growth ended long ago and is not coming back. High rates of economic growth in the mid-20th century – the reference point for any politics that seeks to restore economic growth in the present – were premised on a historically exceptional period. The restoration of stable international trade following two world wars made possible the largest growth of economic productive capacity in human history, not just in Europe and the United States, but worldwide. By the 1970s, rapid expansion had given way to worsening global overcapacity, resulting in rising competition and falling rates of investment in internationally traded goods. People were left scrambling for work in the growing service sector, where the potential for labour productivity growth, and hence economic growth, is significantly lower. Workers’ inability to find stable employment is thus not the result of recent advances in automation technologies, which, like driverless cars, have mostly failed to pan out. Their plight results from an everyday reality of low profitability in economies saturated with capital, and insufficient opportunities for its reinvestment, such that dividends and share buybacks have increasingly become the norm for surplus cash holdings. With shrinking opportunities for investment, enormous pools of capital have rushed into highly speculative ventures such as Uber and Lyft that have little capacity for demonstrated profitability. That governments turned a blind eye to Uber and Lyft’s misbehaviour for so long is no surprise. Governments are complicit in making workers more vulnerable. Facing persistently slow economic growth and high rates of unemployment, governments have spent decades trying to coax companies to invest by making it easier to deny workers’ benefits and to avoid paying taxes. Again, this bid to restore conditions of rapid economic growth, much like supply-side and trickle-down solutions that failed to produce generalised prosperity, was a failure. The Covid crisis has only made economic prospects less auspicious. People need security that is not tied to their job. The pandemic has revealed this imperative more than ever before. In a world that is as wealthy as ours, and given the technologies we have already produced – even without the realisation of the dreams of automation – everyone should have access to food, energy, housing and healthcare. If people had that security, why would they choose to work in terrible jobs where they are paid low wages? The owners of Uber and Lyft know that their business is predicated on a world in which they get to make the key decisions that shape our futures, without our input. The world of work is going to have to be democratised. They are just delaying what should be inevitable. • Aaron Benanav is a researcher at Humboldt University of Berlin. His first book, Automation and the Future of Work, will be published by Verso in November"

          "bodyText": "Boris Johnson attempted to reassert his grip over education after days of chaos by making a personal plea to parents to send their children back to the classroom in England in September. The prime minister, who was criticised for going on holiday to Scotland during the A-level debacle, has spoken out to say the risk of contracting coronavirus in school is low and that it is damaging for children to be out of education for any longer. His decision to personally front the return-to-school drive rather than Gavin Williamson, the beleaguered education secretary who has faced calls to quit over the fiasco, is part of a deliberate attempt to switch the “messenger” and win back the public, a senior Tory suggested. Johnson’s intervention comes after the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said children could be at greater harm by staying at home than attending school. Regarding the expected return on 1 September, Johnson said: “I have previously spoken about the moral duty to reopen schools to all pupils safely, and I would like to thank the school staff who have spent the summer months making classrooms Covid-secure in preparation for a full return in September. “We have always been guided by our scientific and medical experts, and we now know far more about coronavirus than we did earlier this year. As the chief medical officer has said, the risk of contracting Covid-19 in school is very small and it is far more damaging for a child’s development and their health and wellbeing to be away from school any longer. “This is why it’s vitally important that we get our children back into the classroom to learn and to be with their friends. Nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school.” Williamson faced calls to quit after pupils were given downgraded A-level results because of an algorithm applied by exams watchdog Ofqual, despite being warned of flaws in advance. This meant some pupils missed out on places at university and the government was forced into an embarrassing U-turn to allow teacher-assessed grades to be used instead. Tory poll ratings also narrowed to just two points ahead of Labour for the first time since Johnson became prime minister. Johnson was criticised for not publicly addressing the A-level issue and continuing with his holiday in Applecross in the Highlands until his location was discovered and the trip reportedly cut short. The chief medical officers and deputy chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales said in a joint statement they were confident the evidence showed an exceptionally small risk of children of primary or secondary school age dying from Covid-19. Schools in Scotland reopened earlier this month, while those in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to welcome all pupils from the beginning of September. Tory MP Robert Halfon, who is chair of the education select committee, said he understood parents would be worried but it would be a significant risk to keep children at home. He warned of an “epidemic of educational poverty”, while former minister Theresa Villiers said the prime minister was sending a strong signal that getting children back to school was a priority. “He’s gripping this and determined to get it done,” she said. Ahead of a delicate few weeks for the government, one senior Tory said: “Lots of Tory MPs think Gavin is now discredited so a different and better messenger was needed.” But another said: “Boris Johnson making these comments isn’t to do with Gavin although that will have had an impact. Education is the centre of everything that we are doing, so it’s got to come from the top and the clearer message the better.” Keir Starmer, however, said government incompetence and the chaos caused by the exams fiasco was putting the plans to get all children back to school at serious risk. In an interview with the Observer, the Labour leader said two crucial weeks were wasted dealing with a self-inflicted mess that has destroyed public confidence in government. Starmer said: “I want to see children back at school next month, and I expect the prime minister to deliver on that commitment. However, the commitment is now at serious risk after a week of chaos, confusion and incompetence from the government.” The Liberal Democrats’ education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said parents were worried and the government must rapidly upscale test and trace, and ensure schools had the mental health support, financial resources and the use of community spaces they needed before fully reopening. She said Williamson should be fired. “The country, and seemingly the prime minister, has lost faith in Gavin Williamson,” Moran said. “To restore confidence among parents, pupils and teachers the best thing the prime minister could do is sack him, rather than try to speak for him.” Teaching unions share the government’s ambition to get all children back to school, but remain concerned about safety and have called on ministers to draw up a plan B in the event of Covid-19 outbreaks affecting schools. Responding to the joint statement by UK chief medical officers about school reopening, Unison, which represents school support workers, said it was vital for staff to be allowed to wear face coverings, especially given the acknowledgement of a transmission risk between staff. “It’s still unclear why government guidance won’t allow them, when they’re recommended for other workplaces,” said Unison’s head of education, Jon Richards, who also called for more money to pay for specially trained cleaners to carry out regular deep cleans. He also requested proper social distancing measures in cramped conditions such as school kitchens. The National Education Union accused the government of being “negligent in the extreme” with no plan B in the case of further outbreaks and an insufficiently robust test and trace system. NEU joint general secretary Kevin Courtney said: “Today’s report by Public Health England shows that there were only a small number of outbreaks in schools after the partial wider opening in June, but as the report itself acknowledges there are limitations on the generalisability of its findings. “Schools and colleges need to know what should happen if an outbreak of the virus occurs in individual schools or more widely with either national, regional or local spikes.” The government has already promised a £1bn catch-up fund for schools and on Monday will unveil a package targeted at children in their first year of primary to boost their early language skills. Priority will be given to schools with a high proportion of disadvantaged pupils. Schools in England will be encouraged to apply for a share of a £9m early years programme to help reception-aged pupils whose education has been disrupted by coronavirus, and deliver one-to-one and small group support for five-year-olds. Children’s minister Vicky Ford said: “We cannot afford for our youngest children to lose out, which is why this package of support is focused on improving early language skills for the reception children who need it most, and especially those whose long-term outcomes have been affected by time out of education.”"

          "bodyText": "When play resumes in the morning, Jimmy Anderson will need two wickets to reach 600 in Tests. It’s going to happen tomorrow, surely. Please join us then! Stumps That’s the end of the day’s play, in fact. It’s been another good one for England, even though they had to work harder than some might have expected. Bad light stops play The players came back on the field - including Azhar Ali, who did a Peter Taylor and moved himself up to open - but the umpires decided the light wasn’t playable. Azhar Ali laughs as he receives another ovation from the Pakistan balcony, this time for his 0-ball 0 not out. The Pakistan captain Azhar Ali ends on 141 not out. He didn’t quite carry his bat, but he was at the crease from the third over of the innings until the 93rd. It was a mighty innings - defiant at first, breezy towards the end. After a few months of friction, the cricket bat is his friend again. At the fourth attempt, a catch is taken to give Jimmy Anderson his 29th five-for in Tests. Naseem edged the ball low towards third slip, where Sibley moved smartly to his left to take the catch. Anderson is now on 598 Test wickets, and finishes the innings with figures of 23-3-56-5. England have enforced the follow-on. 92nd over: Pakistan 273-9 (Azhar 141, Naseem 0) Archer replaces Broad, who has left the field. Azhar turns down a single off the first delivery and then smacks the last for four. That at least means Anderson can start an over at Naseem Shah. 91st over: Pakistan 267-9 (Azhar 135, Naseem 0) Azhar jumps across his crease to whip Anderson’s last delivery for a single and keep the strike. “Anderson will kill the next fielder to drop one,” says Andrew Goldsby. “It’s very funny to watch though. Like an Alex Ferguson presser when he had one on.” 90th over: Pakistan 266-9 (Azhar 134, Naseem 0) Azhar Ali plays a glorious on-drive for four off Broad. That might be the shot of the innings, and there have been a few. Later in the over, Broad gets an official warning for running on the pitch. 89th over: Pakistan 261-9 (Azhar 129, Naseem 0) It’s fair too say that James Anderson has a bit of a humour on - he’s had three catches dropped in two overs. “Hi Rob,” says David Hindle. “Further to the Jofra question. At what point is it better for him to find form outside the Test team rather than within it? Is a complete break from Tests perhaps the better option at the moment? Also, Mark Wood surely has a claim to be allowed a chance again after his performances in South Africa. He hasn’t been given much of a run this summer. Pinning hopes on the magic pace duo for the next Ashes, and ignoring the other bowling riches for no good reason could be a very costly strategy, but I fear that’s beginning to influence decisions in this regard.” Yeah, it’s an almost impossible balancing act, and everything England have done has been in good faith. I would certainly have given Wood at least one more game this summer, probably two or three, but the situation changes all the time. Anyway, this is the last Test for a while and that’s probably not a bad thing for Jofra, who can return to the white-ball side and start enjoying himself again. I would saving giving him a complete break from the Test team would be excessive, and risk creating problems that don’t exist; take him to Sri Lanka and India, if those tours go ahead, and go from there. A unique moment in Test cricket history. Azhar chips Anderson straight to mid-on, where Broad drops a simple catch. While Azhar tries to steal a single to keep the strike, and Anderson looks around for the hidden cameras, Broad picks up the loose ball and, mainly out of frustration, demolishes the stumps at the batsman’s end. That was very funny. 88th over: Pakistan 260-8 (Azhar 129, Abbas 0) Azhar Ali starts this innings straining for form. After a few hours at the crease, he can now do almost as he pleases. He belts Broad for consecutive boundaries, though there is almost a weird twist when he survives a run-out referral. Azhar dragged a ball from Broad onto his body and set off for a quick single, only to be sent back by Abbas. Broad kept running and hit the stumps from close range, but Azhar was just back home in time. “Michael Gough’s performance starting to get a bit scary now - I am suspecting some sort of filthy Faustian bargain,” says Brian Withington. “Buttler looks like he is a counter-signatory, too.” For those who aren’t familiar with him, Gough’s is a really interesting story. He played for Young England and scored millions of runs at age-group level, but struggled in senior cricket and fell completely out of love with the game. He retired at 23, took a break and then started again as an umpire. Fourteen years later he’s the best in the world. 87th over: Pakistan 252-8 (Azhar 120, Abbas 0) Azhar Ali is dropped by Burns off Anderson. It was a sharp chance at second slip when Azhar nicked a big drive, and the ball burst throught for four. Just as Buttler’s batting has affected his keeping, so Burns might well have taken that three weeks ago. That neat little theory has just been jiggered: Crawley has dropped Abbas at fourth slip. That was a simpler chance, relatively speaking, and Anderson’s face is a picture. 86th over: Pakistan 247-8 (Azhar 116, Abbas 3) The forecast for the next two days is iffy, and this is the last Test until goodness knows, so England will surely enforce the follow on onces they take the last two wickets. “In fairness, Rob,” says Matt Dony, “are there any situations at all where one of your first instincts wouldn’t be to go and talk to Eoin Morgan?” You make a good point. Before I answer properly, let me just ask Eoin Morgan what he thinks. Jos Buttler isn’t just having a day out; he’s having the whole weekend. Broad rammed in a short ball that Afridi fended down the leg side, and Buttler leapt to his right to take a spectacular one-handed catch. That was even better than the earlier one to dismiss Rizwan. Another brilliant catch from Jos Buttler! 85th over: Pakistan 247-7 (Azhar 116, Shaheen 3) Azhar survives a huge LBW shout from Anderson. That looked plumb, at least until I realised Michael Gough was the umpire. UltraEdge confirms the ball shaved the outside edge as Azhar tried to work to leg. Even by Michael Gough’s standards, that is a sensational piece of umpiring! Honestly, that’s as good as it gets. 84th over: Pakistan 246-7 (Azhar 116, Shaheen 2) “In relation to Dave Hindle’s queries regarding Archer’s bowling,” says Tom van der Gucht, “could it be said that all the hopping and weaving he draws out from the batsmen builds the pressure that allow the bowlers at the other end to take wickets? That’s what I’d be telling myself if I was Archer...” That theory, persuasive though it is, relies on him making batsmen hop all summer, which hasn’t been the case. He’s bowled poorly by his standards, though there are a few reasons for that. You know what would solve this, don’t you? Yep. It’s my great pleasure to introduce Expected Wickets (xW), a new performance metric that evaluates how old you were when you lost your virginity. 83rd over: Pakistan 244-7 (Azhar 114, Shaheen 2) Azhar takes a single off the fourth ball, which allows Anderson two balls at Shaheen. It’s almost enough, but Shaheen plays and misses at a lovely outswinger. 82nd over: Pakistan 243-7 (Azhar 113, Shaheen 2) Broad, bowling round the wicket to the left-hander, beats Shaheen with a monstrous delivery that straightens and kicks so sharply as to almost knock Jos Buttler off his feet. “It’s puerile, but I must beg for help,” says Meghan Purvis. “We’re in a pub with no sound on, and thus no explanation for the repeated zooms on Buttler’s box. Did it play a part in his catch, or are we debating whether there’s a Spinal Tap situation happening in his trousers?” I’ve no idea. You’re welcome! They might have been focussing on the webbing in his gloves, which are usually in close proximity to his other bit, because of the way he caught Rizwan,. Or maybe he has added another motivational slogan in an unlikely place. Good old new ball. Yasir has gone, caught smartly at second slip by Joe Root. He was surprised by a good delivery from Broad that popped from a length and took a big deflection off the outside edge. Root did the rest with a two-handed reaction catch above his head. 81st over: Pakistan 241-6 (Azhar 113, Yasir 20) This has been a new-ball pitch, so England will expect to wrap the innings up in the next hour. With that in mind, Jimmy Anderson returns to the attack. His third ball zips past Yasir, who then flick-pulls jauntily for four with one foot off the ground. Shot! “Is there a bit of a pattern emerging with Jofra’s bowling?” wonders David Hindle. “Spectacular, ultra-fast, batsmen ducking, diving, weaving, and... no wickets taken. Aussie quicks certainly do this differently. How exactly? He has the pace, but something else must be wrong at this point, surely? What is it exactly? He’s just out of form and having a bit of an identity crisis, not helped but some well-meaning but hamfisted management. Don’t forget he took 22 wickets at 20 in four Ashes Tests, including one JFK spell and another couple of epics. If everyone holds their nerve, he’ll be fine. The first thing I would do, if I were Joe Root and Chris Silverwood, is talk to Eoin Morgan about the situation. 80th over: Pakistan 236-6 (Azhar 113, Yasir 15) Yasir drives Woakes nicely down the ground for three, then Azhar square drives him beautifully for four. Time for the second new ball. 79th over: Pakistan 228-6 (Azhar 107, Yasir 13) Yasir edges Bess between Buttler and Root at slip for four. Root, who was standing quite wide, moves to a more orthodox slip position to get a better view of the horse’s backside. 78th over: Pakistan 220-6 (Azhar 107, Yasir 5) 77th over: Pakistan 218-6 (Azhar 106, Yasir 4) The timing of that wicket is perfect for England as they can now attack the tail with the second new ball. Jimmy Anderson (597*) could yet reach 600 in this innings. 76th over: Pakistan 215-6 (Azhar 105, Yasir 2) The change in Jos Buttler since that matchwinning innings in the first Test has been fascinating to watch. We’ve seen it a million times before but it never becomes boring. A bonus wicket for England, and a brilliant catch from Jos Buttler. Rizwan tickled a poor delivery from Woakes down the leg side, where Buttler swooped to his left to grab the ball in the webbing of his left glove. He’d have dropped that three weeks ago. 75th over: Pakistan 213-5 (Azhar 105, Rizwan 53) Bess has switched to round the wicket, with a slip and leg slip in place. With Pakistan cruising, it wouldn’t be a bad time for Joe Root to bring himself on at the other end. 74th over: Pakistan 210-5 (Azhar 104, Rizwan 51) Now that Azhar Ali has reached his hundred, attention turns to the second new ball. It’s due in six overs’ time, and England sure need it. For now, it’s drinks. “Surely your reply to Pete Salmon refers to an appeal going against Gough by the batting side,” says Brian Ross, “and Pete specified appeals by the fielding side…” Well, the DRS stats are based on all appeals, and I think Blackwood’s was the first of any kind that Gough had been advised to overturn since the Bronze Age. I probably phrased it clumsily, or misread Pete’s email. But you can’t pick and choose: a mistake is a mistake is a mistake. And Gough makes very few of then. 73rd over: Pakistan 210-5 (Azhar 104, Rizwan 51) It’s there! Azhar reaches three figures with a pristine cover drive for four and waves his bat to the sky. Who needs a crowd: there was a huge cry of celebration from the Pakistan balcony as the ball pierced the infield and they knew their captain had done it. That’s such an impressive innings, full of clarity, determination and skill. He’s scored 17 Test hundreds; he knows how to bat. 72nd over: Pakistan 204-5 (Azhar 99, Rizwan 50) Chris Woakes replaces Jofra Archer, and Azhar clips him confidently to the square-leg boundary to move to 99. I pity the fool who begrudes Azhar Ali a century - but the fool almost gets his wish when Azhar comes this close to edging a beautiful delivery from Woakes. Wasim Akram reckons it was a hint of reverse swing that beat Azhar there. Who made him the authority on reverse swing? “You mentioned Michael Gough being an eerily good umpire,” says Pete Salmon. “Further research shows he hasn’t had the fielding side overturn a decision against him since 2016. Since them 33 reviews, 29 struck down, four umpire’s call. Are we watching the Bradman of umpires here? It’s getting to the point spectators might go to games just to watch him umpire.” Heh, nice payoff. Funnily enough Mike Atherton mentioned Bradman as well today. But Gough did have a decision overturned earlier this summer when he gave Jermaine Blackwood out in the third Test at Old Trafford. It’s no biggie, but I’m a bit surprised you can’t remember where you were at 4.18pm on 25 July 2020. 71st over: Pakistan 200-5 (Azhar 94, Rizwan 50) Rizwan swishes Bess over wide mid-off for six to reach a spunky half-century from 103 balls. He’s such an impressive cricketer: a brilliant keeper, a chipper, intelligent batsman and a hard-nosed competitor. 70th over: Pakistan 193-5 (Azhar 94, Rizwan 44) Archer has gone around the wicket now to ram bouncers over the head of Rizwan. This is like watching a parody. Whatever Archer’s faults this summer, and I’m not suggesting he’s blameless, England are handling him dismally. 69th over: Pakistan 192-5 (Azhar 93, Rizwan 44) 68th over: Pakistan 186-5 (Azhar 90, Rizwan 41) Root has decided that Archer should bowl some rough stuff at Rizwan, with no slips and men scattered everywhere. This is confused nonsense, I’m afraid; Archer has bowled eight of the last 11 overs at this end. It’s not short, it’s not sharp, but it is sh- [that’ll do! - ed] “I think Ofqual would have been better off never using a grading algorithm and just getting Michael Gough in,” says Brian Withington. “And then refusing any appeal as inherently pointless. The man is an invincible machine.” 67th over: Pakistan 185-5 (Azhar 90, Rizwan 40) Bess replaces Broad, and Azhar sweeps a couple to move into the nineties. 66th over: Pakistan 183-5 (Azhar 88, Rizwan 40) A short ball from Archer is uppercut easily for four by Rizwan. Archer’s promising start to the innings is starting to evaporate. Since the end of last summer he has taken 16 wickets at 45 apiece, which would have been unthinkable during those blistering Ashes spells. Scott Roberts has a theory as to what’s gone wrong. “I realise that I’m going over old ground here,” he says, “and the readers are probably bored silly of me bringing this up, but I STILL don’t know why Jofra has changed his release position at the crease and it’s driving me bananas, as it’s clearly affecting his performance. “It’s easy to go back to last summer on the YouTubes and you will see he’s right next to the stumps bowling wicket to wicket, but he’s now defaulting to angling the ball into the right hander from the middle of the crease (leaking far more runs down the leg side), almost a la Craig White, which is something definitely not to be emulated. And to this day I have not seen/heard either Sky or TMS mention it even as a passing comment, even though this is glaringly obvious to me. I’m starting to contemplate ripping a tissue I’m so frustrated that Jofra is a shadow of his former incredible best.” That sounds like an extremely good spot. Bit harsh on Craig White, mind. Whatever the reason/s, I’m sure Jofra will be fine in time, as he’s too gaood not to be. But I must say I didn’t see these struggles coming. He was incredible during the Ashes. 65th over: Pakistan 177-5 (Azhar 88, Rizwan 34) Rizwan clunks a pull off Broad that loops into the leg side for a single. Broad, though not at his penetrative best, has been very economical: 15-4-23-0. 64th over: Pakistan 176-5 (Azhar 88, Rizwan 33) It’s getting gloomy in Southampton. The lights are on, the alarm rang loud and Azhar Ali didn’t see a thing as that delivery from Archer bounced past his outside edge. His eyesight was more effective when he belted the ball of the over for four. “Good afternoon Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “I’m sorry but I must take issue with Charles Sheldrick. No self-respecting Somerset person would voluntarily drink Devon (or any other) cider, if Somerset cider is available. In a ghastly hypothetical situation where no Somerset cider is to be found and one finds oneself in a state of advanced inebriation wishing to maintain a steady equilibrium one MIGHT take a few sips of non-Somerset cider to avoid a dangerous drift into sobriety, but then and only then might it be given serious consideration.” 63rd over: Pakistan 170-5 (Azhar 84, Rizwan 32) Azhar survives a huge LBW appeal after being hit on the toe by a brilliant yorker from Broad. England have no reviews left after some indulgent nonsense earlier in the innings. Normally I would say that looked plumb - but the umpire who said not out was Michael Gough, and what is plumb anyway? Inevitably, replays show that Gough’s decision was correct; the ball was sliding past leg stump. He is an eerily good umpire. 62nd over: Pakistan 169-5 (Azhar 83, Rizwan 32) Archer also returns after tea, which is a bit of surprise given he was only out of the attack for four overs. The spells are supposed to be short and sharp, not the break between them. Rizwan hits a couple of classy boundaries, the first a cut stroke and the second a lovely straight drive. 61st over: Pakistan 161-5 (Azhar 83, Rizwan 24) Stuart Broad is going to start after tea. I’d imagine this will be a short spell, four overs maximum, probably to be followed by a longer one with the second new ball. Nothing much happens in the first over. 60th over: Pakistan 158-5 (Azhar 82, Rizwan 22) Bess produces a peach to beat Azhar Ali with the last ball before tea. Buttler fumbled the ball and the reactions hinted at a dropped catch; UltraEdge showed it hit the thigh but not the outside edge. That ends a really good session for Pakistan. I’m not sure what it means for the match but Azhar Ali’s 82 not out - a proud, clear-headed innings - has increased his chances of staying as Test captain. See you at 4.15pm for a mammoth evening session. 59th over: Pakistan 157-5 (Azhar 82, Rizwan 21) “Have you seen this?” says Charles Sheldrick. “Cider all round at tea time tomorrow methinks! Devon cider of course...” Somerset are in serious form this summer, the Overtons in particular. Idiot question: would this be their first county championship or is it a completely separate trophy? 58th over: Pakistan 152-5 (Azhar 78, Rizwan 20) A nice stroke from Azhar, who guides Bess past point for three. He plays an even better one later in the over, whirling an emphatic sweep to the square-leg boundary. This is all very comfortable for Pakistan, who have responded superbly after slipping to 30 for four this morning. 57th over: Pakistan 144-5 (Azhar 71, Rizwan 19) None of us really care, and maybe we never will, but it could be that the result here will ultimately decide whether England qualify for the final of the inaugural World Test Championship. In 100 years’ time, historians will marvel at how apathetic we all were. Either that or Test cricket will be dead and the world will have ended, it could go either way. 56th over: Pakistan 143-5 (Azhar 70, Rizwan 19) Bess replaces Archer, who was again used in a four-over spell. I’m not completely sold on that tactic but it’s worth a try, especially given his slight identity crisis in recent Tests. Bess starts with a quiet over that is milked for a couple. 55th over: Pakistan 141-5 (Azhar 69, Rizwan 18) There is a bowling change, with Woakes replacing Anderson. He starts with a no-ball, only the third of his Test career, and then has a big LBW shout against Azhar Ali turned down by Michael Gough. I reckon there was an inside edge; not that it matters as England are out of reviews. Replays show it was kissing the leg bail, so it would have stayed with the on-field decision anyway. We’re none the wiser as to whether there was an inside edge. “Time for the skipper to think outside the box-shaped envelope and bring himself on for a twirl,” says Ian Copestake. “Change the state of play.” County latest You’ll have seen this, then. 54th over: Pakistan 139-5 (Azhar 69, Rizwan 17) Rizwan jumps up to cut Archer crisply for three, and then Azhar Ali slams an excellent pull through square leg for four. It’s time for Bess I think, probably at Anderson’s end, because the seamers are getting very little help with the old ball. Excellent batting. 53rd over: Pakistan 132-5 (Azhar 65, Rizwan 14) Azhar back cuts Anderson elegantly for four more. This is such an important innings for Azhar, only his second 50+ score in eight Tests since becoming the regular captain. He gets some bonus runs later in the over because of a loose throw from Bess. Anderson has the face on; you know the one. 52nd over: Pakistan 122-5 (Azhar 56, Rizwan 13) A short ball from Archer hits Rizwan on the grille. He seems okay, though there’s a break in play while he is checked by the physio.Rizwan tried to sway out of the way at the last minute but it was too late and it rammed into his grille. He’s fine to continue and walks back to his crease with a smile on his face. The follow-up deliveries are fuller, straight and defended solidly by Rizwan. Though he remains wicketless, Archer has bowled with eye-catching menace in this innings. 51st over: Pakistan 122-5 (Azhar 56, Rizwan 13) Cheers Daniel, hello everyone. That new-ball spell from Jimmy Anderson looks even more valuable now, as batting is relatively comfortable against the old one. Azhar Ali has plenty of time to steer Anderson to third man for four. Given the circumstances, team and individual, he’s played really well. 50th over: Pakistan 117-5 (Azhar 52, Rizwan 13) It sort of feels like Archer’s on a countdown here, and I’m not feeling it, though I’m certain his body is. Priorities please Joe! Meanwhile, Azhar is coming on an innings, and when he’s offered some width, he climbs in, cutting hard to the fence. So Archer retorts with some short stuff, before one towards the pads it caressed through midwicket for four more, and that’s a very tenacious fifty for him. That’s also the end of my day – here’s Rob Smyth to coax you through the rest. 49th over: Pakistan 109-5 (Azhar 44, Rizwan 13) How far are England from being a proper Test outfit? The openers are functional, but if they can knock the shine off the ball, then what’s behind them is starting to look like something. Crawley is your ideal no3 in theory – he’s got the game to open, and the game to play in the middle-order, if he can find the consistency to match his talent – below him are proven players, though the captain could do with some runs, and the pace attack is a joke. Anyway, Anderson continues and Rizwan reminds us yet again that he won’t wait to be asked, slashing Anderson hard through backward point for four – I absolutely love watching him – the only runs from the over. 48th over: Pakistan 105-5 (Azhar 44, Rizwan 9) Right, Archer is back. Can he crank it up from the off, and give England four overs of pure him? His first is 83mph, but by his fourth he’s up at 87, only for Azhar to half-bat a boundary-four. That’s 600 Test runs for him, and the balcony applaud the achievement; there follow drinks. “This is where your Stokes would come on and wipe the sleep from everyone’s eyes,” says Ian Copestake. “He’s probably doing run-ups in whichever NZ backyard he is currently in.” Not bad to have as your fifth change. 47th over: Pakistan 101-5 (Azhar 40, Rizwan 9) Anderson wallops Rizwan on the thigh pad; there’s a strangulated appeal, but it was going down, I think, and England have already spaffed their reviews. But have a look! Rizwan nicks Anderson’s final delivery, which drops just short of Buttler. The cordon have been pretty close all day, so I don’t think they need to move – the pitch is still offering bounce. Anyway, maiden. 46th over: Pakistan 101-5 (Azhar 40, Rizwan 9) Does anyone love anything more than Stuart Broad loves taking wickets? He willpowers his second delivery into lifting for him, but Azhar manages to get his hands out of the road, just. He then raises his team’s hundred with a run-down behind square on the off side, and it’s probably about time for Archer. 45th over: Pakistan 99-5 (Azhar 38, Rizwan 9) Here’s Jimmy. Anderson is back, and Azhar takes his second ball for a single, then Rizwan helps one off his pads and around the corner for two. Meanwhile, what a stat this is from @WisdenCricket: “James Anderson has taken more Test wickets since turning 30 (329 @ 23.88) than all other England bowlers across the entirety of their careers, with the exceptions of Stuart Broad (511) and Ian Botham (383).” “I suspect most, if not all, readers will be aware that I share a surname with an extremely famous former football player and coach,” says Phil Keegan. “Back in the late 70s, my younger brother, around 12 or 13 at the time, was playing in a school football match against another school and got into a spat with a player on the other team. It was almost certainly my brother’s fault, he was a bolshy little bastard. He still is actually. Anyway, the referee, who was from the other school, decided to book both the kids and asked for my brother’s name (there were no yellow and red cards back then). At this time teachers always referred to kids by their surnames only, so my brother told him his surname, upon which he was promptly sent off for insolence. When all the other kids in the team ran forward screaming that it really was his name, the referee, somewhat suspiciously, rescinded the sending off.” 44th over: Pakistan 96-5 (Azhar 37, Rizwan 7) As Broad charges through another maiden – his final delivery nips back and hits the back pad, but the umpire says no, even when the fingers start waggling – both Anderson and Archer stretch. I’m surprised we’ve not seen the former again, given this is the last Test of the summer and he doesn’t play limited overs. A reply then shows the impact of that final delivery was outside the line. “Rizwan has only played eight tests so far,” says Adam Hirst, “which is amazing for a 28-year old of his quality. He actually looks like he might be worth a middle-order pick on his batting alone. Wish Sky would do a piece on his repertoire of extravagant tosses to first slip after taking leaves and playnmisses. If you haven’t noticed yet, they’re fabulously stylish, over his head, behind his back, one like a Catherine wheel after a diving take.. Don’t think we’ll see any more this series though.” Yeah, his attitude looks perfect, and the easy, dismissive showmanship is just a part of it. 43rd over: Pakistan 96-5 (Azhar 37, Rizwan 7) Bess gives one some air and Azhar clatters it to the fence at square leg for four, then clumps four more through backward point. If he can make a score here, that will be something significant for the team to take home, because speculation over the skipper is an annoyance they can do without. 42nd over: Pakistan 88-5 (Azhar 29, Rizwan 7) Broad would quite like a wicket but has to make do with a maiden. “I did like Shane Warne saying Root looks more like Ellen Degeneres every day,” says David Brown. “By the way , on the subject of names my grandfather had a valet called Mr Crease and a chauffeur named Plugs.” A chauffeur! 41st over: Pakistan 88-5 (Azhar 29, Rizwan 7) Nasser notes that Buttler is staying down a little longer to Bess, which is what enabled him to take that catch. But then he misses one that turns, bounces and takes pad – he must be relieved there was no bat involved – and the batsmen run two leg byes. Rizwan, who looks an excellent cricketer, then decides he’s had enough of doing nothing, so clouts a sweep to the fence at backward square then, when Bess strays to leg, shovels three more around the corner. 40th over: Pakistan 79-5 (Azhar 29, Rizwan 0) It’s actually Broad who returns. He’s not been at his best in this innings and Azhar turns him into the on side for two, but his fifth delivery, a wobble seamer, is far too good, nipping away past the bat. In commentary, Strauss notes that the ability to take the ball past the outside edge is one he’s rediscovered this summer, and cites it as the principal reason for his success. That and simply being Stuart Expletive Broad, I guess. “It’s all good having a legspinner,” says Yaser, “but unless you’re called Shane, you need certain surfaces to thrive. So far the Pakistani part-timers and now Bess, offies, have thrived. As Lyon has shown, there’s isn’t a substitute for good off-spin bowling.” Yes, for a while it looked like they were in trouble, but DRS hauled them back into the game – though that Shah lad looks alright too. 39th over: Pakistan 77-5 (Azhar 27, Rizwan 0) Bess is enjoying himself now, bowling to a slip and a short leg. Azhar turns his final delivery to the on side and they run one, the only scoring off the over. Surely we’ll see Anderson soon? “I have just introduced my wife and daughter to the OBO,” says Michael Scott. “They are hooked and have two contributions: My daughter once worked in a haberdashery. “A woman walked in, picked up some buttons and said ‘Will these match my coat?’ ‘Have you got your coat madam?’ ‘No it’s at home.’ My wife was assured by a client that she had been given apostrophes for her constipation – presumably to work on her colon.” They’re of tantamount importance. 38th over: Pakistan 76-5 (Azhar 26, Rizwan 0) Archer is back on, and he’s there at mid off to cut off a shove from Azhar; they run one. “Obviously with a name like Salmon I try and avoid any Piscean stuff as an opening gambit, says Pete Salmon. “Generally my calls to call centres go ‘Salmon. Salmon. S A L M O N. No, not F, S. Salmon. Salmon. Like the fish.’ Fun fact – Salmon in fact has nothing to do with fish, I tell them, it is from Shelemo, thus shalom, meaning peace obviously. See also Solomon and Suleyman.” Peter Peace sounds extremely literary. Perhaps it’s time for a dead poll. 37th over: Pakistan 75-5 (Azhar 25, Rizwan 0) I like Bess, I must say – he seems to be made of the right stuff. He bowled well in the first Test of the summer, and though i wonder if he’s getting picked because of the batting and fielding, given a relative dearth of options, I think England are right to persevere with him, though Leach is a more obvious option against opponents with mainly right-handers. Wicket maiden. And there we go! Bess tosses one up and hits the rough, with Fawad already forward, looking to attack. The ball turns, bounces, kisses the edge ... and Buttler takes a smart catch at almost shoulder-height. 37th over: Pakistan 75-4 (Azhar 25, Fawad 22) Athers noted, during Bess’ last over, that these are perfect conditions for him: drying pitch, footmarks to hit, runs on the board, middle-order under pressure.... 36th over: Pakistan 75-4 (Azhar 25, Fawad 22) Woakes continues; he’s doing well really, because the other quicks look likelier. Anyhow, Archer is off the pitch for the now, with James Bracey replacing him, and we rattle through another maiden. “Maybe Mr Starbuck was just lucky,” emails Rollo Treadway. “I’ve never been offered even the tiniest hotel discount (and I’m even related to them, if very distantly), although my brother did once steal a branded ice bucket. Not sure five-finger discount is quite the same thing, though.” Gosh, what a day this is for the Harris family library! Perhaps you might get one of these for nowt? 35th over: Pakistan 75-4 (Azhar 25, Fawad 22) A maiden from Bess, and that’s drinks. “While I can only sympathise with Phil West’s predicament,” says Wayne Trotman, “from 1981 when I came to Turkey, until the arrival of Wayne Rooney on the scene and the establishment of the correct pronunciation, for many years I was called ‘Winer’, ‘Whiner’, ‘Vain’, and ‘Weigh-in’.” That’s brilliant – a forgotten consequence of his full England debut. 34th over: Pakistan 75-4 (Azhar 25, Fawad 22) Woakes isn’t quite there today, and Azhar clips two off his first ball, directed towards the pads. They’re the only runs from the over, but England are letting this drift. The lead is down to a paltry 508. “Your mention of Breaking Bad following Tony White’s aftershave anecdote brought to mind this product I encountered near the checkouts in Boyes. Who on earth watched that show and then thought: ‘I know what I want to smell of’?” What’s wrong with good old Lynx Marine? 33rd over: Pakistan 73-4 (Azhar 23, Fawad 22) I’m slightly surprised Bess is bowling. On the one hand, he needs overs, and England need to see what he has. On the other, they’ve got four seamers and conditions are in their favour. One off the over, to Azhar through point, but not much threat. 32nd over: Pakistan 72-4 (Azhar 22, Fawad 22) No, here comes Woakesie. This is the thing with that Archer tactic: as we discussed before, sometimes it takes him a while to get going, and he’s been removed from the attack just as he found his groove. Perhaps this is a good lesson for him: hit it immediately. Anyway, two singles from the over, which is to say that this is becoming a really useful and gutsy partnership. “Woakes will no doubt prove me wrong again,” says Felix Wood, “but the last few overs show again why he should not be given the new ball, even in favourable conditions. He just gives away too many runs. And referencing an earlier discussion, at age 22 I was mainly not being selected for England in any sports discipline, let alone scoring a Test-match double century. I have maintained this stance every year since, making up in consistency what I lack in talent.” I don’t think Woakes will get the new ball very often given those senior to him, but I think he cold be pretty nifty with it. 31st over: Pakistan 70-4 (Azhar 21, Fawad 20) One off this latest Bess over, but here comes Jofra! I’m impressed with the Starbuck free espresso method and suggest it might be adapted for indefinite future freeloading by having a number of fake IDs made and kept in one’s wallet in the name of Wagamama, McDonald and Nando. Which sounds like a multinational firm of solicitors by the way. I would say what larks but wizard wheeze is my go to expression, as per Jennings &amp; Darbishire, such splendid fellows. I never thought I’d do this, but you’ve pressed me into a shelfie. Which, for some reason, the system has turned around. 30th over: Pakistan 69-4 (Azhar 21, Fawad 19) Let’s be real, that Bess over was just a placeholder till this next Archer one. He is absolutely flying in – his last was his quickest of the summer and this one looks even sharpe, every ball over 90mph. This is thrilling stuff, but Azhar gets himself down the other end thanks a leg bye and Fawad mistimes a pull for three. The partnership is 39, and Archer is getting vex. 29th over: Pakistan 65-4 (Azhar 21, Fawad 16) Woakes, who’s been wayward by his standards, is thanked; Bess comes on. You’ll be amazed to discover Warne thinks this is a wise ruse. Four off the over. 28th over: Pakistan 61-4 (Azhar 21, Fawad 12) That was a very interesting over from Archer, as the old Chinese curse would have it. The ball brushed the shoulder. England are out of reviews. I heard something, though I don’t think this is the standard the laws are seeking. 28th over: Pakistan 61-4 (Azhar 21, Fawad 12) After a single to Azhar, Archer’s around the wicket to Fawad; perhaps it’s time for some teeth music. And there’s a bouncer, 91mph – enjoy! – then a dot then another at 92mph. Fawad then leaps to fend off a rib-seeker – 93mph – ! – and the batsmen are allowed to sneak one. Archer, who was working over Fawad, is not pleased, but then another lifter appears to be edged behind There’s a noise for sure, and an appeal, but the umpire says no... 27th over: Pakistan 57-4 (Azhar 20, Fawad 11) In commentary, they’re spending time insulting each other’s appearance, which tells you that things have slowed down in the middle. Azhar, though, turns Woakes around the corner for two then pulls him for one, and I wonder at what point Anderson will return to complete his all-10. “Years ago my mother worked in a bank,” says Alex McGillivray, “and would come home and regale us with stories of all kinds of weird, hilarious names - P. Sample, P. Brain, MT Wallett, Aaron Micock etc, but perhaps the best went like this: ‘Good morning, Lloyd’s Bank.’ ‘Oh hello, my name is Strange.’ ‘Ok ... what is it?’ In fairness, your mum did start it by calling him Lloyd’s Bank. 26th over: Pakistan 56-4 (Azhar 17, Fawad 11) This is an iffy over from Archer, but his fifth ball is good, leaping off a length and addressing Faward in the midriff. “Not enough good ones,” says Warne, and he’s right. Maiden. “When I first came to Turkey in 1987 (before internet and everyone with computers),” says Phil West, “I filled in a form to be in the Istanbul Phone Book – remember those? One small problem, Turkish does not have the letter W - although it did have a place on Turkish typewriters. Now that QWERTY is standard for computer companies this is no longer an issue, but I digress. The new book duly arrived, I turned to the “W” section and low and behold, I was not in it. Eventually I found my entry under VVest P, under the VVashington and above the VVhite.” I wonder what they did with Breaking Bad. 25th over: Pakistan 56-4 (Azhar 17, Fawad 11) Fawad squirts Woakes into the on side for one; I’m not sure what shot he was attempting there, but I’m certain it wasn’t the one that he played. A leg bye follows, then a leaping force wide of gully for two, and an edge through slip for three. Fawad is racking them up now! 24th over: Pakistan 49-4 (Azhar 17, Fawad 5) Archer delays taking off his jersey for as long as possible, as you might, then Azhar glances his loosener for four. He responds superbly, with an unexpected yorker – it’s far too good, squaring the batsman French-cricket style and bashing the pad. Archer thinks he’s got him, but his appeal is rejected and there’s no review – rightly so, because the ball was going down. “Way way back at junior school,” says Tony White, “when ink was really ink and wells were topped up by the week’s ink monitor, in the term after Christmas a fellow oik brought a bottle of aftershave into school to dose around as his father had found it unserviceable. It smelled of battery acid. And we were at a loss of how to make use of this enticing element. Until ... someone poured a few drops into an inkwell. Instantly the combination frothed up and out onto the desk. A calm seriousness kicked in, the mess was wiped clean and we waited for the first lesson after break. At a suitably boring period the chemical experiment was repeated : ‘Sir, sir, SIR, look’ ‘Is it poisonous?’ ‘Crikey!!’ ‘I feel sick!’ ‘I think I’m going to faint ..’ We milked it. The headmaster was sought, all inkwells were changed, an inquisition held... no culprits. But suspicions. The second attempt was not treated in the same way. Detention times 26 boys.” 23rd over: Pakistan 45-4 (Azhar 13, Fawad 5) The lights are on, the sky is grey, some swing bowling, to make the day, as Buddy Holly didn’t sing. And Woakes immediately finds some away movement, before a no ball and a three, caressed square by Azhar, make this the most profitable over of the day so far. Still, though, it’s heartening to see Ollie Pope charging and diving to save the boundary and prevent the lead from dwindling to to a mere 539. “I once went into a Starbucks and gave them my surname,” says John Starbuck. “They didn’t believe me until I showed them ID, then gave me a large size espresso but only charged for a small one.” The nepotism on which Britain was built, right there. It looks like it’ll be Woakes with the ball, England’s third-change opening bowler. There are still 85 overs to be bowled in the day. Tea will be at 3.55pm BST, and we can play till 7.30 pm. “A fair few years ago,” says Damian (with an ‘a’) Clarke, “I booked a hotel in Aberystwyth, and as usual, dictated ‘Clarke with an e’ to the receptionist on the phone. When we got there there was no booking for us, and as the hotel was full, we were forced to seek an alternative. Happily it turned out much nicer, but on arriving home after the holiday, I chased it up with the original. After a while, it was admitted that they had a booked no show, under the name of Clark Withany. My colleagues still call me Mr. Withany.” Lucky you only gave a surname eh? I once went into Starbucks and spelt out my surname. The cup had “James Deltaechobravo” scrawled on the side says James Debens. The cup had ‘James Deltaechobravo’ scrawled on the side.” Amazing, must’ve felt like you were in this photo. “Hi,” begins Paul Ward ominously. “‘What larks’ first appears in chapter 27, in Biddy’s letter to Pip.” Telt. Assuming there’s no more weather. The players are taking an early lunch. “Regarding the old tale of a child swinging on a chair and breaking their neck,” says Ben O’Connell, “I can say with some certainty that it is alive and well. Having taught primary and secondary I’ve been guilty of using a version of it many a time; however the older students are wise to it now and understand why it’s said. Some go along with the charade, while others see it for the largely ineffective tool that it is. Meanwhile, Jimmy may wear 613 but he’s the 614th player to play Test-match cricket for England. But I do like the poetry of him finishing with a total identical to a shirt number he wore for his whole career (and better than 9 in many ways!)”. I assume Alan Jones is the other one? “‘[T]he subject of sarcastic schoolkids (over 21)’” says Ian Copestake, “made me wonder why they were still at school at such an advanced age.” My exegesis is that we’re all schoolkids even once we’ve left school. “Your York Notes haven’t led you too far astray,” says Adrian Armstrong. “From Chapter 57: ‘Which dear old Pip, old chap,’ said Joe, ‘you and me was ever friends. And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride - what larks!’ So in that context, the phrase anticipates future merriment. As in: “‘And when Jofra and Mark are fit enough to bowl together at the Gabba,’ said Joe...”. Magwitch and Compeyson won’t know what’s hit them. Patrice Evra is a footballer, yes, but this isn’t really about football. “On the subject of sarcastic schoolkids (over 21),” says Adam Simpson, “a favourite saying round our way back in the day was, ‘I got this chair from Shackletons, you know’ whenever anyone had to sit on a particularly uncomfortable school chair. It was inspired by this classic TV advert. To give some cricketing context, we were used to experiencing discomfort, this being around the time of the 1989.” Tangentially, is the swinging on a school chair broken-neck epidemic still going? Or was that a purely 80s fabrication fad. It’s extremely grey out there, greyer than John Major’s Spitting Image puppet. “Greetings from Slovakia,” says George Browne. “Where it is also raining. Just so you know.” My mum knew a woman with your surname. She once told someone is was “Browne, with an ‘e’, then received post addressed to “Mrs Brownwitheney.” Pakistan trail England by 542 runs, with six first-innings wickets intact. Seriously. I don’t think this’ll be a long stoppage. During the last one, I took a few minutes to clean my kitchen skylight, which had been vandalised by a passing bird. I wonder what Mrs Harris has in store for me next! It’s going to be one of those days, I’m afraid, but at least we get the amusement of Sturt Broad having the ball taken from him just as he was about to end the Pakistan innings with six lbws in six balls. 22nd over: Pakistan 41-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 5) Archer into the attack – I wonder if his extra pace might force Fawad to go through his movements quicker than he’d like. But he’s not there with his pace quite yet, although Fawad is still mad keen to get down the other end when he lays bat on ball; Azhar rightly sends him back. Archer then goes around the wicket to bowl his final delivery, which completes a maiden. “Enjoying the coverage,” says Keith Fisken, “and to build on James’s theme, Anderson has long since passed mine and Tarzan’s favourite Mazda, the 323...” I was always more a fan of the double sport turbo cleansing super-duper nitro producer 8325600. 21st over: Pakistan 41-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 5) Fawad takes another single and then Anderson diddles Azhar like he’s a child on reins, enticing him to play forward then spiriting the ball past the back with late away swing. That was too good. “So glad to read this snippet from Great Expectations!” says Diana Powell. “A favourite saying of mine - what larks.” A favourite saying of a generation of sarcastic schoolkids, I shouldn’t wonder, though I must confess that I joined it with “dear old Pip, dear old chap”. I can’t say for sure, as I only read York Notes, but I don’t think the two lines appear in the book together. Does enjambement exist in prose? 20th over: Pakistan 40-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 4) Broad is desperate for a wicket here, though that’s not saying much; he was probably spent nine months in the womb appealing to his placenta. Maiden. “I can’t remember the series but I remember when Stokes suddenly became a world class batsman and it coincided with him having the confidence to face a lot of balls and still be there to cash in later,” emails John Busby Buttler is such a talent. Like Stokes before him it looks like he has gone away and worked hard to develop his defensive technique. This summer he has had the confidence to leave and defend. Hopefully, Buttler can keep building on his batting success this summer and have stellar test career. Credit is due to the England setup which seem to have realised/remembered how to bat to have success in test cricket and given Buttler time to develop as a player.” I think South Africa 2017 was when he started to appreciate just how good he was, but the consistent scoring probably started in the 2019 West Indies tour. 19th over: Pakistan 40-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 4) Fawad turns Anderson off his pads for two, Woakes chasing about the boundary to keep Pakistan to two. “The heavens just opened here in Stubbington, about five miles south-east of the Rose Bowl,” says Brad McMillan. “Only for a few minutes mind, so the groundsmen will do well to get the covers on before the shower stops ... if it hits at all, given the prevailing wind is from the south west, and the weather is often diverted by the Isle of Wight. Anyway, this is my first (and probably last) attempt at being an actual weather forecaster, so from now I’ll concentrate on watching Jimmy end this innings on 597, with Broad and Archer sharing the next six wickets between them.” 18th over: Pakistan 38-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 2) Broad is working himself into his spell. Azhar shoves his first ball for two towards cover and Broad charges in in response, almost inciting an edge, but Azhar keeps his bat to himself, just about. “When Jimmy gets to 606,” says Ian Forth, “I would love it if he ran to the camera and pulled up his shirt to reveal a tee showing a smiling David Mellor with a pair of BBC headphones on.” Mellor, goodness me. What a carry-on that was. 17th over: Pakistan 36-4 (Azhar 8, Fawad 2) Azhar bumps Anderson to mid off and they run one. This is a huge innings for him because ultimately the most important aspect of captaincy is leading from the front and he’s not done much of that lately. Lunch, by the way, is now at 1.30pm BST. 16th over: Pakistan 35-4 (Azhar 7, Fawad 2) Broad persuades Fawad to edge, but the ball drops short of Sibley Dom Dom at three. The cordon is stood pretty close, though, so recriminations are disappointingly absent and a single apiece follows. “Sir Jimmy seems to favour the same shade (Oilslick Tortoiseshell) as Sir Paul McCartney,” says James Debens, “who spends a pretty penny getting his coiffure colorised on the Sussex coast. It’s the most popular hair dye after Bono’s Blue-Black Quink edition.” Quink, now that takes me back – most specifically to the ploy of puncturing that little rubber bag inside Parker pens, or the plastic cartridges, with a compass, so that they leaked inside the owner’s pencil case. What larks, dear old Pip, dear old chap, 15th over: Pakistan 33-4 (Azhar 6, Fawad 1) A quiet over, just one run from it, to Fawad, knocked towards cover. At first glance, his stance looks perfect for an outswinger, but by the time he actually plays the ball he’s in a fairly normal position. No, Stuart, it did not straighten, and was missing the wickets. 14th over: Pakistan 32-4 (Azhar 6, Fawad 0) Broad takes the ball looking to hold down an end, so that Jimmy can get his all 10. Azhar gets one to backward square, then Fawad nurdles his first Test run since 1890 ... no he doesn’t, it’s a leg bye. Broad hurtles in again, and THERE IT IS! THE CELEBRAPPEAL! OH YES, THAT IS VINTAGE! Not out says the umpire, but Broad prevails on Root to review. “I would love Anderson to reach 626, which is my favourite Mazda model,” says James Debens. “I can’t fit in the MX-5, and the 3 couldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding. The Mazda 626 rides well and when she picks up her skirts, she really can shift. She was known as the Capella in Japan; this means ‘she-goat’ in Latin.” I don’t think I’ve ever understood fewer words of an email. 13th over: Pakistan 30-4 (Azhar 5, Fawad 0) Fawad sees away the final ball of Anderson’s over. The players are back out, but I’d not be surprised if there was another break prior to lunch. “Good luck to Jimmy for his 600,” says Chris Eastside, “but has he been having a dab of the old Grecian 2000?” A nice bit of fringe misdirection, if so. “Forgive me if it’s been asked before,” tweets Allan MacDonald, “but has COVID killed reverse swing for the time being as players aren’t allowed to put saliva or sweat on the ball?” I don’t think we were seeing much reverse even before that. I’m hoping that with Tests back in Pakistan, we’ll see a bit more of it, and I’m also hoping it’s something Archer can get good it. But in England, we need a bit of help from the weather and the pitches too. I mean, who wants or needs any of this nonsense? Aside from smashing a glass, at the age of 22, I was cold-calling heads of huge multinationals to convince them that what they really wanted to do was invest loads of their money in the state of Iowa. “Morning Daniel,” begins Tom Levesley. “Aged 22 I was putting stickers on the soles of trainers for two pounds an hour in a West Midlands warehouse. Hope Zak’s reading and realises how he’s wasting his youth. I’d have trousered 20 quid in the time it took him to knock a bit of leather around.” State of poor Creepz, absolute fiasco of a man. “I wonder if Jimmy is taking advice from number gurus on marketing his brand,” emails Kim Thonger. “If he stopped at 600 there is linkage with the charge of the light brigade. Could be a splendid logo. 633 is apparently an angel number, whatever that might be, although my age group associate it with the 633 Squadron. 666 would be noticeable but perhaps a bit devilish for his taste. Personally I think he’s capable of getting to 700 if he stays fit.” It’s impossible to have the remotest clue what he’s got in store for us. I enjoy that his number is 613, the same as the number of commandments in the Torah, and I’d enjoy him finishing on that, but for how much I’d enjoy him finishing on 614 and everything after. Provided there’s nee more rain. They’re coming back on, they’re coming back off. “An on/off day,” says Nasser, who notes that it takes a while to get the covers on and off at Southampton. We can go to 7pm though, and it’ll take a lot more than what’s forecast to force a draw. “So pleased for Buttles and Zcrawley,” says Sarah O’Regan. Me too. They’ve earned this – it’s not happened by accident. This won’t be a long stoppage, I don’t think. “Just the 597 Test wickets for me, last night, then.” This is so standard it’s a joke. Anderson runs in, bowls full, and Asad can’t help but follow it, guiding the ball into the warm, grateful embrace of Joe Root at one. Pakistan are struggling here. 13th over: Pakistan 29-3 (Azhar 5, Asad 5) Another decent Anderson over, two singles from its first four balls.... “Morning Daniel,” emails Peter Haining, linking to today’s TMS. Have a lovely OBO.” You guys. 12th over: Pakistan 28-3 (Azhar 4, Asad 4) It’s Broad from the other end; has any cricketer ever responded as well to a dropping as he? He’s got four slips, and after three dots, Asad slces him to backward point; Warne wants him up as a catcher, of course he does. Asad then drives nicely to cover, they run three, and the groundstaff run down because there’s drizzle in the air, Snoop Dogg’s favourite kind of rain (though he also enjoys mizzle). 11th over: Pakistan 24-3 (Azhar 4, Asad 1) Anderson is on the money right away, squaring Asad, who squirts a half-batter away on the off side and gets off the mark. Anderson will finish his over from last night... Here come the players. I’m really looking forward to watching Jofra Archer this morning. It seems like England have decided that they want him to bowl fast, in short spells, which is exciting, but a word of caution: sometimes, his best stuff comes when he’s deep into a spell. That might change, but the ability to do a Mitch might be contingent on ... being Mitch, a rhythm bowler in the form of your life and maybe the form of every life. James Anderson has 596 Test wickets from 156 Test matches. You’ve got to laugh. But even if he’s not, I’m really, really pleased England gave him the time they did. He’s far too special to be discarded early – much better too late. The thing with him is that he’s not a slogger who has no discipline, which is why it always seemed like a mental thing: how to assimilate the best bits of his attack with the best bits of his defence. Jos Buttler is with Nasser, noting the tiny margin of error Crawley allowed Pakistan’s bowlers. And explaining that he now gets his triggers in early, so he’s in position to play, and talking about how much lockdown helped in giving him a rest and time to work on things. I really, really hope he’s there now – imagine if he is. “It’s such a good feeling to know you can play at that level,” says Andrew Strauss of Crawley’s knock, a sentiment with which I’m sure we can all agree. It was certainly one of highlights of my Test-match career. On which point, in such circumstance, do England enforce? Generally, teams don’t, but if they knock Pakistan over quickly, I’d be surprised if they didn’t. It looks to me like the tactic is to bat once. It looks decent for swing bowling out there. The pitch should still be flat, but most of Pakistan’s best batsmen are gone. If Azhar doesn’t make runs, it’s hard to see them getting anywhere near the follow-on target. For more of the same, check this on the theatre of Shane Warne. I’ve just read that Jacques Kallis has been inducted into the ICC Hall of Fame. I can’t remember if I knew that such thing even existed, but is he the most underrated great of the game, or the great of the game people like to say is most underrated? Please forgive the namedrop, but I think this tidbit is worth it: Kevin Pietersen once told me that in an England team meeting, going through their plans for the South African batsmen, they came to him and the best they could do was “run out candidate early in his innings”. Anyway, I hear James Anderson is finished in Test cricket. It’s been a good run. What were you doing at 22? Me, I was on a completely normal one, getting married as you do. “Oh my days!” I remember where I was the first time I heard that glorious phrase – Roe Green Summer Scheme, 1987 – and remember wondering at what age one could deploy it with legitimacy. Like the speaker, I was eight years-old then, which makes me 41 years-old now, so reckon I’m good to go. As such, oh – my – days. The purpose of a preamble is to set up what’s to come, but in this case that’s already been determined by what’s already been. Zak Crawley’s innings didn’t just end on a big number, though it did, and didn’t just come against a magnificent attack, though it did. Rather, it evidenced the craft, commitment and temperament of a talent maturing into a player before our eyes. Strauss, Greig, Stewart, Sutcliffe, Smith, Vaughan, Atherton, Cowdery, D’Oliveria and SJ Broad are but some of the legendary batsmen who never made a Test double century, and of the 695 people to play for England – Crawley being the most recent – only nine have made more in a single innings than his 267. Not bad for 22 (but for how many consecutive meals can he eat ketchup sandwiches? Well then.) Consequently, Pakistan are right under the pump, ravaged last evening by England’s double-pronged attack of JM Anderson and SB Pressure. And it’s hard to see things improving much over the next bit. Just 15 days ago, they were poised to go 1-0 up in the series, yet at some point in the immediate future, they’ll lose it 2-0. But when we think back in another 33 years time, we won’t dwell on any of that, we’ll relive the achievement of Crawley – and Buttler, and Woakes – that still make us exclaim “Oh my absolute days!” Or, put another way, Test cricket is alright.

          "bodyText": "Alex Hern was correct (Ofqual’s A-level algorithm: why did it fail to make the grade?, 21 August) to point out that the “algorithm” is actually an equation. This is not just a nerdish distinction. A statistical model, which should be the basis of this type of algorithm, would estimate the likelihood that a particular factor would influence the accuracy of predicted grades and the strength of impact when it does. The method employed by Ofqual provides neither piece of information. However, even well-designed statistical models would not necessarily produce a fair result, because the various correlations would not be 100%. In statistics, therefore, all predictions come with a health warning, called the error term. Knowing the reliability of a model would be scarce consolation to any student victim of its degree of unreliability, regardless of how small this level might be. Emeritus Professor Graham Hall Bury, Greater Manchester • For several years I was an admissions tutor at a middle-ranking university. We needed to improve our first-year pass rate so, based on five years of first-year entrants, I created a predictive model using data scraped off Ucas forms and actual results obtained to predict whether students would pass our first year. Doing this involved what the press have quaintly termed “an algorithm” – in fact, I used a mixture of statistical methods, mathematics and machine-learning (AI) techniques. The model was not of course used to make admissions decisions, but was used to inform admissions strategy. Purely for interest, I then adapted my “algorithm” to make predictions on A-level results. I found that I could not achieve an accuracy of greater than about 75% to within one grade. Even by changing my “algorithm”, using predictive models with a different mathematical basis, I could not improve the accuracy. My conclusion was that there was something missing from the data itself – it lacked the predictive power. Something that might be called the human factor – students who put in an extraordinary effort, students with changing circumstances etc. Something that could possibly have been filled in by teachers. What I find staggering about this whole fiasco is why this “algorithm” wasn’t tested against last year’s results – or if it was, why such an appalling level of accuracy was accepted. Dr Peter WH Smith Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire • It comes as no surprise to me that the algorithm hasn’t worked. Back in 2001, colleagues and I showed that schools’ A-level performances from one year to the next were pretty unstable when intake characteristics were taken into account. In short, using one year’s results to predict the next would be an inherently risky business. We titled our analysis Predicting the Future. We thought it sufficiently important to send to several exam boards and government players at the time. What we didn’t predict was that 20 years later it would have been entirely forgotten! Prof John Gray Faculty of education, University of Cambridge • There is often much to learn from obituaries, and I was impressed by that of the French philosopher Bernard Stiegler (18 August), whose work highlights the negative impact on society of the use of algorithms and automated systems, particularly damaging to the lives of young people. The exams debacle suggests it should be required reading. John Bailey St Albans, Hertfordshire • Alex Hern’s article about Ofqual’s A-level algorithm reminds me of another equation. It has taken me most of my adult life to devise it: ME = NT3. This equation can be translated as “my experience is [that one should] never trust the Tories”.

          "bodyText": "The row over A-level and GCSE results has intensified after the chair of the exams regulator in England accused the Royal Statistical Society (RSS) of making comments that led to “widespread misunderstanding and suspicion” about Ofqual’s work. Ofqual has been under scrutiny for its role in the debacle, which left pupils devastated and university admissions in chaos. In the increasingly acrimonious aftermath, Roger Taylor, the chair of Ofqual, called on the RSS to set the record straight after it raised concerns about the now discredited algorithm and offered help. In a letter that will be seen as part of Ofqual’s fightback as the postmortem into the results mayhem gets under way, Taylor takes issue with comments made by the RSS to the press and the statistics watchdog, the Office for Statistics Regulation (OSR), about Ofqual’s approach to moderating teacher-assessed exam grades. According to a Sky report the RSS offered to help the regulator with the algorithm in April, suggesting the expert services of two fellows, Guy Nason, professor of statistics at Imperial College London, and Paula Williamson, professor of medical statistics at the University of Liverpool. The arrangement foundered, however, after the RSS objected to the proposed confidentiality agreement the experts would be required to sign, on the grounds that it would have prevented them from commenting on the final model of the algorithm for years to come. The RSS wrote to the OSR: “The proposed confidentiality agreement [from Ofqual] would, on our reading, have precluded these Fellows (who were suggested precisely because of their relevant statistical expertise, and lack of ties to qualification regulators or exam-awarding bodies) from commenting in any way on the final choice of the model for some years after this year’s results were released. “We set out our concerns about the terms of the proposed non-disclosure agreement (NDA), and restated our willingness to help if a more suitable agreement could be reached. In the end, we did not get an official response to those questions, and our offer to help was not taken up.” Taylor denied that the confidentiality agreement would preclude anyone from commenting on the model and said Ofqual had responded. “It only precludes the disclosure of confidential information shared within the group. This approach is a normal and entirely ethical mechanism to ensure people can speak freely in the discussions and can see analyses of confidential data without fear of information being made public during the deliberative process.” Taylor continued: “Your letter and comments to the press have led to widespread misunderstanding and suspicion of Ofqual’s process. I would ask that you take all measures you can to correct this impression.” Ofqual also published a copy of the NDA. “This is important not least because the suggestion in your letter calls into question the reputations of all those who did take part in the advisory group and who, I am sure, would not have signed up to the restrictions you have incorrectly alleged.” Taylor said Ofqual was also exploring how to make the entire data set available through the ONS secure research service to enable others to look at how different approaches to moderation would have worked. The Guardian was unable to contact the RSS for comment. Following the scrapping of the controversial algorithm at the 11th hour, Taylor threatened to quit unless the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, publicly backed the exams regulator and admitted it was behind the U-turn that salvaged millions of student grades, the Guardian was told. Taylor’s ultimatum came after the education secretary tried to lay the blame for the exams fiasco at the door of Ofqual following a humiliating climbdown that scrapped A-levels and GCSEs awarded by algorithm and instead awarded pupils their school-assessed grades."

          "headline": "Gavin Williamson defends trip to Scarborough a week before A-levels fiasco",
          "bodyText": "The beleaguered education secretary has defended taking a trip to Scarborough the week before the A-levels fiasco in England that left pupils devastated and threw university admissions into disarray. Gavin Williamson, who is facing mounting pressure to resign over his handling of the exams debacle and failed attempts to get children back to school before the summer holidays, said he remained in “constant communication” with his department throughout his visit. He also shared on social media that he had cancelled his family holiday abroad in order to be able to focus on the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic on schools and education. The trip to the North Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough, reported to have taken place the week beginning 3 August as Scottish results were published to widespread uproar among disappointed pupils, was to visit members of his family that he had not seen since lockdown began. According to the Sunday Times, Williamson cancelled what it described as “a crucial meeting” with school leaders to discuss the return of children to school in September, but took part in Zoom calls with Boris Johnson and other ministers while he was away. In a post on Twitter on Sunday morning, Williamson said: “I cancelled our family holiday abroad this year to focus on the challenges Covid-19 created for the education sector.” He added: “Over the summer, I went to see family in Scarborough for the first time since lockdown, and while there I was in constant communication with the department.” A few responses were supportive, saying Williamson and other government colleagues who have been pictured on their holidays – including the prime minister, who was photographed in Scotland, – should not have to justify taking a break. Others were scathing and called on him to resign. Williamson, who has been nicknamed the “useful idiot” by some union leaders, is said to have lost the trust of his officials to such an extent that he can no longer serve effectively in the cabinet. Sir Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the powerful Commons liaison committee, told the Observer that after Williamson’s humiliating U-turn over A-level and GCSE results, the secretary of state made a bad situation worse and caused a “complete breakdown” of trust in his department by seeking to blame officials for the crisis. The Guardian revealed that the chair of Ofqual threatened to quit unless Williamson publicly backed the exams regulator and admitted it was behind the U-turn that salvaged millions of student grades. Roger Taylor’s ultimatum came after the education secretary tried to lay the blame for the exams fiasco at the door of Ofqual after a humiliating climbdown that scrapped A-levels and GCSEs awarded by algorithm, and reverted to school-assessed grades instead. Another of the most senior and influential Conservatives on the backbenches said he would be amazed if Williamson survived for long, and that his reputation in the education world had been irreparably damaged. Williamson’s fate is expected to be discussed by the executive of the backbench 1922 Committee of Tory MPs when parliament returns from the summer break on 1 September. His cabinet future depends on the success of the full reopening of schools to all children from the beginning of September. The prime minister said the reopening of schools was a national priority. He has been supported by the chief and deputy chief medical officers from across the UK, who said this weekend that while there were no risk-free options, further time out of the classroom would increase inequalities and reduce the life chances of children, and could exacerbate physical and mental health issues. Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, said plans to get all children back to school in early September were at serious risk because of government incompetence and the chaos caused by the exams fiasco. Starmer said that two crucial weeks, which should have been spent preparing for schools to reopen, have been wasted dealing with a self-inflicted “mess” that has destroyed public confidence in government."

          "bodyText": "Unemployment is rising. The national debt has topped £2tn for the first time. The economy contracted by 25% in just two months. So why then is Rishi Sunak the cabinet’s golden boy? Well, for a start, everything’s relative. The chancellor has clearly had a tough first six months in the job, but has given the impression of competence and consistency when both have been in short supply. You don’t need an algorithm to work out which ministers would have failed their exams or to know that Sunak is not one of them. The chancellor has the perfect riposte to anybody unhappy about the current state of the economy: not my fault. That’s a cast-iron defence, because it wasn’t the chancellor who decided the country should be locked down in late March and that sacrificing the economy was the only way to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed by Covid-19. The third thing going for Sunak is that the economy’s recovery from the lockdown has been going as well as he could have dared hope. After months of being cooped up at home with little to spend their wages on, consumers have returned to the shops. Retail sales are now higher than they were before the crisis. The strength of high street and online spending runs counter to surveys showing consumer confidence at a low ebb, but the polls also suggest that members of the public are more relaxed about their own personal finances than they are about the wider economy. Certainly, there has been no shortage of people eager to take advantage of Sunak’s eat out to help out scheme, with 35m discounted meals in its first two weeks in operation. Restaurant meals are not included in retail sales, but it is likely that the increased high street footfall the scheme generated is boosting spending in the shops as well. Most analysts had expected the recovery would have petered out by now following a sugar rush as restrictions were lifted in May, June and July. The latest snapshot of the economy from Markit/Cips suggests this is not the case, with a sharp increase in activity reported by both the manufacturing and services sectors in August. This was in contrast to a similar survey for the eurozone, which fell back. No question, the chancellor would have settled for the current state of the economy during the most severe part of the lockdown. The recession was not quite as bad as feared and the recovery has been stronger. There was even a silver lining to the public finance figures showing that UK national debt exceeded national income for the first time since 1961: the deficit for July was lower than the financial markets had predicted, while the shortfall in June was revised down. All of which, if anything, makes life trickier for the chancellor as he weighs up his options for his autumn budget. If the recent economic news had been unremittingly bad it would be a no-brainer for him to announce a package of tax cuts and spending increases to stimulate activity. The fact that there have been signs of life returning to normal complicates matters. That’s because Sunak is uncomfortable about how much the state is borrowing, as he made clear last week in his response to the release of the latest figures for the public finances. “Today’s figures are a stark reminder that we must return our public finances to a sustainable footing over time, which will require taking difficult decisions,” he said. This doesn’t mean Sunak is going to announce tax increases or launch a new era of austerity in a few months’ time. Such measures may eventually come, but not this year. What the stronger-than-expected performance of the economy could do, however, is sway the chancellor against further meaningful stimulus in the budget. That would be a mistake because, while there are risks in over-stimulating the economy, they are substantially less than the risks of not doing enough to support activity and jobs. The UK might continue to recover smartly in the coming months so that by the end of the year national output is back where it was before the crisis. It is not, though, the likeliest outcome as Sunak knows full well. Nothing much should be read into the surveys showing that the UK did better in August than mainland Europe. Britain went into lockdown later, lifted restrictions later and is probably going to slow down later as well. The ingredients for a period of weaker activity are there in plain sight. The Treasury’s wage subsidy scheme – the principle reason why people have money in their pockets despite not working in the spring and early summer – is being wound down. Mortgage holidays are coming to an end, which will cut into discretionary spending. Renters in England and Wales facing eviction have been given a reprieve – but only for the next month. Meanwhile, the small print of last week’s impressive-looking Markit/Cips survey showed that businesses intend to shed jobs at a more rapid rate in the months ahead as pent-up demand is satisfied and the backlog of orders left unfilled during the lockdown is cleared. Then, of course, there’s the threat of restrictions being reimposed. While the government, rightly, has ruled out another national lockdown, localised action in Covid-19 hotspots will be a direct drag on activity in the areas targeted and may affect behaviour elsewhere. So, yes, the economy is currently on course for a record-breaking third quarter in which it may have expanded by more than 15%. The question for Sunak is whether recovery will be sustained. Left to its own devices, the chances are it won’t be."

          "bodyText": "What children know and too many politicians seem not to: a few years ago, the psychologists Alex Shaw and Kristina Olson ran an experiment in which they told young children about two boys, Dan and Mark, who had cleaned up their room and were to be rewarded with rubbers (why rubbers should be seen as a reward I don’t know). However, there were five rubbers, so they could not be divided equally between the two boys. What should they do? The vast majority of children thought that one eraser should be thrown away, so there could be an even split between Dan and Mark. However, when the children heard that “Dan did more work than Mark”, they were quite comfortable giving three to Dan and two to Mark. The children, in other words, had a deep commitment to fairness – anyone who has children will know that their favourite cry is “but that’s not fair!” – but they also recognised that the meaning of fairness could change depending on context. If Dan worked harder than Mark, it was only fair that he received more of the goodies, rather than fairness always requiring an equal division of the rewards. The issue of fairness is a key concern, of course, not just for children but for politics too. Unlike the children, though, many politicians seem not to recognise that the meaning of fairness depends on context, that there are different ways of being fair and that we have to choose between them, depending on our broader political aims. Consider the examination results fiasco. The original set of results, created by an algorithm designed by the exam authorities in the four nations, was manifestly unfair, penalising exceptional pupils in historically disadvantaged schools while giving a statistical leg-up to poorly performing students in high-achieving ones. Outrage over the unfairness has led to the abandonment of the algorithmic scores and their replacement with unmoderated teacher assessments. But this, too, is unfair. Not only do teachers’ assessments tend to be overgenerous when compared with actual exam results but, left unmoderated, they penalise those pupils whose teachers were stricter in their assessments. Then there is the question of grade inflation. The fact that this year’s grades are so much better than those of previous years may be unfair to both past and future students who must compete with them. All the methods, in other words, are fair from certain perspectives and unfair from others. The question that the exam authorities and the politicians needed to answer was not: “How do we create a fair assessment system to replace the exams?” but: “What kind of fairness do we want and what kinds of unfairness are we willing to tolerate?” Fairness is not a thing in itself but defined by one’s wider political vision. A utilitarian, committed to the notion of the greatest good for the greatest number of people, has a different understanding of fairness from an Aristotelian who believes, in the words of Aristotle’s Politics, that “persons who are equal should have assigned to them equal things”. Fairness to a free-market libertarian, for whom the market is best placed to equitably distribute goods, is different from fairness to a socialist, whose starting point is social need. Politicians and policymakers have, however, increasingly embraced a technocratic view of fairness, adopting the pretence that science or statistics can objectively define what it is to be fair. The problem with this approach, as the Royal Statistical Society observed, is that an algorithm “is not simply a technically obvious and neutral procedure” but “embeds a range of judgments and choices”. The results of an algorithm depend on what it is asked to do and what data it is fed. In the schools fiasco, the exam authorities, such as Ofqual in England and the Scottish Qualifications Authority, were apparently told that the primary concern was to prevent grade inflation. Once politicians had made that choice, then blaming the algorithm for producing the wrong political answer is little more than refusing to accept responsibility for one’s judgment. Algorithms are, as the writer and broadcaster Timandra Harkness puts it, “prejudice engines”. The data with which they are fed is inevitably tainted by the prejudices and biases of the human world. Unchecked, that feeds into the results they produce. And where algorithms make predictions, those prejudices and biases are projected into the future. The reason the exam algorithms penalised pupils from disadvantaged schools is that this is the algorithm built into real life. The education system has long served to thwart the ambitions of working-class pupils and to ease the path of the more privileged ones. The results debacle is but a sharper expression of what usually happens year after year. It’s not just with algorithms that we see the problem of political judgments being passed off as objective decisions. Throughout the summer, ministers have justified their pandemic policies by claiming that “we’re following the science”. Scientific data and modelling can help us understand the consequences of different political decisions but they cannot tell us which decision is socially or morally preferable. Is it better to prevent grade inflation or to reward students who have done better than historically expected? Do the benefits of opening schools outweigh the risks of further spreading coronavirus? These are not just empirical questions but require political judgment too. “People in this country have had enough of experts,” claimed Michael Gove during the Brexit referendum campaign. No government would seem to be more in tune with that sentiment than Boris Johnson’s administration. Yet his is also a government that shirks responsibility for its own decisions by pretending that political questions are really technical ones to be settled by experts. Perhaps what Gove meant was: “We’ve had enough of experts except when they can provide us with an alibi for political misjudgments.” • Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist"
